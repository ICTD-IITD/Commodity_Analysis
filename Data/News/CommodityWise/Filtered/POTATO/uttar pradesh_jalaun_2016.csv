For the 70% of population of Uttar Pradesh living in villages, Rs 300 crore of the total budget outlay has been earmarked to create smart villages. Rs 7,000 crore will be spent for special state feeder to enhance power supply to villages and facilitate better irrigation and mechanised farming. In the absence of power, purchase of diesel to run generators is dealing the already impoverished farmers a financial blow.There is focus on bringing relief to beleaguered farmers driven to starvation, debt and suicide with Rs 897 crore Samajwadi Kisan and Sarvahit Beema Yojana, Rs 240 crore for Krishak Durghatana Beema Yojana, Rs 709 for state disaster funds and Rs 2,057 for the drought affected farmers in 50 districts.To make farming at least productive if not profitable, the budget has emphasised on organic farming and mechanisation of farm sector by offering machines to cultivators on loan through clusters, apart from building kisan haats, bazaars and mandis and subsidies on machines, tools and seeds and fertilizers. ""Though direct benefit schemes of transferring subsidy into the bank accounts, more than 10 lakh farmers have benefited in the state like in no other state of the nation,"" said chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in his budget speech in the House on Friday.Unemployed youth have been offered support to start 'agri junctions', though this scheme was announced in the last budget and failed to take off. Exclusive market for potato in Kannauj and mango in Malihabad to the tune of Rs 102 crore and Rs 79 crore, respectively will be there to save cultivators from the market glut. In the absence of any such market, potato and mango growers feel depressed when market is hit in the peak season.Priority has been given to availability of potable water with an allocation of Rs 2,300 crore, while Rs 1,779 crore has been allocated for houses for homeless under the Lohia Gramin Avas programme, Rs 3,162 crore for Indira Avas and Rs 2,031 crore for village roads. Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for interlocking tiles and CC roads in towns and villages through the panchayati raj department and Rs 1,536 crore for clean toilets in the rural areas.Irrigation will get a leg-up with Rs 1,574 crore to new schemes, including Rs 100 crore for Arjun Sahayak canal and Saryu canal national projects to support the revival of dams and canals which had been lying closed or incomplete for over 30 years and provide water for drinking as well as irrigation in drought-prone areas."

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress. The government must act to give relief to farmers affected by crop damage, Gandhi said in the Lok Sabha.(With inputs from Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Meerut)"

A resident of Jattari in Aligarh, Prasad found that his mustard crop, spread over six bighas, was completely destroyed due to heavy rain and hailstones over the weekend. According to his son Rajveer, Prasad died on Monday evening after complaining of chest pain.He suffered a huge blow after seeing that the mustard crop had been almost completely destroyed, Rajveer told The Hindu. Prasad was not the only casualty of the untimely rain and hailstones. Two more farmers reportedly died in Agra due to the distress caused by destruction of crops. About 30-40 per cent of the crops have been destroyed by the sudden change in weatherOfficials told The Hindu that farmers were badly affected by the large-scale damage to crops. In Aligarh district, wheat, potato and other rabi crops were badly affected. There is no district in western Uttar Pradesh which has not seen crop damage.Though the agriculture department has begun surveying the losses incurred, unofficial estimates put the figure at 25-30 per cent.From the information we collected from the ground, production of wheat in Meerut division may go down by 15 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of crop damage in Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Agra and Aligarh division is about 20-25 per cent. The crop damage may go up further if it rains in the next few days, said Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch.Mr. Jaula said the problem was multi-fold for farmers. First of all, a large number of farmers have not enrolled for the crop insurance scheme. The other problem is that a farmer will get insurance benefit only if the crop damage is at least 33 per cent, which complicates the situation especially for small farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for survival, added Mr. Jaula."

Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait. The aspirati-ons of a billion people also cant.(The writer is a technocrat and a small-scale entrepreneur based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh)"

As compared to the price of Rs5-6 per kg in 2015, local farmers are currently fetching Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets, thanks to lower production in other states.Top potato growing states -Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal -have seen production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. Although the yield in Gujarat, too, has dipped by 10% this year, unlike other major states Gujarat has registered an increase in potato production on account of higher acreage. In fact, the potato output has galloped substantially over the last two years.The potato production in an area of one lakh hectare was around 35 lakh tonnes as against 31 lakh tonnes of 2015 and 23 lakh tonnes in 2014.Agriculture minister, Babubhai Bokhiriya, said, ""There is low potato production in the country, barring Gujarat, and hence the farmers are getting good prices. The other reason being that the state has, in the last one year, increased its cold storage capacity, which has led to better storage facilities, and hence the farmers expecting a higher price later are storing their produce, rather than selling on spot,"" he said.""Last year, there was a glut in the market. The supply is higher this year, but the excess output has been absorbed by increase in storage capacity providing a much needed cushion to the farmers. The prices would have fallen this year, too, had there been a rise in potato production across the country,"" said Ashish Guru, president, Gujarat Cold Storage Association.The cold storage capacity in Gujarat saw addition of approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50 kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes, while the annual consumption of potato in the state is 20 lakh tonnes. The lower output in other states kept the prices of vegetable firm, and farmers in Gujarat are able to reap the benefits due to availability of cold storages. ""The wholesale prices had plummeted to Rs 5-6 per kg in Gujarat last year due to glut in the market. However, the prices have remained at Rs 10-13 per kg in 2016 much to the relief of farmers,"" Guru added.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Gujarat potatoes are supplied to Maharashtra and states in south India, and are exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

The agreement is aimed at bridging the current demand and supply gap.""This is a unique initiative as the company would set up a tissue culture laboratory at Deras near Khurda. The laboratory will produce over one lakh metric tonne of potato seeds, which will cater to the demand of Odisha and other eastern states, by 2020-21,"" said horticulture director Susant Nanda.The company would also set up a seed multiplication centre on 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput. ""The firmwill establish the required infrastructure. The government is not required to invest anything,"" Nanda added.The state requires around one lakh metric tonne of potato seeds a year. At present, these are being produced in limited quantity. To meet the demand, large quantities of potato seeds are being procured from Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.""Though National Seed Corporation sends us seeds, they are not suitable for Odisha's weather conditions and a large amount of these are damaged during transportation,"" an officer in horticulture directorate said.In 2014, the government had signed similar agreements with National Seed Corporation, International Potato Centre and Lima in Peru. Besides, Potato Mission was launched last year to tackle the crisis, but nothing much has changed on the ground."

Telegraph pictureBhubaneswar, April 20: Faced with potato scarcity, the government today signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Utkal Tubers India Private Limited to augment potato seed production.The state has been facing potato scarcity every year as its domestic production does not meet its demand. At present, the state produces two lakh metric tonnes of potato as against the requirement of 11 lakh metric tonnes. Hence, the state is dependent on other states, especially Bengal, to meet its potato requirements.The state had faced a severe potato shortage when Bengal government restricted its supply to Odisha and other states this year and previous year. At that time, potato was selling at Rs 60 per kg in retail market.The state government has now set a target to increase potato production from the existing level of two lakh metric tonnes to 11.25 lakh metric tonnes by 2017-18.On December 27, 2014, the state government launched a Potato Mission for planning ahead to avoid tuber shortage in the state. The mission has initiated several measures to make the state self-reliant in potato production.The task force set up by the state government has estimated that the state will require 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds by 2017-18.However, there has been a big gap between the demand and supply as the domestic production is very low. So, the state government has to procure seeds from states, such as Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.According to plans, 1.10 lakh metric tonnes of potato seeds will be produced in the state by 2020-21. The potato producers will get the seeds at reasonable rate, said the officials of the state horticulture directorate."

Bengaluru-born Mukundan and his four co-founders were exploring the Internet of Things space, the idea of connecting ordinary objects to send and receive data. They considered telemedicine, but decided against it since many MNCs were in the business.That's when one of the founders pointed to the problems in dairy management, inclcuding that milk stored in regular containers become non-consumable after a few hours. His uncle was an organic dairy farmer in Tiptur, a town 150km north west of Bengaluru, and had trouble managing his cattle and the supply chain. They liked the idea so Mukundan, now 41, and the team spent the next eight months at the dairy farm and also visited farms in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. Their company, Stellapps, used their learnings to develop automated dairy solutions, and now works with milk cooperative societies such as Aavin, Milma and Tirumala. Its products are in 250 farms and are used by three lakh dairy farmers.Agriculture in India is a $370 billion sector, but there is little application of technology to improve productivity and lift millions out of poverty . Now, a clutch of entrepreneurs is looking out of their city offices to the countryside to change this.Bengaluru-based Flybird Agri Innovations places sensors in the soil to detect moisture content and control irrigation. It's installed sensors in 45 villages in Karnataka to help farmers in the drought-hit state optimize irrigation. The company is supported by Chennai-based Villgro, a social impact fund backed by Dell Foundation.Most companies faced resistance when they first set up their equipment. ""Our work exposed the malpractices of middlemen,"" says Mukundan, who is now recruiting sales people in Delhi and Gujarat.The company is looking to expand to allied sectors such as fisheries where perishabil ity is high. Despite the need for technological intervention, there's not much funding coming to startups in this sector.Funding for Indian agriculture startups declined to $56 million in 2015 from $123 million the year before, according to data from Tracxn, a startup activity tracking platform. In 2015, also a drought year, just 20 agriculture-related startups raised money , but $6 billion was invested overall in tech startups that year. Agriculture startups attracted less than 1% of the total.""The agri funds in the country are mostly early stage investors, and the startups struggle to raise subsequent rounds of funding, thus prolonging their scale up,"" says Hemendra Mathur, an investor in agri businesses and former managing director of SEAF India Investment Advisory .While overall inflation has been under control, food inflation is growing at 7%, indicating a mismatch of supply and demand. India imported corn after 16 years, and it has turned from an exporter to an importer of soya. ""The inflation translates into an additional `70,000 crore opportunity.The propensity for consumption is also going up. Droughts are an opportunity to develop various seeds and processes that help reduce water consumption without affecting productivity ,"" says Mathur.Investors tend to view agriculture as a risky proposition. ""Most investors don't understand agriculture. The strong gov ernment intervention in the sector along with the vagaries of nature accentuate the business risks associated with startups in the space,"" says Srikrishna Ramamoorthy , partner at Unitus Seed Fund, an India-focussed fund supported by Gates Foundation that invests in social impact enterprises. It has invested in agri startup Villfarm and is looking for more opportunities. Ramamoorthy says most small farmers are not willing to try technology , and even the large farmers find the equipment too expensive.""Very often, it is not whether the technology is available. The problem is whether there are India-specific solutions,"" says Mark Kahn, founding partner of Omnivore Partners, an agriculture technology focused fund. It is backed by diversified agri-business firm Godrej Agrovet, SIDBI and SBI among other financial institutions. It has invested in Stellapps and Ecozen, a micro cold storage facility that works on solar power and can be installed even in small farms.In a country where more than half of the population still survives on agriculture, fruit and vegetables worth $2 billion are wasted because of lack of supply chain management and cold storage facilities.""The big cold storage products of the west are not affordable for many Indians,"" says Kahn. He has investments in 11 agriculture startups, including Skymet, which analyses weather patterns and predicts risk in agriculture for every season.Kahn was earlier head of business strategy and mergers and acquisitions at Godrej Agrovet and found that most agritechnology startups struggle to raise funding. He convinced Godrej to anchor a fund to support more firms and thus Omnivores was founded in 2011 with a corpus of Rs 260 crore.The same year also saw the establishment of the SONG Fund by Thomas Hyland, a US citizen who came to India and travelled around the country in trains for a year. He then went on to do a management degree from ISB, Hyderabad, and established Song, backed by US billionaire George Soros, Omidyar Network and Google Capital. ""For a country of India's size, there are not enough startups that focus on technologies that addresses the lower middle class and bottom-of-pyramid solutions,"" says Hyland, who has since started a second fund Aspada.These funds work with the startups for several months before committing to investments. Hyland, for instance, worked with Pune-based SV Agri for eight months before investing. SV works with potato farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat to improve productivity by providing better seeds, as well as working on supply chain and processing.It supplies potatoes to ITC, Marico and Pepsico for chips. ""Not many big companies or startups want to do backward integration when it comes to agriculture because they don't want to get their hands dirty ,"" says Hemant Gaur, founder of SV Agri.Rohtash Mal, a former CEO of tractor firm Escorts, has established EM3, which provides farm machinery vehicles on demand. ""Only 10% of the country's farmers can afford farm machinery and ours is a pay-per-use model. We wanted to reach 90% of the farmers,"" says Mal, who has 15 centres in MP , Bihar and eastern UP . The price is based on the farmhold area measured using satellites. Each centre sends machinery to a 20km radius and Mal says 95% of his customers come back.""Government policies treat agriculture as a poverty alleviation method rather than a means to enhance productivity and raise incomes, and this keeps entrepreneurs out,"" says Mal.Mathur says that funds like Omnivore, Villgro and Aspada give him hope, and entrepreneurs are trying to start agri businesses. ""The slowdown in e-commerce and the entrepreneurial energy will spur a new wave in rural and agricultural innovation,"" he says."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Onion prices may have fallen drastically in Ranchi, but potato is now acting pricey. The staple, which used to cost around Rs 10-12 a kilo till a fortnight ago, is now available between Rs 16 and Rs 20. Wholesale traders said potato prices were high this year due to poor production in different parts of the country and they might escalate further. ""We are selling potatoes to local traders in the range between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,600 per quintal because of poor production of potatoes this year in states such as Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. There is the threat of another spurt in prices,"" S. Lal, a trader in Chaibasa, told The Telegraph. Kesto Mahto, who sells potato, onion, garlic at the local Kokar market near Distillery Bridge, said: ""What can we do when we get the potatoes at higher rates from the wholesale markets? In the summers, potatoes also start rotting soon."" Not surprisingly, Ranchi residents are dismayed with the prices of the essential commodity. ""If the rate goes beyond Rs 20 per kg, we will reduce potato consumption. After all, potatoes are not healthy for diabetic and obese people,"" said Anita Jain, a resident on Lake Road area. No step to check the prices has yet been taken by the Jharkhand Agriculture Marketing Board, as no directives have been issued to the wholesale traders so far regarding price control or stock maintenance. Asked, managing director of the board Rajkumar said he had returned from Bengal recently and needed to find out whether any circular had been issued. This summer is also spelling bad news for vegetable budgets. As the mercury soars, vegetable production falls while marriage season keeps demand on the higher side. Most veggies such as cauliflower, cabbage, pointed gourd (parwal), bottle gourd (lauki) sell for around Rs 20-Rs 30 per kg. Capsicum and coriander leaves cost a whopping Rs 60 per kg. ""These prices won't fall before July,"" said a vegetable dealer."

Patidars, Jats and Gujjars feel that communities that first managed to board the reservation train are uniting to keep them out. State governments would be perfectly happy to include them in the reserved category if they were not worried about the electoral backlash. Other Backward Classes (OBC) classification for Jats brings a similar demand from Rajputs; Scheduled Tribes (ST) classification for Gujjars brings about protests from the powerful Meena community unwilling to share the ST classification. Gujarat seems to have found a novel way to address these demands: be so inclusive that hardly anyone is left to protest. A 10 per cent quota for the economically backward among upper castes that is, those with family incomes of less than Rs.6 lakh per annum (p.a.)  spreads the net so wide that the excluded group is minuscule.Data on incomeSince income data are hard to come by, let us look at three different sources of data to derive estimates of those with incomes above Rs.6 lakh p.a. First, data on income tax filers in 2012-13 show that only 13 per cent of individual returns have incomes higher than Rs.5.5 lakh p.a.; once we take into account people who do not file the returns at all, this forms about 3.5 per cent of total individuals in the country aged 18 and above. Since incomes may be hidden on tax returns, we must look to alternative data. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) collects information on consumption expenditure, not incomes. If we apply household savings rate of about 25 per cent, a Rs.6 lakh income p.a. cut-off would result in a cut-off of about Rs.4.5 lakh consumption. NSSO data (2011-12) show that less than 1 per cent of the population falls in this category. A third source of data is the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) of 2011-12, organised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and University of Maryland. It collects data for both income and expenditure. It shows that less than 2 per cent of the population had household consumption of Rs.4.5 lakh p.a. and about 2.5 per cent had incomes of Rs.6 lakh p.a. in 2011-12. This suggests that whatever statistics we use, a Rs.6 lakh p.a. cut-off will exclude less than 5 per cent of the population from being eligible for reservations if the Gujarat example is followed nationwide.These statistics should calm the passions around this new wrinkle in the battle for reservation in Gujarat. Appeasement tactics used by the Gujarat government are mostly ineffective; they will neither reduce options for middle-income Indians nor will they really expand benefits for the poor among forward castes.Can we devise a narrower band that might really benefit the poor among groups currently ineligible for reservations? Here, our spectacular failure in identifying the poor for issuing Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards gives us reason to be wary. The IHDS survey found that in 2011-12, only 50 per cent of the poor had a BPL card while nearly a third of the non-poor had BPL cards. Almost all observers agree that identifying the poor is a difficult task resulting in errors of both inclusion and exclusion. This is particularly the case when incomes are growing rapidly and a household that is poor in one year may well climb out of poverty the following year. So focussing on just the poor among the general category may be more difficult than we anticipate.Moreover, the demands for expansion of reservation have little to do with the poor among the so-called general category. Most of these demands are emerging from angry young men  many of them with college education  among agriculturalist communities that have historically held considerable political clout (for instance, the Navnirman movement of the 1970s, which the Gujarat government is acutely aware of).Future of reservationIn order to get out of this quagmire, we need to think of the immediate concerns of educated youth and the broader future of reservation in India. What fuels the anger of young men from agricultural communities? As they see it, investing in education has got them only minor monetary benefits. With massive growth in private and distance education programmes of questionable quality, most college graduates today lack the skills for high-paying private sector jobs. They may well be qualified for lower-level clerical or support positions, but for these jobs salaries are far lower in the private sector than the public sector. The ratio of government salary to private sector salary for a college graduate has consistently increased; the IHDS data show that in 2004-05, a college graduate earned 62 paisa in the private sector for each rupee in the public sector; by 2011-12 it had dropped to 57 paisa. With implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission, this difference will grow. Not surprisingly, competition for government jobs is fierce. As Prabhat Mittal, Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, noted, in 2015 nearly 2.3 million applications were received for 368 low-ranking positions in the State government. Is it surprising that frustrated young men try to beat this insane competition by demanding inclusion in the reserved category? If government salaries were more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this strident demand may subside. If current initiatives for increasing employability and creating more manufacturing jobs succeed, this will also reduce the pressure.A longer-term solution, however, requires re-evaluation of the fundamental nature of Indias reservation regime. Affirmative action to make space for communities that have historically been subject to discrimination fits well with the Indian ethos of creating a level playing field and is part of the Indian Constitution. But the patchwork implementation, particularly for the OBC classification that is currently in place, makes little sense and leaves room for powerful lobbies to unite around demands for inclusion.One of the ways of dismantling the quota raj is to ensure that the reserved category certificate is not a currency that is hoarded by groups who no longer need it. This involves periodic recertification into the reserved category. Unfortunately, the current system has an established, if imperfect, procedure for notification of new groups into the reserved category but not for moving groups out of the reserved category. A first step towards establishing such a process may be to ensure that we collect data on caste/tribe affiliation along with data on basic demographic and housing characteristics in the 2021 population census. This would allow us to move past the exclusive reliance on the 1931 census and obtain information on the current socio-economic conditions of all castes and communities in India.Frankly, I have never understood the resistance from the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (ORGI) for collecting caste data in national population census. If the colonial census could do this in 1931, why cant we do it today? Collecting data on thousands of castes is difficult, but it is by no means impossible. Perhaps, the collection of data on caste is a hot potato that the ORGI hopes someone else will handle. But surely national interest demands that this caution be put aside to develop a long-term solution to an issue that has gained such visibility. While we are destined for periodic eruptions of demand for reservations by groups like the Jats, without timely and accurate data we have no way of developing a rational system for responding to these demands.Sonalde Desai is Senior Fellow, NCAER, and Professor of Sociology, University of Maryland. Views are personal.If government salarieswere more on a par with the salaries of the private sector, it is possible that this demand may subside"

(Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi) Former Union HRD minister Kapil Sibal (right) with Chief of Bureau Maneesh Chhibber at The Indian Express office in Delhi. (Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)Why Kapil Sibal?Kapil Sibal held the important portfolios of HRD and Telecom in the UPA government. The changes in education system brought in under him are now being examined by the Smriti Irani-led ministry. He remains one of the leading lights of the Congress and was recently nominated by the party, that is looking for strong voices in Parliament, for a Rajya Sabha ticket. A legal eagle, Sibal has returned to a successful practice and is leading the Gandhi familys defence in the National Herald caseKAPIL SIBAL: My biggest worry for the country is that an aspirational India finds itself in great difficulty. When we talk about our demographic advantage, the young people in this country find the education system not fully aligned to the market. Also, when they get out of the university, they cant get jobs. And remember there are about 12 million people who move out of the university into the job market every year. The maximum job creation was in 2009, with 1.2 million jobs as opposed to the 12 million required, and there has been a constant decline after that. So I wonder what those 12 million will do. Whatever you do in life, if its disengaged, its a perilous journey not just for them individually but for the nation. I think political parties must get together because remember, there is no quick fix to this.It must start from the education system; from the schools. But the education system cannot be tweaked unless you have teachers. Teachers dont come from the air unless you have institutions to teach. Having done that, you move up the school ladder and go to the universities. What is the kind of teaching you must have in your university? What kind of a market interface must you have with the educational system? Where are the jobs being created? Where in future will jobs be created? Then align the education system to that opportunity within the economy, and you will have a purposive India. I dont see that happening; I dont see political parties discussing this.WATCH: Idea Exchange With Kapil SibalI only see angst, a sense of destruction through verbal abuse, allegations without proof, (talk of) a Congress-mukt Bharat, as if that will save this country from the impediments ahead. Thats my greatest worry, and unless you fix this, there is nothing else that will be fixed.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Modi government has completed two years and we all saw what happened at India Gate. So the impression that one got was that we are growing as a nation.I would love the nation to grow; I have no problem with that. I just have a problem with the statistics that he (PM Modi) has churned up. One of the statistics that he gave was of new ration cards  three crore. It is only 66 lakh. Then he said my Jan-Dhan (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana), in the first 100 days, saw 21 crore accounts. The fact is 8.6 crore. He said we have given new LPG cylinders to crores of people, but actually its only 45 lakh. So if the Prime Minister of India, at India Gate, talks of statistics which are incorrect, then how do you trust our leaders?The Central Statistical Organisation is also giving out data which economists are now questioning. So you may tom-tom about yourself but the fact of the matter is what is on the ground, and we all see that.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The aam aadmi seems to be buying these statistics.If dal is Rs 200 (a kilogram), then how is he buying these statistics? His income has not increased. If vegetables are as expensive as they are now, and if one tonne of potato sells for one rupee, then what statistics are we talking about? And whats the feel-good factor on the ground? What worries me is that you may have a wonderful advertising campaign but the fact of the matter is that when the voter thinks about himself, hell ask the question to himself at the right time  Has my life improved?. For the last 17 months, exports have been on the decline; imports are on the decline. So whats on the up? Modi. Nothing else is on the up.MANEESH CHHIBBER: So how does the Congress party plan to expose the government?I think we must take this message to the people. I think the media also needs to investigate this at the same time. When he (PM Modi) gives a statistic for example he said in America that India is a $9 trillion economy, when were just about near 2 trillion. Now the press did not pick it up. So how do we deal with this? They repeat the same statistics. He goes to Kerala and compares us with Somalia. Of course he got some flak for that, but I think every time he makes a statement, for him its an election rally speech You dont act like the Prime Minister of India; you act as if youre an RSS pracharak. You spew venom and you give statistics thinking that its the next election. And then suddenly, one of them goes and has food at a Dalits house when hes not even a Dalit. You should remember Modis tweet on a previous occasion about this.COOMI KAPOOR: Why has the Congress not been able to capitalise on the failures of the Modi government? And the Congresss own position has come down in the last two years. It has lost its stronghold in Kerala, in Bengal, in AssamSince when did a government in Kerala win a second term? Thats the pattern. As far as Assam is concerned, were deeply disappointed about that, but how many chief ministers have got a fourth term in the history of this country? Hardly any. Our vote percentage in Assam is 31 per cent. I think where we might have gone wrong is with the alliances. In West Bengal, we have emerged actually as an alternative to the TMC, because in our alliance we have gained much more and were now leading the Opposition there. The DMK, I think, was a great disappointment because there the pattern also is the AIADMK and DMK. We could have won. I think again, if we had made some alliances, we might well have succeeded. But if you look at it overall, the BJP fought 696 (Assembly) seats (in all) and got 64, and we fought 335 and got 135.AMBREEN KHAN: Sonia Gandhi said the Prime Minister behaves like a Shahenshah. What does that imply?I think Arun Shourie put it very well in the course of his interview  narcissism, megalomania, trying to control the government, a statue at Madame Tussauds. They give you an indication of the persona of the Prime Minister. Giving out statistics without regard to the truth and basically concentrating everything in the PMO, not allowing his ministers the kind of freedom that was allowed during the UPA government these are personal traits of character wearing a name-printed striped suite and then auctioning it off. These are all very significant characteristics of a man who basically is in love with himself, which is not a bad thing, but in politics it may not sometimes succeed for a long period of time.LIZ MATHEW: Regional parties have been successful in keeping out the BJP to an extent. But why has the BJP managed to defeat the Congress so easily?If you go back to analyse the decline of the Congress party, I think we go back several years, to the compromises that we made with regional parties by sharing seats What happens in politics is that the moment you compromise for sharing of seats, then your entire cadre shifts from one party to the other, and thats the genesis of the decline of our regional presence.We did it in Uttar Pradesh, and see the consequences of it. We have not done it in Odisha but there the Congress has been a weak force for a long time. Luckily, we are now the alternative in West Bengal. I dont think we made a mistake because, had we gone with the TMC, we would have landed in a much worse position.SHALINI NAIR: The Prime Minister often raises the point that governance under the NDA, unlike the Congress regime, has been corruption-free.What are the charges of corruption against the Congress party during the UPA regime? It started in 2010-11 with the telecom issue. What was the corruption there? We did not sell the spectrum because the policy was not to sell. It may be right, it may be wrong, the Supreme Court ultimately said it was wrong, so you auction it. What is the result of that auction? That the very telecom sector which bought 5 Megahertz of spectrum at an administered price of Rs1,680 crore buys it for Rs 45,000 crore and that goes to the consolidated fund of India. Now, you will not call this a scam, because all this money has gone to the Government of India, which should have gone to the sector, so the result is that, by calling it a scam, and by reversing the policy, you have, in fact, destroyed the sector. The same with coal, nobody wants a coal mine anymore.RITIKA CHOPRA: In a recent interview, Smriti Irani said that during her predecessors regime, education had become a political akhada, states wouldnt see eye to eye, whereas she has achieved consensus.I dont want to react to what Smriti Irani says. I think the people of this country know how the education department is being run. Did we appoint RSS people or Congress-minded people as vice-chancellors of universities? Did we appoint people of a particular ideology as directors of IIT? Was there a controversy about the Prime Ministers degree? What about the corruption in Madhya Pradesh, the Vyapam scam? Is that not the BJP?AMITABH SINHA: As a former HRD minister, what is your opinion on Smriti Iranis tenure so far?Im not worried about individuals, Im worried about the change of textbooks, Im worried about the effacing of history, Im worried about a Vedic board being created. See, these are real worries. You tell Ramdev that you can have a private Vedic board in India so that our children get aligned to that ideology as they grow up. Im worried about that. Im not worried about Smriti Irani, Im worried about what she symbolises.LIZ MATHEW: After the rout in the recent state elections, some in the Congress have talked about surgery and changes in the party. What do you think is the way forward?Surgery of a political party will not change the future of India. We need to do a lot of things within the Congress party, but thats not enough. We are here for the nation, we are not here for the Congress. We are presenting an alternative, right? That may be an unacceptable alternative, to that extent we need to change, to provide a wholly acceptable alternative, and people who have voted against us, we must bring them back to our fold, to say that this is the only party that recognises the needs, the aspirations, and the pain of every Indian.SHEELA BHATT: Sonia Gandhi called the charges against Robert Vadra a conspiracy. But why make it political?Who says dont investigate? But you leak the email to the media, then you have the media play it up, that is what Mrs Gandhi is talking about. Your intentions are not to investigate in a fair manner, your intention is to besmirch the name, to have another way of saying you want to have a Congress-mukt Bharat. Who is stopping your investigation? Did we say dont investigate? Why dont they agree to an SIT under the Supreme Court? In all these allegations, have you found a single case where a Congress person has been convicted? This is all media stuff. You get something, you leak something, then you give a spin to it, then the Finance Minister writes a blog, then his people go up on television, then you create an atmosphere, and then you say he is corrupt. And when it comes to you, that piece of paper that names family members of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and the money trail, then thats irrelevant.COOMI KAPOOR: Some people see similarities between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. What is your opinion?Let Donald Trump fight the election then I will give you my opinion. But you have my opinion of Modi anyway.MANEESH CHHIBBER: Why is the Congress party always defending Robert Vadra and his alleged wrongdoings?The point is that he happens to be associated with a person who is part of the family of the Congress leadership. So when you make an allegation against him, in a sense you are making an allegation against the Congress party. If the Congress party does not respond, then you would say that the Congress party has accepted it. Fact of the matter is, if you make a false allegation, the person is entitled to say it is false.AFRAZ ALAM: This whole wave of admiration for Modis work has only increased in the last two years. Even if the people start rethinking about their decision to choose Modi, what is the alternative?You must know that there is an army out there, which is funded by a particular political party, which has enormous presence in the social media to serve a particular purpose. That army whenever I say something will attack me within two minutes, then they will praise Modi. It is a self-serving army which is part of the narcissism that I talked about. There is a lot of trolling against Modi today I bet that in the next two years, you will have an alternative. An alternative that will be far more compassionate, far more acceptable, far more inclusive and far less obsessed with himself or herself.ANANT GOENKA: Do you agree then there is a need for an internal organisational change in the Congress?There is no dispute that reform is needed. You ask us about the big idea, but Modi did not come with any big idea. It was lies, lies and damn lies. He was selling a dream and a person who looks forward to the next day for survival will buy a dream. So people of this country bought a dream.AMBREEN KHAN : So who will be able to sell the big dream in Uttar Pradesh?We should go back to the people of this country and say, We will not tell you lies, we will try and tell you what the reality is, believe us and give us a chance. All these guys have fooled you by telling lies, we will not do that. I think it is time for us to tell this to the people of our country.MANEESH CHHIBBER: We saw what happened in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. What is your partys take on it?I think we need an amendment in the defection law. We should have a new law which says two things: first, that you are free to defect, but if you defect, you will not get a public position for the next five years. Even if you succeed in an election, you will not get a public position or ministerial post in the next five years. If you defect in the middle of your term, you will not be entitled to stand for elections in the middle of that term. If you do that, then this buying of people, horse-trading and all these shenanigans will stop. We should take off our political hat and think of the future of India. You cannot have a future that is bright when you have a party in power at the Centre destroying constitutionally elected governments in this completely amoral fashion. The other grave concern I have is (regarding) the investigating agencies, whether it is the NIA, CBI or Enforcement Directorate. These have by and large become tools in the hands of the dispensation which is in power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Potato can be exported to many countries if pest related issues are addressed and standard operating procedures are put in place.In a meeting held last week, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman discussed ways to increase potato exports and other related issues with Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh.""In the meeting, the Commerce Minister emphasised the need to identify pest-free zones for export of potatoes in the production clusters. Both ministries have decided to take further course of action soon on this issue,"" a senior government official told .The Commerce Ministry has suggested that concerned stakeholders such as Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Central Potato Research Institute, National Plan Protection Organisation (NPPO) and the state horticulture departments need to interact and prepare an action plan for identification of pest free zones for potato.That apart, it has also stressed on preparing the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for export of potatoes to various countries in order to address the quarantine pest concerns, the official added.It may be noted that though there is huge demand for Indian potatoes from Russia, the country has not been able to tap the export opportunities fully due to pest related issues.Identification of pest-free zones in producing areas will help export of quality commodity from India and avoid any rejection of consignments, the official said.India exported 1.80 lakh tonnes of potatoes in 2014-15 fiscal, which was lower than 3.05 lakh tonnes in the previous year, as per the government data.

It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.

With limited production of quality seeds, there is a huge gap between supply and demand.The Government Task Force on Potato Mission has estimated that the State's requirement of tuber seed at 1.2 lakh tonnes by 2017-18.The Government has been procuring large quantities of potato seeds from West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh every year to meet the demand. This not only drains the State exchequer but also results in reduction of quality due to long distance transport.The Task Force had recommended for seed production to be done inside the State with private involvement. The potato seeds to be produced by UTIPL will be marketed inside the State and in Eastern India.The company will get 10 acres of land at Deras farm for establishment of tissue culture laboratory and 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput for seed multiplication with usual Government rent for a period of 15 years.The company will establish the required infrastructure and seed multiplication at their own cost which will be around `20 crore, official sources said.However, the State Government will provide infrastructure support like road connectivity, electricity and water supply to the project sites."

(Source: Twitter/@BJP4India) BJP President Amit Shah. (Source: Twitter/@BJP4India)The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes in PoK, BJP president Amit Shah said today lashing out at Rahul Gandhi over his dalali barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yesterday, wrapping up his UP kisan yatra in the capital, Gandhi had accused Modi of hiding behind the blood of soldiers and added: Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are cashing in on their sacrifice). This morning, Gandhi tweeted: I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocallybut I will not support using the Indian Army in political posters and propaganda all across the country.By his khoon ki dalali comment, Rahul has insulted the Army, the martyrs and 125 crore Indians, Shah said.Dalali is what Congress did from Bofors to Embraer, from 2G to coal. Dalali involves some goods, what does he think this is about? Can one put a price to the blood of jawans?The morale of the very Army that risked their lives to destroy terror camps has been broken by him. I do not know what he was trying to achieve but the government, BJP and the people are standing firmly behind the Indian Army, Shah said accusing both Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of politicising the Army.The question is why you (Congress) are not happy, enthusiastic and proud of this, Shah said. It shows there is some fundamental flaw in youInstead of joining people in their happiness, the Congress party is with Pakistan in its despair.The BJP will certainly go to the people on the issue of surgical strikes, Shah said in reply to a question whether the strikes would feature in the BJP campaign in next years Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Zaroor jayenge, he said. I said at the very beginning that if some tehsil president had put up some posters (a reference to posters celebrating the strikes) that should not be taken into account. But we will go to the public because Army morale needs to be boosted and this achievement of the Army needs to be lauded. It was the achievement of the Army and the political will of Narendra Modi. Government was careful from the first day not to politicisethat is why the briefing was done by the DGMO and not by a political functionary, Shah said.Rahul Gandhis clarification in the morning did not cut much ice, Shah said claiming that BJP had kept all its poll promises  from securing the countrys borders and not allowing anybody to get away with beheading our jawans to one rank, one pension.Suggesting that those casting doubts on the authenticity of the strikes are anti-India leaders, Shah said, The whole country, BJP and its government are standing firmly behind the Army. We do not trust the anti-India rhetoric of leaders, we trust the bullets of our Army men.Gandhi, he said, should concentrate on potato factory, a swipe at this comments to farmers that they want potato factories. Shah also appeared to dismiss demands for releasing video evidence, saying who is seeking them.Shah brushed aside Pakistans denial. Then what was the special Pak Parliament session all about, he asked, and why is the Pak Prime Minister who comes to Islamabad only 3-4 times a month camping in Islamabad.As for Kejriwals remarks that India should counter Paks denial propaganda, he said that there is no doubt who is benefiting from his comments because Pakistanis are making him trend on twitter. The reference was to the hashtag PakStandsWithKejriwal that began trending on Thursday.Shah said Congress and Rahul Gandhi dislike Modi and recalled expressions like maut ke saudagar, (merchant of death) and zeher ki kheti (sowing poison) used by his mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi against Modi. The BJP won a two-thirds majority in Gujarat after maut ke saudagar and a majority after zeher ki kheti comments, Shah said, wondering how the latest statement will play out.He lauded the media for what he called its support of the government on its stand on Pakistan.Investigative journalists have dug out the truth from across the border, he said.

Shah asked and put the Congress leaders remarks in the same league as maut ka saudagar, an old comment from the party referring to Modi.The army raids were being touted as revenge for Uri and could become a talking point for next years assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.Posters hailing Modi for the raids have surfaced in UP, prompting the Congress and BSP chief Mayawati to allege that the BJP was trying to gain political mileage out of the military action.I fully support the surgical strikes and I have said so unequivocally, but I will not support using the Indian army in political posters and propaganda all across the country, Gandhi tweeted,standing by his dalali remarks.The political slugfest came on a day home minister Rajnath Singh announced sealing the entire the India-Pakistan border, while the finance minister said in Washington that every major terrorist incident in the world has a Pakistani footprint.The blame game over the surgical strikes broke out on Tuesday when Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam called the military action fake and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the government to release proof to counter Pakistani propaganda against the operation.Mayawati, a political rival to both Congress and BJP, condemned the attempt to profit from the armys cross-border action ahead of the UP polls.Only the army should be felicitated and hailed for it not any leader, the defence minister or the Prime Minister, she said.Congress leaderKapil Sibal called for a stop to this poster-baazi and politics on the armys successes.BJP chief Shah attributed these posters to decisions taken by local leaders, but credited the Prime Minister for his leadership. He insisted that his party wont desist from using the issue during the elections to boost the morale of the armed forces.He lashed out at the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for seeking proof.Who is being questioned  the soldiers who risked their lives? What did Kejriwal want when he asked for proof? And after his statements, Kejriwal began trending (on social media) in Pakistan. From this, it is clear his words have helped whom, he said.Shah tried to corner the Congress, with scams such as Bofors guns deal and 2G spectrum auction when the party was in power.The use of the word dalali for soldiers shows the Congresss mindset. The word is synonymous with the opposition party whose leaders were embroiled in several scams worth thousands of crores, he said.Shah said Gandhi should concentrate on the potato factory for farmers as his understanding of the problems of agriculture sector is limited to that only. He was referring to Gandhis remarks made at a public meeting during his Delhi to Deoria march in UP.Congress leader Sibal hit back, accusing the BJP of giving birth to Jaish-e-Mohammed as it was during the previous NDA government that the militant outfits chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, was released from jail in a hostage exchange.But the BJP was not alone in criticising Gandhis remarks. The AAP too latched on to the issue.Such words (dalali) should not have been used by Rahul Gandhi. These are the times for us unite & stand along army,Kejriwal tweeted."

This has had a cascading effect on retail prices which, in case of patotatoes and onions, have shot up by anwhere between 50% and 100%.""I bought potatoes for under Rs 30 a kg on Friday. Today, the prices have gone up to Rs 50. Tomatoes and onions too have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20. In Delhi, however, the vegetable prices continue to be stable,"" said Kavya Kohli, a resident of Sector 46.Increase in the prices of tomatoes and onions particularly has affected households.""We can opt for brinjal instead of cauliflower or beans instead of peas in case of price rise but we cannot replace essentials like tomatoes and onions. Vegetable prices generally drop with the arrival of winter,"" said Sanjeev R. Shukla, a resident of Sector 4.Vegetable prices, both wholesale and retail, soared within days of demolition of all the 175 makeshift shops in the Khandsa market on Saturday by the agricultural produce marketing committee. The space was cleared to set up an open-shed agricultural mall here.President of the Khandsa market association Inderjeet Thakran told TOI, ""While the authorities have razed the makeshift shops, they have no alternative arrangement in place to shift the wholesale vegetable market until the open-shed mall comes up. Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984. Until it was demolished, the market received over 200 trucks carrying 300 tonnes of vegetables and fruits every day."

Shah, who addressed a public rally in Etawah, Samajwadi boss Mulayam Singh Yadav's home district, also called on young BJP supporters to take a ""pledge"" to stop the ruling party's thugs from venturing out of home during elections. ""I know very well where I am standing, and still saying that central forces must be here to prevent the goons (from capturing booths). But I also appeal to the youths of the BJP to stop the goons from venturing out of their homes during elections,"" the BJP leader said. With 10 to 25 per cent Yadav voters, the 11 Assembly constituencies in Etawah and its adjoining districts - Mainpuri, Auraiya, Farrukhabad, Kannauj and Etah - have for long been strongholds of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP). Mulayam's native village Saifai is in Etawah, around 250km from Lucknow. ""You take a pledge today that you will not let the goons of the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party take over the election this time. Enough is enough. Now UP has to take the path to development and strengthen (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi,"" Shah said. Shah asked the people whether they needed parties like the Samajwadi and former chief minister Mayawati's BSP, which, he said, have ""promoted criminals during their rules"" or a leader like Modi ""who has been giving jobs to youths"". The BJP has not projected a chief ministerial face and the decision so far is to let Modi lead the campaign. Shah said the BJP would once again give the state a ""Kalyan Singh-like government"" if it won the Assembly elections. The BJP claims that Kalyan, a two-time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and now governor of Rajasthan, had given the heartland state clean governance when he ruled. It was during Kalyan's first term as chief minister that the Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992. The Supreme Court had later held Kalyan responsible for the incident and punished him by asking him to stand in the courtroom till the court rose for the day. Shah also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi, who recently completed a kisan yatra in the state. The BJP leader claimed that the Congress vice-president was not aware of the fact that ""potatoes are not manufactured in a factory"". ""Rahul is a big leader. He was recently on a kisan yatra in Uttar Pradesh and said in Agra that he would open new factories to increase the production of potatoes. He doesn't know that potato is not produced in a factory; it is grown in fields. But we will certainly open factories in the state to produce potato chips if the BJP comes to power,"" Shah said. Rahul's critics had spread an unsubstantiated rumour last month that he had said he would open factories to increase potato production. BSP boss Mayawati said Shah's promise of a government like that of Kalyan Singh amounted to insulting Uttar Pradesh residents, adding that the former chief minister had been ""punished"" by the Supreme Court. ""Shah has insulted the 22 crore people of UP by promising a Kalyan Singh-like government,"" she said."

""Maybe tomorrow onwards, every two, three weeks, I will have to go the ATM or bank to get cash.""India's ""black economy,"" a term widely used to describe transactions that take place outside formal channels, amounted to around 20 percent of gross domestic product, according to investment firm Ambit.New bills of 500 and 2,000 rupees will be introduced from Nov. 10. Jaitley said it would take two to three weeks to replace the old notes, amid concerns over the availability of cash.POLICE ON ALERTDeepak Chhatoi, a salesman at a car varnishing store in Mumbai, said he had to turn away customers wanting to pay with larger bills, and could not buy the popular potato sandwich known as the vada pav.""I couldn't even have breakfast this morning because there seems to be a shortage of change in the market,"" he said.The extent of the impact of the measures became evident as petrol stations and hospitals also refused to accept larger denomination bank notes, even though the government had given them a waiver to continue accepting them.Meanwhile, bank ATMs were closed and banks prepared for a flood of people seeking to exchange larger bank notes for smaller ones.They will have to fill a form and show proof of identity to exchange no more than 4,000 rupees worth of the old notes at any bank, which is likely to cause further chaos.Swapan Mandal, a labourer, wanted to withdraw 3,000 rupees from an ATM and send it to his family in Kolkata, in eastern India, but was unable to do so.""I have only 500 rupees notes at home. I don't know if I will be able to send the money,"" he said.A sub-inspector in New Delhi said the police commissioner had issued orders to watch for disturbances, especially at key retail outlets like petrol pumps.""This is a sensitive time. We have to be alert,"" he said.TEMPORARY GOLD RUSHThe main opposition Congress party said it supported moves to attack the shadow economy, but that withdrawing bigger denomination notes would hit the common man first.""Modi shows how little he cares about ordinary people of this country - farmers, small shopkeepers, housewives, all thrown into utter chaos,"" said party leader Rahul Gandhi.""(All the) while the real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed away abroad or in bullion or real estate.""Indians raced to turn their cash into gold, which jumped nearly 4 percent to its strongest in more than five weeks as investors sought safety following Trump's unlikely win.India is the world's second largest gold consumer and around a third of its demand comes from the unaccounted sector.On Tuesday night, jewellers in Mumbai kept shops open until midnight as panicked people rushed to buy gold with cash, said Kumar Jain, vice president of the Mumbai Jewellers Association.On the stock market, real estate firms that depend on cash transactions were hit particularly hard, with DLF Ltd, India's biggest property developer, closing 17 percent lower.But analysts said the move would prove beneficial to India in the longer term, by ushering in transparency and bringing transactions into the formal economy, and providing additional revenue for a country that has long struggled to contain its fiscal deficits.It could also lead to easing inflation, raising the prospect of additional rate cuts from the central bank, which lowered the key repo rate by 25 basis points last month"

Prices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.Shortage of new currency notes has hit potato farmers in Punjab, who are now struggling to sell their stock of potato seeds. At the peak of the potato sowing season, the lack of new notes in the market is preventing potential buyers from purchasing supplies.There are buyers but they do not have the new currency. We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. Most of the traders are small businessmen and they prefer purchasing the stock with cash, he added. The potato farmers of Punjab are also the primary suppliers of potato seeds across the country.The rates of potato seeds too have crashed over the past one week, from Rs 1,800 per 50 kg to Rs 1,000- 1,200 for the same amount.Watch What Else is Making NewsPrices for the early variety of potato that is already available in the market too have come down, from Rs 20 per kg in wholesale market to Rs 10-12 per kg.After 1984 riots, which also happened in November, this is the first time we are facing such a crisis. Trucks are ready with the supplies, but transporters do not have cash to send them to other states, said Sangha.Punjab has around 560 cold storage units which dispatch about 1.1 million tonnes (mt) of potato seeds to other states, while 0.4 mt is used by potato growers within Punjab. So far not even 40 per cent of the seed stock has been sold, said farmers.The potato planting season begins in early October and lasts till November 25 across the country. In Punjab, the seeds are sown in October itself, and the first batch of the vegetable arrives in the market by mid-November. In the other states, the potato seeds are only sown in November.Punjab, which produces about 2.2 mt of potatoes a year, supplies the seeds of the vegetable to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat etc. Punjab meets around 63 per cent of the annual potato seed demand of the country.Apart from the small amount of seeds used in Punjab in October, most of the stock has been lying in cold storage units.Said Raghbir Singh, president of the JPGA, Several traders who had come to Punjab last week to buy the potato seeds returned empty-handed. The farmers here were not willing to accept the scrapped currency notes.We do not know how to tide over this situation. The government should have had adequate stock of new currency notes. The seed supply season lasts only for three weeks.

We want to act as a pressure group for getting the concerns answered, Digmohan Negi, one of the founders of Uttarakhand Ekta Manch Delhi, told HT over phone from Delhi.He said the states languages Garhwali and Kumaoni are still considered dialects and demanded their inclusion in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.Gairsain (which is almost equidistant from Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the state) is yet to be made the states capital, Negi rued.Read: Why Gairsain capital issue a political hot potato in election-bound UttarakhandUttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat addressed the gathering over phone and assured action on the demands.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia assured assistance for celebration of hill festival Uttaraini-Makraini at 40 places and setting up of an Uttarakhand Akademi in the national capital, where thousands of Uttarakhandis are residing.Noted Uttarakhandi singer Narendra Singh Negi recited a song specially written for the gathering through which he exhorted locals to join hands for the cause of the hills. Its only through unity that we can make our voices be heard, he said.It is just the beginning of the fight of the pahadi (community). Were glad we could highlight our concerns on the national level, Uttarakhand-based activist Amit Gusain Pahadi who works for hill cultures promotion, said.I brought my children to witness the gathering and to evoke a sense of belonging (to the hills) among them, Reena Pandey, a Ghaziabad-based homemaker from Uttarakhand, told HT from the capital.Besides keeping a tab on the follow-up of their demands, the collective is looking forward to develop 10 model villages in the hill state with financial and voluntary help of its members.Our focus is on the nine hill districts of Uttarakhand. We will try to develop model facilities like health and education so as to curb migration, Negi said."

The sluggish acreage is going to affect production of the early variety (jaldi aloo) that usually reaches the market by mid-November.But this was not expected when Bengal farmers, the second tuber producing state after Uttar Pradesh , had made huge profits in the last season. ""The November chill is ideal for potato farming. But where is the money?"" said potato grower Kinkar Das from Tarakeswar. Kinkar hasn't been able to sow potato seeds entirely in his 2.5 bigha land. ""I sowed in only 1.5 bigha, leaving the remaining for less expensive farming such as brinjals and radish,"" Das said.Gopinath Khanrui from Singur has major stakes this year. Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch. The Punjab Potato Seed Federation has already approached Bengal agents with a request to collect the money from farmers in old currency notes. West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances. ""I have intimated the state government about the proposal and am waiting for the response. I came to know that the Punjab government has endorsed the move. But there is no use taking the old currency notes unless Bengal government gives a go-ahead,"" he said."

Photographs: Tashi TobgyalMy name is Love, but I dont believe in love; ours is an arranged marriage, says Deepak aka Love Gola. At 5 pm, with only five hours to go for his wedding, Deepak is sitting slumped on the floor, dressed in a pair of checked boxers and a half-sleeved vest and leaning heavily on his mother Amita. The 22-year-old gym instructor and his extended family have congregated at Jattumal Dharamshala, at the far end of Sitaram Gali in Old Delhis Chandni Chowk, from where the baraat will set off this evening. I had big plans for my wedding. I wanted to go to the parlour to get dressed but all I could afford was a hair cut, says Deepak, running his fingers through his hair thats streaked blond.The baraat sets off The baraat sets offDeepak, the youngest of four siblings, had got engaged to Priya Prajapati, a 22-year-old from Nand Nagri in East Delhi, in April, six months before the Central governments sudden decision to scrap notes of Rs 500 and 1,000. The decision scuttled his dreams of a grand wedding and what followed was an endless spiral of cost cuts. Demonetisation ne sab pe paani pher diya (Demonetisation played the spoiler), he complains.Deepaks 53-year-old mother Amita, her face taut, is concentrating on the mehndi her niece is drawing on her outstretched palms. Deepaks sister Bhavna, 32, is lying on one of the three mattresses spread out on the floor, trying to put her three-year-old son to sleep. The few others in the dharamshala, a few cousins and friends of the Golas, are idly waiting for the ceremonies to begin.Since November 8, we have only been queuing up outside banks  I, my son, daughter, niece Sirf dimag mein tension hi tension hai (I have been very tense), says Amita, whose husband Roopchand, a property dealer, died four years ago. Amita gets nostalgic as she talks about their wedding in 1978, incidentally the year of the last demonetisation exercise. Of course, then I didnt know any better. Or at least I dont remember going through such trouble, she says.His nephew has woken up in time for the wedding His nephew has woken up in time for the weddingWe had saved up Rs 2 lakh for the wedding. We queued up to exchange some money but the first three days, by the time our turn came, the money at the bank would get over. We finally managed to deposit all the money after 10 days, and then began queuing up to withdraw it, says Deepak, stretching out his mehndi-painted feet. The family could eventually only withdraw Rs 58,000, the budget hence for Deepaks November 23 wedding.The government has set a withdrawal limit of Rs 2.5 lakh for weddings, with stringent conditions  claimants have to produce wedding cards and copies of advance payments made. Besides, withdrawals are allowed only from balance available before November 8. We didnt even try. We werent sure if we were eligible and there was no time anyway, says Deepak.Indu, 24, the third of Amitas four children, says, If this (the demonetisation) hadnt happened, bhaiyya ki baraat would have set off from a banquet hall, not from a dharamshala. The siblings exchange a quick smile. They had hired a banquet hall but cancelled it for the dharamshala close to their home.A few paces from the dharamshala, the forced austerity at the Gola household finds its echoes in the markets of Chandni Chowk, the Capitals hub for all things matrimonial.Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UP Band budget: Rs 12,000Rahul Band had not been paid any money till wedding day by the Golas. The band members are all from Mahua in UPAt the office of Jea Band, one of the oldest wedding organisers in Old Delhi, Anil Thadani, 45, is busy handling the mood swings of his clients. All our clients are panicking Most of them come to us with old notes, phir gussa dikhatein hain, koi emotional ho jata hai (Some clients get angry, some turn emotional). But we have no option, we have strictly stopped accepting old notes, says Thadani. The company, which featured in the 2001 movie Monsoon Wedding, organises venues, tents, bands and decorations for weddings.There are 150 auspicious wedding days in a year and business is usually brisk then. But this year, 25 per cent of our bookings have been cancelled, many have been postponed, and 15 per cent is on credit. We have been forced to lay off some of our staff, says Thadani, stopping to admonish someone on the phone: Pooja shuru hone waali hai, ghodi nahi pahunchi (The puja is about to begin, where is the horse)!A lot of families are also opting for day weddings to cut lighting costs, he says, though adding that while the move has hit the industry, in the long run, it will make the sector more organised.***At the dharamshala, Amita is still disgruntled. Unmindful of the caked mehndi on her palms, she angrily pulls out a cloth bag full of Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes and says, This is all the money we have! We cancelled the reception and the sangeet. All the other ceremonies  haldi, mehndi and the wedding  are being done in one day. Ladki waalon ne kuch dahej bhi nahin diya. Unka cash bhi humne hi line mein lag kar exchange karwaya (The girls family didnt give dowry either; it was we who got even their old notes exchanged), she says. We didnt buy new clothes for ourselves or gifts for our guests. I am wearing a sari my mother gifted me. The only thing we bought was a suit for Love, she says, pointing to a beige-and-maroon sherwani hanging from a nail on one of the pillars.Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relatives Clothes budget: only for groomGolas bought new clothes just for Deepak. At Chhabra store, they say lehenga sales are hit, no one is buying for relativesAt Chhabra Store, one of the most popular bridal wear shops in Chandni Chowk, Manoj Kumar, 44, a salesman, says many families have, like the Golas, cut down on their trousseau budget in the wake of the new policy. Lehenga sales have been hit. No one is buying lehengas for more than Rs 15,000-20,000, says Kumar. Bride toh lehenga kharidegi hi, par relatives ke liye ab koi kapde nahin khareed raha (The bride will of course buy the lehenga, but no one is buying clothes for relatives), he says, folding a bright red sari.Kunal Singh Chhabra, 18, the store owners son who is overseeing operations at the shop today, says sales have gone down by 80 per cent. The first three days after November 8 saw zero business. Even now, the ones who come to us insist on giving us old notes. So we take the money from them and send our boys to queue up outside banks, says Chhabra, who is an undergraduate student in Mumbai and is in the Capital on a break.However, he backs the demonetisation move. I want to become a politician when I grow up. So I think it is brilliant.All along Katra Asharfi, the lane in Chandni Chowk that has over 200 bridal-wear shops, including Chhabra Store, most are empty, with desperate salesmen calling out to people on the road. Across the street, there are lines but outside banks and ATMs.Chhabra, however, is hopeful. Have you seen the movie Band Baaja Baaraat? The actors in the movie say no matter what, weddings will happen. That is absolutely true. Just give it some time, says the budding businessman.A little more than a kilometre away is Dariba Kalan, the Mughal-era bazaar for silver jewellery. There have been no customers since morning. We have lost 70 per cent of our business. The artisans are suffering, they are not accepting cheques, complains Vineet Seth, 48, who owns Durgadas Seth Jewellers and Silversmiths. He is also anxious about the rumours that have been doing the rounds. People are very scared. Look around, most shops are shut. We have been receiving messages on WhatsApp about possible raids by the Income Tax Department, says Seth, who is also the general secretary of the Dariba Jewellers Association.Apart from the silver stock thats piling up in his shop  jewellery, bowls and cups  Seth is worried about his top-selling gift item, silver boxes with framed notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. No one wants them now. I have to get these notes replaced. Now, people are only buying silver coins worth Rs 250, he says.Seth is not completely convinced about the demonetisation, rattling off a few idioms to express his state of mind: We have entered a tunnel, lets see if there is light at the end of it Dekhein oont kis karwat baithta hai (Lets see how it goes), he says.A kilometre away is Kinari Bazar, the one-stop shop for wedding bling  shimmery laces, envelopes, turbans for grooms and chooda-kaleere (bangles) for the bride. Modi ji ne bahut accha kiya, sabko barbaad kar diya (PM Modi did a very good thing, he killed our business)! says Piyush Gupta, 30, who owns a shop in the market. Business has gone down by 50 per cent. People are opting for court marriages, no one wants turbans and bangles anymore. We sell items worth Rs 10, 20 and 50. But the few people who come to us come with Rs 2,000 and we turn them away, he says.***Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vessels Utensil budget: 0R K Sharma, who rents out utensils, says weddings like of the Golas are happening in dharamshalas, which provide vesselsShaadi ka mazaa hi nahin hain (the wedding fervour is missing), says Deepaks sister Bhavna. Around her, everything is moving at an unhurried pace, with little to suggest that Deepak will take his wedding vows in a few hours from now. There is no decoration  no marigold flowers or electrical streamers  no trays of food going around, no piled-up gifts.The family had got the wedding invitations printed before the notes were scrapped, but not everyone who received the invitation is here. Though I sent invitations to my four sisters, eventually, I asked only two of them to come. The other two have big families. Where would they have stayed? Now they wont invite me for their childrens weddings, worries Amita, hurriedly collecting her belongings to get dressed at a neighbours home. Beauty parlour bhi nahi gaye, khud hi taiyaar ho rahe hain (We are not going to the salon either), says Bhavna.Ram Veer, 23, a mehndi artiste from Aligarh who visits Delhi during the wedding season every year, says its been an exceptionally bad season for him too. We charge Rs 50 for designs per hand, but that hardly gets us any money. We usually make all our money from bridal mehndi  Rs 1,500 for both hands and feet. Earlier, we would be booked for the entire season, but this year, there are no customers, only cancellations, says Ram Veer, sitting on a stool outside a beauty salon at Sitaram Gali.Unlike the Golas, many families have also cancelled their orders for wedding cards. We have stacks and stacks of printed invitations but customers havent been collecting them. All the customers just disappeared. Sab thap ho gaya hai (Business has shut completely), says C P Singh, 42, owner of Maharaja Papers and Cards in Chawri Bazar, the Capitals biggest market for invitation cards. I have been sitting here for hours People say demonetisation is a good move, but I dont know, it all seems uncertain now, he says, looking out at the empty street.As the sun begins to set, there is some sign of activity at the Jattumal Dharamshala. Two workers from Radhe Radhe Snacks and Caterers, an 80-year-old shop in Chandni Chowks Sitaram Gali, have arrived. The menu is basic: samosa and chai. For its owner Pradeep Sharma, 45, that is a severe downgrade. Usually, there are 250-odd items on the menu during the wedding season. Kashmiri aloo, shahi paneer, kadai paneer, tawa sabzi they are all off the menu now. Clients are only asking for potato dishes. Four of my orders have been cancelled. At the Gola wedding too, we are only making snacks, he says.Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they say Dhol budget: Rs 6,000The dholwallahs, all from Solapur, are hopeful the family will pay them a good shagun. Lets see, they sayThough the sudden note ban forced the Golas to trim their wedding expenses, Deepak had booked the band, dhol and photographers in advance. We had already given them some advance payment and they said if we cancelled, we wouldnt get the amount back. We still have to pay them some money. Right now, its all on credit, says Deepak, now slipping into his sherwani in the courtyard. His sister Bhavna and elder brother Sonu, 30, help him with the accessories. Indu has gone to a friends house to get her hair done.Outside, members of Rahul Band are getting impatient. Panch baje se aaye hain, pata nahin kab baraat niklegi (We have been here since 5 pm, dont know when the procession will leave), says band master Moolchand, dressed in a blue velvet outfit with yellow trimmings.Moolchand and his team of 11, all from Mahua village in Uttar Pradesh, come to the Capital only during the wedding season, and play bass drums, trombones, French horns, bugles, and sousaphones, set to tunes of old Bollywood songs. This time, however, Moolchand says, their trip has been wasted. This is our fifth wedding of the season, but we havent earned much. Some tell us to take cheques, but what will we do with that? says Moolchand, who has signed up for the Gola wedding for Rs 12,000. He has got no money so far.The dholwallahs, who have spread out in the courtyard now, are worried too. They are from Solapur in Maharashtra and, like members of the Rahul Band, make trips to Delhi during the wedding season. We are supposed to get Rs 6,000 for this wedding, lets see. Hopefully, they will enjoy the music and gives us good shagun (money), says Raja Chouhan, 23. We will stay back till March. If the income isnt good, we will return to Solapur.Dressed in a blue shirt, trousers, a red jacket and a red hat, Chouhan is keeping an eye on Rahul Band. We will have to make sure we lead the baraat. If we go first, before the bandwallahs, we will get to pick the money the guests throw, he says.***In the courtyard, Bhavna is giving final touches to the groom. A dupatta is tied around Deepaks waist, a turban placed on his head and a garland of Rs 10 notes put on him. Deepak turns emotional. Wiping away tears and hugging his siblings, he begins to head out. His mother and sister Indu still havent arrived.His best friend, also called Love (Anand), arrives with another garland of Rs 10 notes, interspersed with a few Rs 100 notes. Dost ke liye itna toh karna tha (I had to do this for my friend). It cost me Rs 1,500, he says, patting his friend on the back and posing for a photograph with the garland.Its dark now and the videographers flashbulb lights up the courtyard. For a little while, at least, the tension dissipates and Deepak tries to enjoy his big day. The revelry picks pace as the band begins playing the song Ye desh hai veer jawanon ka, and Deepak and his friends and relatives break into a dance. A few in the crowd pout for selfies and pose for photographer Vikas Kumar.Kumar and videographer Dharam Singh, from SR Studio, are happy to oblige everyone, though they admit being worried about their payments. They booked us for Rs 35,000 for three days. But now, that it is just a one-day function, I dont know Let them have a good time today, we will discuss money later, smiles Kumar, rushing to take the grooms photograph with his sister Indu, who has arrived in a dazzling green sari, matching eye-shadow, and crimped hair.After a few rituals, the group heads to the street outside, where Ajay Giri, 24, has been waiting with Rani, the mare which Deepak will soon mount. Rani is dressed for the occasion  a jasmine garland around her ears and a red, velvet cloth on her back. Giri and Rani have been booked for Rs 10,000, but all that money goes to his owner. The only money Giri makes is the shagun, usually in notes of Rs 100 and 500, or even 1,000 if he gets lucky. These days, he barely gets Rs 200 in all for a wedding. Earlier, Rani would do three weddings in one night; now one and some days, none. Here too, I am sure Rani will get gud (jaggery) and I will get nothing, he says.He is right. Bhavna feeds Rani some jaggery and Deepak climbs on to the mare with some help from his friends. Giri is forgotten.Finally, Deepak Golas baraat begins to take shape. The air is filled with beats of the band and dhol and the wedding procession dances with abandon. Neighbours look out, bodies bent over window sills and parapets of roofs. One of Deepaks uncles takes out a bundle of Rs 10 notes and flings it on the groom. As the band and dholwallahs rush to grab the notes, the uncle quickly collects the notes and stuffs them in his jacket. Disappointed, the band and dholwallahs return to their spots and switch to a new track, Aaj mere yaar ki shadi hai. Happy with the new song, another relative tosses some money in the air and this time, band master Moolchand alerts his team members in time. Two of them rush and get the money.The procession begins, making its way past homes and shops, many of which have signboards of Yahan udhaar mana hai (No credit here) placed outside. The procession holds up traffic on the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk.A few metres away from New Delhi Railway Station, the band, dhol and ghodi are relieved and members of the baraat accommodate themselves into a few cars, some of their friends and relatives, the others hired. They are off to Nand Nagri in East Delhi, where Deepaks bride is waiting for them.Ladki waalon ne sirf pachas logon ka khana rakhwaya hai. Kya kar sakte hain, choti shadi hi hogi (The girls side has arranged for food for 50 people only. What can we do, it will be a small wedding), smiles Amita, squeezed into the rear seat of a car.Wedding budget: Rs 58,000Deepak with his bride Priya. I couldnt enjoy the wedding fully because of the cash crunch, but I am happy, he says Wedding budget: Rs 58,000Deepak with his bride Priya. I couldnt enjoy the wedding fully because of the cash crunch, but I am happy, he says***Two days after the wedding, as Deepak Gola settles into his new life, he has mixed feelings about his wedding. Enjoyment nahin hui poori paison ke wajah se (Couldnt enjoy the wedding completely because of the cash crunch). But I am happy, lifetime ki commitment hai, he says.A wedding plannerNov 8Government scraps notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominationNov 16Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das says a member of the family can make a one-time withdrawal of Rs 2.5 lakh for a weddingNov 21RBI issues new rules, says wedding card, copies of advance payments made for booking marriage hall and caterers will be required for withdrawing Rs 2.5 lakh.

They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesnt extend credit any longer. Chitra cant pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so, Ms. Bag told this reporter. We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit, Ms Bag said.Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer  a middle-aged man  said he could not extend any more credit as customers were paying in old bank notes.Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land  second only to Uttar Pradesh  was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the States total area. Since Bengals industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato.Ms. Bag  who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May  had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes.He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was a time-consuming affair in the potato sowing season.The potato seeds  which are tubers of the previous year  are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.Crisis timeSince stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes, Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds, warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.We are helplessThe officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur  Sethia Cold Storage  accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. We are instructed not to accept old currency notes, an official of Sethia Cold Storage said .Former president of Cold Storage Owners Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be difficult for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government should intervene.Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants federation and Bengals Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday.The problem, however, remains unresolved, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected, he warned.They are distressed as they do not have new currency to withdraw seeds from cold storage facilities"
,,,,,,,590a05287be9e033fa42eca5,Watch out for these four crops!,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-currency-ban-agricultural-producuction-wholesale-market-4404175/,2016-12-01,"There are four major crops currently being planted or in the early stages of growth  wheat, onion, potato and chana (chickpea)  whose status needs close monitoring in the coming weeks, to ensure least production disruptions from demonetisation-imposed cash crunch.In three of the four commodities, tight supplies have already led to price rise. Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

As wasted fruits and vegetables fill the area and raise a stink, estimates show that at least 60-70% of the produce is going waste because supply chain has been disrupted by cashlessness. It is the same situation at most mandis that come under Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Markets Board.On Wednesday morning, potato buyer and whole seller Mohammad Salim ordered throwing 25 sacks into the garbage dump. A single sack contains 1 quintal potatoes. ""An average of 20-25 sacks are going waste since demonetisation was announced,"" said the businessman.His son Mohammad Shaan said wastage over the month was to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh. ""We would have sold the produce to retailers at an estimated rate of Rs 5 per kg which means Rs 12,500 for 25 quintals. If the average for 28 days of demonetization period is calculated, our loss stands at Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said.But Salim is not the only one to have run into losses. The mandi comprises 50 buyers and at least 500 farmers in the vicinity. ""Cash and change crunch has upset business across levels. Over 60-70% of the produce is wasted for lack of demand. If this goes on, the mandi will have to close down,"" said Arvind Shukla, vice-president of the mandi's vegetable and fruit whole sellers association.General secretary Irshad Hussain added, ""Many farmers are not able to bring their produce to us because they have no money for transport. Some of the growers are dumping their produce either for peanuts at the local level or leaving it to fate. Even those who can manage are not able to get the cost of ferrying goods as prices have nose-dived.""Explaining the price factor, Saroj Pal, a dealer in tomatoes said, ""In October, a crate of tomatoes (25kg) sold at Rs 700 but a farmer gets only Rs 100 for the same now. Clearly, the rates have come down seven times.""Cauliflower, the cash crop of the past two seasons is making farmers regret. ""A single bud is fetching just 1 rupee instead of Rs 6-8 each last season,"" said Dharmu Lodhi, a farmer from Bangermau.Wastage at the fruit sellers' end was estimated to be around 40-50%. Tanveer Ahmed, who dealt with exotic fruits like kiwis , kinnows and grapes said, ""We dealt with these fruits on a daily basis but there have been just one or two business days in the week. The stock is going waste on a daily basis.""Tomato farmer from Rajpur (MP), Angad Singh said ""Will Modiji pay for our losses?"" Nizam Bhai pyazwale said, ""Many farmers had taken loans... the bid to battle black money is fine but not at the cost of human lives. Steps have to be taken immediately,"" he said.Hand-to-mouth locals are perhaps the only happy ones in the mandi because some vendors are giving away their vegetables free. Potato dealer Mohammad Irshad said, ""It will be disrespect of the Almighty if food is thrown away so it is better some human consumes some it without paying."" Beneficiary of this benevolence, Gita from Birdibagh said, ""I will use the best part for the family while feed the cattle on the rest."""

In 2015, potato sowing was conducted over 5.19 lakh hectares till December 5. This year, however, 10.17 lakh hectares have been sown by the same date. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.Currently, Gujarat ranks fifth in the country in production of potato. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily. While 23 lakh tonnes had come to the market in 2014, in 2015, that amount went up to 31 lakh tonnes, and to 35 lakh tonnes in 2016.Sowing of the crop picked up over last month, said officials, who reported that at least 5.51 lakh hectares had been sown in the last 20 days alone. If the trend continues, sowing will cross 12 lakh hectares - so far the highest area used to cultivate potato in Gujarat in any year.Mavjibhai Desai, chairman of the Deesa APMC attributes the exponential growth of potato farming to a number of reasons. ""This year, sowing has gone up with Narmada water reaching the northern parts of the state,"" said Desai, adding, ""The big increase in storage facilities has also drawn the attention of farmers to the cultivation of potato.""Desai said that in 2015-16 the top potato growing states - Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - had seen their production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, unlike other potato-growing states, Gujarat had registered an increase in potato production due to higher acreage.Better prices have also attracted farmers to potato cultivation, hold officials in the agriculture department, who said farmers received a good price last year for their yields, and this year, as compared to 2015, potato seed is cheaper and more easily available.In 2015-16, cold storage capacity went up by 6.25 lakh tonnes, with the current capacity at 22.5 lakh tonnes, said agriculture department officials. Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda.Potatoes from Gujarat are sent to Maharashtra and states in South India, and are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Mauritius."

Picture by Surajit Roy Dec. 15: From murder to disenchantment to skewering questions, seemingly unconnected events in the past 24 hours in places far apart from one another have brought to the fore the unintended consequences of demonetisation in the country. Over 100 factory owners in Amritsar have handed over keys of their units to the district administration in a symbolic protest that stood out in sharp contrast with the public pronouncements of support for demonetisation from most of corporate India. ""The problem is very simple. We cannot run our units any more. Let the government do it,"" said Amit Dalmiya, who runs a textile processing unit in Amritsar. ""If Modiji can run the country, he can also run the industry... it is a question of survival and the situation has gone beyond us,"" Krishna Kumar Sharma, the president of the Amritsar Textile Processor Association, told The Telegraph this evening. One industrialist who sought anonymity indicated his political choice. Without naming anyone, he said: "" Pehli baar to aadmi par bharosa hota hi hai... baad mein pata chalta hai.... (The first time you do trust a man... then realisation dawns). They did not go into demonetisation with full planning."" On Wednesday, the industrialists handed over the keys to the additional deputy commissioner, Tajinderpal Singh Sandhu. Amritsar is home to around 60 textile processing units on which another 700-800 embroidery, knitting and weaving units are dependent. ""At this moment our units are running at 20 per cent of the optimum capacity.... The labour strength had to be halved because of the prevailing economic situation,"" said Sharma. The units have been hit badly because of sudden cancellation of bulk orders since the demonetisation drive started. ""If a person manages to withdraw Rs 2,000 from an ATM, he will buy food and not clothes,"" said an industrialist. A contract worker with HDFC Bank was stabbed to death in Gujarat by three people with whom he had allegedly struck a deal to exchange notes. Rajesh Bhilariya, 27, was called today afternoon to a village in Junagadh where he was allegedly supposed to accept Rs 9 lakh in old notes and hand over new ones, police inspector Ashok Tilva said. Rajesh worked as a "" mitra"" or ""correspondent"" (effectively rural agents) of the bank. Police said Rajesh had reached the spot with his cousin. But the three would-be cash recipients snatched the bag with the new notes and tried to escape. When Rajesh tried to stop them, he was stabbed, the police said. An SBI branch and an adjoining ATM kiosk were ransacked in Malda today after hundreds of account holders seeking cash for family weddings, potato cultivation and travel were told each could withdraw no more than Rs 3,000. The account holders had queued up at the Balupur branch in Ratua, around 50km from Malda, from daybreak. The SBI branch, with 3,500 account holders, is the sole bank in the area. Saidul Sheikh, who was in the queue, said the bank staff initially offered only Rs 1,000 when depositors demanded the weekly quota of Rs 24,000. The amount was then raised to Rs 2,000 and then Rs 3,000. The trouble broke out around noon. The bank employees and officers fled. Mushref Miyan, a trader, said he was becoming increasingly nervous. ""My daughter's wedding is on Sunday. The Prime Minister had said we could draw Rs 24,000 each week. I have about Rs 80,000 in my account. But the bank is offering Rs 1,000 and I am really feeling frustrated. The people erupted today,"" he said. Subol Pal, a farmer, said he needed Rs 40,000 immediately. ""I am not being able to start my potato and vegetable cultivation as I need to invest Rs 40,000. The cash crisis is affecting hundreds of farmers like me,"" Pal said. Ankan Paul, the manager of the Balupur SBI branch, said: ""We are helpless. We are distributing whatever cash we are being sent. The bank was shut down after the violence."" Arun Kumar Sinha, the SBI regional manager, said that things were expected to normalise after tomorrow. BJP parliamentarians and party office bearers have told Amit Shah that the government needs to ensure adequate flow of cash in banks to check discontent among the people despite continued support for demonetisation. ""The public mood is still in favour of the government on demonetisation but people are facing hardships due to the shortage of cash. The government has to increase the cash flow to keep the people favourable,"" one MP from eastern Uttar Pradesh was quoted as having told a meeting on Wednesday evening. Concerned by the feedback, the BJP leadership had called separate meetings of party MPs and office bearers on Wednesday and Thursday. The Supreme Court today took note of growing instances of new currency notes being funnelled out of banks and asked the Centre ""you are not able to secure it?"" The court also grilled the government on withdrawing exemptions granted to hospitals and pharmacies for accepting the demonetised notes. The apex court underscored that although the government claimed that it had infused new currency worth Rs 5 lakh crore into the system, the ground reality was that people were not able to get even the promised Rs 24,000 per week. Responding to questions from a bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi said certain bank officials were diverting the money. ""Bank managers had done this fraud.... The Government of India can't sit in every bank and monitor. We are having raids every day."" The submission invited a repartee from Justice Thakur and triggered titters in the courtroom: ""So your Rs 5 lakh crore has gone this way. You are not able to secure it?"" When the attorney-general contended that there had been no complaint or protests from the common man on withdrawal of exemptions, Justice Thakur asked: ""You expect all people to come here? Please tell us what is your apprehension? What is wrong in exempting government hospitals? How can it be misused in government hospitals?"""

The riots had shattered the equations between the Jat and Muslim community in the area, a combined vote base that his party traditionally depended on.He said he had tried for this kind of consolidation of erstwhile socialists or members of the Janata Parivar to bring farmers interests back to the forefront of politics, but it had not been possible.We did try to bring together former socialists of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, at least for a rally and even that did not happen. You will have to ask [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam Singh why he didnt come for the rally on October 12, he said.Mr. Singhs party had organised a Kisan Swabhiman rally on October 12 and many members of the erstwhile socialist block had participated in it with Mr. Mulayam Singh being conspicuous by his absence.Mr. Singh has entered into an alliance with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (U) for the U.P. elections.Why scrap import duty?Mr. Singh said the removal of import duty on wheat, coming as it does on the back of expectations of a bumper crop domestically this year (after two years of drought) does not make sense.The imported wheat will be hitting our markets just as procurement will start here. I dont understand the logic unless it is to make sure our farmers dont recover their costs, leave alone make profits, he said. According to him, even in the case of paddy, the situation was dire. While the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is Rs. 1470, the real price offered is around Rs. 800-900 with the Uttar Pradesh government not having set up even purchase centres for paddy.Markets in distressDemonetisation had rung the death knell for vegetable farmers as the largely cash-based supply chain to mandis and retail outlets was shattered, he said.Vegetable farmers, potato farmers are in deep distress. The Central government has no understanding of the rural economy. The importance that the agricultural sector has not just in food production but also in ensuring buoyancy in rural demand and economy in general is not being understood by Delhi.Much of rural demand depends on what a farmer earns in the harvest season, and these policies have jeopardised that, Mr. Ajit Singh added.We tried to bring together members of the erstwhile Janata Parivar, but it did not happen: Ajit Singh"

These are A-grade big potatoes that he usually sells at Rs 11 per kg. Had you been five days early, he said, you would have got cauliflower and brinjals too - for free.So what's the catch? Sadly for Prasad, the offer is as unconditional as it is tragic.Like many other farmers here, in the potato belt of Uttar Pradesh that starts near Mathura, about 150 km from Delhi, Prasad has little choice. He can either abandon his crop at cold storages or plough it into the ground as cash appears to have vanished from the market ever since the government on November 8 announced withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as legal tender, rendering invalid 86% of India's currency.A rich crop of potatoes is dumped along the roadside and sacks of potatoes abandoned outside cold storages in the potato belt as farmers are not finding buyers in the mandis.Even if there are some buyers, the rates have crashed, making it uneconomical for the farmers to pay transportation costs and take potatoes to the mandis.Kunwar Raghavendra Singh, former zila panchayat member in Raya, said the farmer is getting a rate of Re 1 per kg.Every year, farmers sow potatoes between October 20 and 30. When the new crop is ready around January end, they sell roughly 20% of the produce in February and the rest is sent to cold storages to be released slowly when the rates get higher.The rates average around Rs 600-800 per katta (a bag of 52 kg). The farmer pays Rs 100 to the cold storage owner for storing his crop. So he gets Rs 11-15 per kg. Prasad, a resident of Sesu Nangla village in Raya, had kept 132 bags in Mansarovar cold storage on Mathura-Aligarh road. ""I am getting no rate right now. For my potatoes I was getting Rs 8 per kg before 'notebandi'.But now it is useless. I have to pay Rs 105 per bag to the cold storage person and then add to it transportation costs. What I would get is just Re 1 per kg in a mandi,"" he said.So Prasad is now selling potatoes to gowshalas. He is getting a measly Rs 50 per bag of 52 kg. ""Rest I will distribute for free in the village,"" he said.Just like Prasad, Nekram of Nagla Amrua village had kept 515 bags of potatoes in Brijwasi cold storage at Raya on Mathura-Aligarh road. He hasn't gone back to claim them. ""I would have to pay the cold storage person for something I cannot sell.What is the point?"" he said. The potato belt supplies to big markets in Jaipur, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Kanpur and Lucknow. With the markets running out of cash, the potatoes are useless.In Sadabad on Mathura-Aligarh road, cold storages have been saddled with thousands of unclaimed potato bags. Pradeep Kumar Singh, owner of Om Sheetgrah , said, ""I have about 5,000 potato bags lying unclaimed. These are farmers who owe me money from before. But what do I do? Everybody is in distress.""The cold storages are shut down mid-November for annual maintenance. Singh ran his facility for an extra month so that he could help the farmers already in distress due to demonetisation But now he has had to dump all the bags outside the cold storage. ""We have dug up a huge pit on the cold storage grounds to dump the produce,"" he said.Just a few kilometres from Singh's cold storage in Khandauli block, farmers have been ploughing their produce in the ground. ""What do we do? We carry these potatoes and vegetables to the market to find no buyers.Even transporting and loading them needs labourers. It is additional cost. We use what we can,"" said Moni Singh of Kharwa village. His neighbour let his cattle out to graze on the dumped vegetables and then ploughed the remaining into the field. ""What else? They are useless,"" he said.Prominent farmer leader and Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti national president Pushpendra Chaudhary said, ""The potato farmers have been ruined for the next two years. The markets would not recover even for the sale of rabi crop. The Modi government should at least write off loans of farmers."""

Liquidity crunch and fresh supply of potato from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have changed the game altogether. The wholesale price of Jyoti variety of potato crashed to Rs 2-3 per kg at markets closed to cold storages across Bengal. However, the crash has a little impact on the retail markets in the city.This year saw the least potato production  9 million tonne  in Bengal compared to earlier years. So, many farmers and middlemen calculated a good price if they managed to hoard a substantial amount of potato. A section of farmers, middlemen and cold-storage owners fudged this year's actual storage to jack up the price. So, when the actual storage was 6.5 million tonnes across 462 potato cold storages in Bengal, it was shown only 3 million tonne. This led to abnormal rise of potato price in both wholesale and retail markets.Potato economy of Bengal is always erratic. It is one of the most risky farming bets. With a contribution of 25% in India's potato output, Bengal is the second-largest producer of the vegetable after UP. ""A section of middlemen and traders speculate the probable price of potato every year, keeping in mind the production of potato and its price in previous years. But things often go haywire when ground reality changes,"" said Shankar Adhikari , an agriculture economist.November 30 was the last date for clearing entire stock. But government found a huge stockpile of potato in the cold storages. Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta extended the last date of clearing the stock till December 8. But even after that the government found a huge stock uncleared. Now that section of farmers and middlemen find it difficult to withdraw the stock from cold storages as the cost overshoots the wholesale price.Paschimbanga Potato Traders Association president Swapan Samanta said: ""Liquidity crunch along with fresh supply of low-cost potato from Punjab has changed the game. Bengal potato now has hardly any buyer. The potato retail price now should be below Rs 8 in Kolkata's retail markets."" Traders are jostling to sell before the new crop arrives in December end, failing which the old one must be destroyed."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."

The prices are as low as Rs. 200 for a 50-kg bag in the citys wholesale markets. Staff Reporter"
