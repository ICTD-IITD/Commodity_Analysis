Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: Production of horticulture crops like vegetables and fruits is likely to touch a record 305.4 million tonnes (mt) in 2017-18, about 1.6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the previous five years average, the agriculture ministry said in its first advance estimates released on Tuesday.The final estimates for 2016-17 released alongside showed that production of these perishable crops was 300.6 mt, a year-on-year rise of over 5%.Within horticulture, production of vegetables is estimated at 181 mt in 2017-18, about 1% higher than the year before, while that of fruits is estimated at 95 mt, 2% higher than the previous year.Data showed that during the year, area under different perishable crops stood at 24.9 million hectares, about 0.3% higher than the year before. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, productivity of horticulture crops rose from 11.7 tonnes per hectare to an estimated 12.3 tonnes per hectare.Disaggregated data on estimates of production of specific crops showed onions at 21.4 mt, about 4.5% lower than the year before, and potatoes at 49.3 mt, marginally higher than the 48.6 mt in 2016-17. Production of tomatoes is estimated to rise 7.7% year-on-year in 2017-18 to 22.3 mt, showed the data.The record production during 2017-18 will mark the sixth straight year of horticulture production outstripping that of foodgrains (estimated at 276mt in 2016-17), suggesting a structural change in Indian agriculture where farmers are increasingly growing perishable commercial crops due to a growing market and a quicker cash flow as these crops require less time from sowing to marketing.However, price volatility continues to be a major risk in horticulture, with prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes plunging below growing costs several times last year. While farmers in Madhya Pradesh were forced to sell onions as low as Rs2 per kg in June last year, in northern India, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were forced to dump their potato crop for want of buyers around the same time.Retail and wholesale prices of perishables are also at a large variance from each other, implying fragmented markets and poor cold chain facilities. For instance, while tomatoes are currently selling for as low as Rs2-4 per kg in wholesale markets in Andhra Pradesh, they are retailing at Rs35 per kg in Delhi."

The BJP is the biggest party in the country with crores of members. Had each member of the party either weaved or provided a sweater each, then none of the children would have been without sweaters, he said.The BJP and the SP had engaged in a war of words over the state governments delay in distributing pullovers to 1.54 crore students of state-run primary and upper primary schools (up to class 8).

What happened to that?On the issue of saffron paint on UP Haj Committee offices boundary wall in Lucknow, the SP leader took a dig at the BJP, saying they turned jittery and overnight restored the original cream colour.The government should concentrate on changing the heart of people by doing development and welfare works than changing the colours of buildings, he said.When asked to respond on SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavs comment that he will contest Lok Sabha polls from his original Mainpuri seat, Akhilesh said: He will contest the polls from whichever seat he wishes to. Entire party and I will rally behind him and for him to win.Mulayam had contested Mainpuri and Azamgarh seats in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He won both, but vacated Mainpuri to let his grand-nephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav contest and win it.I know from where Tej Pratap will contest in that case, he said."

So far no farmers group has claimed responsibility for this act. This seems to be the work of antisocial elements... We are probing all possible angles, said Lucknow District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma.He added that the potatoes were thrown on Vidhan Sabha Marg, near VVIP guest house and near the 1090 Crossing. The roads were then cleaned by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation.Pre-planned actToday it is the potato farmers who have thrown potatoes on the streets of Lucknow, tomorrow it may be the sugarcane farmers, the wheat and paddy farmers if the situation does not improve, said Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit.State Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi called it a pre-planned act. The potatoes which were thrown were partly or completely rotten and rejected in the mandi (market). It is a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the Yogi Adityanath government, he said."

Three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on charges of negligence after the incident.Lucknow district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said potatoes were thrown from a truck but they were yet to ascertain who was responsible for the act. So far, no farmers' group has claimed responsibility.In Meerut, however, CM Aditya Nath Yogi said his was the first government to announce a minimum support price (MSP) for potatoes.

Why is the government not regulating the price?He also took a dig at the government for regulation of price even for people who get it for Rs 15-20 per kg despite an excessive produce.We will sit on an indefinite strike if the prices are not regulated; not only of potato but also sugarcane and other vegetables, said Verma.Uttar Pradesh agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi told reporters that the present state government was committed to the welfare of farmers, especially potato growers.

The plan never took shape.In 2015, then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had announced at a programme that least one vodka brewing factory would be set up in Kannauj and Farukkhabad districts each, which will ensure remunerative prices to farmers.While Akhilesh has represented Kannauj in Lok Sabha for two terms, his wife Dimple Yadav is serving her second term from the same constituency. Kannauj is part of UPs potato belt, along with Farrukahabad, Etawah, Mainpuri and Aligarh, stretching up to Meerut.With 31% production, UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and more than 8 lakh farmers plant potato every year, with production increasing every year.UP produces nearly 46 lakh million tonnes of potato a year in nearly 5 lakh hectares of area. Farmers, however, have no other platform except local mandis to sell their produce and trade some portion outside the state.Demonetisation and souring relationship with Pakistan have further dealt a blow to potato growers who were earlier able to get cash in hand by trading it off to other states and Pakistan.Unlike the adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana and far off Gujarat and Maharashstra, Uttar Pradesh does not have major food processing units to process.This leads to distress selling by growers in local markets at low prices and frequently dump produce on streets in anguish.Official records of the horticulture department reveal that the food processing industry in Uttar Pradesh is at the bottom as compared to any other state.While potato prices have touched an all-time low in the past two years, there was none to educate farmers to shift to other cash crops.Glut in the market in the past two years has resulted in farmers getting into distress, said RK Singh, senior scientist at Central Institute of Potato Research, Shimla.Farm crisis would not be solved unless the state government makes efforts for a food processing industry. Unfortunately, it has not developed in the state, said SK Shukla, principal scientist at the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture in Lucknow.Potato growers keep their produce dumped in cold storages for months as they cannot even afford the rent.If we collect the potato from cold storage and take it to the market, it would cost us Rs 30 a kg while potato is already available at Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kg in the market. This does not make economic sense, said Naresh Dixit, a regular potato grower in Unnao."

Bringing up the issue of 'saffronisation' of state buildings, Akhilesh said the BJP took a U-turn by repainting haj house walls after giving it a saffron cover.

""He is a victim of BJP conspiracy,"" he said. He also condemned the BJP government for charging toll tax on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.Mounting a vitriolic attack on the BJP government, Akhilesh said, ""Starving farmers are committing suicide but are being gagged by the administration on the orders of the government"".Raising the issue of farmers throwing potatoes on the streets of the state capital, the SP president said that by suspending police personnel for not preventing the farmer protests, it was clear that the government was applying administrative machinery to suppress them.""I dare the government that even if it had announced MSP for potato growers, can it give data on how much was purchased by it,"" said Akhilesh, claiming that GDP figures, demonetisation and poor implementation of GST had collectively ruined the economic progress of the country leading to acute depression among the farming community and widespread unemployment.Questioning the existence of the anti-Romeo squads announced by the government, Akhilesh said criminal assaults on women and young girls had become the order of the day and the government was fooling the state in the name of anti-Romeo squads.""Where are anti-Romeo squads when girls are assaulted,"" he said. Reinforcing the political superstition that a UP chief minister who visits Noida is ousted from power, Akhilesh said it was good that both the PM and the CM had inaugurated the Noida Metro because now their departure from their positions was imminent."
5aeb24ae9855b73f522c74d5,PM Narendra Modi’s move on FDI underlines RSS faultlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pm-modis-move-on-100-fdi-in-single-brand-retail-underlines-rss-faultlines-5019924/,2018-01-11,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the BJP headquarters on Monday. (Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal) Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the BJP headquarters on Monday. (Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal)Prime Minister Narendra Modi governments decision to permit 49 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Air India and allow 100% FDI in single-brand retail with liberalized sourcing norms, may not be economically significant, but is of outsized symbolic importance because of its potential to aggravate the faultlines within the RSS Sangh Parivar.The degree of government intervention in economic activity, especially the role of foreign investment, has long been a deeply contested matter within the Sangh Parivar. The BJPs current FDI policy is best summed up by the Prime Ministers promise of red carpet, not red tape for foreign investors.The liberalization of FDI limits and easing of regulatory requirements, such as permitting greater FDI via the automatic route, the policy thrust of the Modi government has been unmistakable. The RSS economic affiliates, especially the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) and its labour union, the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), have been critical of the governments FDI liberalization policies.The SJM has vocally contested the governments assertion that FDI is a means to boost growth and generate employment. But, unlike during the Vajpayee government, a modus vivendi has been worked out between the Sanghs economic affiliates and its political arm, the BJP, to air policy differences behind closed doors rather than taking disagreements to the street.Nevertheless, yesterdays decisions could exacerbate the aforesaid faultlines because they impinge upon the Sanghs ideological verities: preferring economic interests of mom-and-pop retail stores. Throughout its history, the BJP has had a robust debate on the role of foreign investment in the economy  a debate that, until recently, lacked a counterpart within the RSS. The RSS was implacably opposed to FDI because it was perceived as inimical to traditional Indian values. The RSS believed that foreign investment would infuse into the national bloodstream culturally alien values of consumerism and sybaritic hedonism.The RSS feared that an economy dominated by impersonal market forces would undermine local economic activity which, it believed, was key to sustain bonds of family and community. The SJM was established in 1991 as a response to former prime minister and Congress leader P V Narasimha Raos reforms to advocate for economic self-sufficiency because the Sangh feared that greater foreign investment would lead to a ceding of economic sovereignty to multinationals. The second coming of the East India Company was a common trope used in SJMs arguments justifying investment protectionism. Because small traders and North Indian trading communities were the core of RSS support base, the opposition of FDI in retail was an ideological totem for the Sangh.The rapid expansion of the Sangh has changed its social composition. Most of the new entrants into the RSS are urban professionals or members of upwardly mobile social groups. The new joiners do not share SJMs autarkic or statist proclivities. The younger members of the RSS are more accepting of foreign investment and recognize FDIs criticality in a resource-constrained economy.Also Read | Modi opens up FDI before he meets Trump at Davos, but has the show already moved to China?Moreover, the political needs of the BJP, especially the imperatives of employment generation for sustained electoral success, also moderated the RSS stance on FDI. Younger BJP leaders with RSS provenance  Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis or Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, for example  have been enthusiastic supporters of greater foreign investment.Unlike during the time of former RSS chief or Sarsanghachalak K S Sudarshan (2000-2009), the current RSS leadership rarely delivers rhetorical broadsides against FDI. Signaling a reevaluation of the RSS stance on FDI and economic liberalization, the current Sarsanghachalak, Mohan Bhagwat, had contended in November 2013 that the organization was not bound by dogma and was willing to change with the times.The softening of the RSS once implacable opposition to FDI created a faultline between pragmatists and traditionalists within the RSS, and exacerbated disagreements between the BJP and RSS economic affiliates.Notwithstanding a greater acceptance of FDI, the RSS remains firm in its opposition to FDI in retail, especially multi-brand retail. Apart from hurting the economic interests of a key part of its support base, that is North Indian trading communities, the RSS believes that undermining the economic viability of small traders would be inegalitarian.The RSS prefers small trading businesses because it believes that these enterprises treat employees as an extension of the owners family (jajman), and a concern of employee welfare is at par with pecuniary considerations. To be sure, the tweaks to the Modi governments policy in retail announced yesterday are relatively minor. Earlier 100% foreign investment in single-brand retail was already permitted, albeit with government approval for increasing stake beyond 49%. Now, government approval will no longer be needed as all 100% FDI in single-brand retail will be cleared automatically.Similarly, allowing 49% FDI in Air India could hasten its privatization  a hot potato the Modi government had been careful to avoid in its first three years. Privatization had long been a sticking point within the BJP and the Sangh Parivar.Ram Naik, the current governor of Uttar Pradesh and Petroleum Minister during the regime of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, had reportedly resisted Vajpayees attempts to privatize public sector oil companies. In fact, Dattopant Thengadi, an influential Sangh ideologue and the founder of the SJM, had termed Vajpayee governments move to privatize BALCO as anti-national.Certainly, the battle isnt over yet. As the privatization of Air India neared fruition over the last several months, the BMS warned the government of a major confrontation. Air Indias privatization, especially to a partly foreign-owned entity, will be vehemently opposed by it and the SJM, because these issues have been an ideological totem for the RSS.Perhaps Prime Minister Modis decision to open up FDI could deepen faultlines over economic issues within the RSS and among its affiliates. But it is certainly a manifestation of the PMs determination to push through another liberal economic reform in the face of rising demands for a shift in governments focus to alleviating economic discontents. Does this mean that the PM has taken this decision with the support of the RSS highest decision-making body?The answer to that question could make the politics of the BJP-RSS clearer as the Modi government moves to present its last full Budget before elections are held just over a year from now.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav)RULING OUT that farmers were behind potatoes being dumped on Lucknow roads on January 6, the police on Saturday arrested two persons and booked six others, including two Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav went on to rebuke the state police, saying he would honour Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar with Yash Bharti award for this achievement when his party came to power. On Saturday, the SSP said that while Kannauj residents Ankit Singh and Santosh Pal were arrested on Friday, Shivendra Singh, Deependra Singh, Sandeep Yadav, Sanju Katiyar, Pradeep Singh and Jai Kumar Tiwari were booked on the charge of mischief by injury to public road.He added that Shivendra Singh and Jai Kumar Tiwari are SP leaders. Barring Santosh Pal  who drove the truck that dumped the potatoes  all were friends, said the SSP. Calling it an act of political conspiracy, Kumar said Shivendra had unsuccessfully contested the recent urban local body polls for the post of nagar panchayat chairman in Kannaujs Tirwa area on an SP ticket. Jai Kumar, too, contested for the chairmans post for municipal board from Kannauj on an SP ticket. Another accused, Sanju, is the husband of Shilpi Katiyar, who had won the zila panchayat chairperson election on a SP ticket from Kannauj.With the help of CCTV footage, we arrested Ankit Singh and Santosh Pal, said the SSP. He claimed that while Shivendra and Sanju purchased the potatoes from a cold storage in Kannaujs Thathia area, Sandeep hired Santosh and arranged two SUVs. Deependra, Pradeep and Jai Kumar helped load the potatoes in the truck, he added.They reached Lucknow in the SUVs early January 6 and followed the truck, which started throwing potatoes from the 1090 crossing on Lohia Path they covered areas near the VVIP guesthouse and the Raj Bhavan crossing the last consignment was dumped outside the Vidhan Sabha building, Kumar added.Later in the day, Akhilesh took on the SSP, saying: The SSP should better concentrate on law and order and arrest criminals I will give Yash Bharti to SSP for this achievement (of arrest).He added: Jis tareeke se sarkar ka ravaiyya hai us se kanoon vyavastha nahi theek hone wali jinhe kanoon vyavastha dekhna hai wo aaloo ki vyavastha dekh rahe hain Jinhe kanoon vyavastha sambhalna hai wo apne aaloo liye ghoom rahe hain ke humne aaloo ke kisano ko pakad liya (Such attitude of the government will not improve the law and order situation those who have to look after law and order, they are busy in handling the potato business they are roaming around with potatoes and claiming that they have arrested the potato farmers).Akhilesh claimed that even if those responsible for the protest did contest elections on SP tickets, there is nothing wrong in it, as they are raising the voice of potato farmers. He added that he will ask SP leaders to fill gunny bags with potatoes and gift the same to all district magistrates on January 27.

Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: The extreme weather has claimed its first casualty: the potato.Farmers on the fringes of the state capital say low temperatures have ruined more than half of their crops and a supply crisis was imminent in city markets, which by default will jack up prices of the otherwise humble vegetable.Deepak Mahto, an elderly farmer from Boreya, said they often brought stocks from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to bridge the demand-supply gap and ensure price stability, but the yield in the neighbouring states had suffered as much as in Jharkhand.Kishwar Sahu, who owns a few fertile decimals of land in Chandaghasi, near Birsa Munda Airport, said the plummeting Celsius had reduced his potato production to one-eighth of last year's crop.""Every year, I sow potato in four decimal land and the yield is at least 400kg. This time, I am not expecting more than 50kg. The numbing cold at harvest time is pure bad news. We also have smaller sized potatoes this year,"" he said.Arun Sahu, a resident of Argora, echoed him. ""I do not depend on farming for a living, but I do sow potato in a small plot on my premises. The cold has taken a heavy toll on the crop this time.""Director of research D.N. Singh at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke, where the Celsius notched the freezing point for two consecutive days last week, said the potato needed moderate temperature (10-25 degree Celsius) for proper growth. ""But, the past fortnight has been unnaturally cold even by Ranchi's standard. No wonder the crop yield has suffered,"" Singh said.Director of horticulture Rajiw Kumar, however, said it was too early to anticipate a hike in potato prices owing to low production.""Around 7 lakh metric tonnes of potato is produced in Jharkhand against the average annual requirement of 16 lakh metric tonnes. We depend on supply from Bengal and Uttar Pradesh too. Let me study district-wise yield reports and access production data from neighbouring states before I can comment on prices,"" he said, but conceded that extreme cold had a negative impact on potato production, especially in the absence of proper irrigation.A potato vendor in the city, Bablu Kumar, said currently, the price of a kilo ranged between Rs 8 and Rs 14. ""Now, that is because old stocks are still available. Once that is exhausted, the price will rise because as far as I know crops in Bengal and UP have suffered too,"" he summed it up."

Whether it is pertaining to the Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of people or giving a remunerative price to the farmers or construction of roads..., Gandhi said at a public meeting in Salon.He was referring to Modis poll promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every citizen by cracking down on black money, if voted to power.He alleged that a step-motherly treatment was being meted out to Rae Bareli, his mother, Sonia Gandhis parliamentary constituency, and Amethi. He promised to restore the mega food park in Rae Bareli and other development projects once Congress was voted back to power.Farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce.

Ninety per cent universities in Gujarat are in private hands. A youth told me that students need to pay Rs 15 lakh to get admission there. he said.POSTER WARA poster war seems to have erupted ahead of Congress chief visit.

Samajwadi Party didnt work for farmers, but the BJP is doing the job.The PM is working hard to double the income of the farmers by 2022 and the farmers loans were waived and under various projects crores of rupees are being made available for seed and agriculture machine purchase, Mr. Shahi said.Because of the hard work done by the BJP, other parties are getting depressed, he said."
5b2d80ff9855b723c6f46a32,Potato portents,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/crop-prices-modi-government-indian-farmers-potato-rates-5035179/,2018-01-23,"The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Farmers are habitually great raconteurs. My grandfather would often narrate an episode, when he encountered a farmer sitting by a heap of potatoes in the middle of the night. On investigating what compelled the farmer to guard potatoes when there were no buyers, he was astonished to learn that the farmer was, in fact, keeping a watch to deter anyone from dumping their unsold spuds in his field. This 40-year-old episode got a rerun recently when farmers dumped their unsold produce in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home and office in Lucknow.The genesis of the potato crises in Lucknow, however, is more recent. In June 2014, soon after the BJP won a stunning mandate in the general elections, one of the first acts of the Union government was to rein in the price of potatoes (refer to my article, Making a hash of it, IE, July 5, 2014) by imposing a minimum export price (MEP), which was followed by bringing potatoes under the essential commodities Act (ECA) and permitting duty-free imports even though imports carried the risk of new diseases. Farmers were harassed and cold stores raided. The euphoria of the electoral victory celebrations drowned out the farmers sorrow. Farmers took home meagre profits, substantially less than they could have easily made. The presumptive loss to 50 lakh potato farmers on a very conservative basis was Rs 30,000 crore (total production 42 million tonnes X R.7/kg, the subdued price) amounting to Rs 60,000 per potato farmer.Profits from the previous harvest usually determine the acreage under sowing for the next season. Consequently, in the following year, India had a bumper crop of 48 million tonnes of potato in 2015 and prices crashed to Rs 2.75/kg. The government ignored the plight of farmers who subsequently failed to even recover the cost of sowing.2016 was a normal crop year in India, with 44 million tonnes of potato production. Without credible data, fearing inflation, the government overreacted and again imposed MEP. Without access to international markets, the prices faltered. Unfortunately, demonetisation in November that year made matters worse. The presumptive loss of Rs 22,000 crore (Rs 5/kg) was incurred by farmers, amounting to an average loss of Rs 44,000 per potato farmer for 2016 year alone. Our export restrictions were a bonanza for farmers in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Importers seek reliable business partners and India has become an unreliable supplier due to arbitrary policy decisions. Our produce now sells at a substantial discount compared to our neighbours.In 2017, due to the relatively firmer prices of 2016 and boosted by good weather, farmers produced 48 million tonnes of potato and prices literally crashed through the basement. When, even after 10 months of storage, prices were hovering between 50 paisa to Rs 2/kg, farmers completely lost hope. The cost of growing potatoes being Rs 6.50/kg and the additional cost of storage is Rs 2.50/kg, it became infeasible to even reclaim stocks from cold storages and potatoes were strewn in Lucknow and elsewhere.Do the farmers math: In two of the four years of the Modi government, when an opportunity arose to double farm incomes, the governments inflation targeting strategy kicked in and each potato farmer lost approximately Rs 1,04,000. The loss incurred by a farmer in just two crop seasons is more than the debt waiver announced by the government of Uttar Pradesh. There is no denying that controlling food inflation has to be a priority. I confess, as a potato farmer, I have a vested interest in the issue but it is this experience that gives me insight. Our demand is fair and simple: Should the government intervene to subdue potato prices in a bad crop year, it is morally bound to give a minimum support price of Rs 9/kg in excess production year. Logically, a farmer allowed to make money in one year, would be better prepared to bear the losses on the farm in the next. If not, the farmer gets into a perpetual debt cycle and is compelled to seek financial sops. Consequently, most farmer organisations are content to limiting themselves to what the farmer understands  farm loan waiver and venture no further into the policymaking quagmire.In 2018, the planting is lower by a mere five per cent, and potato prices are expected to be remunerative. But historical data indicates that a short-sighted government may respond by imposing MEP/ECA. The solutions to the farm crises arent limited to budget allocations but rooted in a system where interventions to control food inflation are not harmonised with crop-price compensation. As far as the farmer livelihoods are concerned, state governments and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare are becoming less relevant, as decisions of the Ministry of Food, Public Distribution & Consumer Affairs are demolishing the prime ministers grand plan for doubling farmer incomes.Farmers are demoralised. The promised sab ka saath sab ka vikas rings hollow, because its starkly evident that the government has decided to focus on the urban vote bank as a part of the strategy to win the parliamentary elections in 2019. About 50 per cent of the population is financially dependent directly on agriculture, but religious, caste and ever-changing narratives divide farmers across villages to the extent that farmers arent considered a political force to be reckoned with any more. The Opposition is in an equally sad state, without a farmer face to galvanise the community. Nevertheless, farmers could change fortunes in the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, allowing the Opposition to bask in the farmers misery.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

He wont. There is no point in asking for his resignation when people are not getting justice, he said.Akhilesh said Adityanath had famously said that pradesh ke apradhi pradesh chhod ke bahar chaley jaayein (Criminals in UP now must leave the state and go elsewhere). What happened to this warning that Yogi had been issuing? he asked.He said there was no place in the state that is untouched by gory crimes. Robberies have been reported from the outskirts of Lucknow, an SP worker was beheaded in Azamgarh and incidents of crimes are happening unchecked in Meerut, Chitrakoot, and Varanasi.Investors will be terribly scared of coming to UP to invest. Let us see how he (Adityanath) eradicates that fear now, he said.Akhilesh was referring to the forthcoming UP Investors Summit scheduled on February 21 and 22 for which Adityanath and his colleagues have held roadshows in Mumbai and Hyderabad to make it a big draw.The Samajwadi Party leader accused the Bharatiya Janata Party government of posting officers who he said were engaged in pleasing their political masters instead of deploying good officers on important posts.The BJPs leaders should recall their statements during the 2017 polls. They went around saying that police stations were being run by Samajwadis. Now, I ask who are running the police stations, Akhilesh said.Akhilesh said the government had made tall claims that encounters would improve the law and order situation in the state but instead of bringing about any change, questions are being raised about the extra-judicial killings by the police.According to reports, 28 criminals have been killed in nearly 940 encounters till January 9 and about 3,900 have been arrested across the state since Adityanath assumed office on March 19 last year.Akhilesh also accused the activists of the BJP of the violent protests against Bollywood period drama Padmaavat."

Before we start the agitation against the state government, which has been a complete failure on all aspects be it law and order or protecting the interests of farmers, youth or women  we have to ensure that our units are well prepared.

Thus, senior leaders will spend the entire day in these interactions. We will give chances to not only district or city presidents, but also one representative from each block to speak and share problems, said Babbar, adding that the message would be to go to the people and raise their issues.Sources in the party said the aim of these meetings is also to finish grass-root level differences and ask workers and office-bearers to prepare for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Akhilesh asked.When some potato farmers who suffered losses dumped their produce in Lucknow, police tracked 10,000 phone calls. (When) I asked police to check phone towers (in Kakori) and find out who made the calls and in which direction the dacoits escaped, police were busy pleasing BJP leaders, he further said.

Yet, prices crashed, 8,007 farmers committed suicide in 2015, unpaid agricultural loans rose 20 per cent between 2016 and 2017, and 600 million Indians who depend on agriculture are struggling to get by.This is the situation that faces the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as it heads into its last full budget before general elections in 2019, at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised doubling of farm incomes by 2022.The agriculture sector will not just watch how much money is set aside in the 2018-19 budget but also how it is used, as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) also tries to woo disaffected farmers before upcoming Assembly elections in eight states  Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura.Agriculture is the governments top priority, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on January 15, 2018, admitting that farmers were not getting the right price for their produce. That is an acknowledgement that record harvests and government spending are not significantly improving Indias agricultural crisis.Record harvest, falling incomeIndia has seen a decline in the proportion of cultivators  as the census calls farmers who own or rent land  from 50 per cent in 1951 to 24 per cent in 2011, as IndiaSpend reported on August 8, 2014. Yet, nearly half of Indias population, or about 600 million people, still depend on agriculture.India harvested a record 276 million tonnes  all-time highs were reported for rice, wheat, pulses, tur (pigeon pea), urad (black gram) and coarse cereals  4.01 per cent higher than the previous record in 2013-14, according to the fourth advance estimates for the rabi (winter) and kharif (monsoon) crops for 2016-17.Similarly, horticulture output was a record, nearly 300 million tonnes, or 4.8 per cent more than 2015-16, with potatoes  now experiencing a glut, leading to unrest among potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh  recording an 11 per cent rise over the previous year.Over a decade ending 2014-15, Indias agriculture sector grew at 4 per annum compared to 2.6 per annum the previous decade, according to the 2017 Dalwai Committee report that explored how farm incomes could be doubled, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in 2016and IndiaSpend reported on March 30, 2016, as being unlikely.An indicator of growing problems in Indias agricultural economy is a drop in the growth of gross value added (GVA)  a measure of income to farmers before their produce is sold  to 2.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent the previous year, according to the first advance estimates of national income 2017-18.The slowdown could be witnessed in Indias agricultural exports, which dipped to Rs 2.1 lakh crore, after growing more than five times over a decade ending 2014, while agricultural imports grew five times over the decade to 2015-16, Down To Earth reported on January 11, 2018.An agricultural slowdown has evident political implications: 49 per cent of landowning farmers voted for the BJP in 2014, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. A reminder came in December 2017 from Gujarat, where the BJP won by the narrowest margin in 22 years, winning fewer rural seats (43) than the Congress (62).Further evidence of farm distress is evident in rising agricultural loan defaults, loan waivers by state governments and farm suicides.Defaults, distress & suicidesAlongside record foodgrain and horticultural output in 2016-17, many Indian states were swept by farm agitations demanding higher prices for their produce from government and farm-loans waivers.One example is tur dal. After the monsoon of 2017, imports and a record harvest caused a glut that led to a fall in minimum support price (MSP)  the price at which the government purchases crops from farmers leading to unrest and stress in rural Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Gujarat, IndiaSpend reported on June 8, 2017.A similar glut in potatoes crashed prices in Uttar Pradesh (UP), prompting farmers to dump produce on roads statewide, The Hindu reported on January 13, 2018. Such situations spur agrarian unrest. India witnessed an almost eight-fold increase in agrarian riots between 2014 and 2016, Mint reported on December 20, 2017. In July 2017, five farmers were killed in police firing during a protest seeking farm-loan waivers and higher produce prices, the Hindustan Times reported on July 17, 2017.As distress grew, so did farmer suicides, which increased 42 per cent in 2015 over the previous year, IndiaSpend reported on January 2, 2017. Indebtedness was a major reason for farmer suicides. Nearly four in ten of 8,007 Indian farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were in debt, compared to two in ten in 2014; more rural households went into debt over 11 years; and the average rural household had borrowed Rs 1.03 lakh, according to a January 2018 IndiaSpend analysis of government data.Nearly 70 per cent of Indias 90 million agricultural households spend more than they earn on average each month, IndiaSpend reported on June 21, 2017.In 2017, with farmers in eight states demanding loan waivers, Indias potential cumulative loan waiver was Rs 3.1 lakh crore ($49.1 billion), or 2.6 per cent of Indias gross domestic product in 2016-17, almost equal to Indias defence budget of Rs 3.6 lakh crore ($53.5 billion) for 2017-18.The loan write-offs caused non-performing assets (NPA)  or bad debts  related to agriculture to increase three-fold over three years to 2012-13, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the government.A major reason for persistent farm distress and the debt-and-death cycle is that 52 per cent of Indias farms depends on increasingly erratic monsoon rains.Despite normal monsoon, 8 states drought-affectedAlthough 2017 was classified as a normal monsoon, eight states were declared drought-affected, The Economic Times reported on April 6, 2017, revealing the vulnerability of Indias farms to uncertain rainfall in an era of climate change. Despite spending Rs 3.51 lakh croreequivalent to the farm-loan waivers demanded in 2017over 67 years, no more than 48 per cent of nearly 201 million hectares of farmland is irrigated.The government intended to invest about Rs 50,000 crore over five years to 2019-20 through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojanathe Prime Ministers Irrigation Programmeto reach its target of water for every farm.But the programme was modified to revive 99 moribund small and medium irrigation projects in 2016-17, Down to Earth reported on January 19, 2018.As production rises, so will the demand for water for irrigation, estimated to grow from 910 billion cubic meter in 2015 to 1,072 billion cubic meter in 2050. Irrigation requires more water than drinking water, industry and energy needs. Over a decade to 2011, water available per capita fell 15 per cent, IndiaSpend reported on August 2, 2017.Without a long-term budgetary plan, planning for sustainable groundwater management and conjunctive use using ground and surface water  India will face a water shortage.As the water crisis grows, programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Programme  started in 2016 to insure farmers and provide financial support after natural calamities, pest or disease outbreaks, could be redundant.As excessive extraction of groundwater makes water scarce for agriculture, it may be outside the ambit of schemes like PMFBY to provide farmers insurance against crop failure.There is a need to ensure that farm production is linked to various markets for farmers to recover full value of the quantity produced. This will incentivise the farmer to adopt improved farm technology and management practices for higher productivity, according to the Dalwai Committee report. This requires better storage and warehousing facilities.Better storage will reduce foodgrain wastageAbout 60,000 tonnes of foodgrain was wasted between 2011-16 in warehouses run by the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI). This means the grain either rots or is eaten by rodents and other animals.FCI stocks classified as damaged dropped from 18,847 tonnes to 8,776 tonnes over two years to 2016-17, according to this August 8, 2017, government response to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. That is still 731 truckloads  using a 12-tonne truck  of wasted foodgrain every year.Indias cold-storage capacity for fruits and vegetables increased by 8 per cent to 346 lakh metric tonnes over three years to 2017. This should allow farmers to reduce time to market and ensure better quality.(Paliath is an analyst with IndiaSpend, a data-driven, public-interest journalism non-profit)"
5b16cb3e9855b75cf6a8f09a,In Lucknow  a crop crisis of plenty,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-lucknow-a-crop-crisis-of-plenty/article22539233.ece,2018-01-28,"Potato farmers in Uttar Pradesh have a twin crisis on their hands  they brought in a record production of the crop but that has led to a slump in rates.What happened?On January 6, several quintals of potatoes were found strewn outside the Uttar Pradesh Assembly as well as near the Chief Ministers residence, in what appeared to be a mark of protest by distressed farmers. The BJP government dismissed the incident as a politically motivated conspiracy and filed an FIR against unknown persons. It also suspended five policemen for negligence. A few days later, the police arrested two persons linked to the Samajwadi Party from Kannauj on charges of conspiracy. However, the entire fiasco brought the much-needed focus on the dilemma faced by potato farmers.Why have prices fallen?Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of potatoes in the country and in the 2016-17 season, it broke the previous records, growing 155 lakh metric tonnes. A record 120 lakh tonnes was also stored in the 1,708 cold storages in the State. But rather than bringing cheer, the bumper crop led to a fall in prices. The newly elected Yogi Adityanath government stepped in to launch a market intervention scheme in April, under which one lakh tonnes of potatoes would be purchased from growers at the minimum support price of Rs. 487 a quintal. However, farmers are not satisfied.What are the problems?The grievances of farmers revolve around high input costs and low and unpredictable rates.First, farmers say the minimum support rate set by the government is too low; the cost of growing a quintal of potato, including expenditure on transport and cold storage rent, comes up to Rs. 800-900. They are demanding that the minimum support price be increased to Rs. 1,000. Second, farmers claim the government did not actively purchase their produce as promised. Even in cases where the State purchased the potatoes, the farmers complained that the purpose was counter-productive due to the grading system, under which only the best quality was selected by government agencies. The bulk of average-poor quality potatoes was left with the farmers, who had the option of selling it in the market and dumping the rest in cold storages. Horticulture Department Director S.K. Joshi, however, says the State purchased 12,937 tonnes from farmers during April-May, causing the market price to increase by Rs. 100 a quintal.Where to store the excess?The new produce from 2017 is already in the market even as cold storages are still flush with last years yield. Already bearing the loss of the input costs, farmers are faced with the dilemma of letting their produce rot in the storages or attempt to sell the old produce at throwaway prices in markets, while competing with the new potato. Many farmers chose to let their produce rot in the cold storages or threw them in their fields for cattle to eat, as the costs of transporting them to the market to sell at low prices was unfeasible. As farmers are unable to repay the cold storage rents, they too face losses as they have to incur operational costs.Authorities, however, say the potatoes being dumped by farmers are the rotting old stock, which would have been cleared from the cold storages sooner or later.What happens next?The State has sent a proposal to the Centre for purchasing 2 lakh tonnes from farmers under the market intervention scheme for the new season. Once the Centre approves the rates proposed by the State, the Horticulture Department will start buying potatoes from farmers in districts where rates are lower than the minimum support price. Last year, purchasing was done in 41 districts. Potatoes for the new season are still being dug out and the situation will be clear by February-end.OMAR RASHID"
5b1f4a119855b74cfa8ca02d,"Hiking crop MSP impractical, say UP farmers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/hiking-crop-msp-impractical-say-up-farmers/articleshow/62752911.cms,2018-02-02,"MEERUT/BAREILLY: Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday announced that the minimum support price (MSP) for notified kharif crops would be 1.5 times the cost incurred by farmers for its production. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh , however, said increasing the MSP was impractical as there was no way to calculate the exact cost of the crop. Industry associations, too, were unhappy with various provisions.National convenor of Azad Kisan Union , Rajendra Singh, said, Government says it will give one-and-a-half times the cost incurred by the farmer on his crop. But there is no way that cost can be calculated. Will it include yearly wages? Will the rent of land be included for landless farmers? If not, then this promise will be an empty one.""National spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait said, Raising MSP isnt the solution. The government needs to look into farmers basic problems. A national committee on agriculture to look into these problems is yet to see the light of day.VM Singh, national convenor of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, said, We have several doubts over the governments intention. First, raising MSP of crops was a poll promise of the BJP in the 2014 LS polls. It has come four years late? Second, there is no mention of marginal farmers who grow vegetables and suffer the most. UPs recent potato crisis is a case in example. Yashpal Malik , a farmer-leader in west UP, said it was more important to ensure that benefits reach farmers rather than raising the MSP. MSPs were increased by previous governments too. But red-tapism didnt allow farmers to sell their crops at those rates. Those leakages need to be plugged first, he said.Chairman of Meerut chapter of Indian Industries Association, Atul Gupta, said, There is no mention of simplification of GST provisions which have crippled the industry. Though the FM has announced a package of Rs 3,794 crore for credit support in the MSME sector, there is no talk on the much-needed simplification of archaic laws and tedious procedures. Is that the ease of doing business?"

He accused Modi of forcing the farmers to commit suicide because they had no option but to sell their production at low prices.""In the last four years, 12,000 farmers have committed suicide. Condition of farmers is so pathetic that their sons are not getting married because of poor finances. All of the Prime Minister's promises are nothing but jumlas,"" said Raghuvansh.The senior RJD leader also claimed that around 8,000 hand pumps are defunct in Bihar. Addressing a news meet at the RJD office in Patna, Raghuvansh said farmers earlier would get subsidy of 90 per cent for borings but that has now been brought down to 50 per cent. This has meant farmers cannot install their own borings and irrigation is hit.He also attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar over paddy procurement. ""As the government did not procure paddy, farmers had to sell their produce at very low prices. The worst affected are potato farmers who have run away after dumping it in cold storage. In states like Uttar Pradesh, farmers threw away their potatoes on the road. The crop insurance and subsidy on diesel are just promises,"" Raghuvansh said.He asked the Prime Minister that if bank loans of farmers in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were waived off why weren't Bihar farmers'.At Kisan Melas, farming machines are so expensive, Raghuvansh said, that farmers get no benefit of subsidy. So, he demanded pension for farmers on the pattern of government employees."

We will ensure that farmers get remunerative prices. This will be done by setting up additional procurement centres for wheat and paddy, said minister for agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi.A committee of ministers has also been set up to look into the problems of potato growers. Measures will soon be initiated to improve their lot on the committees recommendations. We are focusing on diversification as farmers remain mostly focused on wheat and paddy crops. An amendment to Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act is being contemplated to reach out to the farmers to get them better prices for their produce. We want to double the income of farmers by 2022, said Shahi.An action plan that NITI Ayog formulated for Uttar Pradesh also refers to the proposed agriculture sector reforms. The plan also refers to the challenge of transforming the agriculture sector, that has not grown despite claims of successive governments, by addressing issues of low growth, low productivity and low income of farmers. It asks the state government to identify reasons for decrease in canal irrigated area from 32.1 lakh hectare in 1990s to 25.5 lakh hectare now and take appropriate action.A decrease in irrigated area assumes significance as the states backward regions like Bundelkhand have witnessed drought and a number of distressed farmers have reportedly committed suicide over the years. Bundelkhand has seen 411 suicides of farmers from January 2014 to June 28, 2016, said Saheb Lal Shukla, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhupendra Singh Mann group).But a change in the UP story is perhaps now showing. If claims of the officers of the agriculture department were to be believed, the state achieved 3.5 percent growth in the agriculture sector in 2014-2015. The sector may have grown further in the following years.After its installation on March 19, 2017, the Adityanath government had announced a number of measures for welfare of farmers. These included a loan waiver scheme involving an expenditure of Rs 36,000 crore for farmers in the states annual budget for 2017-2018.Earlier, the UPA government too had taken a number of initiatives for the farmers. A debt relief scheme for farmers was implemented across India during the UPA regime. It had also introduced schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MNREGA) scheme and the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition and Resettlement Act 2013 to ensure that the farmers got better value for the land that was acquired for various development projects.."

The members were protesting against Kasganj violence and Noida encounter.However, a determined governor, facing a barrage of paper missiles and relentless slogan-shouting, read out his 38-page speech, lasting nearly 90 minutes. Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit described the oppositions behaviour as unruly and unconstitutional. Last year, on May 15, the opposition had staged a similar protest during the special session on GST and marshals had to use official files to bat away the paper balls and missiles to save the Governor and the Speaker.While reading out his speech, Naik warned the agitating legislators that they were honourable members and that their behaviour was uncivilised and being watched by the entire state. chief minister Yogi Adityanath said a handful of members had no right to hijack the functioning of the House.Opposition members protest during the address of Governor Ram Naik before the start of the budget session on ThursdayOppn will keep pointing out govts wrongdoings: AkhileshHowever, soon after the joint session, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said: The opposition will continue to discharge its constitutional responsibility and duty to point out the state governments wrongdoings.

Had we tried ordering food from Taamonline, he wanted to know. Nice, genuine biryani, he said. And I swung into action.The moment I hear the word biryani I get activated, quite like Pavlov and dog. For someone who is essentially a wheat eater, I cant quite understand this great love I have for biryanis. But as I have said before, I truly enjoy this rice-and-meat dish  irrespective of where it is from. I love the spiciness of the Hyderabadi biryani, the richness of the Awadhi one, the more rustic taste of the Delhi version, the juicy potato in the Calcutta dish and the variations that you find in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. I dont even mind the pickled taste of the Moradabadi biryani.So, of course, I went online to get to know more about Taam.It turned out that it is a service which provides biryanis, kormas, kababs and other such delicious dishes in kilos.Diversity on tableBut a sampler came home, and I tried out quite a few of the dishes  and had a great meal, indeed.There was quite a spread  biryani, korma, kababs, baghare baigan, meethi roti and sewain. I think I enjoyed the lamb shami kababs the most  they were soft, the meat was deliciously tender and lightly spiced, and what I really liked was that they were not thick and chunky, as kababs often are, but thin, like home-cooked kababs. The kababs had been made with beaten meat and not minced meat, so they were exceptionally tasty. I ate a piece with a small chunk of the meethi roti, and found they complemented each other rather well.The Lucknowi biryani was good, too. The rice was long-grained, and the meat pieces were well cooked. It was rightly spiced  neither too much, nor too little.Nawabi dishThe mildly sweet taste of the Hyderabadi dish, baghare baigan, was delightful. The tamarind in it gave it the tart edge that it needed. But, somehow, the korma didnt work for me. I found the gravy too runny and the meat a little insipid. The Muzaffar sewain (Rs. 300 a box  450g and serves 7-8 people), on the other hand, was superb, and gave a pleasantly sweet end to what was a veritable feast.The rates are in kilos. The Lucknowi mutton biryani  which serves 5-6 people is for Rs. 1400 a kilo, the chicken biryani for Rs. 1200 a kilo. Hyderabadi mutton biryani is for Rs. 1600 a kilo and chicken biryani Rs. 1400 a kilo. The mutton qorma, which serves 10, is for Rs. 1800 a kilo. A plate of mutton shami kababs  one kilo with 40 pieces  costs Rs. 1500. The baghare baigan is for Rs. 1000 a kilo and serves 10, says the rate card.Taam is an online platform run by Asra Ahmad. It takes orders on phone and online. The phone numbers are 8586030554 and 9953170590. The email id is order@taamonline.com, and the website is www.taamonline.com. You have to order your food at least a day in advance, and they take delivery charges as applicable. The bawarchis of Taam have been trained by the family, and a cook is there from Hyderabad as well.My friend from Bhopal was not wrong. You wont be disappointed, he had said. And I certainly wasnt."
5b164b739855b762ececf17b,Madhura Deshpande on a 'Misal' Hunt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/madhura-deshpande-on-a-misal-hunt/articleshow/62881615.cms,2018-02-12,"Tasty, pocket friendly and available at almost every street corner - misal is one of the most popular (and most loved) street foods of Pune. So no wonder then, that actor Madhura Deshpande jumped at the chance to join a misal hop around the city. A group of 20 foodies gathered near the Tilak statue at Mandai and led by Jayesh Paranjape , the curator of the hop (which was part of the Pune Heritage Festival), visited various misal outlets to try unusual varieties of the dish. The actor, known for her roles in Marathi soaps such as Ase He Kanyadan and Zunjh , tried everything from extra spicy to traditional and even dum cooked versions of the dish. And if you too are a fan of the dish, here are a few recommendations from our hop...This quaint eatery is situated in the narrow by lanes of the shopping destination Tulsibaug. Though it's nothing fancy to look at, this place serves some of the tastiest misal in town. The misal here is as Puneri as it can get, said Jayesh, the curator of the misal trail. The base is poha and it has typical boiled potato cooked the traditional Puneri style, mixed with the curry (also known as kat or tarri or sample) that has loads of coconut and is garnished with chopped onions and shev, he added, as Madhura polished off her plate.Misal is always believed to be a spicy dish. As someone not too fond of chilli, I always steer clear of spicy food. But this one I absolutely loved. It has the perfect balance of sweet sour and spice, she said.Our next stop was a small eatery in Bibwewadi. And misal being a filling dish, most of the foodies were already full, but one glance at the menu and they simply had to try the three different styles of misal available here. We have the Damodar misal which is regular, Upwas (fasting) misal and the dum misal, said Alok Thakar, the owner of the place. Here you get a Puneri sweet and sour meets Kolhapuri spice kind of flavour. And the spices used at this eatery are ground the traditional way, on stone. Their speciality  the dum misal  is infused with a smokey flavour and served in a clay pot. The smokey flavour of the misal was great and it was served very well too, said a happy Madhura.Also on the itinerary, was a restaurant on Sinhagad Road. Despite being a place that's known for its grills, this restaurant serves a very Puneri version of the dish. It is spicier than the other two versions, said Jayesh, adding that the curry here is made on a chulha, which gives it a distinct flavour. There are very few places in the city that serve misal made on a chulha and this is one of them, he informed.I am a big foodie. I need variety in my food, but I tend to eat small quantities. When it comes to Maharashtrian cuisine, I love homemade ukad. I also have a sweet tooth and love desserts.The places where you get the best local food will seldom show up online. That's why I joined this misal hop. I am from Uttar Pradesh, but wherever I go, I like to explore the culture and cuisine of the place.Ive been in Pune for one and half years, but did not know about these places. I really like misal and joining this hop was a wise decision. The SriKrishna misal was my favourite among the versions I tried today.Despite being born and brought up in Pune, I did not know about many of these places. We usually tend to explore only eateries that are close to where we live. This hop took us around the city to explore the food culture."

The food processing sector is a giant which has now woken up in UP. A similar international investors meet for food processing World Food India was organised in Delhi last year. There international companies signed MoUs of more than Rs 1lakh crore investments and UP being the largest state of country will get a lions share, she said.The minister further said UP was the leading milk producing state accounting for nearly 17% of its total production in the country.Similarly it produces fruits like guava, mango, Indian gooseberry, watermelon, muskmelon in abundance. UP is second largest producer of carrots, bottle gourds, pumpkin, parwal, highest producer of wheat, sugarcane, meat bust still people are not fed properly because high amount of food is wasted. On an average, around Rs 1 lakh crore of food products go waste in the country in a year. This can be saved through processing, she said.The government has doubled the budget of department due to high opportunity of jobs in the sector, she said.Investors should invest in the sector as the government was ready to give a subsidy of Rs 5000 crore for this sector. Rs 6000 crore has been earmarked for Pradhanmantri Kisan Sampada Yojana. For establishing food parks government is ready to give subsidy, she added.She said the government also was keen on laying foundation stone besides inaugurating the ventures in the state.Kaur struck a chord with the audience by terming herself as UP Ki Beti as she sais she spent her childhood in Gorakhpur and studied in Lucknow. She said she still missed Shukla Chaat in Hazratganj. The minister said she would be the happiest person if she could something for her Maika (mothers place).POTATO BOARDSpeaking on the occasion, deputy CM Keshav Maurya said the state government had constituted the Potato Board to protect the interests of farmers.STATE GOVT INKED 664 MOUSUP minister for food processing Surya Pratap Shahi said the state government had signed 664 MoUs of Rs 31,300 crore and these projects would start soon as his office was following them.

The new policy targets to take this to an ambitious 30% during the next five by attracting an investment of Rs 15,000 crore, he said. Even at 20%, we will be able to get an investment of Rs 6,000 crore and Rs 11000 crore at 20% milk processing, he added."

This is being implemented on request of the state government willing to share the loss with the central government on a 50-50 basis, the order says.In a missive sent to all district magistrates as well as director, horticulture and food processing department on March 01, UP Agriculture Production Commissioner Raj Pratap Singh has conveyed the state governments decision in this regard following a letter from the Centre, also dated March 01, specifying the norms, said a senior official requesting anonymity in view of the model code in place for Phulpur bypolls.HT is in possession of a copy of the order that comes with a detailed table of agency entrusted the task of opening purchase centres in districts and the set target for them.The letter adds that overhead charges would cover expenses like transport, loading, unloading, gunny bag and other packing material, Mandi tax, purchase tax and godown charges etc. The purchases would be through agencies like UP Agro, Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Federation Limited, Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society, National Cooperative Consumers Federation of India Limited (NCCF), UP State Horticultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (HOFED) etc, the official added.As per the plan, Rs 2 crore each would be made available to the UP Agro, the PCF etc by the State Agricultural Produce Markets Board, UP, as an interest free loan for four months on their demands while the Uttar Pradesh Consumer Cooperative Society and NCCF would arrange for the money themselves, the letter adds.These agencies would open procurement or purchase centres in different districts in consultation with the respective DMs with their numbers and targets being fixed as per local needs and circumstances. The purchase of potatoes would be made between March 2 and March 31, which, however, could be increased with the permission of the central government.The order specifies that while one purchase centre should become functional in every district from March 1 itself, by March 6 at least one such purchase centre should start functioning in every tehsil of a district.The procurement agencies should furnish a daily progress report to horticulture and food processing department through e-mail while the DM would ensure that a team of senior officials undertakes surprise inspection of the purchase centres, the missive says.Uttar Pradesh is the largest potato producing state of the country accounting for about 35% of the countrys total output. As per some estimates, a whopping over 23 lakh farmers grow potatoes in the state. With very limited capacity to store the produce just 1,708 cold storagesevery harvest produces the challenge for the government to ensure proper returns to the farmers at a time when large number of its cold storages are already full with last seasons harvest.In only its second cabinet meeting in April 2017, for the first time ever, the Yogi government had decided to fix minimum support price for potato to give fillip to potato growers who had been forced to sell their produce on throwaway prices in the past.Last year, the government had decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potatoes from farmers at Rs 4,870 per tonne to arrest the sharp fall in prices besides an extra Rs 1,217.60 per tonne or actual whichever is less for overhead expenses."

The average total monthly income of farmers in UP in 2012 was Rs 4923 against their monthly expenditures of Rs 6230 leaving them with savings in minus Rs 1307. The farmers of Punjab earned Rs 18059 and spent Rs 13311 saving Rs 4748 per month.Average gross cropped area per agricultural household in UP was 0.57 against 2.17 hectare in Punjab and 1.68 hectare in Haryana.UPs total share in countrys food production is 17.45% which is highest.Asking such questions is only natural as the BJP had devoted the first full four pages of its election manifesto Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra  to agriculture and farmers.Farm loan waiver was among the major promises that the BJP made to farmers. The crop loan of all small and medium farmers will be waived, the manifesto said.But when it came to implementing the pledge after the party romped to a grand victory in 2017, the fund-starved new government diluted the important loan waiver promise by putting in many eligibility conditions for debt-ridden farmers to avail the scheme, those familiar with the matter said.For example, it fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived, that too against one loan account only.Initially, 70 lakh farmers were expected to benefit after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore but gradually the number came down to just half. Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said the government had waived farm loan to the extent of Rs 20,596 crore, benefitting around 33 lakh farmers.The eligible farmers, who have been left out, had been asked to give an application by March 10. We have received applications from lakhs of farmers. We will sit in March end and take a call, he said.Even the implementation of the promise drew flak when it was found that many farmers received loan waiver cheques for as low as Re 1 or even less.Although the government countered the criticism by arguing that since the loans existing on March 31, 2016 were being waived, many farmers paid their loan before that period and a few rupees still continued to be showed as arrears with banks. These are the same arrears for which many farmers got the loan waiver cheques of very low amount, additional director, agriculture, Rajesh Gupta pointed out.Arguments notwithstanding, the opposition found an opportunity to mock at the loan waiver scheme. Shailendra Kumar Awasthi, a progressive farmer of Asmanpur village in Bahraich said, the scheme ended up earning more critics than admirers due to dilution and faulty implementation of the important pre-poll promise.The BJPs loan waiver promise was a big joke to farmers, UP Kisan Sabha leader Mukut Singh said. They promised to waive all the loans of small and medium farmers, but later limited the amount to Rs 1 lakh apart from putting many other ifs and buts, he added.The waiver, Singh claimed, was too inadequate and benefitted too small a number of farmers to make any difference.Contrary to the promise of providing affordable electricity to each field, power tariff for unmetered private tube wells owned by farmers was increased by 50% and by 77% for unmetered residential connections at one go a few months after the new government came to power.Unprecedented tariff hike with regard to tube wells and domestic connections in villages contrary to the promise of cheaper power is one of the major reasons for the simmering discontent among farmers, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma said.The work on some other farmer-related announcements is till to begin. They include interest-free crop loan to farmers, setting up of Mukhyamantri Krashi Sinchai Kosh and making cows and other milch animals available to landless farmers.Agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi claimed that the government had done a lot of work for farmers, which he claimed had no parallel. Apart from waiving crop loans, we are distributing 10,000 subsidised solar irrigation pumps to farmers every year, providing soil health cards to farmers as a campaign, we did record purchase of wheat and paddy and fixed the minimum support price of potato for the first time and ensured smooth and adequate distribution of fertilizers and seeds, he said, enumerating some achievements.Critics must not forget we got the mandate for five years and we will implement each and every promise made to farmers in the days to come. Our government is committed to doubling farmers income by 2022, he stressed.The criticism, however, becomes important when it comes from an organisation like the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, an outfit of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS). The government is trying its best but benefits of the policies are not reaching the ground because of the bureaucracy that makes the schemes and rules too complex for a common farmer to avail benefits, said Ram Chela Ji, state organization secretary.Farmers, he said, were disappointed. The government must act fast, he advised.The results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye polls must come as a wake-up call to those in power, he cautioned."

Besides, he laid foundation stones for schemes worth over Rs 34 crore and inaugurated projects worth over Rs 2.5 crore.The CM detailed measures being taken for potato farmers, including the promotion board constituted to help them as well was efforts to offer them an adequate support price.He also spoke about the governments statewide School Chalo campaign, which is to be launched on April 2.The chief minister said that his government had worked tirelessly to supply electricity impartially to all regions of the state. While the previous government had been partial in providing electricity (to different districts), we have ensured 24-hour power supply to all district headquarters, 20-hour supply to tehsils and the Bundelkhand region, and 18-hour supply to all rural areas, he said.The chief minister left the city in the afternoon. State cabinet minister SP Singh Baghel and Firozabad MLA Manish Asija were also present at the event."

The loan was waived after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government announced a debt redemption scheme for farmers last year.Actually, only Rs 74,000 was waived against the declared sum of Rs 1 lakh, said a dejected Kumar, who owns eight bighas (1.3 hectares) of crop land.In 2014, third-generation marginal farmers Vijay Mishra and brother Ashok took a loan of Rs 1.25 lakh through the Kisan Credit Card to grow potato and paddy in Samri Majra Baihrana village under Kaudihar block, 35km from Allahabad.But their crops got destroyed, first by drought and then by hailstorms. I was saddled with a loan and an interest of Rs 1.85 lakh. I was relying desperately on a waiver to survive. But after waiting for months, just Rs 65,000 got waived, the 38-year-old Vijay said.Today, I have over Rs 1 lakh to repay and the bank is putting pressure.These two cases reflect the shortcomings in the Yogi Adityanath governments loan-waiver scheme for farmers, a promise the BJP made before the 2017 assembly polls.The party won the elections with absolute majority.

We had asked the farmers to give applications if they have been left out. We will verify the claims of lakhs of farmers and waive loans of those eligible in accordance with the rules, he promised.But the snags are drawing more critics than admirers to this well-intentioned scheme. The government is accused of keeping its promise by putting a number of riders for farmers seeking their loans to be written off.The government fixed a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh that could be waived and that, too, only against one loan account.Initially, the number of farmers to be benefitted after the government made a budgetary allocation of Rs 36,000 crore was put at around 7 million.The number was almost halved eventually.In Allahabad district, around 82,000 farmers were identified as eligible for the loan waiver. However, after three rounds of verification, only 49,600 farmers benefited with a total loan waiver of Rs 275 crore. The remaining 32,300 farmers had to repay their loans, lawyer and RTI activist Anand Mohan said.The loan-waiver scheme, Anand Mohan said, should have been implemented in a better way.Not only was the promise watered down, the execution was marred by criticism and controversies when it was found that many farmers received loan-waiver cheques of as low as Re 1 or even less.According to agriculture minister Shahi, loan waiver is not a solution to rural distress.We are working on different fronts simultaneously to double farmers income by 2022 as a lasting solution to the problem, he said, reminding critics that they should not forget that this government has the mandate for five years to work for the farmers.The criticism is not coming only from the BJPs rivals.The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers outfit affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological mentor, is unhappy as well.The bureaucracy messed it up by attaching too many riders, said Ram Chelaji, the Kisan Sanghs state organisation secretary.He pointed to the BJPs loss in the Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypolls in March and said the government should act fast to address the problems of disenchanted farmers.The disenchantment is difficult to ignore in a state in which 43.8% of its farmers are in debt. The government now stands hostage to a promise it made in the run-up to the polls."

In that case, what am I? About 70% water, I learned in school. Of the rest, I am perhaps 10% staple grains, 17% other homely foods and 0% hamburgers and cola. By CSE's reckoning, I should be as safe as a fire extinguisher.But I could actually be drop-dead unhealthy since the last 3% of me consists of samosas, chaat, pav bhaji, dosas and parathas. The etymology of paratha is believed to be parat (layer) + atta (dough). Between the parats nestles ghee or hydrogenated fats, the Great Satan of the health-conscious.The CSE study seems to be limited to junk food packaged by multinational chains. The only Indian brand visible is also a chain, Haldiram's. But the bulk of finger-lickin' good unhealthy food is produced by the informal sector, on the street. It is not advertised or promoted, and still sells out. Like movements against corruption and nuclear power, this sector is difficult to engage with precisely because it is informal. There is no corporate face to heckle, no visible head to cut off. But not to try at all is a cop-out, neglecting the majority who do not patronise food chains.That's one problem with the debate. The other is that it lost the plot on day one. The CSE report was a sophisticated guided missile locked onto a specific target. It claimed that food corporations are mislabelling or misrepresenting products in a manner which threatens public health. A serious matter in a country which may be heading for a public health crisis, led by an escalation in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.The priorities should have been peer review and confirmatory replication of the study, followed by punitive action against corporations guilty of concealment or misrepresentation. Instead, the matter was referred to the uproar of TV debate, where the missile's guidance chip overheated and it veered off on irrelevant tangents, including the need to ban fast food from schools.Uttar Pradesh has gone and done that already but bans are a bad idea in principle, whether we're talking books, alcohol or potato chips - which go very well together, incidentally. Enforcement of standards and informed consumer choice serve the purpose better. Instead, there was a lot of sound and fury, after which some corporations named in the CSE report smugly reported that their sales were unaffected.Does this mean that apart from a vocal minority of bleeding-ulcer progressives, Indians don't care about what they consume? That's difficult to believe, since a 2003 CSE report on pesticides in soft drinks had sparked off public demonstrations. But there's a difference between the two cases. Consumers were shocked to learn that soft drinks were contaminated. But when they order a burger meal, they know what they're asking for.CSE's report suggests that they don't know the whole truth. But the patron of a paratha stand may know even less. So we need full disclosure for packaged food and better public education about unbranded food. Thus armed, if consumers still choose to assassinate themselves with burgers and bhaturas, they will soon have the right to do so.

Yet, the price of potato in the market is high because the price at the sourcing point has gone up.""Mishra said: ""We have not found cases of hoarding so far during our raids which even took place in the Chhatra Bazar godown, one of the biggest markets of the state. But in order to check possible hoarding, food supplies and consumer welfare secretary Vir Vikram Yadav has asked all the district collectors and civil supplies officials to keep a close vigil on supply of potato in the market and ensure availability of the same to consumers at a reasonable price.""The price of potato has jumped to Rs 20 per kg. Last week, it was being sold Rs 16 per kg. Officials said shortage of potato had led to price rise. Consumers have also started complaining about the shortage and sought the government's intervention.Food and civil supplies minister Surya Narayan Patro said: ""We had earlier planned to purchase potatoes thorough Nafed. But as Nafed has quoted a high price, we are yet to take a decision on how to procure potatoes. We have not also decided from where will we procure potatoes.""Officials said the state was facing acute shortage of potato as there was a short supply from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. ""Though there is a good production of potato in Bengal, most of its production goes to Bihar and Jharkhand,"" said an official.In another development, the state government has fixed stock limit for potato at 500 quintal for wholesalers in Cuttack and 350 quintal in cities such as Bhubaneswar, Berhampur, Sambalpur, Puri and Rourkela. For other places, the stock limit is 150 quintal.However, the Opposition said that the state was facing such a crisis only due to lack of foresight. ""The state government should have set up more cold storages and kept the stocks to meet the future needs,"" said BJP leader Manmohan Samal.Traders' associations alleged that their advice to the government to stock potato had gone unheeded.

5b156ab19855b75db2e72b43,The changing terms of endearment,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-changing-terms-of-endearment/article23876235.ece,2018-05-14,"Uttar Pradeshs pivotal importance to Indian politics is hard to exaggerate. Anyone who wishes to rule India must control this State. The Bhartiya Janata Partys (BJPs) biggest win in 2014 came from U.P., which was instrumental in providing Narendra Modi with a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. The party won 73 (with its ally) of the States 80 seats, while its nearest rivals, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress, got only five and two seats, respectively. The BJP repeated this performance in the 2017 Assembly election, winning 325 seats (with its ally) in the 403-member State Assembly, which is about 80% of the seats. No party has ever registered such a colossal tally, not even Indira Gandhi, whose party, the Congress, had won 309 seats in the then 425-member Assembly in 1980.An alienationBut barely a year after its stunning victory the situation has changed significantly. The strongest sign of the changing public mood is the growing alienation of Dalits from the government. Even though many Dalits voted for the BJP in 2014, they feel excluded from access to power and the benefits it brings. Attacks on Dalits have not ceased even after the national furore over the Saharanpur violence in May 2017. A Dalit student of Allahabad University was lynched in February. Some of the BJPs Scheduled Caste MPs from U.P. wrote to the Prime Minister to express their anguish over these incidents. One of them accused the government of only paying lip service and not doing anything for the benefit of the community. This unusual development had occurred just days after the BJP lost in its bastions, Gorakhpur and Phulpur (which is part of Allahabad district), to the SP-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in the by-elections pushing scores of Dalits towards the anti-BJP camp.Elements of a strategyThe growing conflict between Dalits and Hindutva must be seen in the context of the paradigm shift in U.P.s politics which is increasingly defined in narrow majoritarian terms, even as the BJP is seeking to co-opt the oppressed groups within its electoral umbrella. Two key elements of the BJPs electoral strategy are inclusion/visibility of Dalits and exclusion/invisibility of Muslims. It has shown that it can win elections without Muslims even though they constitute a fifth of the States population, which is larger than the population of several Muslim-majority countries. By contrast, it has made every effort to demonstrate its love for Dalits. But they are unhappy with the terms of endearment since they want greater Dalit representation to address their concerns regarding social exclusion, food preferences, education, employment, housing, and so on.The BJP has consistently used religious polarisation to trump the caste divide in U.P., but it hasnt succeeded; in fact, the divide has been exacerbated by the cold caste and sub-caste calculations of its top leadership to undercut old forms of caste mobilisation. Moreover, the attempts to assimilate Dalits within the fold by invoking the legacy of B.R. Ambedkar or the symbolism of communal inter-dining is not enough to cool tempers of Dalits who face discrimination and atrocities despite the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The instrumental use of both gestures is obvious to everyone; not surprisingly, these gestures have failed to quell the growing tide of discontent, with many Dalit voters losing patience with the ruling dispensation.Elusive developmentDalit inclusion will work when their core concerns are addressed and when there is overall development, which the State badly needs. Development and economic growth has, of course, been a constant leitmotif in the electoral campaigns of the BJP since 2014. But there is no evidence to show that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is the leader who can deliver development for the State. In fact, the very idea of development was sidelined by his controversial appointment. He was installed as Chief Minister to polarise public opinion on Hindu-Muslim lines, and not to promote integration through development. His elevation signalled a decisive shift from the dual strategy of combining Hindutva and development to a singular embrace of Hindutva which has been used as a weapon of mass mobilisation to offset the fissures of caste, class, language and culture. Asked about Opposition parties linking his speeches and work to Hindutva and not development, the Chief Minister replied that Hindutva and development are complementary to each other... Those who are opposing Hindutva are in fact opposing development and Bharatiyata. In other words, even the optics of development and the claims of taking everyone along through development will be sacrificed at the altar of Hindu nationalism ahead of the 2019 election.Going by the policy decisions of his government, the cow appears to be the fulcrum of the U.P. model. It took centre stage in the governments budget with a record Rs. 233 crore allotted for the welfare of cow and dairy development. In a similar vein, social sector spending has been reduced while religious tourism is being given a boost. Mr. Adityanath made a plethora of promises such as building houses, toilets, laying roads and providing 24-hour electricity supply. But these promises are unlikely to be fulfilled, which is causing restlessness even among people who voted to bring the BJP to power in 2017. This is evident from several events in the past few months. In October 2017, sugarcane farmers burned their crop in front of the U.P. Assembly after the government increased the minimum support price by only Rs. 10; in January, farmers unhappy with the minimum support price for their potato harvest dumped the crop in front of the houses of VVIPs in Lucknow; and the much-hyped farm loan waiver turned into a farce as many of the beneficiaries received waivers of amounts as small as Rs. 1 to Rs. 500. The employment situation remains grim, as large-scale government recruitments  the major source of public employment in the State  are not regular and even previously conducted exams, for instance, for clearing the backlog in police jobs have been cancelled. An extravagant UP Investors Summit 2018 held in February to boost investment in the hope of creating employment cannot promote industrialisation and job creation unless the structural constraints of underdevelopment are removed.Closing the gapWhat seems to be working for the BJP is the disarray in the Opposition camp. However, this can change as political majorities are constituted and reconstituted in changing historical and political circumstances. Political majorities are contingent and do not last, at least in part because the Opposition parties make adjustments to capitalise on opportunities. The Mandal (caste) and Mandir (religion) interregnum of the early 1990s signified the arrival of identity politics, which upstaged religious politics that was catapulted by the Ayodhya movement to take centrestage. The ensuing upper caste-backward caste confrontation displaced the Congress from its position of dominance in U.P. and prevented the BJP from reinforcing its political clout despite unprecedented public support for Hindutva in north India for the first time since Independence. Twenty-five years later, in 2104, the BJP closed the gap between the economic and the political sphere with its mantra of development to secure a popular mandate. Currently, the Opposition is making tactical adjustments to counter the overarching narrative of Hindu nationalism. The by-election results demonstrate that if the two main Opposition parties combine, they can give the BJP a run for its money. If there is one State where Opposition unity can upset the BJPs plans for majority rule in 2019, it is U.P.Zoya Hasan is Professor Emerita, Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University"

The cycle continues for the entire month of Ramzan, feeding around 600 poor people as their dinner the the entire month of Ramzan.In the same kitchen, a different set of snacks is also prepared for the specific purpose of serving rozedars coming to offer prayers in 15 mosques under Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT).Around 2,500 people will receive a plate of gujhiya, phulka, chana, suhaal, dates, a fruit (preferably banana) along with bread-butter and cake outsourced from a bakery, thanks to a kings commitment to the poor.The third King of Awadh, Muhammad Ali Shah, had created the Husainabad Endowment Deed in 1839 to feed the poor. Since then, the two massive community kitchens within the Chhota Imambara have been following the tradition of sending out iftari to the 15 mosques under its umbrella.Every Ramzan, by the end of the day, this kitchen would have fed over 3,000 mouths.A sum of around Rs 16 lakh is passed for the iftar and dinner services every year. Two separate dedicated teams of chefs and their assistants are engaged for it. Everyday, activity in the kitchens begins at 8am. By 4.30pm, we send out the first batch of iftar food for the mosques, said Habibul Hasan , an official from HAT.The 179-year-old Nawabi tradition saw a break only in 2015. During Ramzan that year, a movement against alleged corruption in the UP Shia Central Waqf Board being spearheaded by Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad had brought the tradition to a halt. Protesters had locked the entrances to both the Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara, restricting all entry. Even the kitchens could not function.However, people from the neighbourhood of the 15 mosques came together to fund the food. HAT had also roped in private bakeries. Even during the mourning months of Muharram, food is served from the traditional kitchens of the Imambara."

The resultant GDP figures circulated to commissioners and DMs on February 22, 2018 show that at Rs 71,294, the per capita GDP of Kasganj is almost equal to that of Lucknow, Rs 71,846.The per capita GDP of Kasganj, a little-known district carved out of Etah in 2008, is next only to Gautam Buddh Nagar that tops the chart at staggering Rs 3,68,081 and Meerut with second highest per capita GDP at Rs 88,273. Even developed districts like Ghaziabad ( Rs 64,907), Kanpur Nagar (Rs 57,308), Aligarh ( Rs 47,849) and Agra ( Rs 68,795) are all behind Kasganj.Explaining the probable reasons for Kasganjs remarkable per capita GDP, director, economics and statistics, AK Pawar said growth in livestock production, especially buffalo meat, rise in minerals and potato production etc during that particular year(2015-16) could have contributed to a high GDP.In 2014-15 also, Kasganj was on the sixth position but this time it has found a place among the states top five districts with regard to per capita GDP, he said adding A higher GDP obviously shows an overall prosperity of a district.Further analysis of the GDP figures shows that while western UP comprising 30 districts has the highest per capita GDP at Rs 62,386, eastern UP with 27 districts has the lowest GDP at Rs 32,360, which is worse than Bundelkhands per capita GDP of Rs 44,446.

After the initial fossil identification study, they found that the leaves were of sweet potato. A detailed research work began in 2000.The discovery of a plant fossil is rare because plants soft structure is not easily preserved in the rocks, said senior scientist Rakesh C Mehrotra.He said that 17 specimens of the fossil of leaves discovered were made to study the pattern of veins in the blade of a leaf and secretory ducts (cells). The study showed that the leaves were of sweet potato and belonged to the morning glory family, Mehrotra added. The research was conducted at three herbariums in the country  National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow; Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, and Central National Herbarium, Howrah.Mehrotra said the sediment where the fossil was extracted was found to be 57 million years old, hence the fossil was also considered to be of the same date.BSIP director Sunil Bajpai said its a landmark discovery.The study will help in understanding the evolutionary origins and the existing concepts of sweet potatoes. It will also help in understanding the climatic conditions and related factors that prevailed millions of years ago."

Three months on, they have some reason to cheer. Wholesale potato prices now range from Rs 9 to Rs 22 a kilogram and are not expected to slide anytime soon. As demand rises, market experts feel prices will rise further, by up to 60%.One reason is that the quantity of potatoes in cold storage is currently 20% less than last year. Officials said that potatoes are currently commanding higher prices than onions and tomatoes. The wholesale price of onions currently ranges between Rs 3.50 and Rs 9 per kilogram, while tomatoes are selling for between Rs 6 and Rs 9 a kilogram.Potato prices have been rising for a fortnight and market officials believe they will climb further. We are seeing wide fluctuations in the wholesale market. Any tightening of supply will raise prices further, says Deepak Patel , secretary of the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee.Market officials met traders who said prices will not rise if demand remains at the same level, Patel said.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , says, There are at least one crore 50-kg bags fewer at cold storages in Gujarat compared to 2017. Further, Uttar Pradesh, a major potato producing state, has registered a fall in production. Farmers have not been getting remunerative prices for their produce and have hence moved away potato to more lucrative crops.Guru said the Gujarat government last year gave Rs 40 as subsidy to potato farmers. Only 4.09 crore 50-kg bags have been stored this year. The number was 5.10 crore bags in 2017. Cold storage capacity in the state is 5.75 crore bags.Guru said the drop in potato production this year has brought some relief to farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers.According to potato traders, farmers in major potato producing states collectively reduced the acreage sown with the tuber last year by 5% to 7%, after two straight years of gluts in the market. The reduced acreage has led to a 10% to 20% fall in potato output."

Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs.

But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The miseries of financially distressed farmers seem far from over even as they continue to demand waiver of farm loans and remunerative prices for their produce through several platforms across the country.The problem of plenty has hit the farmers badly. While garlic farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which produce 45% of the countrys garlic, recently fetched as low as Rs. 1 a kg in wholesale prices, the instances of tomato farmers dumping their harvest on the fields earlier this month  be it in Haryana, Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh after prices nosedived  have only highlighted their woes. Tomato production during 2017-18, according to the first advance estimate, is likely to be 7.8% higher than that of the previous year. However, it is 20% higher than the average production of the past five years. Similarly, potato production is estimated to be 1.5% higher than that of the previous year. However, compared with the average production of the past five years, it is 8.7% higher. These figures indicate that farmers are producing more without good returns. Why are vegetable farmers not getting a fair price? Season after season, farmers face price uncertainties mainly owing to fluctuations in demand and supply caused by bumper or poor production, speculation and hoarding by traders.Are traders manipulating prices?In Madhya Pradesh, after garlic prices dropped sharply, the government decided to include it in the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (Price Deficit Payment Scheme) that was introduced in the Kharif 2017 season. Farmers, however, rue that with the conditions associated with the scheme, most of them are unable to gain any benefit. The scheme is aimed at providing price deficit payments to farmers if the market prices are below the minimum support price. Farmer leaders believe the implementation of this scheme in the first season has resulted in little benefit to farmers, with very little to prevent manipulation of prices by traders. The government claims to have disbursed Rs. 1,900 crore in compensation, but a large section of farmers has been excluded from the scheme, says Jai Kisan Andolan national convener Avik Saha. Those left out bore the brunt of a larger price crash because of market manipulation.What is the way forward?The fluctuation in vegetable prices has become a perennial problem and is usually associated with the economics of demand and supply. Farmers, mainly marginal and small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. Being perishable, vegetables are more prone to price fluctuation, hence they require better infrastructure for storage and marketing. Contract farming is an alternative for farmers to reduce financial risks by providing an assured market for their produce at a pre-agreed price. The Centre last week approved the State/UT Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018. The Act lays stress on protecting the interests of farmers, considering them as weaker of the two parties entering into a contract. The Act is aimed at ensuring the purchase of the entire pre-agreed quantity of one or more of produce, livestock or its product. Although varied forms of contract farming exist in some pockets, a formal system is not widespread. By and large, cultivation of commercial crops such as cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber and dairy has had some elements of informal contract farming.Experts believe that integration of vegetable and fruit growers with agro-processing units through contract farming could prove beneficial to producers as it takes care of price fluctuations and helps to mitigate production risk. Pratap Singh Birthal, professor at the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, says: Under the contract farming law, the agreements would help farmers get an assured price for the produce, which will act as a buffer against price volatility and market fluctuations...Vikas Vasudeva"

The daily retail prices available in the consumer affairs ministrys price monitoring cell show there was an increase of Rs 10 and Rs 7 per kg of potato in Delhi and Mumbai on Friday as compared to the prices a year back.The consumer affairs ministrys data also show major increase in the prices of the staple food items across Uttar Pradesh and the maximum in Agra (by Rs 13 a kg) despite the state being the largest producer of crop. UP also has the maximum installed cold storage capacity to keep potatoes.The retail average prices in some of the cities in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have also increased by Rs 10 a kg in comparison to the prices of last year.Officials said the issue of increasing potato prices came up for discussion at the weekly meeting of an inter ministerial committee on Friday. NHB officials briefed the panel that there is enough potatoes in stock to meet demand despite a minor dip in harvest during last season.There can be no reason except nexus of certain section of traders and middlemen for the increasing prices. We have been producing 46-47 million tonnes of potatoes while our average consumption is around 40 million tonnes. We have cold storage capacity of 35 million tonnes, which is enough to meet our demand, said an official, who did not wish to be named.Sources said that since movement of agriculture produce is free between India and Bangladesh substantial quantity of potatoes has gone out of the country as domestic production in the neighbouring country was less during last season. Similar, potato production in Nepal also got impacted last season and there are indications of potatoes from India going to Nepal.Officials said prices will moderate in near future as supplies increase."

Roadside vendors are selling colourful glass and lacquer bangles, assorted fruits, mounds of dry fruits and bags filled with sewai or vermicelli.There is a faint aroma of ghee that clings to the air. Bundles upon bundles of uncooked sewai lie on tabletops of makeshift stalls. Off-white, paper white, yellow, light brown. Men and women carrying huge shopping bags haggle with the vendors for their dose of this season's sweetness. Indeed, in the grand Eid spread of sheermal paratha, galauti kababs, biryani, mutton chaanp, sewai is the lone sweet note.The scene at Zakaria Street is no different from Mullickbazar that evening. There is still a week to go before Eid. Shop owner Mohamad Eiyaz is taking an iftar break. His son, Shahnawaz, a college student, is filling in for his father. The shop that sells stationery all year also sells sewai during this time.Shahnawaz tells us that they source it from a factory in Metiabruz on the outskirts of the city. And not just them, the paanwala, the man frying samosas, another manning a bag shop, all jump onto the sewai bandwagon at this time.Qudimi Karkhana Sewai is different in that it sells sewai throughout the year. ""What do you want - bhuna, mota, Banarasi, lachcha,"" asks Syed Feroze, who works at the 200-year-old shop, in between measuring a heap of lachcha for a customer. The lachcha is very fine of texture, looks like a heap of hay. It is basically made of rice or refined flour or semolina kneaded with ghee.""The mota sewai comes from Lucknow, the Banarasi one from Benaras and the lachcha is made right here in the city,"" says Feroze, as he stashes the payment into a tin tiffin box. The finest and the most expensive of the lot is the Banarasi sewai. ""What Basmati is to rice, Banarasi is to sewai,"" explains Shahanshah Mirza, a food connoisseur. He adds, ""An Eid without sewai is considered incomplete.""Athar Ali, the 25-year-old owner of a garment shop in Chitpur, says that most people start to stack up sewai before the beginning of Ramzan, and consume it intermittently that whole month. Mirza says, ""Chand raat marks the end of Ramzan and a lot of people buy sewai especially then because the next day is Eid.""The menu at most Mughlai eateries comprises firni and shaahi tukda and not sewai; it is the preserve of home kitchens and makes an appearance only on special occasions.There is no one way of preparing sewai, we are given to understand. The lachcha is usually doused in a bowl of milk and had with a sprinkling of sugar. ""A lot of people have it thus during sehri. It is filling and keeps one going all through the day,"" says Athar Ali.We learn from homemaker Shagufta Bano, a resident of Howrah, that every family has its own version of the sewai, most of them going back several generations. ""You could boil it in milk, cook it in chashni or sugar syrup, or deep fry it in ghee..."" she rattles away.Shagufta adds a generous pinch of jafran (saffron) to her version. First, she adds sugar in desi ghee, then water and, thereafter, some jafran for an orange tinge. Then she adds the raw sewai to this mix, throws in kaju, kishmish, pista, badaam and khoa. And a drop or two of meetha attar.What Shagufta prepares is called the qimami sewai. There is also the sheer khurma, a sweet pudding made of milk, sewai, dried dates and sugar. Be it meethi sewai, sheer khurma or rumali sewai, the slight variations are most likely in the DNA of the dish - place of origin and consequent availability of ingredients.Manzilat Fatima, a preserver of royal Awadhi family cuisine and a food curator, tells us about a sewai dish called muzaffar. ""It is an age-old preparation, not so common in every home. One needs considerable expertise to achieve the balance of moisture in the sewai and at the same time maintain the individual strands of vermicelli,"" says Fatima.Vermicelli does not have much of a flavour of its own, and so it readily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with. That is why it can be added to dishes sweet and savoury alike.Chef Deepak Raj Srivastava of Pukhtaan, a restaurant in Patna specialising in Awadhi cuisine, tells The Telegraph over phone that sewai is also used to make savoury items, cutlets and potato rolls. In these cases, the vermicelli acts as a coating, lending a certain texture to the dish.A dessert usually comes at the end of a meal. But in a manner, the sewai is an exception. Something sweet is partaken of before namaaz on Eid. Says Athar, ""Having something sweet before the Eid prayers is sunnat, which means respecting the Prophet. Some households have dry dates and milk without sugar and some prefer sewai."" It is also among the first few dishes offered to guests on Eid day, we are told - to sweeten relations."

5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

Staring at glut, the potato growers in UP are seeking a MSP regime as they continue to dumping their old produce on the roads in the absence of buyers.Its an every day phenomenon. UP government should take up the issue of lifting ban on potato export with the Centre so that they get better remuneration for their produce or introduce a fixed price, said Ajay Kumar LalluThe UP government has been mulling to purchase potato and may direct schools to use more potato in the mid-day meal. The Yogi government is expected to table two amendments in Water and Sewage Act and Good and Services Tax (GST) on the fourth day of the session."
