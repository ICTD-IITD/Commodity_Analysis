58e4c27aa3d24b281b1020e6,West Bengal should try to maintain law and order: Governor Kesharai Nath Tripathi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-should-try-to-maintain-law-and-order-guv/articleshow/56361789.cms,2017-01-06,"KOLKATA: An apparently innocuous advice from the head of the state became a political hot potato on Thursday with the ruling Trinamool training its guns at Raj Bhavan like the Left did after the Nandigram killings nearly 10 years ago in March 2007. West Bengal Governor Kesharai Nath Tripathi while responding to a question on the attack on the state BJP headquarters in Kolkata soon after Trinamool Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay's arrest, said: ""Every state, irrespective of political attachment, should try to ensure peace in the state and maintain law and order."" The governor didn't name any state neither did he comment on the prevailing situation in West Bengal.While BJP leader Rahul Sinha welcomed the governor's statement saying that Tripathi had advised the state government to discharge raj dharma, Trinamool secretary general and minister Partha Chatterjee feared that BJP was trying to use the governor's office. The Left also didn't spare the governor for ""breaking silence"" only after the BJP party offices and leaders came under attack.Political parties read between the lines of his statement giving political connotations to the context in which the governor made the statement. The governor's comment comes two days after the attack on state BJP headquarters on Tuesday evening, and a day after men carrying Trinamool flags mobbed Union minister Babul Supriyo's Kolkata home and also led a siege to BJP party offices in Durgapur and Hooghly. The violence apart from the bedlam in city continued even on Thursday, the recent being the attack on state BJP president Dilip Ghosh's house. All these caught the notice of Union home minister Rajnath Singh who in turn called the state BJP president and asked him to lodge separate FIRs on each of these attacks. The Union home department has asked for an action taken report for all these cases.The continuing violence without any arrest so far doesn't speak well of the state's law and order. Such a situation also blunts the state government's writing to the Union home ministry against the deployment of CRPF jawans at the state BJP office on the day of the incident without the state government's consent. On the contrary, the Union home minister's taking interest in the happenings in West Bengal has prompted the police brass at Lalbazar to take guard. Setting aside the usual nonchalance over the last two days, Lalbazar has fortified the BJP party offices and the residence of the leaders across the state, and are likely to make some arrests before sending a report to Nabanna. The state government also wants the police to take action before it sends the action taken report to the Union home ministry.Mamata Banerjee as opposition leader had witnessed such wrangling match between the BJP government at the Centre and the Left Front government in West Bengal in 1998-99 during the violence in Keshpur, Nanoor, Suchpur when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sent a central team to Bengal to take stock of the ground reality.State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee thus doesn't want to open yet another front of confrontation with Raj Bhavan. ""The government has no problems with the present governor. We may have differences at times but some people are trying to take it too far. I had a talk with the governor even today,"" Chatterjee said, adding that his party isn't in a mood to burn bridges with Raj Bhavan."
58f97d01a3d24b0b70c4011b,‘Serious job losses are taking place’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/%E2%80%98Serious-job-losses-are-taking-place%E2%80%99/article17047770.ece,2017-01-17,"More than two months after the demonetisation, Nobel Laureate and economist Amartya Sen says that any proper economic reasoning could not have sensibly led to such a ham-handed policy. He predicts that the demonetisation will hit the economy quite drastically. In an interview with Suvojit Bagchi at his home in Santiniketan, which he visits every winter, Professor Sen spoke about the motives and impact of the move.Weve seen the primary impact of the demonetisation: long queues outside banks and shortage of cash. Now we are seeing the secondary impact, which is on the informal sector. Potato sowing in West Bengal is affected and some other businesses are collapsing. What could be the impact of all this?What you are calling the secondary impact shouldnt at all be surprising since the availability of money plays a very big part in facilitating business and trade. Particularly for small businesses (farming, for example), money is often used in the form of cash. In the long run, cashless transactions can perhaps be made into routine practice, through organisation and training, but that would take time. To act on the presumption of instant learning and institutionalisation is to place the hard-earned interests of many people without any connection to black money in serious risk.Most of what we now call cash is actually promissory notes, the emergence of which reflected a big advance over relying only on precious metals (like gold and silver). Promissory notes played a significant part in building up the financial backbone of industrial Europe. If in the 18th or 19th century, Britain had been demonetised suddenly, it would have devastated British industrial progress.Given the underdevelopment of electronic accounts and transactions, big parts of the economy are similarly vulnerable. For many, especially among the poor, making efficient and correct use of electronic payments and receipts would remain difficult to master and the possibility of losing ones money would be hard to avoid, especially given the shortage of infrastructure and the slowness of learning in using cashless transactions. The perplexing question is why some people  those who gave us demonetisation  did not foresee that this would happen and even more perplexing is how the promoters of demonetisation can be so blind even now to the overwhelming evidence of a crisis.Why has over 85 per cent of cash suddenly been taken out of circulation?The Government of India seems to have been caught in a confusion of purposes. Demonetisation has been seen both as a way of catching and eliminating black money, and as a way of moving towards a cashless economy. The former has gradually been replaced in the rhetoric of the government by the latter, which is not surprising as demonetisation can make only a very small contribution  at a huge social cost  to the black money problem. This is because only a very small proportion of black money (it is estimated to be 6 per cent or so, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. Most black money is in the form of precious metals and other assets in foreign accounts. The inconvenience and loss imposed with no black money (workers earning wages; small businesses doing trade or production; people, even housewives, keeping small savings) are much more acute than any benefit from catching relatively small amounts of black money. There are going to be huge job losses too, and the recent reports by All India Manufacturers Organisation are beginning to show that serious job losses are already happening as a result of what Londons Financial Times has called a dramatic drop in business in the 34 days since Narendra Modi announced his plan to scrap 86 per cent of its banknotes.The unrealistic governmental expectation that the black money problem can be solved, or largely removed, by demonetisation soon became clear even to the government. Then the initially trumpeted objective of getting rid of black money through demonetisation was suddenly changed into a very different objective  to leap rapidly into a cashless society. However, for such a structural change, much more time is needed, and the draconian measures  penalties installed in the hope of catching black money  are particularly ill-suited. The result has been a combination of chaos and widespread suffering rather than an orderly transition to a cashless society.Do you think there are political reasons behind the demonetisation move? The elections are coming up, so that may have been one?I dont really know. Since economic reasoning could not have sensibly led to such a ham-handed policy, it is natural for people to suspect an explanation in terms of political advantages that the ruling parties were expecting to get. It has certainly given, at least for the time being, a great political image to the Prime Minister of being a huge fighter against corruption, even though the policy has done very little to achieve anything on that front.These 50 days of hardship will not take black assets out of the economy?How could it? Only a very small proportion of black money (around 6 per cent, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. How can cleaning up of 10 per cent, at most, of black money clean it all up? Even that 10 per cent is a huge overestimate, since the black money dealers are much more skilled in overcoming official barriers than are normal honest people who are simply harassed  or made to lose their money  because of their lack of specialised skill in avoiding transaction barriers.If it is a bad policy, why do you think there havent been protests against demonetisation yet?The governments publicity surrounding this inept move has been very strong. People have been told again and again that if you are against demonetisation, you must be in favour of black money. This is a ridiculous analysis, but a readily exploitable political slogan. The persistent crisis created by demonetisation is only slowly becoming clear in terms of hard statistics as well as in public perception.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda. The truth may ultimately prevail, but the government might be able to maintain the loyalty of a large part of the public for a long time, certainly until after the U.P. elections.It is worth remembering that the notorious Irish famines in the 1840s did not immediately cause serious public agitation against the government run from London. That happened only later  much later  but when it did happen, the understanding of blame had a huge long-run impact, making the Irish people deeply suspicious of everything that the government in London did.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda"

They have been hit as big- and middle-level traders are not coming to markets to strike the deals. The prices have crashed so much that even recovering costs is becoming a challenge, they say.Potato seed growers are saying that they are facing double whammy as the season of selling potato seeds in November was lost to demonetisation and the prevailing crisis seems to be an aftermath of it. Punjab produces good quality potato seeds which are sold across the country.""No traders is coming to purchase the fresh crop and prices have nosedived in local mandis. In November, when potato seeds were to be supplied, demonetisation came. Farmers from West Bengal, which was the main market to be catered at the time, had no cash and the growers and suppliers here refused to sell on credit. Even according to conservative estimates, over four lakh bags (50kg per bag) were left in the stores in Punjab,"" said Inderdeep Singh Grewal, a major potato grower from Saraba village near Ludhiana. ""I too suffered big loss in November despite owning a cold storage,"" he added.""In November, several small growers had already sold most part of their produce and the middle and big producers were badly hit. However, this time, it's theses small growers who are worst hit as they sell their produce directly in the local mandis and don't have financial capacity to store,"" said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.""Most of the trading of potato crops is done in cash. Now traders are wary of making all transactions through banks,"" Sangha said. ""People are worried as to how would they return the crops loans,"" he added.""In Jalandhar, farmers had to sell potato at Rs 2 to 3 per kg which did not even make up the cost incurred on producing it leave aside its transportation or other charges like labour,"" Sangha said. ""We are considering to launch some protest or agitation to expose that how demonetisation has hit the farmers,"" he added.Grewal pointed out that the last two - three seasons were good for potato and the area under the crop also increased. ""This time production is good and if things don't improve a major part of the produce would simply left to be rotten,"" he said.Kala Sanghia-based potato grower Gurminder Singh, a middle-level grower, said that farmers were now striving to recover their costs only and even that seems to be an uphill task.""We don't have any money to sow maize crop and have no money to pay the land owners whose lands we have taken on annual contract,"" said Nawan Pind-based small farmer Mandeep Singh. ""For us pangs of demonetisation are far from over,"" he added."

58f508237be9e018510a1e5b,Bengal opens farm trade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170303/jsp/bengal/story_138748.jsp,2017-03-03,"Calcutta, March 2: The Mamata Banerjee government today amended the agriculture produce marketing act to allow the entry of major private players in the trade so that better prices were ensured for commodities produced by farmers. But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Balu, who buys his vegetable stock from Gudimalkapur Rythu Bazaar, said:The present rise is not due to lorry strike. There were a lot of trucks supplying vegetables to the market on Monday.

I decided not to stock the vegetable, said Ravindra Reddy, owner of Hindupriya Vegetable shop at Begumpet. The prices do keep changing every few weeks but a steep rise usually happens in the summer, he added.Interestingly, the rise in potato prices in Telangana comes at a time when the prices have gone down in West Bengal and other states due to bumper crop resulting in over supply.The Centre-owned National Horticultural Boards data for the second half of March also showed a 25 per cent decline in wholesale vegetable prices across many states. The reason for the falling prices has been attributed to farmers rushing to sell off their stock fearing spoilage of vegetables due to summer."

""Nachos is the fastest growing category in the Indian salty snacks segment and market size is pegged at Rs 200 crore and Doritos is well poised to address this robust demand,"" VP-snacks category, Jagrut Kotecha said.In the next few days, this nacho chips will be made available in top 40 cities of the country before spreading further in future.The company declined to divulge whether with Doritos, the company was focusing toward premium snacks for better margins.Asked why the company preferred Kolkata plant for Doritos manufacturing, Pradhan said, Kolkata plant is the largest plant out 19 snacks facilities with highly capable manpower that can handle specialised snacks and geographical presence.Doritos is made from corn sourced from Bihar but not through collaborative farming as of now. Present in over 55 countries globally, it will be the third master brand in PepsiCo India snacks portfolio introduced after Lay's and Kurkure.PepsiCo is engaged in collaborative farming involving 24,000 farmers and of which 12,000 is from Bengal.The F&B major outsources potato from Bengal in a big way and uses some 80 per cent of it's requirement of Kolkata plant from local sourcing.On GST, the Pepsico officials said it is not going to hurt company at least in snacks category and the company was poised for new taxation regime and business remains as usual in the transition period."

A Telegraph picture Calcutta, June 9: Bengal has emerged as the first destination for PepsiCo to churn out its entire range of snacks in India with the launch of the nacho chips line at its Sankrail factory in Howrah. The company has invested Rs 100 crore to manufacture Doritos - one of the billion-dollar brands of the American food and beverage giant - from the Bengal unit that produces all the other snacks Pepsi sells in India. The installed capacity of the new line, tucked inside the factory located on National Highway 6, will be 3,000 tonnes per annum - enough to meet the initial demand of the product. Explaining the rational of the fresh investment in the plant, Niteen Pradhan, vice-president (supply chain & operation) of PepsiCo India, said it was logical for Pepsi to choose Sankrail. ""It is one of the best we have globally in terms of capabilities. Close proximity to the source of corn also helped,"" Pradhan said after the launch of Doritos in Calcutta today. Pepsi, which works with 12,000 potato farmers in Bengal to manufacture Lays potato chips, is sourcing two special varieties of corn from Bihar's Purnea. Going forward, the company may procure from West Dinajpur district in north Bengal. ""We are always keen to procure raw material close to the plant. As volume picks up, we hope to start procuring from Bengal too as it would bring down the logistic cost,"" he said. The Sankrail plant, which came up in 2004 at Sudha Ras food park of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, also produces Kurkure and Cheetos - two other snacks from the PepsiCo stable available in India. PepsiCo has 62 manufacturing facilities in India, 43 for beverages and 19 for snacks. However, only a handful of them are owned and operated by the company, the majority being contract manufacturers. Roll-out plans PepsiCo started test marketing imported Doritos in select markets before it started producing from the Bengal plant. Available in two varieties - cheese and sweet chilli - the company plans to leverage its distribution network to reach out to traditional and modern trade in 40 cities, apart from offering online. Jagrut Kotecha, vice-president (snacks) of PepsiCo India, said nachos is the fastest growing category in the Indian salty snacks segment. ""The market size is Rs 200 crore (about 4,000 tonne in terms of volume) and growing by 40-45 per cent,"" he said. Doritos would be the third master brand from PepsiCo in India. ""We have come with three pack sizes, targeting the 18-24 age category in urban and semi-urban localities,"" Kotecha added. Cornitos of Greendot Health Food is the market leader in tortilla corn chips, popularly known as nachos."

Farmers say there is no point selling the produce as they are not even able to get back their investment due to the low price. It is estimated that around 6 crore sacks of 50 kg each, totaling 30 lakh ton, are stored in Agra region alone. State horticulture department has now appealed to farmers not to hoard the tuber. Recently government determined minimum support price for procurement of potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal, but farmers said it is too low to benefit them.There are around 240 cold storage units in Agra. All of them are completely filled with potatoes, with farmers refusing to take them out till the prices become better.According to horticulture department officials, In August the potato crop of Karnataka will hit the market. This may result in a sudden fall in the price of the stored potatoes. Therefore farmers in the state have been advised to continue selling the stored produce to avoid even worse losses.Potato is a major crop in the district, cultivated in around 72,000 hectares of land. Agra division, which includes Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri, is one of the major producers of the tuber, which is supplied to states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.District horticulture officer Anita Singh said, ""The current potato prices are much lower than in previous years. In the near future, there is no significant scope for increase in potato prices. To avoid major losses, farmers should slowly continue to sell their produce. Depending on quality, the present market rate of potato is Rs 300 to 600 per quintal whereas it should be between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per quintal.""According to department officials, increased in production of potato and a stop on supply to Pakistan and some other neigbouring countries is one of the reasons behind the drop in prices.Rakesh Goyal, secretary of Agra Cold Storage Association said, ""Compared to previous years, this time around 12% more potato came for storage. But due to low prices, few farmers are taking away their produce.""According to market experts, till June 20 around 25% of the produce should have been sold. But business has witnessed fall of 12%.Khandoli farmer Sharvan Singh said, ""Government has turned farmers into a joke. The minimum support price is not reasonable at all. It doesn't even pay for the investment we made in the crop.""Agra Potato Business Association general secretary Aamir Bhai said, ""Ever since demonetization, business has continued to be derailed. Farmers will be forced to throw their produce on the roads, but the government does not seem to be concerned.""Farmer Gyan Singh Sikarwar said, ""Next year I will not produce potato at any cost. I am thinking of sowing some other crop but that needs money too. I already have a pending loan of Rs 5,000 and banks have told us we will not get further loan till the previous ones are waived by the government."""

He said small and marginal traders were never subjected to tax before.According to him, the imposition of GST on the sector will make it uncompetitive.CPI(M) leader C P Narayanan demanded that items relating to the disabled people should removed from the GST net.Another CPI(M) member Ritabrata Banerjee spoke about the complexities in the new indirect tax regime which came into force from July 1.Rajeev Shukla of Congress said there was lack of coordination between the Centre and the states on the implementation of GST.Besides the problems facing the textile sector, members also raised issues relating to the floods in Assam and Odisha and farmers' problems.Digvijaya Singh of Congress said the condition of farmers was worsening and farmers' suicides have increased by 42 per cent during the NDA rule.He particularly highlighted the fall in prices of pulses, potato and onion. He has also sought a detailed discussion on the farmers issue.Raising the issue of floods in Assam, Congress member Sanjay Sinh demanded that the government should start relief measures on a war-footing and announce a package after assessing the damage.His party colleague Ripun Bora criticised the BJP-led state government saying it has not prepared any contingency plan for tackling the floods.BJD member Dilip Tirkey demanded special relief package for people affected by floods in certain districts of Odisha, including Kalahandi.Naresh Agrawal (SP) expressed concern over ""vulgar"" and misleading advertisments being aired on television channels.He said there should be regulations to check such advertisements to protect consumer interest.Veteran Congress leader Motilal Vora asked the government to construct good roads along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab saying these were in very bad condition.Another Congress member Viplove Thakur highlighted the plight of women, allegedly being brought to Haryana from different parts of the country for marriage as the state's sex ratio was bad.She demanded that the government should take steps on the issue seriously.Deputy Chairman P J Kurien asked Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs M A Naqvi to take note of it."

There are hardly any buyers for our crop. Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in drop of bulk orders from big markets like Delhi and other major cities, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu.He said that potato growers have kept the eatables and seed potatoes in cold storage since the last crop season in anticipation of selling the produce at a better price later.But now there are fewer buyers and poor prices. The crop is still lying and now when the new season crop will hit the market (in next few months) the loss of growers would only aggravate, he added.Facing hardships due to demonetisation, the potato seed growers from Punjab have demanded an immediate freight subsidy so that the growers can transport their crop to other States and fetch some returns.Also, the growers have urged the State government to waive crop loans of potato growers besides asking the State agencies to intervene and generate markets at the national and international level.Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country including West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP , MP and Odisha. Potato seed is usually supplied from last week of October to mid-December every year."

A total of 69 species of butterflies belonging to 54 genera and five families were recorded from the study area. Family Nymphalidae was the most dominant among the five families with 22 species, followed by Lycaenidae, comprising of 19 species, the paper titled A study of butterfly diversity in Singur says.Five of the species found in Singur are rare and to be protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They include species like the Tree Flitter, Striped Albatross, Pea Blue, Common Indian Crow and Danaid Eggfly. The other interesting species found here include the Zebra Blue, the Common Banded Peacock and the Indian Skipper.The paper, authored by researchers Pritam K. Dey, Arajush Payra and Krishnendu Mondal, was published in June 2017 in the environmental journal e- planet . The study was carried out from March 2015 to November 2016, and most butterflies were observed between 8 a.m. and noon.Detailed study in futureThe presence of 69 species of butterflies in Singur points out that the butterfly diversity of the region is high. This is a preliminary study. More detailed studies in future can bring out more species. What is striking about Singur is that the area is not only rich in butterfly diversity but also in the diversity of frogs and birds, Mr. Dey said.Researchers found butterflies in the rice and vegetable fields of the area, as well as in bushes and shrubs along railway lines and National Highways.No forested landSingur has no forested land and the area is known for rice, potato and vegetable cultivation.Mr. Dey said that more intensive studies on different ecological parameters that can help access diversity of Singurs fauna are being planned.The presence of so many species of butterflies has provided a great deal of joy to the farmers who had waged a long battle against the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) led West Bengal government against the acquisition of 997 acres of agricultural land for Tata Motors Nano car plant in Singur.While our struggle was aimed at the return of the land acquired for the proposed car plant, we are happy that it has helped the environment of Singur. There would have not so many butterflies had the car plant been operational, said Mahabdeb Das, a farmer who was at the forefront of the land acquisition struggle. He was pleasantly surprised to learn about the butterfly diversity of the region.On August 30, 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the Left Front governments acquisition of 997 acres of land for the car plant in Singur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee returned the acquired land to farmers on September 14, 2016."

All my concentration was only on clicking the photograph.The photograph taken on State Highway 9 in Jhargram district of West Bengal was awarded the Sanctuary Wildlife Photography Award 2017, felicitated by a Mumbai-based wildlife photography magazine Sanctuary Asia on Sunday.Titled 'Hell is Here', Sanctuary Asia, on its Facebook page, described the incident with a caption: ""In West Bengal, this sort of humiliation of pachyderms is routine, as it is in the other elephant-range states of Assam, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and more. India is the world's stronghold for the Asian elephant and boasts over 70 per cent of the global population of the species. But this achievement rings hollow as vital elephant habitats and routes continue to be ravaged, and human-elephant conflict escalates to a fatal degree. ""The award is an attempt to raise awareness about the treatment of pachyderms in the country, Sanctuary Asia editor Anirudh Nair told the New Indian Express. ""By awarding the photograph, we wanted to raise awareness on the practice of violence against elephants in West Bengal and in other parts of the country, he added.Human-elephant conflict is rife along the elephant corridor in Bankura and Jhargram districts of the state. While villagers complain that 40-50 strong herds of elephants destroy their ripe crops and smash their homes, their retaliation has traditionally been violent.Crackers are bursted and fires raged to ward off the herds but due to this practice, the elephants get more enraged and cause even more damage to the public.Hazra said, The calf may not have been intentionally set on fire by the villagers living in the vicinity of the elephant corridor that stretches from southwestern West Bengal up to Saranda forest in Jharkhand, but bursting crackers and throwing fireballs on elephant herds has been a common practice in this part of West Bengal.In a separates comment to the Sanctuary Asia Facebook post, Mainaz Mazumdar, from Baroja village of Bankura district in West Bengal said, Our village is frequently invaded by such wild and unruly animals that come all the way from dalma range of forests. The fault, of course, lies with us. Because of heavy habitat destructions (in this case the forest) the elephants are coming down onto the settlements. This has been a great problem over the years.When the horde of elephants comes near to a village the respective forest office hires people to drive them back to the Jungle. These people are locally known as Hulia Party. They use strong and loud firecrackers, big and bright lights, harpoons, tin drums to make noises to scare them off, torches and bow and arrow. There is no controversy that these poor creatures suffered greatly at our hands. But it is also true that they wrecked havoc on these poor peasants that are entirely dependent on agriculture. They wasted paddy fields, potato fields, fields of wheat and so on. Many farmers committed suicide because of these damages. But worse still, they killed innocent people too.The silver lining amongst all of this gloom is that now the forest department has reclaimed their senses and built deep trenches along the perimeter of the jungle fenced with electrical wire. That electrified fence won't kill them but it's strong enough to repel them. We left much of the worse behind us, Mazumdar added.a"

Given the glut, many farmers have already abandoned their potato stocks in cold storages as there are no signs of price recovery.Farmers say ideally a 50kg sack of potatoes should be priced Rs 380, but they are getting only Rs 50 for it in the wholesale markets. ""There are trollies full of potatoes as villagers are offering to sell potatoes at as low as Rs 2 per kg. After the state government failed to provide any relief, farmers had dumped potatoes in Mohali last month. With no solution in sight, many farmers plan to dump potatoes in the rivers in the coming weeks,"" said Harinder Singh , general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal).Jang Bahadur Singh Sangha, secretary general of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON), suggested the Centre should have intervened after the crisis began after demonetisation. ""The solution lies in concrete steps such as setting up Potato Board , involving think tanks for long-term policies and getting rid of randomness in policy so that initiatives to export potatoes can work. The international community is expecting from us, but archaic steps like fixing minimum export price hold the farmers back.""The bad run for potato farmers started last year as 70% of the crop was pushed into cold storages and potato seed buyers from West Bengal did not turn up.

The suicide comes at a time when West Bengal has witnessed a bumper potato harvest for the second year running.The deceased, Golak Bijari Ullal, had taken loans from the Cooperative Bank and moneylenders to grow potatoes on his 20 bigha plot.A resident of Muzaffarpur village in Harimkhola, Golaks son Tarakhnath Ullal said: We have a debt of Rs 5 lakh We had grown potato because the crop had been doing so well. While some of the crop was destroyed because of the untimely rain there were months when there was no rain. But the potato crop itself has done well in the state and thus, the prices plummeted. We couldnt even recover our investment.On Friday morning, finding his fathers room locked, the family called the police. My father did not open the door. The police broke the door and found him hanging, said Tarakhnath.BJPs OBC Morcha state president Sapan Das, who hails from Hooghly, has paid a visit to the family. Blaming the Trinamool Congress government for the death, he said: Farmers are in trouble if crops dont do well they are in trouble even when crops do well. The bumper crop has made the price of potatoes drop. While the market price of potato is substantial even now, farmers dont get this priceThe state government buys the crop from farmers at Rs 6 per kg While the current market price is Rs 8 per kg, the farmers are investing the same amount in the crop So, they are not making any money Middlemen from the ruling party buy the crop at a lower price from farmers and sell it at a higher price. Farmers are thus pushed to commit suicide, he alleged.Pal maintained a healthy price for the farmers is Rs 14 to Rs 15 per kg. The government buys 40 kg of potato for Rs 120 It should instead buy 10 kg at this price, he said. In case of wheat surplus, the crop can be processed and stored. This is not the case with potatoes, as it is perishable. There arent enough storages, which the government is supposed to build. And even when storages are built, these are taken over by TMC workers and middlemen, alleged Pal.Bengal is one of the largest producers of potato in the country with main cultivating areas in Burdwan, Hooghly and Aram-bagh. During 2016 state polls, the Left had raised the issue of farmer suicide. According to CPM, 200 farmers have committed suicide in the last three years in Bengal, with 116 such cases in Burdwan.Kisan Sabha state secretary Amar Haldar said the main cause of farmer suicides is debt. The government has not made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give a subsidy to farmers for crop cutting. This has been removed by the Mamata government. Moreover, the production cost of crops has increased  prices of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, electricity have increased. The fertiliser subsidy has also been removed.For the first time in 50 years, potato farmers dont have water to irrigate their crops. The crops fail, farmers go to moneylenders and are then unable to pay off their loans, he said.In 2015, 12 potato farmers had committed suicide in Bengal. A bumper harvest of 120 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 led to a similar crisis, resulting in the price of potatoes falling to Rs 3 to Rs 5 per kg. While in 2012, Bengal was not among top five states in terms of suicides, by 2013, it contributed to 9.7 per cent of all suicides. Unlike Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where the cities recorded highest number of suicides, Kolkata recorded 360 out of a total of 14,310 suicides in 2014, with most suicides taking place in rural Bengal.Despite repeated attempts, Agriculture Minister Ashis Banerjee was not available for comments.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"
5b509b259855b708a7cccd3d,Winter rain to delay state potato harvest,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/winter-rain-to-delay-state-potato-harvest/articleshow/62028568.cms,2017-12-12,"Hooghly: The surprise showers over the last two days have taken a toll on the early variety of potato in vast stretches of West Midnapore, Bankura and Burdwan, forcing farmers to sow seeds afresh. The delay in sowing, along with a projected drop in the total acreage of potato this season, may lead to a supply crunch because the new variety is likely to reach the market earliest by March, instead of February. The notun aloo selling in the retail market now at Rs 25-30 a kilo are those from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Potato grower Chandranath Jana from Bankuras Jaipur said: I took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the rural cooperative to cultivate the tuber on a bigha (one-third acre) of land. The saplings have now all gone under water. The cooperative wont sanction loans unless I repay the earlier one and I now have to borrow from elsewhere to sow the seeds.A rough calculation of the input costs (seeds and fertilizer) and labour shows that a farmer needs Rs 10,000-12,000 per bigha to grow the tuber  costlier than sowing paddy. Yet, farmers took the potato route after incurring loss in the aman paddy because a substantial part of the crop was wasted while harvesting during the downpour. The damage of the early variety of potato will affect the sowing of the regular variety, particularly in the areas of Chandrakona and Garbeta in West Midnapore, Jaipur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur in Bankura, and Jabalpur and Kalna in Burdwan.However, these are only a portion of the areas that cultivate the early variety. Many farmers in Hooghly and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur didnt go for the early variety sowing after the November rain. The untimely rain has damaged the crop in parts of the entire 4.25 lakh hectares. It didnt have any major effect in Hooghly, which alone produces one-third of the crop. However, the sudden rise in minimum temperature will delay the sowing of the regular variety (jyoti). If it persists, the total acreage of the tuber may fall by 25,000-40,000 hectares this season. Potato needs the chill by December-January for better productivity, said Pradip Majumdar, agro-expert and adviser to the chief minister.The saving grace for consumers is the 17.5 lakh tonnes of potato available in cold storages that can feed Bengal of 5 lakh tonnes a month for the next three months, till the new crop arrives in March. Patitpaban De of the West Bengal Cold Storage Owners Association said the monthly output from Bengal was 7 lakh tonnes. Des claim puts a question mark on the steady supply from cold storages till March, leaving a gap of 15 to 20 days in February when people wont buy the last lot of the stored tuber while the new crop will take some more time to reach the market. Potato, thus, may get expensive for a fortnight at the end of February. But Bengal farmers wont be able to make the fast money. Instead, potato traders from Jalandhar and Amritsar in Punjab, and Farukabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh are likely to take advantage of the supply crunch."
