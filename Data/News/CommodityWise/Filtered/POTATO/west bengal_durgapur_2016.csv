Besides, horticulture production also showed continuous increase unlike foodgrain output which reported a decline in 2014-15 as compared to 2013-14.The figures are part of the horticultural statistics, released by the agriculture ministry on Thursday. The report - Horticultural Statistics at a Glance 2015 - shows that while Maharashtra tops the list of states in terms of leading fruit-producing states, West Bengal is at top in terms of vegetable production in 2013-14.Similarly, Tamil Nadu is the top flower producing state while Gujarat is the leading spices producing state. Tamil Nadu is also at the top in the list of plantation-producing states in the same year.Horticultural crops comprise of fruits, vegetables, plantation crops, flowers, spices and aromatics, while the foodgrains basket contains wheat, rice, coarse cereals, oil seeds and pulses.Noting the consumption pattern, the publication said that the nutritional intake from fruits and vegetables is higher among urban population than that of rural population.Releasing the first issue of such detailed compilation, comprising district-wise statistics of horticultural output in the country, agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said, ""The data would help policy planners, farmers and other stakeholders"".The publication notes that India has witnessed voluminous increase in horticulture production over the last few years. ""Significant progress has been made in area expansion resulting in higher production"", it says.Data show that fruits and vegetables account for nearly 90% of the total horticulture production in India which is, at present, the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world. The country is, in fact, the leader in several horticultural crops including mango, banana, papaya, cashew nut, areca nut, potato and lady's finger.On the export front, the report notes that grapes occupy the premier position with 107.3 thousand tonnes worth Rs 1,08,649 lakh of exports, followed by banana and mango. Even exports of fresh vegetables have been on the rise.The publication presents a comprehensive picture of the Indian horticulture sector by using statistical data across states, districts and time periods, covering diverse aspects such as area, production, productivity, growth trends, percentage share and value of output for major horticultural crops.Other aspects covered are outlays and expenditure under horticultural activities, monthly series of prices and arrivals over past year in respect of onion, potato and tomato; inputs for horticultural crops; exports and imports; infrastructure availability and India's position in world scenario of horticulture production."

(Express Photo: Subham Dutta) Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee greets ITC Chairman Y C Deveshwar at Panchla in Howrah Wednesday. (Express Photo: Subham Dutta)THE ITC Wednesday unveiled three projects in West Bengal involving an investment of Rs 3,000 crore as Chief Minister Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stressed on the need to cooperate with the industry to take the state on progress path.Let us not disturb the industry. Let us fully cooperate with them. When the world is moving ahead, Bengal cannot afford to sit back. Collective interest is bigger than individual interest, Mamata said after laying the foundation stone of an integrated consumer goods manufacturing unit at Panchla in Howrah and an IT Park at Rajarhat near Kolkata. Mamata also pre-commissioned another consumer goods manufacturing facility at Uluberia, also at Howrah.Assuring ITC Chairman Y C Deveshwar that her government would provide any cooperation necessary for more such projects in the future, the Chief Minister said West Bengal had over one lakh acres in terms of land bank which could be made available for industrial development.All we need is the demand. If you ask us for land for your projects, you will have it, Mamata claimed.We will have to do this for the good of the stateOnce a big industry comes, many ancillary units also come up creating jobs for the youth, she said, adding that that government was happy to collaborate wit an agro-based industry.Share This Article Related Article Bengal Global Business Summit: This meet is more than just a ritual, says Mukesh AmbaniBengal Global Business Summit: This meet is more than just a ritual, says Mukesh Ambani Day 1: Investment pledge worth Rs 93,600 croreDay 1: Investment pledge worth Rs 93,600 crore Mamata draws India Inc. crowd,promisesMamata draws India Inc. crowd,promises Mamata hardsells Bengal to India Inc.Mamata hardsells Bengal to India Inc. Mamata Banerjee: Land acquisition not to be a problem for projects in hand in West BengalMamata pitches for investment as she plays host to industry captainsPointing to the growing per capita income of the state, Mamata said, Bengal is an agriculture-driven state. Setting up food processing units is naturally the next step for us. Once these units come up, ancillary industries will also follow. Bengal is witnessing a growth of 10.5 per cent which is far higher than the national growth of 7.5 per cent. The per capita income has doubled and we have recorded an infrastructure growth of 600 per cent and development growth of 300 per cent.While agreeing that the growing per capita income should attract industry to Bengal, the ITC Chairman also admitted that the state government was unable to provide the group with contiguous plots. We had asked for 60 acres, but we got 40 acres at one place and another 18 acres at another. If we want to expand and increase production, it is more beneficial to get contiguous plots. For instance, we want to set up a cold chain and start manufacturing frozen foods. Right now we simply dont have the land for that, said Deveshwar, adding that if its gets better opportunities elsewhere, the group would expand outside the state.While Mamata thanked ITC for not shifting its headquarters from Kolkata, Deveshwar said, The ITC Group had its headquarters in Kolkata since 1910. But only three of our present 12 Bengal units existed in the state till five years ago. The rest have come up in Mamata Banerjees tenure and we are extremely grateful to the CM and her government for facilitating this.ITC would engage more with the farmers of the state, Deveshwar said, adding that it was experimenting with the manufacture of a special variety of seeds, which will not absorb moisture. The company is also developing a special kind of potato seeds as well.The integrated consumer goods manufacturing facility at Panchla is spread over 800,000 feet and will manufacture packaged food, including noodles and potato chips, and is expected to be commissioned by January next year.The facility at Uluberia is being built over 400,000 square feet and is likely to be completed by May 2016.The IT park at Rajarhat will come up in phases over 27 lakh square feet of built up space. The project to be completed by 2018, will create direct employment for 5,000 people.The ITC is further developing a Royal Bengal hotel next to the Shonar Bangla hotel in Kolkata. With an investment of Rs 1000 crores, the new hotel is set to be ready by the end of next year.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

C. Deveshwar said.Talking to reporters after unveiling three green field projects, Mr. Deveshwar said the plan could be taken forward if the company had more land at its integrated consumer goods manufacturing facility in Uluberia in Howrah District.While we are exporting shrimps now, we could become a branded player in the frozen shrimp market, taking West Bengal shrimps all over India, he said.We are targeting a Rs.one-lakh crore turnover from new-FMCG business. We need to enter new categories.. it cannot be done only through the existing business, Mr. Deveshwar said.ITC has set this target for 2025-30, planning to emerge as the top FMCG company. ITCs non-cigarette business now stands at over Rs. 20,000 crore.Earlier, he urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for some additional land (around 40 acre) for setting up a cold chain and frozen food facilities at Uluberia where it will commission by May 2016 a four-lakh square feet facility for making atta (wheat flour), biscuits and snacks.He said industrial land was lying unutilised close by.We could scale up tomorrow.. planning a frozen food or a fruit juice line, Mr. Deveshwar said.Ms. Banerjee also laid the foundation stone for a larger unit for making noodles and potato chips.The two initiatives would entail Rs.3,000 crore investment, Mr. Deveshwar said. While pointing out that ITC was experimenting with cultivation of a moisture-resistant wheat strain for West Bengal, its home state, he said the company had taken a leap of faith.He also said the state government could show case these projects for attracting investors.ITCs non-cigarette business now stands at over Rs. 20,000 crore."

The price of potato rose from Rs 11 to Rs 16 over the last couple of days.In the harvest season, prices are going over the roof with the availability of new crops in the market. ""This has given away the clear failure of government policies and programmes announced to deal with crisis,"" said Benudhar Samal, a bank employee.Sources have revealed potato production has dropped by 20-30% across India this year, leading to a price rise in the major potato-producing state, West Bengal, from where Odisha imports a major portion of its needs. There has been a drop of over 40% in potato production in Odisha as well, sources said.The state produces about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of potato from 15,000 hectares of farmland every year, against the requirement of 9.86 lakh metric tonnes per year.""We are keeping a close watch on the market and asked district collectors to take action against those who are charging higher rates from consumers. The Essential Commodities Act will be followed strictly in the state,"" said food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma.The government's handling of the situation came under fire.""On Tuesday, the wholesale price of potato was Rs 1,150 per quintal. When the wholesale price of potato is Rs 11.50 per kg, its retail price should be Rs 2 to Rs 2.5 extra. It is the state government that is answerable for the exorbitant rate of Rs 16 per kg,"" said general secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Sangha, Sudhakar Panda. ""The government has failed to keep its promise of providing quality seeds and other benefits to potato farmers in time and the adverse weather conditions have led to huge loss of potato in the state,"" Panda added."

District officials said if potato prices keep soaring, measures will be taken to counter this. ""Our officials are keeping a close watch on the situation. If necessary, we will make arrangements to sell potato at government-run fair price shops,"" said collector Nirmal Mishra.As per the direction of the state government, the district administration will also start conducting surprise raids on potato wholesalers and their godowns located at Chhatra Bazaar and Krushak Bazaar Thursday onwards to check the price rise in retail markets.When potato prices had skyrocketed in the state earlier, Cuttack was among the first few districts to start selling the vegetable at fair price shops. Besides, special teams will conduct raids on potato godowns in the city to keep a check on hoarding. Retailers will also be directed to sell the vegetable at appropriate prices.The vegetable traders' association has ruled out the possibility of hoarding in Cuttack. There are hardly 8-10 big potato wholesalers in the city. ""It is difficult for traders to hoard potatoes as we do not have well-equipped cold storages to stock the vegetables. In fact, 5-7% of the vegetables rot during transportation. So we can't risk stocking it,"" said secretary of Chhatra Bazaar vegetable traders' association, Debendra Sahoo.Sahoo said attributed the price rise to low production in West Bengal. ""This year, West Bengal's potato production has gone down by almost 30-40%,"" added Sahoo. Traders in Cuttack import potato from West Bengal. On Tuesday, the wholesale price of a kg of potato was Rs 13 while it was sold in the retail market at Rs 16 to Rs 18."

Potato price is high across the country. There is no point in buying potatoes at a high price from other states and selling at much higher price to consumers here. Therefore, we decided to stop the procurement process and manage with the existing stock,"" said cooperation minister Damodar Rout.Agriculture, food supplies and consumer welfare and agriculture departments called a joint meeting on Monday following criticism that lack of coordination between the departments and failure of potato mission led to the price rise in the state.

It depends heavily on West Bengal to meet its requirement. When the scarcity was acute a few years ago, the State government had announced a potato mission for increasing production of tuber. However, the mission failed to yield desired results.According to the Ministers, the area of potato cultivation has been increased from 15,805 hectare to 25,270 hectare under the mission. Due to rise in temperature and fewer cold days, the potato cultivation was hit, the Ministers said.The Ministers, however, said potato scarcity was felt all over the country. While per kg price in Kolkata is Rs.14, it is Rs.20 in Chennai, Mumbai (Rs.19), New Delhi (Rs.14), Bhubaneswar (Rs.16) and Sambalpur (Rs.16), they said.In view of rising potato prices, the government on Monday declared to make enforcement activities stricter in order to ensure stability and take stringent action against hoarders.

This disclosure could become a political hot potato in the upcoming West Bengal polls.Documents belonging to the PMO on the Justice Mukherjee commission of inquiry mention that some files, including a proposal to keep Bose's ashes in a memorial at Delhi's Red Fort, were either not ""readily traceable"" or ""destroyed"". Most of the files are likely to have been destroyed in the 60s and 70s, one file noting points out.The commission had sought photocopies of orders regarding destruction of filesdocuments concerning Netaji as also photocopies of the lists of files documents destroyed.The PMO had informed the commission that ""one file no. 12(226)56-PM has been destroyed on 6.3.1972; certain documents of file no. 23(156)51-PM have been destroyed while recording that file; and one file no. 2(381)60-66PM (proposal to bring Shri Subhas Chandra Bose's ashes from Tokyo to put up a memorial to him in front of the Red Fort in Delhi) is not readily tracea ble in our records"". It is not immediate ly clear why these documents were de stroyed or what their exact contents were, though there have been reports that Bose's death in the 1945 aircrash was a smokescreen allowing him to es cape to the then USSR.Author Anuj Dhar, who has done ex tensive research on Netaji, said, ""I hate to draw this parallel, but just as the gov ernment is making an inquiry into missing correspondence concerning the Ishrat Jahan case, they should find out how documents of historical im portance were destroyed by Congress governments.

The 50 files declassified on Tuesday include 10 from the PMO, 10 from MHA and 30 from MEA, and pertain to the period 1956-2009.

As compared to the price of Rs5-6 per kg in 2015, local farmers are currently fetching Rs10 per kg in the wholesale markets, thanks to lower production in other states.Top potato growing states -Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal -have seen production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. Although the yield in Gujarat, too, has dipped by 10% this year, unlike other major states Gujarat has registered an increase in potato production on account of higher acreage. In fact, the potato output has galloped substantially over the last two years.The potato production in an area of one lakh hectare was around 35 lakh tonnes as against 31 lakh tonnes of 2015 and 23 lakh tonnes in 2014.Agriculture minister, Babubhai Bokhiriya, said, ""There is low potato production in the country, barring Gujarat, and hence the farmers are getting good prices. The other reason being that the state has, in the last one year, increased its cold storage capacity, which has led to better storage facilities, and hence the farmers expecting a higher price later are storing their produce, rather than selling on spot,"" he said.""Last year, there was a glut in the market. The supply is higher this year, but the excess output has been absorbed by increase in storage capacity providing a much needed cushion to the farmers. The prices would have fallen this year, too, had there been a rise in potato production across the country,"" said Ashish Guru, president, Gujarat Cold Storage Association.The cold storage capacity in Gujarat saw addition of approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50 kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes, while the annual consumption of potato in the state is 20 lakh tonnes. The lower output in other states kept the prices of vegetable firm, and farmers in Gujarat are able to reap the benefits due to availability of cold storages. ""The wholesale prices had plummeted to Rs 5-6 per kg in Gujarat last year due to glut in the market. However, the prices have remained at Rs 10-13 per kg in 2016 much to the relief of farmers,"" Guru added.Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda. Gujarat potatoes are supplied to Maharashtra and states in south India, and are exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mauritius."

The collapse of the Kolkata flyover, which killed 27 people, was described by its builders as an act of God, an expression that has a specific legal meaning.Twenty-three days after a section of Vivekananda Flyover in Girish Park area of north Kolkata caved in, killing 27 people, leaving 80 others injured and turning into a political hot potato for the ruling Trinamool Congress, the last of the debris was cleared on Saturday.The West Bengal government had been eager to clear the debris not just to clear a traffic bottleneck on a busy commercial street in a congested part of the city but also to remove from sight what was being used by the Opposition parties as an election issue.After the state chief secretary put in a request with the Railway Board chairman, the Indian Railways, on April 7, had accepted what looked like an engineering challenge. The PSU Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) was given the job, even though no railway arm had any experience in taking on an assignment like this before.The intended 2.2-km under-construction flyover, which collapsed after a 490-foot steel span fell during construction, thew up a unique challenge. Its girders were woefully close to decades-old buildings on both sides of the road. The structure, officials said, had to be cut into large pieces and moved without damaging the buildings and creating civilian distress.RVNL pressed into service several huge diamond cutters to cut the flyovers remains into pieces and deployed a 180-ton crane to move the material. Satish Agnihotri, CMD, RVNL, said: Since the buildings were so close to the flyover, we could not risk any structure falling on them while work was going on. So we joined the two flanks of the bridge by welding (them) so that it doesnt collapse on the road.After about 10 days of work, the accumulated debris several truckloads  were handed over to the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, which owns the bridge and had awarded the work contract to the Hyderabad-based firm IVRCL.Under fire, the Trinamool Congress had maintained that work contract of the flyover was awarded by the erstwhile Left Front government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

As the Portuguese coast recedes and our ship edges into Spanish waters, vora's reticence about the communist upsurge in the surrounding region called Alentejo reminds me of the stonewall I encountered in Hyderabad trying to talk of the Telangana revolt. Most people assumed I meant the agitation for a separate state. Few even remembered the earlier armed rising linked to the 1948 Calcutta Conference which also resulted in Malaya's prolonged and bloody Emergency. ""In the Alentejo, you travel naturally with and to History,"" writes a local chronicler. It didn't know a revolution that never was like West Bengal where revolution means speeches, and revolutionaries fatten in office for decade after decade. Alentejo's was a revolution that failed like Telangana's. But without the violence. It also suffered from a confusion of aims. Both mixed the local with the global. The immediate impetus in Telangana was opposition to the Nizam of Hyderabad's regime. However, the Calcutta Conference spoke of a wider ideological purpose. In fact, many believe the insurrection petered out because Moscow's rapprochement with New Delhi prompted the Comintern to abandon the conference's ostensible hosts, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. The peasantry around vora where we spent several delightful days also felt betrayed. vora is a charming medieval walled town whose university students in black medallion-studded cloaks over their frock coats sing and dance in the cobbled central square, the Praa do Giraldo, chasing away horrible memories of the burnings that took place there during the Inquisition. Founded in 1559, the university closed down in 1759, when the authoritarian prime minister of the day turned out the Jesuits. It didn't reopen until 1973. vora was under Muslim rule for 400 years. They came to help a local contender for power and stayed to consolidate their own rule. The real contradiction was between radical young officers of the Movimento das Foras Armadas and peasant and student protesters clamouring for reform in 1974. The officers overthrew Portugal's long dictatorship in a last-ditch attempt to pre-empt more drastic change. The protesters in the streets who gave them carnations which they put into the barrels of their guns - hence the name Carnation Revolution - hoped for a drastic social and political transformation. The organizations of workers and young people that sprouted all over the Alentejo resembled the proletarian councils (soviets) associated with Russia's October Revolution. Ordinary soldiers weary of war also set up their own committees to demand democratic rights and an end to Lisbon's imperialist wars. If national liberation movements could rock the foundations of colonial rule in the so-called ""overseas provinces"" of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and So Tom, they asked, why should the metropole remain under the corporatist yoke? Landless labourers who toiled on the great estates called latifundio seized the fields they farmed. According to government estimates, about 2,200,000 acres were occupied. Some 1,000 estates were collectivized. Something like the Spanish Civil War seems to have been fought out in miniature but with roles reversed. Claiming that fascism had to be defeated, Portugal's reformist Socialist Party and Stalinist Communist Party sprang to support the MFA and the junta it had installed. Social historians believe they destroyed the chance of a socialist revolution. Lisbon promulgated the Land Reform Review Law in 1977. The collectives were dissolved. The original owners repossessed the latifundio. Portugal's aristocracy has retained its wealth through centuries of upheavals. Some of the mansions and manor houses have been in the same family for generations. Hoardings in the vineyards along the road from vora to Lisbon proudly proclaim the ownership of families like the Fonsecas. No lingering memory of the 1974 uprising disturbs vora's tranquillity. The official justification is that the Alentejo collective farms could not be modernized. In the mid-1980s, agricultural productivity was half that of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the European average. Land holdings were polarized between small and fragmented family farms in the north and inefficiently large collectives in the south. Even Bangladeshi immigrants who had managed to acquire Portuguese work permits fled to more prosperous economies. Decollectivization was said to be the only hope. I learnt more about vora and its unexpected links with Bengal from Trilokesh Mukherjee, my graphic artist friend who lived in the Dordogne in France for many years. Now he seems to spend more time in Oxford and South Wales but remains a storehouse of the minutiae of Indo-European culture. Trilokesh told me vora was the birthplace of Manuel da Assumpo, an Augustinian monk who spent many years near Dhaka and is credited with writing and printing the first dictionary and grammar of the Bengali language, Vocabulario em idioma bengalla e portugueza. ""The Portuguese even cast some Tamil and Malayalam types. But they never could cast Bengali types."" It's a matter of everlasting regret to Trilokesh that this final triumph eluded the Portuguese. ""The first book to be printed in Bengali was printed in Lisbon though the writer, translator and the compiler came from vora,"" he wrote. Alas, it was set in Latin type. vora's state library treasures another historic document, the manuscript of Brahman-Roman-Kyathalik-Samvada: an argument on Law between a Roman Catholic and a Brahmin by the Bengali Dom Antonio de Rozario. Dom Antonio's life is shrouded in mystery. No one knows his Bengali name. He was apparently a princeling of Bhusana, which some place near Dhaka and others near Jessore. According to one version, Mug pirates took him to Arakan as their prisoner. Another has it he was sold into slavery in Goa. Both agree that another Portuguese Augustinian priest was his saviour and that he converted to Christianity. The reinvented Dom Antonio is believed to have converted 30,000 Hindus in and around his estate, thereby arousing the wrath of the Jesuits in Goa who sent a senior priest to investigate. He confirmed Dom Antonio's proselytizing success but added the converts had little knowledge of Christianity and had been paid to be baptized. It must be added before ghar wapsi fanatics reach for their purifying water that this was the competing camp's verdict. No rivalry is more relentlessly bitter than that between the pious who are convinced of their monopoly of the truth. Religion and language are the two main links. Vasco da Gama wasn't quite the pirate in priest's clothing that Bharatiya Janata Party loyalists made out on the 400th anniversary of his landing at Calicut, but he did have a strong religious motivation. Another Portuguese sailor, Lus de Cames, called Portugal's Shakespeare, immortalized his achievement in the epic poem, The Lusiads. If Calcutta had Anthony Feringhee (Hensman Anthony), Dhaka's Christians revere Sadhu Antoni (St Anthony of Padua). Some credit the Portuguese with creating Bengal's first modern city in Hooghly. Others hold their imports of tobacco, potato and guava changed Bengali taste for all time. With so many connections, it was exciting to stumble upon a Bengali gift to Portuguese (or so I imagined) when my wife was allotted the janela seat on the train to Sintra. I emailed a friend in Calcutta who passed it on to Aditi Roy Ghatak who messaged me from Macau, where she was holidaying, to say the former Portuguese colony had given her a janela on Portugal. I now learn that far from being Bengali, janla is an import like potato, guavas or tobacco. Derived from the vulgar Latin januella, the Portuguese janela travelled east with those first Europeans to inspire the Sinhalese janelaya and Tamil cannal. Our own janla is like almirah or kameez. Borrowing within reason is all right providing it doesn't prompt Mamata Banerjee to follow the late P.N. Oak and claim that Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower are really Bengali creations."

(Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi) Former Union HRD minister Kapil Sibal (right) with Chief of Bureau Maneesh Chhibber at The Indian Express office in Delhi. (Express photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)Why Kapil Sibal?Kapil Sibal held the important portfolios of HRD and Telecom in the UPA government. The changes in education system brought in under him are now being examined by the Smriti Irani-led ministry. He remains one of the leading lights of the Congress and was recently nominated by the party, that is looking for strong voices in Parliament, for a Rajya Sabha ticket. A legal eagle, Sibal has returned to a successful practice and is leading the Gandhi familys defence in the National Herald caseKAPIL SIBAL: My biggest worry for the country is that an aspirational India finds itself in great difficulty. When we talk about our demographic advantage, the young people in this country find the education system not fully aligned to the market. Also, when they get out of the university, they cant get jobs. And remember there are about 12 million people who move out of the university into the job market every year. The maximum job creation was in 2009, with 1.2 million jobs as opposed to the 12 million required, and there has been a constant decline after that. So I wonder what those 12 million will do. Whatever you do in life, if its disengaged, its a perilous journey not just for them individually but for the nation. I think political parties must get together because remember, there is no quick fix to this.It must start from the education system; from the schools. But the education system cannot be tweaked unless you have teachers. Teachers dont come from the air unless you have institutions to teach. Having done that, you move up the school ladder and go to the universities. What is the kind of teaching you must have in your university? What kind of a market interface must you have with the educational system? Where are the jobs being created? Where in future will jobs be created? Then align the education system to that opportunity within the economy, and you will have a purposive India. I dont see that happening; I dont see political parties discussing this.WATCH: Idea Exchange With Kapil SibalI only see angst, a sense of destruction through verbal abuse, allegations without proof, (talk of) a Congress-mukt Bharat, as if that will save this country from the impediments ahead. Thats my greatest worry, and unless you fix this, there is nothing else that will be fixed.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The Modi government has completed two years and we all saw what happened at India Gate. So the impression that one got was that we are growing as a nation.I would love the nation to grow; I have no problem with that. I just have a problem with the statistics that he (PM Modi) has churned up. One of the statistics that he gave was of new ration cards  three crore. It is only 66 lakh. Then he said my Jan-Dhan (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana), in the first 100 days, saw 21 crore accounts. The fact is 8.6 crore. He said we have given new LPG cylinders to crores of people, but actually its only 45 lakh. So if the Prime Minister of India, at India Gate, talks of statistics which are incorrect, then how do you trust our leaders?The Central Statistical Organisation is also giving out data which economists are now questioning. So you may tom-tom about yourself but the fact of the matter is what is on the ground, and we all see that.MANEESH CHHIBBER: The aam aadmi seems to be buying these statistics.If dal is Rs 200 (a kilogram), then how is he buying these statistics? His income has not increased. If vegetables are as expensive as they are now, and if one tonne of potato sells for one rupee, then what statistics are we talking about? And whats the feel-good factor on the ground? What worries me is that you may have a wonderful advertising campaign but the fact of the matter is that when the voter thinks about himself, hell ask the question to himself at the right time  Has my life improved?. For the last 17 months, exports have been on the decline; imports are on the decline. So whats on the up? Modi. Nothing else is on the up.MANEESH CHHIBBER: So how does the Congress party plan to expose the government?I think we must take this message to the people. I think the media also needs to investigate this at the same time. When he (PM Modi) gives a statistic for example he said in America that India is a $9 trillion economy, when were just about near 2 trillion. Now the press did not pick it up. So how do we deal with this? They repeat the same statistics. He goes to Kerala and compares us with Somalia. Of course he got some flak for that, but I think every time he makes a statement, for him its an election rally speech You dont act like the Prime Minister of India; you act as if youre an RSS pracharak. You spew venom and you give statistics thinking that its the next election. And then suddenly, one of them goes and has food at a Dalits house when hes not even a Dalit. You should remember Modis tweet on a previous occasion about this.COOMI KAPOOR: Why has the Congress not been able to capitalise on the failures of the Modi government? And the Congresss own position has come down in the last two years. It has lost its stronghold in Kerala, in Bengal, in AssamSince when did a government in Kerala win a second term? Thats the pattern. As far as Assam is concerned, were deeply disappointed about that, but how many chief ministers have got a fourth term in the history of this country? Hardly any. Our vote percentage in Assam is 31 per cent. I think where we might have gone wrong is with the alliances. In West Bengal, we have emerged actually as an alternative to the TMC, because in our alliance we have gained much more and were now leading the Opposition there. The DMK, I think, was a great disappointment because there the pattern also is the AIADMK and DMK. We could have won. I think again, if we had made some alliances, we might well have succeeded. But if you look at it overall, the BJP fought 696 (Assembly) seats (in all) and got 64, and we fought 335 and got 135.AMBREEN KHAN: Sonia Gandhi said the Prime Minister behaves like a Shahenshah. What does that imply?I think Arun Shourie put it very well in the course of his interview  narcissism, megalomania, trying to control the government, a statue at Madame Tussauds. They give you an indication of the persona of the Prime Minister. Giving out statistics without regard to the truth and basically concentrating everything in the PMO, not allowing his ministers the kind of freedom that was allowed during the UPA government these are personal traits of character wearing a name-printed striped suite and then auctioning it off. These are all very significant characteristics of a man who basically is in love with himself, which is not a bad thing, but in politics it may not sometimes succeed for a long period of time.LIZ MATHEW: Regional parties have been successful in keeping out the BJP to an extent. But why has the BJP managed to defeat the Congress so easily?If you go back to analyse the decline of the Congress party, I think we go back several years, to the compromises that we made with regional parties by sharing seats What happens in politics is that the moment you compromise for sharing of seats, then your entire cadre shifts from one party to the other, and thats the genesis of the decline of our regional presence.We did it in Uttar Pradesh, and see the consequences of it. We have not done it in Odisha but there the Congress has been a weak force for a long time. Luckily, we are now the alternative in West Bengal. I dont think we made a mistake because, had we gone with the TMC, we would have landed in a much worse position.SHALINI NAIR: The Prime Minister often raises the point that governance under the NDA, unlike the Congress regime, has been corruption-free.What are the charges of corruption against the Congress party during the UPA regime? It started in 2010-11 with the telecom issue. What was the corruption there? We did not sell the spectrum because the policy was not to sell. It may be right, it may be wrong, the Supreme Court ultimately said it was wrong, so you auction it. What is the result of that auction? That the very telecom sector which bought 5 Megahertz of spectrum at an administered price of Rs1,680 crore buys it for Rs 45,000 crore and that goes to the consolidated fund of India. Now, you will not call this a scam, because all this money has gone to the Government of India, which should have gone to the sector, so the result is that, by calling it a scam, and by reversing the policy, you have, in fact, destroyed the sector. The same with coal, nobody wants a coal mine anymore.RITIKA CHOPRA: In a recent interview, Smriti Irani said that during her predecessors regime, education had become a political akhada, states wouldnt see eye to eye, whereas she has achieved consensus.I dont want to react to what Smriti Irani says. I think the people of this country know how the education department is being run. Did we appoint RSS people or Congress-minded people as vice-chancellors of universities? Did we appoint people of a particular ideology as directors of IIT? Was there a controversy about the Prime Ministers degree? What about the corruption in Madhya Pradesh, the Vyapam scam? Is that not the BJP?AMITABH SINHA: As a former HRD minister, what is your opinion on Smriti Iranis tenure so far?Im not worried about individuals, Im worried about the change of textbooks, Im worried about the effacing of history, Im worried about a Vedic board being created. See, these are real worries. You tell Ramdev that you can have a private Vedic board in India so that our children get aligned to that ideology as they grow up. Im worried about that. Im not worried about Smriti Irani, Im worried about what she symbolises.LIZ MATHEW: After the rout in the recent state elections, some in the Congress have talked about surgery and changes in the party. What do you think is the way forward?Surgery of a political party will not change the future of India. We need to do a lot of things within the Congress party, but thats not enough. We are here for the nation, we are not here for the Congress. We are presenting an alternative, right? That may be an unacceptable alternative, to that extent we need to change, to provide a wholly acceptable alternative, and people who have voted against us, we must bring them back to our fold, to say that this is the only party that recognises the needs, the aspirations, and the pain of every Indian.SHEELA BHATT: Sonia Gandhi called the charges against Robert Vadra a conspiracy. But why make it political?Who says dont investigate? But you leak the email to the media, then you have the media play it up, that is what Mrs Gandhi is talking about. Your intentions are not to investigate in a fair manner, your intention is to besmirch the name, to have another way of saying you want to have a Congress-mukt Bharat. Who is stopping your investigation? Did we say dont investigate? Why dont they agree to an SIT under the Supreme Court? In all these allegations, have you found a single case where a Congress person has been convicted? This is all media stuff. You get something, you leak something, then you give a spin to it, then the Finance Minister writes a blog, then his people go up on television, then you create an atmosphere, and then you say he is corrupt. And when it comes to you, that piece of paper that names family members of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and the money trail, then thats irrelevant.COOMI KAPOOR: Some people see similarities between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. What is your opinion?Let Donald Trump fight the election then I will give you my opinion. But you have my opinion of Modi anyway.MANEESH CHHIBBER: Why is the Congress party always defending Robert Vadra and his alleged wrongdoings?The point is that he happens to be associated with a person who is part of the family of the Congress leadership. So when you make an allegation against him, in a sense you are making an allegation against the Congress party. If the Congress party does not respond, then you would say that the Congress party has accepted it. Fact of the matter is, if you make a false allegation, the person is entitled to say it is false.AFRAZ ALAM: This whole wave of admiration for Modis work has only increased in the last two years. Even if the people start rethinking about their decision to choose Modi, what is the alternative?You must know that there is an army out there, which is funded by a particular political party, which has enormous presence in the social media to serve a particular purpose. That army whenever I say something will attack me within two minutes, then they will praise Modi. It is a self-serving army which is part of the narcissism that I talked about. There is a lot of trolling against Modi today I bet that in the next two years, you will have an alternative. An alternative that will be far more compassionate, far more acceptable, far more inclusive and far less obsessed with himself or herself.ANANT GOENKA: Do you agree then there is a need for an internal organisational change in the Congress?There is no dispute that reform is needed. You ask us about the big idea, but Modi did not come with any big idea. It was lies, lies and damn lies. He was selling a dream and a person who looks forward to the next day for survival will buy a dream. So people of this country bought a dream.AMBREEN KHAN : So who will be able to sell the big dream in Uttar Pradesh?We should go back to the people of this country and say, We will not tell you lies, we will try and tell you what the reality is, believe us and give us a chance. All these guys have fooled you by telling lies, we will not do that. I think it is time for us to tell this to the people of our country.MANEESH CHHIBBER: We saw what happened in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. What is your partys take on it?I think we need an amendment in the defection law. We should have a new law which says two things: first, that you are free to defect, but if you defect, you will not get a public position for the next five years. Even if you succeed in an election, you will not get a public position or ministerial post in the next five years. If you defect in the middle of your term, you will not be entitled to stand for elections in the middle of that term. If you do that, then this buying of people, horse-trading and all these shenanigans will stop. We should take off our political hat and think of the future of India. You cannot have a future that is bright when you have a party in power at the Centre destroying constitutionally elected governments in this completely amoral fashion. The other grave concern I have is (regarding) the investigating agencies, whether it is the NIA, CBI or Enforcement Directorate. These have by and large become tools in the hands of the dispensation which is in power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Mamata's support is important because the BJP doesn't have the numbers to ensure the safe passage of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha.According to experts, the switch-over from VAT (value added tax) to GST is likely to benefit consuming states like West Bengal more than producing states such as Gujarat. Mitra has been holding a series of meetings with the state finance ministers to arrive at a golden mean. One of the major issues coming in the way of a seamless rollout of the GST is the proposed 1% extra GST on producing states. The Congress has opposed it as the proposal has come from Gujarat. Besides, there are other issues like some states have demanded that percentage of revenue-neutral rate of GST should be put into amendment.Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and state FM Amit Mitra will be pushing hard for a consensus by bringing in some amendments over the tax proposal to reach a consensus to marry the polarities between states and political parties. Other than the economic considerations, GST has also become a political hot potato with the Narendra Modi government trying to gain confidence of the India Inc through this major tax reform. On Tuesday, Mitra will be placing the seventh GST draft in the meeting where as many as 20 state finance ministers will be present. When contacted, state FM and chairman of GST panel, Amit Mitra said, ""With Mamata Banerjee taking charge for the second term, such a national event on a significant reform agenda in city makes us proud.""With the Bengal chief minister taking a lead role among states to introduce GST, Kolkata has been chosen the venue of the meeting. This is the first time that a national-level tax reform meeting is being held in the city, a state official said. Even the VAT panel led by former state finance minister Asim Dasgupta didn't ever have a meeting in Kolkata.While giving a push to the GST initiative at the meeting of the chambers, the Bengal chief minister held that the micro, small and medium industrial units in Bengal will gain out of the unified tax procedure, bringing relief to a whole lot of people engaged in this sector."

Left party supporters take part in a rally in Kolkata to protest against West Bengal Government over Saradha chit fund scam in 2013. Now, after lying low for the past several years, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal.After lying low for the past several years after the Saradha scandal unfolded, chit funds are back in business in rural West Bengal, this time under the garb of agricultural schemes.The consumer affairs department has started a campaign against these chit funds which are operating on a small scale in various parts of Bengal.For more than a year we have been receiving several complaints, especially from rural Bengal about investors not getting returns or the capital siphoned off in various agricultural schemes, Consumer Affairs Minister Sadhan Pande told PTI.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe minister said that some chit funds promised huge returns on investment on potato purchase scheme and some others promised huge returns on tree plantation and poultry farming.These ponzi schemes are not big like Saradha or other major chit funds companies which are presently under the scanner of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, according to the minister.After the Saradha bubble burst in April, 2013, several Ponzi schemes and chit fund companies had to wind up their operations as central and state agencies cracked the whip amid protests by lakhs of defrauded investors.According to the consumer affairs department, these chit funds are operating at such a small level that at times it becomes tough even for the local administration to locate them.These operators are taking the advantage of lack of proper banking facilities, poverty and illiteracy of the investors. In most cases the promise of huge return lure the investors into the trap. In most cases the investors and the frauds are known to each other, a senior official said.The official said that in many cases these potato and other agricultural schemes offered investors guaranteed return of 20-100 per cent on their investment within a fixed period of time.A chit fund company, which is being investigated by the CBI, had started a scheme called potato flexi scheme promising huge returns on investment in potato business.On steps the consumer affairs department is taking to deal with such cases, a senior official of the department sounded helpless, saying, If you buy a fridge and you are facing a problem then we can solve the matter. But in these cases of local chit funds we have nothing much to do.Whenever we receive such complains, we direct the complainant to lodge an FIR and then direct these cases to the state finance ministry. Earlier when the Shyamal Sen Commission was there we used to send these complaints to the commission but now we send it to the state finance ministry, the official explained.Pande said that his department was conducting a campaign to make the poor and gullible rural people aware of the pitfalls of investment into these schemes.We are telling them that apart from bank, post office or government entities, they should not invest in any scheme or financial company which are not approved by the SEBI, RBI or other central financial agencies, Pande said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Potato can be exported to many countries if pest related issues are addressed and standard operating procedures are put in place.In a meeting held last week, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman discussed ways to increase potato exports and other related issues with Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh.""In the meeting, the Commerce Minister emphasised the need to identify pest-free zones for export of potatoes in the production clusters. Both ministries have decided to take further course of action soon on this issue,"" a senior government official told .The Commerce Ministry has suggested that concerned stakeholders such as Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Central Potato Research Institute, National Plan Protection Organisation (NPPO) and the state horticulture departments need to interact and prepare an action plan for identification of pest free zones for potato.That apart, it has also stressed on preparing the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for export of potatoes to various countries in order to address the quarantine pest concerns, the official added.It may be noted that though there is huge demand for Indian potatoes from Russia, the country has not been able to tap the export opportunities fully due to pest related issues.Identification of pest-free zones in producing areas will help export of quality commodity from India and avoid any rejection of consignments, the official said.India exported 1.80 lakh tonnes of potatoes in 2014-15 fiscal, which was lower than 3.05 lakh tonnes in the previous year, as per the government data.

The award would be conferred to KVK Harnaut by PM Narendra Modi in the presence of Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh at the foundation day function of ICAR to be held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi, on July 16, said its head and senior scientist Dr Sanjeev Kumar. Interestingly, Nalanda is the home district of CM Nitish Kumar.KVK Harnaut has been chosen for the prestigious award for the promotion and spread of the practice of organic farming of vegetables in Nalanda district on a big scale, besides the two other equally spectacular achievements of setting the world records in paddy and potato production by two different farmers, among other achievements.The significance of promotion of organic farming of vegetables among the three notable achievements could also be gauged from the fact that today - even in the age of the use of high dose of pesticides and chemical fertilisers for increased agricultural yield - the ""organic farming"" is the buzzword the world over. 265 farmers of Nalanda have formed a federation of producers of organic vegetables, called 'Shere Bihar Farmers Groups,' which has received C-3 certificate from the organisation Ecocert for the export of their vegetable yield.KVK Harnaut senior scientist Dr Kumar said the vegetables produced by them through organic farming methods are exported to the Middle East countries and Bangladesh, as well as to metropolitan cities of Maharashtra, West Bengal, and even to neighbouring Jharkhand for the high-end customers.Dr Kumar said KVK Harnaut is the ""child"" of CM Nitish, as he opened it in 1992 when he was Union agriculture minister. Initially, the method of organic farming of vegetables was started by 30 farmers in Sohdih village over 15 hectares of land in 2010-11, but the acreage has spread to 5,900 hectares of land by 2015, he added.In several ways, KVK Harnaut also became a part of the saga of Bihar turnaround story from 2006, especially in the first term of CM Nitish.Sumant Kumar, a farmer from Darveshpura village, set a world record in paddy production by getting a yield of 224 quintals of paddy per hectare of land for which he was given the award of best farmer by ICAR in 2012-13, apart from awards by the Punjab and Bihar governments.Similarly, Rakesh Kumar from Sohdih village also set world record in potato production by producing 1,088 quintals of potato per hectare of land that also brought to him best farmer award at International Potato Expo, New Delhi, in 2014, apart from recognition from Punjab government and Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour (Bhagalpur)."

Their target is to remain in power at the Centre. ""The BJP is not concerned about us; their target is to trigger communal tension wherever they get a chance. The Modi government is a government of the rich for the rich by the rich. It does not have any pan India stake or vision except tall talks.

The chief minister will hand over cheques to many of the farmers who had not accepted compensation to protest land acquisition The dais on Durgapur Expressway. Picture by Pradip Sanyal MEETING VENUE On the Calcutta-Durgapur flank of Durgapur Expressway, in front of the main gate of the abandoned Nano project area. WHY HERE This is the spot where Mamata had set up a stage in August 2008 to protest the land acquisition. THE STAGE A 2km stretch of the Durgapur-bound flank from Calcutta has been taken up to build the two-tier stage for Singur Divas. The median divider has also been taken up to create space for the crowd. More than 1.5 lakh people are expected to be present. TRAFFIC Around the meeting venue, the Calcutta-bound flank of Durgapur Expressway has been divided with iron barricades to allow two-way movement of vehicles. The expressway is used by around 30,000 vehicles daily. TIME Mamata is expected to arrive around 4pm. Senior party leaders will come before that. Around 600 unwilling farmers who have applied for compensation will reach the venue by noon. Police said the rally would begin at 4pm and continue till 6pm. It will take at least an hour for the vehicles that will bring participants to disperse. The stage is unlikely to be dismantled on Wednesday. CROWD MANAGEMENT The police said Trinamul supporters would start arriving from 11am. The crowd will be allowed to sit on the road, covered with tarpaulin. Special invitees will be provided green chairs. DIVERSION The police have decided that till 11am, normal vehicular movement will be allowed, although at a slow pace, near the venue because one flank has been taken up by the stage.  After 11am, goods vehicles from Calcutta will be diverted to Delhi Road, which runs parallel to Durgapur Expressway, from Dankuni, 20km from the rally venue.  The vehicles can return to Durgapur Expressway from the Maheswarpur crossing, 10km from the venue, or continue on Delhi Road.  Calcutta-bound goods vehicles will have to take the diversion to Delhi Road from the Maheswarpur intersection. They can return to the expressway from Dankuni.  Private cars and other modes of transport other than goods vehicles will be allowed to use Durgapur Expressway till it is possible. If the crowd swells, cars from Calcutta will have to switch to Delhi Road from Ratanpur More, 3km ahead of the meeting venue.  Cars from Durgapur will have to take the diversion from the Maheswarpur intersection. Report by Kinsuk Basu Singur, Sept. 13: On a September night a decade ago, Dilip Samanta was inside the Singur BDO's office with Mamata Banerjee and many other land protesters demanding that the 400 fertile acres that were acquired ""forcibly"" from farmers be returned. Police had switched off the lights on the premises and lathicharged the 1,200-odd protesters, Dilip said. He had taken blows and fallen down. His motorbike was allegedly seized and kept in the police station for three days. When Dilip walks up to the Singur Divas stage to receive his compensation cheque from Mamata tomorrow, it will be one of his ""biggest moments of triumph"". Dilip, whose 14 bighas are part of the land that is supposed to be returned to the owners in keeping with a Supreme Court order, said: ""I will carry green abir with me. When Mamata Banerjee hands me the cheque, I will throw it in the air. It will be Holi for me and my family and for several others like me."" Dilip, the eldest of three brothers, has taken several loans from a farmers' cooperative society to cultivate potato and rice on the 8 bighas that had not been acquired. The accrued loan amount that he is yet to return is Rs 1.4 lakh. ""I am not sure of the amount I will receive tomorrow. But it won't be less than Rs 26 lakh. We have calculated,"" said Dilip, whose son is a government employee and daughter is married. ""Before the acquisition, we used to grow our own rice. Now, we have to depend on the Rs 2 a kilo rice the government provides,"" he added. Dilip will have to share the compensation amount with his brothers, Sushanta and Jayanta. The priorities of the Samantas are to repair their crumbling house, arrange for the marriage of Sushanta's eldest daughter Riya, a college student, and ensure that Jayanta's school-going daughters, Titli and Tania, do not face any hurdles to their education. ""If the land is made fit for cultivation, we will be able to make a turnaround. We had to sell ornaments to get my daughter married,"" Dilip said. He said when his name would be called tomorrow, he would run up the stairs to the dais. ""The fight to get back our land has finally yielded results,"" he said."

With limited production of quality seeds, there is a huge gap between supply and demand.The Government Task Force on Potato Mission has estimated that the State's requirement of tuber seed at 1.2 lakh tonnes by 2017-18.The Government has been procuring large quantities of potato seeds from West Bengal, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh every year to meet the demand. This not only drains the State exchequer but also results in reduction of quality due to long distance transport.The Task Force had recommended for seed production to be done inside the State with private involvement. The potato seeds to be produced by UTIPL will be marketed inside the State and in Eastern India.The company will get 10 acres of land at Deras farm for establishment of tissue culture laboratory and 40 acres of land at Similiguda in Koraput for seed multiplication with usual Government rent for a period of 15 years.The company will establish the required infrastructure and seed multiplication at their own cost which will be around `20 crore, official sources said.However, the State Government will provide infrastructure support like road connectivity, electricity and water supply to the project sites."

On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was present to hand over the physical possession of land, as she distributed the land deeds to farmers on September 14.She also spread mustard seeds as a symbolic measure to restart farming on 997 acres, which was stopped in 2006, when the erstwhile Left Front government acquired the land to help set up the Tata plant.Even though local Trinamool Congress MLA and former agriculture minister, Becharam Manna, claimed the state government is returning the land in a cultivable state, agriculture and soil experts express doubts that after lying fallow for a decade, the land is not likely to retain its fertility. While the plant stood on more than 250 acres of the total acquired land, since the area was low-lying, its height was increased by piling tonnes of sand, fly ash and solid waste.While this process itself would have rendered the land infertile, Manna claimed around 400 acres are ready for cultivation.Mamata handed over 23 plots spread over 6.71 acres on Thursday, with plans to hand over 50 to 60 land plots everyday.The government is also installing 50 mini-deep tube-wells for better irrigation, besides distributing free seeds, fertilisers, and providing a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 to each farmer.Farmers like Ganesh Koley, Naba Kumar Ghosh and Jugal Kishore Ghosh, however, did not seem to share the governments confidence over the lands renewed cultivability. Jugal said that the government decided to start with mustard because crops like mustard, sesame and pulses release nitrogen and help land gain fertility.Weve to grow such crops for a few years till the land regains nutrition. It could take as long as four years for the land to be properly cultivable so that we can grow potato or rice, he said."

It served twin purposes -such demarcations will help owners to get the land as estimated by the Hooghly land records office, and the land labourers will get some crumbs of the government bounty . On Friday morning, Srimati Tudu, Bilasi Soren, Phulmani Kisku and Madan Ghosh from Gopalnagar joined work happily because they won't have to go to far off places to eke out a living.The Singur panchayat samity has engaged these day labourers under the NREG scheme on a daily wage of Rs 165 and breakfast. ""We are planning to give some money because the work is not too easy. The samity members at a meeting decided to begin the work with day labourers from Gopalnagar, Dobandhi and Bajemelia,"" said panchayat samity chairperson Pratima Das. The rural body has also devised a way to identify the bona fide day labourers from these areas and keep outsiders at bay. These labourers have got a certificate from the respective gram panchayat member based on which the block land and land reforms office has given them permission to enter the land. ""We are very happy. All of us had come from Bankura 22 years ago to work on the fields here.We have got back the right to work in Singur at last. We had a tough time looking for odd jobs outside Singur.The government once engaged us in road construction but we are skilled in agricultural work,"" said labourer Phulmani Kisku.The landowners, mean while, queued up in front of the block development office to get the land deeds after hearing. Tarun Bagui, who owns 1.5 bighas, said: ""I have got back my plot and will go back to farming. The land is fit for farming. This year, I will start with potato and cauliflower,"" Bagui said.However, those having land along the Durgapur Expressway are in two minds.Land brokers have already offered them a price of Rs 8 lakh a bigha.

The transporters have refused to carry potatoes any more as the unpaid fuel bills are mounting.With fuel stations refusing any more credit to transporters, there is a chain reaction hitting transportation of potatoes.The retail price of the tuber declined on Saturday following the severe liquidity crunch. But it happened as the retailers sacrificed their margin of profit to facilitate faster offtake of the stockpile. ""But this dip at retail level will be temporary as both the wholesale and retail prices will rise, thanks to shortage of supply,"" Swapan Samanta, secretary West Bengal Potato Traders Association , told TOI.Price of potato (Jyoti variety) at the retail end dipped to Rs 18 from Rs 20-Rs 22 in some markets on Saturday. This was offered by retailers to encourage customers to buy more. However, the crisis will be felt in the retail markets soon because of the shortage in supply . The wholesale price of Jyoti and Chandramukhi was Rs 12 and Rs 22 respectively in Hooghly, the largest producer of potato in Bengal.According to Patit Paban De, member, West Bengal Cold Storage Association , 462 potato cold storages across Bengal still has stockpile of 13 lakh tonnes. Out of this, only 3 lakh tonnes will be used as seeds. The rest should have been out in the market. But sudden liquidity crunch has disrupted the system. Small farmers are not taking out potatoes they had hoarded in cold storages. Traders, particularly, transporters are feeling the heat.In Hooghly district alone, there are 161 potato cold storages which still have a sizeable stockpile. November 30 is the deadline for complete stock clearance. The new crop will be coming shortly. Potato prices have shot up since May as the production had dropped in Bengal, the second largest producer of the tuber.Traders and companies, however, expect the downward trend in the agriculture market to continue in the short term as the harvest season is on and the country is looking at a record khariff crop. ""The smallest player in the entire system, the farmer, is panicking. We expect prices to go down further in the short term,"" said agriculture economist Sarit Basu."

We have been sending our trucks to other states, but there are no labourers to unload the stock. There is no money to pay them, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.

The wholeseller fears that his entire stock will go waste, incurring him a huge loss.

Garg said that most of such patients are from middle and upper-middle class families belonging from rural Bengal where the reach of plastic money is limited.Another psychiatrist Santasree Gupta said, One of her patient is a 50-year-old widow who inherited Rs 30 lakh in cash savings from her deceased husband.

In the districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Sangrur, sowing of wheat is less than 50 per cent and a little better in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar.However, Punjabs director of agriculture, J S Bains, says the sowing figures are not as bad as they are being bandied about. Yes sowing has been affected. Normally, 95 per cent sowing is done by November 15. This year, 70 per cent sowing has been done till date. Out of 17 lakh quintals of seeds required for the crop, some 12 lakh quintals have already been purchased by famers, he says.Not just farmers, Punjabs traders have taken a hit too. We used to sell 100 mobile phones per day but we are barely selling one or two now, says Jagmohan Singh, who runs a mobile phone shop in Gurdaspur. No one has any money.Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh says the RBI orders prohibiting cooperative banks from exchanging/accepting old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are to blame for the state of affairs in rural Punjab.The state has 12,673 villages, and farmers deposit their earnings into cooperative banks, which have not been allowed to exchange old notes."

In November 2008, on one such road near Bhadutola, then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and Union ministers Jitin Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan narrowly escaped a Maoist ambush. This sparked police excesses, particularly in Chotopeliya village, which triggered the Lalgarh movement in which 700 lives were lost over the next three years.In 2011, top Maoist leader Kishenji was killed near another tarred road not far from Bhadutola.

The sluggish acreage is going to affect production of the early variety (jaldi aloo) that usually reaches the market by mid-November.But this was not expected when Bengal farmers, the second tuber producing state after Uttar Pradesh , had made huge profits in the last season. ""The November chill is ideal for potato farming. But where is the money?"" said potato grower Kinkar Das from Tarakeswar. Kinkar hasn't been able to sow potato seeds entirely in his 2.5 bigha land. ""I sowed in only 1.5 bigha, leaving the remaining for less expensive farming such as brinjals and radish,"" Das said.Gopinath Khanrui from Singur has major stakes this year. Unable to get credit from the Krishi Samabay Samiti, Gopinath has arranged for Rs 60,000 by mortgaging his wife's gold jewellery and the rest as loan from seed and fertiliser agents. A small section without having bankable assets has taken loans from big farmers and money lenders at 10-12% monthly interest, a trend that is a cause of worry for the administration. State officials fear that such high stakes may increase the possibility of farmer suicides.Seed and fertiliser agents have no other option to give the items on credit. ""If we don't, our business is going to suffer. What's the use of having unused stocks when seeds have a limited shelf life. We are thus giving the items to farmers based on a written undertaking that they will pay back during the harvesting season,"" said trader Pradyut Das. Even seed and fertiliser prices have recorded a dip due to the liquidity crunch.

West Bengal Potato Seed Trader Association secretary Swapan Samanta who is also the Tarakeswar Municipality chairman, however, isn't taking chances.

For those involved in agriculture in West Bengal  estimated to be two-thirds of the states 91 million population  the question and its potential answers have dire consequences.While the average area owned by each household in Bengal is 0.174 hectares  the smallest in any state of India  officials said the sheer fertility of land in the Bengal delta meant that many, particularly marginal landowners, cultivated their land to supplement their income. Take for instance the case of Dharani Kanta Bhowmik (55), a schoolmaster who died on Tuesday in Cooch Behar after standing in queue for three consecutive days. Bhowmik owned less than 0.1 hectares and like many others in Cooch Behar, cultivated paddy. He had been trying to withdraw money to pay labourers who worked on his land.WATCH VIDEO: Heres Why RBI Restricted Withdrawal Limits On Jan Dhan Accounts To Rs 10,000On Thursday, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das announced that farmers would be allowed to withdraw up to Rs 25,000 per week against crop loans, subjected to limits. This would also apply to those who hold Kisan credit cards. Bank accounts needed to be in the name of the concerned farmers.On the other hand, traders with Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, would be able to draw of Rs 50,000 per week to pay wages and other sundry expenses.Almost 1,500 km away, at Boinchi in Hooghly, small-time trader Bibhash Sen who also grows potatoes on his land, is confused. I have three katha of land (0.1 hectares) on which I grow paddy. But I dont have a kisan credit card. Does that mean I would not be able to avail this relaxation? I went to the cooperative bank, but no one knew. I will go again on Monday. I desperately need money to buy seeds and begin planting.As of June 2016, only 31 per cent of the 17 lakh targetted Kisan credit card accounts had been opened, said State Level Bankers Committee records.Moreover, as per government records, Bengal only has 2,918 APMC markets and agriculture  in spite of the state being food surplus  remains largely informal. But unlike other food surplus states, small and marginal farmers contribute almost 86 per cent of the total output in Bengal. But the inherent informality of the agricultural system implies that these small and marginal farmers continue to be deeply in debt, with an estimated 88.7 per cent of all indebted ones owning land less than 1 hectare.WATCH VIDEO: Income Tax Law To Be Changed To Increase Penalty On Unexplained Deposits: All You Need To KnowOn the ground, farmers  many of whom are already in debt  are now finding that the traditional network of moneylenders do not exist anymore, following the governments decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.Prabir Sengupta, a small-time farmer in Howrahs Andul area, said: The demonetisation move has spelt disaster for me.

Wheat is now retailing in Delhi at Rs 24 per kg, up from Rs 19 at this time last year. This, even as stocks in government warehouses have depleted to a 9-year-low. Retail prices of milled chana dal and potato are, likewise, averaging Rs 140 and Rs 20 per kg, respectively, as against their corresponding levels of Rs 70 and Rs 12 a year ago. Consumers are paying about Rs 15/kg for onions  half of what they were last year at this point  but low plantings this rabi season can be a source of worry over the next 4-5 months.WATCH VIDEO: Petrol Pumps, Air Ticket Counters Will Not Accept Old Rs 500 Notes After December 2Thankfully, data from the agriculture ministry shows area sown under both wheat and chana so far in the ongoing rabi season to be higher than the progressive coverage during the same period last year. Available indications are that there will be no shortfall in planted acreages for three reasons. The first is the improved soil and sub-soil moisture levels. Second, high prices are themselves an incentive for farmers to plant. In the case of wheat, the Rs 100 increase in MSP to Rs 1,625 per quintal is an added motivation. Third, both wheat and chana are non-hybrid crops, whose grain saved from the previous years crop can be used as seed for the current season. Most farmers would, therefore, not be buying seed. Lack of cash shouldnt in any case be a deterrent for sowing.Cash can, however, be an issue when it comes to purchase of other inputs like fertiliser, pesticide and labour. Farmers need to give three 50-kg bags of urea and one bag of di-ammonium phosphate for every acre of wheat. In potato, the requirement is even more: 3 bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and muriate of potash. The cost of these works out to Rs 2,000-3,300 per acre. While there is no dearth of availability of fertilisers, whether farmers have the cash to purchase these isnt clear. Also, the application has to be timely  farmers, for instance, need to give one bag of urea per acre 20-25 days after sowing. With cooperative banks not being allowed to accept the old notes, there is also a question mark on availability of sufficient credit for farmers in the current rabi season.Farmers also need cash to pay labour, whose requirement is particularly high in onions and potatoes. In potato, the sowing operations were completed in Punjab by end-September, and by end-October in Uttar Pradesh. Right now, planting operations are taking place mainly in West Bengal and Bihar, and there are reports of farmers struggling to raise cash to pay labour.The next few months will decide the fate of these four crops and also sugar, where, too, supply situation is tight though that precedes monetisation. Preventing a flare-up in prices before Assembly elections in UP and Punjab would pose a huge challenge to the government at the Centre.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Potato growers say there are no buyers and that they are yet to receive full payments even for the stocks they have already supplied to other states before and after the demonetisation.Also, they say, the government announcement allowing farmers to purchase seed with old currency notes came quite late when the potato sowing season in other states was almost about to end.In Punjab, potato planting season is from September-end till early October while in other states, it is between October 25 and November 25.In every cold store, around 10,000 to 12,000 bags of 50 kg each have been lying. Now, we do not know where to go and what to do, said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers Association. I have got 22,000 packets of government certified seed in my own cold store but there is no taker.Sangha said Punjab farmers were selling potato seeds at Rs 30-35/kg to the traders from other states before the announcement of the demonetisation on November 8, but after that, buyers simply vanished.The government has put us in a big trouble and it should compensate us now, said Sangha.Now we are planning to throw this potato seed either on roads or to distribute it to the poor as there is no taker. We cannot afford to keep these in cold stores where we have to pay rent and also for next crop which will start coming in February we have to empty our stores, said Raghbir Singh, the president of JPGA.Meanwhile, the rate of table potato has been hovering between Rs 800 and 1000 per quintal in wholesale market.Punjabs potato farmers are the main seed supplier of the crop across the country. The state produces about 2.2 metric tonnes, out of which 1.5 MT comprises seed potatoes only. Currently, Punjab supplies about 1.1 MT of potato seed to other states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other potato producing state and meets around 63 per cent of the seed demand of the country every year.Doaba region, where potato seed is grown on 90,000 hectares of area, is the home of potato seed for the entire country. Jalandhar too has big potato producers.The sowing takes place in early-October and harvesting towards February-March, after which the produce is put in cold stores. Yields of seed potatoes, at 8-10 tonnes per acre, are below the 12-14 tonnes for normal table potatoes. But while the latter sell at Rs 1,000-1,200 per quintal, seed potatoes fetch rates that range from Rs 2,500-3,500 for branded and Rs 1,800-2,000 for unbranded material.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Mercurial Mamata is on a ""'s cash clean-up bid.Such is her determination that she was ready to shake hands with her arch rival CPM against Modi. Although the Marxists did not reciprocate, that didn't faze her. Nor did the refusal of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar  she had moved closer towards him in the last few months  to join her, dampen the. Didi immediately widely seen as a reference to Nitish  and reached out to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. She even put aside her anger against Samajwadi Party for betraying her to back Pranab Mukherjee for the post of President, to enlist UP CM Akhilesh Yadav in her campaign.And she has been raising the pitch constantly, demanding a roll-back of the entire exercise when other opposition parties have restricted their criticism to the manner in whichSo what makes Mamata so angry? Social media is flooded with posts saying it's a desperate bid by her to protect her ilk that has been hit hard by the cash clean-up. But, even if one doesn't discount the view, the argument applies to all political parties, including the ruling BJP. Then why is she alone being so edgy?It would be too early to jump to conclusions, because both Modi and Banerjee are moving by perceptions.Fact is, people across Bengal, from auto-rickshaw drivers to the salaried middle-class, hailed Modi's move the day it was announced.They saw it as a sincere attempt to book the crooks, politicians, real estate developers, a section of bureaucrats and professionals, who've been looting their hard earned money with impunity. Even people standing in long queues were ready to bear the short-term pain for the long-term clean-up. The public mood began swinging a week later, when the liquidity crunch hit households.Sales in kirana shops and local bazaars dropped, making households cut their expenditure and go for credit purchases. In villages, small farmers, at the end of the supply chain, have never had enough muscle to keep this credit business going for more than a week.The result has been a shift of business from local markets to malls. It hit the informal supply chain at a time when a large chunk of people in Bengal ekes out a living from this sector. Harvesting has got delayed by a week in Bengal's villages and sowing of the potato tuber has also suffered. Mamata is hoping to tap into this frustration and anger.Moreover, she seems to have got a sanction from a wide range of economists, including Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. Even a working paper prepared by the Tax Research Group of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) under the Union finance ministry shared some concerns.Mamata is thus playing a gamble to find for herself space in national politics, when other opposition parties are not too confident of the outcome in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Nitish already has problems with his ally Lalu Prasad; and, the Yadav family feud in UP has spilled out into the open. Congress too doesn't have the numbers to command the opposition course.Mamata is far better placed. She has decimated the Left, and BJP, though a rising force in Bengal, is still a distant second. Confident of winning at least 40 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections, the Trinamool chief is now banking on the growing public impatience among the farmer, the petty trader and the salaried class to turn the tables on Modi. It's not without reason that Mamata reached out to the city's biggest trading hub at Burrabazar the other day to talk to traders, many of whom voted for BJP in the national and assembly polls.Finally, Mamata sees BJP as her next opposition in Bengal  reason enough for her to up the ante against Modi. Both the leaders, it seems, are looking at a new polarisation in Bengal, and Mamata is doing it her way."

These advisories, which include information on temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, cloudiness and wind speed, are issued for a span of five days.Based on these parameters, the AgriMet field units issue specific crop-based advisories for the district, intended to help farmers plan their agricultural activities.However, the district-level forecast is not always sufficient to meet the requirements of individual farmers, given the wide variation in the above five parameters a single district can experience, said Chattopadhyay.For example, while areas like Maval and Mulshi may experience excess rainfall, Baramati and Shirur often have to face drought-like situation. Small and marginal land holders, who comprise about 80 per cent of the cultivators in the country, were the worst hit by the vagaries of nature.A recent study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has shown that proper advisories can increase production by 25 per cent, said the IMD official. Better access to satellite data as well as newer and improved forecasting models would now enable IMD to customise their advisories, said Chattopadhyay.In order to understand the specific needs of farmers, we intend to tie up with grass-root level organisations. These organisations will help us build bridges with the local community and help us receive feedback from farmers, he said.The advisories will not only include five climatic parameters, they would also include details on how to improve productivity by fighting diseases or pest attacks. Citing an example from West Bengal, Chattopadhyay said farmers from the state had asked for prior information to fight diseases and pests which tend to attack the potato crop.This project is part of a global initiative which would be funded by agencies like the UNDP, World Bank etc. While the accuracy of district-level forecasts seem to have increased in the last few years, a recent study by IMD scientists pointed to certain shortcomings. The model had failed to determine the temperature in hilly areas accurately and the accuracy of the prediction was lesser for northeastern regions.While the weather predictions were 60-80 per cent accurate for states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, they had varied between 40-50 per cent for Haryana.

In 2015, potato sowing was conducted over 5.19 lakh hectares till December 5. This year, however, 10.17 lakh hectares have been sown by the same date. Consequently, a bumper potato crop is expected.Currently, Gujarat ranks fifth in the country in production of potato. Officials said potato production in the state has been rising steadily. While 23 lakh tonnes had come to the market in 2014, in 2015, that amount went up to 31 lakh tonnes, and to 35 lakh tonnes in 2016.Sowing of the crop picked up over last month, said officials, who reported that at least 5.51 lakh hectares had been sown in the last 20 days alone. If the trend continues, sowing will cross 12 lakh hectares - so far the highest area used to cultivate potato in Gujarat in any year.Mavjibhai Desai, chairman of the Deesa APMC attributes the exponential growth of potato farming to a number of reasons. ""This year, sowing has gone up with Narmada water reaching the northern parts of the state,"" said Desai, adding, ""The big increase in storage facilities has also drawn the attention of farmers to the cultivation of potato.""Desai said that in 2015-16 the top potato growing states - Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - had seen their production decline by 5% and 15%, respectively, due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, unlike other potato-growing states, Gujarat had registered an increase in potato production due to higher acreage.Better prices have also attracted farmers to potato cultivation, hold officials in the agriculture department, who said farmers received a good price last year for their yields, and this year, as compared to 2015, potato seed is cheaper and more easily available.In 2015-16, cold storage capacity went up by 6.25 lakh tonnes, with the current capacity at 22.5 lakh tonnes, said agriculture department officials. Gujarat has over 420 cold storages located mainly in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha and Kheda.Potatoes from Gujarat are sent to Maharashtra and states in South India, and are also exported to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Mauritius."

On an average, the cost of production for potato is Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per kg, but the farmer is getting way below it, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu .Same time last year, farmers were getting around Rs. 600 per 50 kg, he said.The new season potato crop from the Kandi belt, including Hoshiarpur and neighbouring districts of Punjab and also Una district in Himachal Pradesh, has started arriving in the markets but farmers are finding it difficult to sell their crop in the absence of buyers.Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in a drop in bulk orders from big markets like Delhi. In local markets there are a fewer buyers and hence farmers are getting a far lower price, Mr. Sangha said, adding that the potato grower had earlier suffered losses due to drop in sale of seeds and now again when the fresh crop has reached the market.Potato growers from Punjab on Wednesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to waive off their crop loans.Clash with peak seasonWhile we appreciate the governments [demonetisation] move, we have suffered huge losses. Potato seed farming business accounts for nearly Rs. 1,500 crore annually, but this year we are estimating a loss to the tune of Rs. 800-900 crore, he said, adding that demonetisation had clashed with the peak season of potato seed when it is supplied nationwide.Notably, Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country, including in West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Potato seed is supplied from the first week of November to mid-December every year. In neighbouring Haryana, the situation is no different as farmers are forced to sell potato at a dismal price on account of poor demand."
