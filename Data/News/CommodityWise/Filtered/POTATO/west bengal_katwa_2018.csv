Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Maharashtra continues to be at the top in recording the highest number of farmer suicides in India.Provisional figures for the year 2016, disclosed by agriculture ministry in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, show that the country recorded 11,370 farmers (farm labourers and cultivators) suicides as compared to 12,602 in 2015.The decline may be attributed to better rainfall in 2016 which witnessed record production of kharif (summer sown) crops. In contrast, 2015 was the second consecutive drought year after 2014. A shortfall of 10% or more of rainfall for the entire monsoon season - June to September - is considered a drought year.The figures, however, show that the benefit of record production could not probably lessen the distress of farm labourers as suicides among them increased from 4,595 in 2015 to 5,019 in 2016. The overall decline was seen due to decline in the number of suicides among cultivators - from 8,007 in 2015 to 6,351 in 2016.The other states at the top in terms of having the dubious distinction of recording higher number of farmers suicides include Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. In fact, two states - Maharashtra (3,661) and Karnataka (2,079) - together account for more than 50% of the total farmers suicides in 2016.These are provisional figures, shared by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) with the agriculture ministry. The bureau has, so far, not made the final figures public.Farm activists took the figures for 2016 with a pinch of salt. Decline in number of farmers suicides can mainly be attributed to data manipulation and change in category (from farm related suicides to non-farm suicides). Getting the NCRB to abstain from releasing its report raised strong suspicion, said Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture ( ASHA ).Out of 3,661 farmers suicides in Maharashtra, 2,550 were cultivators while remaining 1,111 were farm labourers. Similarly, in Karnataka, 1,212 cultivators and 867 farm labourers took their lives in the state.Flagging figures of West Bengal which reported zero suicide in 2016, Kuruganti told TOI that those who worked on the ground had reported suicides of potato farmers in the state but the ministry figures show it as nil. Where have those numbers gone? she asked.Though the ministry has not specified causes behind suicides in 2016, the minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala, in his written response, said the bankruptcy or indebtedness and farming related issues were reported as major causes of suicides among farmers/cultivators in 2015. Citing the NCRB report of 2015, he noted that family problems followed by illness were reported as major causes of suicides among agricultural labourers.Kuruganti said, Even 11,370 farmers suicides in a single year, as disclosed by the ministry as the NCRBs provisional figure, is quite a big number. It clearly shows that neither the Centre nor the states are serious about dealing with the farm distress."

The governor has asked state election commissioner Amarendra Singh to take all possible measures to guarantee peace in the rural polls.During his meeting at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday, Singh told the governor that the state election commission had already intimated the state government about the need for central paramilitary forces.In an earlier meeting, the governor also asked chief secretary Moloy De and home secretary Atri Bhattacharya to ensure that candidates can file nomination papers across districts, with particular reference to South 24 Parganas, Bankura and Birbhum. According to the state election commission (SEC), till Wednesday, Trinamool had filed 3,629 nominations (including gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad) while BJP had filed 2,316 nominations, and other parties together filed 1,651 nominations.Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee will be calling on the governor on Thursday to apprise him of the ground reality. The governor is going on an overdrive without verifying the facts. The opposition has raised a clamour from the second day of filing of nomination in a bid to keep the state election commission under pressure. State BJP leaders are quoting the governor, which is unfair. We will meet the governor tomorrow and also the state election commissioner, Chatterjee said.Clashes between political parties in the run-up to panchayat polls have become a political hot potato in Bengal, with opposition parties knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court while keeping up the pressure on SEC. BJP leader Mukul Roy staged a dharna at the SEC office on Wednesday while party activists demonstrated in front of the office. I told the state election commissioner that we are being denied the right to contest in rural polls, which is a fundamental right. Our party has moved the Supreme Court on this ground, Roy said.In a counter-offensive, Trinamool leaders called on Union home minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Wednesday to complain against the governor going on an overdrive over rural polls when things were under control. A 20-member Trinamool MPs delegation, led by its Lok Sabha party leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Rajya Sabha leader Derek OBrien, met Singh to put on record their unease over the governors interference. They took exception to the governor giving directions to the chief secretary and home secretary without taking the elected state government into confidence.Constitutional experts, however, see nothing wrong in the governor calling senior state officials or meeting the state election commissioner once the rural poll process is on because the Constitution, under Article 243K, vests in him the power to make available to the state election commission such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions of the SEC. However, the state Act specifies that the arrangement has to be done in consultation with the state government."

This year the government revised and raised the MSP/MIP to Rs 549 per quintal.A low production in various states, including West Bengal, the second largest potato grower after UP, and various incentives offered by the state government for other states to buy potato from UP to help farmers get better price are being seen among main reasons for the potato prices shooting up in UP.While UPs production fell only slightly to around 150 lakh MT from 155 lakh MT last year, the production in West Bengal and Bihar, the other potato growers, has dropped significantly creating more demand for UPs potato there, said a senior horticulture department official. UP produces more than 30% of the countrys potato.Many southern states are said to have sourced potato from UP availing the governments incentives including one on transportation.As per the estimates, there are little chances of the potato prices coming down this year. Many farmers store potato at their home and keep on supplying the same to mandis but once the supply of this kind of potato ends after May, the price may even go up further, said DN Pandey, an ex-official of the horticulture department.The prevailing high prices of potato to much of the benefit of farmers must have come as a big relief to the BJP government that had been under attack from the opposition for the potato growers facing hardships due to their not getting the proper price. The issue was much in news when some farmers allegedly threw potatoes outside the CM residence and the Raj Bhawan as a mark of protest. The BJP had blamed the Samajwadi Party (SP) of stage managing the protests."

The price of the vegetable has jumped from Rs 10 per kg last month to Rs 18 per kg.Collectors have also been advised to crack down on unscrupulous traders. ""They have also been asked to keep a close watch on the arrival of potatoes in the market and ensure the availability of the same to consumers,"" food supplies and consumer welfare secretary V V Yadav said in a letter to the collectors.The letter said, ""If required, action may be taken against the hoarders and unscrupulous traders under the Provision of Essential Commodities Act, 1955."" The price of potato has shot through the roof in the last few days. ""It is ascertained that there is less production of potato this year in the producing states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, which has led to the rise in price in our state. Taking advantage of such a situation, some traders may resort to hoarding and creation of artificial scarcity in the market,"" the letter read.The collectors of border districts were requested to ensure that flow of potato from the producing states into Odisha is not disrupted. ""Potato is the most essential vegetable in the kitchen and in summer we use more of it. But due to high prices, we have had to cut its consumption,"" said Hemangini Das, a homemaker living in the capital city.The civil supply department on Wednesday conducted raids at several vegetable mandis of Cuttack, including the one at Chhatra Bazar , following Yadav's letter. ""We have conducted raid on 14 vegetable godowns and found no extra stock there,"" said district civil supply officer Amar Mohapatra. Odisha produces around three lakh metric tonnes of potato every year against the annual requirement of around 12 lakh metric tonnes and depends on West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to meet the need."
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The ban was imposed following detection of Nematode virus in the potato samples of districts, including Una, Kullu and Shimla . According to agriculture minister and Lahaul-Spiti MLA, Dr Ram La Markanda, no virus was detected in Lahaul-Spiti potatoes and, therefore,ban should be lifted for their region. On Monday, a high level team from the state, headed by Markanda, would meet Union Agriculture Minister in New Delhi in this regard.The seed potatoes of Lahaul-Spiti is in great demand not only in West Bengal, Gujarat and other parts of India but also in Pakistan. At present, they are grown in 747 hectare area in the entire district.According to Markanda, the residents of Lahaul-Spiti have already suffered extensive damage because of untimely snow due to which 80% of apple crop has been damaged and plants broken. Now this decision of Centre has left the residents in a lurch.State government has formed a four-member committee headed by director, agriculture to submit a report on the repercussions of the ban. In the committee formed by the government, experts from Central Potato Research Institute and CSK Agriculture University Palampur have also been included. The committee will suggest whether the seed potato is suitable for further distribution or not, Markanda said."

Whats worse, some of the leftover stock of last year is still lying with them.The farmers claim that they are unable recover even their cost of production and harvesting as the price is down to Rs 3 per kg. When the harvesting of potatoes started, which are supplied directly in the market for domestic consumption, the price was at Rs 20-25 per kg. That was three weeks back, now it has crashed to Rs 3 a kg. While, Jalandhar is largely a seed producingbelt for the country, farmers here also harvest part of their crop for supplies in the local market, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary Jaswinder Singh Sangha.Cost of production, harvesting and packing ranges from Rs 6 to 8. With selling price tumbling to Rs 3, and would not be surprising if farmers start ploughing their produce in their fields, said Kulwant Singh of village Qadianwal on the outskirts of Jalandhar.He said that some part of the last year crop meant for supply as seeds was still lying with them. Market for us has just not revived since demonetization. For third year in a row, we are set to fave huge loses, he said.Demonetisation was announced in the days when season for receiving orders was about to start. After the announcement, we received no orders from traders. The entire business was based on cash transactions and our biggest buyer is West Bengal. Even 2015 was also not very good for us, but last two years have been the worst as our buyers from other states were left with little cash, he said.Village Uggi resident Gurdeep Singh said that while he would be harvesting his entire crop in February for supply as seeds to others states but some part of his last year crop was still lying with him.Meanwhile, Sangha said that they had last year demanded that export to Pakistan be opened in the summer. Pakistan does not have cold storage facility and in the summers there potato prices remain high and we could have finished our stocks of previous season by supplying the produce to Pakistan. Now, there would be no benefit as their own fresh crop would flood the market, he said.Since demonetization, there has been no reprieve for potato growers and they are continuing to suffer. We cant give up potato cultivation easily as we have invested on implements and appliances, said Sangha and Kulwant.When contacted, deputy director (horticulture) Satbir Singh confirmed that prices were low.Doaba belt of Punjab mainly produces potato seed for major parts of the country and they did not receive good returns on their produce in the last two years. In these days only a part of the crop is harvested for supplies to local markets and their prices have also come down after the glut in the market, he said."

These officials are trying to project the crop insurance scheme as the Centre's contribution. I vouch that this is a travesty of truth,"" she said. ""The Centre is trying to showcase the scheme as its own when it pays only 20% of the liability while the state bears 80%. I am telling AIC officials the state will withdraw its deposits with AIC if they continue with such misinformation. We can very well bear entire liability if we can pay 80% of insurance premium,"" she said.State officials pointed out that Bengal was the only state where farmers didn't have to pay crop insurance for rabi crops other than potato and onion . The state government pays its own share and also the beneficiary's share, which adds up to 80% of the insurance premium.The Centre uses the PMFBY tag by paying only 20% of the premium share. According to state officials, the CM has introduced a crop insurance scheme called Bangla Fasal Bima which is aimed at covering rabi crops, with the state bearing the entire cost of the premium. ""Now, when the CM has mentioned it, beneficiaries under PMFBY are likely to be transferred to the Bangla Fasal Bima scheme,"" a state official said.The CM also listed government bounties in the agricultural sector. ""We have abolished 'khajna' (land rent) on agricultural land. The owner of agricultural land doesn't have to pay a mutation fee to get it registered. We are giving farmer pensions to 1 lakh beneficiaries and have increased monthly pensions from Rs 750 to Rs 1,000,"" she said."
