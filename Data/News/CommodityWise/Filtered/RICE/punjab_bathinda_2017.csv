5909e86d7be9e033f19b8ad6,Religion and regression,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/religion-and-regression-ppp-leader-asif-ali-zardari-forced-marriage-non-muslim-girl-forced-marriage-into-islam-4462620/,2017-01-07,"Former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. (Source: Reuters) Former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. (Source: Reuters)Last month, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari did something that no man with a conscience could have thought of doing: He gave his word to Amir Jamaat-e-Islami Siraj ul Haq that the Sindh Assembly will strike down a recently passed law meant to protect non-Muslim girls from being forcibly converted to Islam. Hindu and Christian girls have been forced to convert, so that Muslim men can take them as wives. The law would have addressed the abuse of Muslim law which forbids forcible conversion.The Movement for Solidarity and Peace, which campaigns against religious violence in Pakistan, says, 100 Christian girls and at least 300 Hindu girls (in Sindh) suffer such conversions every year and has presented its case at the US Congress too. The law passed by the Sindh Assembly laid down that change of religion will not be recognised until the person reaches 18 years of age; otherwise perpetrators will get five years in jail.Secretary general of the Jamaat-e- Islami, Liaquat Baloch, attacked the law: The provincial assembly passed the bill in haste to please foreign lobbies. We will not let it sail through and will challenge it in the Council for Islamic Ideology and the Federal Shariat Court. The Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill, 2015 was tabled by minority members Nand Kumar and Khatumal Jeewan. They must feel cheated by the ruling party using the issue as a pawn in the political battle at the national level.Hindutva may turn out to be less terminal in its destructive spread than sharia, but the seduction of religion is there in South Asia. In the Sindh district of Ghotki, there is the Sant Satram Das temple from where Hindu girls have been picked up and converted before being forcibly married to Muslim men. Near the temple, there is also the infamous Bharchundi Sharif shrine whose patrons once became famous in India for convertingnon-Muslims. But the shrine is not without its blots today, its custodians backing conversions as divine inspiration. Every April, there is the death anniversary of Bhagat Kanwar Ram, a popular Sufi poet and singer,killed in the communal riots of 1939, allegedly by the then-custodians of the Bharchundi Sharif shrine.In the past, this northern Sindh region generally abjured violence and treated Hindus well on the basis of their Sindhi identity. In southeast Sindh, in Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot and Sanghar, they suffer maltreatment. But in 2012, upper Sindh too experienced an anti-Hindu trend after madrassas from South Punjab spread their tentacles into Sindh. This trend was emphasised after Deobandi Islams Taliban affiliation gave it impunity.In the past, Hindus were the dominant class  some of their dominance is still in evidence. One local observation goes like this: In Ghotki, the cotton ginning factories are owned by Hindus. In Sukkur, half the trade in rice, grains and dates is conducted by Hindus. In Khairpur, Hindus have a big role in the date trade (which goes mostly to India). In Jacobabad and Kashmore, rice milling and trading are Hindu domains. In Larkana, Hindus have a big role in the rice trade. All of this makes them a target.Hindu girls are in fact the target and this persuaded the two Hindu members of the Sindh Assembly to table the bill about conversions. A member of the Sukkur Hindu Panchayat stated in a 2012 report by journalist Cyril Almeida: Periodically kidnapping Hindus, entering our homes, picking up our children, its all meant to prevent the community from growing, to keep us under psychological pressure. Like the Hindus of Bangladesh  whose constitution is secular  the Hindus of Sindh have tried to migrate to India. Now, if the upper Sindh leader Asif Ali Zardari decides to rescind the law that protects the Hindu community, Pakistan will sink further into chaos.The police are lax. Converted Hindu girls are often raped or beaten and, when the family complains to the police, they let the case drop when the abductors report conversion. In Islam, inward conversion is welcomed, but outward conversion attracts the death penalty, so far not enshrined in law, but all known away-convertees have been killed. Religion is not turning South Asia into paradise. Anand Teltumbde wrote in the Economic and Political Weekly (January 3, 2015): On 8 December, 57 families (nearly 350 persons) in Ved Nagar in Agra were converted to Hinduism by Dharma Jagran Samanvaya Vibhag and Bajrang Dal activists, both RSS outfits.Amarnath Motumal, the vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), reports: About 1,000 non-Muslim girls are converted to Islam each year in Pakistan. Every month, an estimated 20 or more Hindu girls are abducted and converted, although exact figures are impossible to gather.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

Mann is surprised to find how closely his father has been following AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal 's Punjab tour in newspapers.Mann told TOI, ""The days of struggle are still not over for our family. We are six brothers and two sisters and bringing up the family made my father take up menial jobs like selling glasses in adjoining areas before he opened his shop.

Makar Sankranti is when the sun moves towards the north, signalling an auspicious period. Yesterday, Punjabis in the city observed Lohri with fervour, while today Maharashtrians and south Indians will celebrate sankranti adhering to ritualistic norms. While traditions may differ for each family, several rituals observed by people are similar.The day is commemorated with preparation of sweet dishes at homes. Sujata Kothari, a Tamil, says that a preparation of Sakkara pongal, a sweet rice preparation made of jaggery, is common among Tamils to mark the beginning of calendar. ""The first food should be good for stomach and should give heat in the winter. Dal and jiggery used in pongal does that,"" she said, adding that bhogi is the first batch of agricultural produce offered to God.For Telugu, it's the Bhogi festival today, where Burelu, dumplings made of chana dal and jaggery is a traditional Andhra dish prepared for the occasion, apart from pongal. Vipin Sood, a Punjabi, says kheer chawal is a must at his household every Lohri. ""Sarson Ka saag is also a dish we have each year this time. This is the season where heavy food items are easily digested, and such food items help generate heat in the body,"" he says. Similarly, til gud chikki, a preparation of sesame seeds and jaggery, has become synonymous to Makar Sankranti not just for Maharashtrians, but all communities.When it comes to customs, these aren't very different either. ""We make rangolis of chariot,"" says Pushpa Anand, a Tamil. CV Ramakrishna, an Andhraite, shares that his family also makes rangolis, and sit around a bonfire. Bonfire is a big part of Lohri too. 'Revdi', 'makhaana', peanuts and popcorn are offered to the fire. ""For Punjabis, a newly married couple moves around the bonfire, followed by others. 'Sundar Mundariye' is a traditional Lohri song we sing every year, and we sing and dance around the bonfire,"" says Stuti Pincha, a Punjabi. For Telugus, the bonfire resembles a pyre where they attempt to burn all unwanted things and desires,"" says Anand.Tamils and Maharashtrians celebrate Haldi Kumkum on similar lines. ""For Tamils, it is of prime importance for a mother to send money to her daughter during this time. We also give betel nut, kanjeevaram sari, betel leaves, turmeric, mirror, comb, kajal, and other things of use to a married woman. For pregnant ladies, we give black saris,"" adds Anand. Meenakshi Deopujari, a Maharashtrian, says, ""We observe 'sugdyachi vaan' where several items like bindi, bangles and other things are exchanged among married women in earthen pots. For Keralites, sankranti is the culmination of eeklong celebrations of lord Ayyapa's special day, informs Kartika nair, a Keralite, adding, ""we wear traditional saris, organize a feast, and have lamps lit all around the temple, along with taking part in traditional pujas."""

""It was one of the most productive time of my life, when I worked for five years in PPP and finally merged it in the Congress after six years. At the time of merger, we presented an 11-point charter to the Congress on why we had formed PPP -to finish VVIP culture, end policeneta nexus, and take Punjab out of debt. I am thankful to the Congress for letting me accomodate in the manifesto what we were trying to articulate in PPP. Entire mani festo of PPP has been incoroprated in toto,"" says Manpreet.""Manifesto also brought me closer to Congress leaders like former Punjab CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. We toured to meet roadside vendors, knitwear-manufacturers, fur nace-owners, used car-owners, jewellers, stock market traders, dry fruit traders and rice millers for days and days,"" he adds.After having two dilligent yet failed starts -one when his debutant People's Party of Punjab (PPP) failed to win a seat in 2012 and second when he lost by a small margin of 19,000 votes against his sister-in-law Harsimrat Kaur from Bathinda Lok Sabha seat in 2014, Manpreet doesn't hide his emotions. ""The way Harsimrat and CM are making frequent visits to Bathinda comes from the fact that they have staggering hatred for me. That's because I dared to rebel. I dared to contest against the CM's daughter-in-law. They will try every trick up their sleeve to beat me again. It (my victory) is up to the people,"" he insists.But he doesnt harbour malice when it comes to PPP rebels. While former colleague Bhagwant Mann is AAP's star in Punjab, Dev Mann is shaping up well and Kiki Dhillon is fighting for Congress.""I am proud of the fact that they all are products of my school of politics.I wish them good luck in their ca reers,"" he says."
590466837be9e04154df6503,Punjab election questionnaire: Let’s claim our environmental rights,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keep-india-beautiful/punjab-election-questionnaire-lets-claim-our-environmental-rights/,2017-01-15,"History of apathy of major political parties towards environment:In the past as India steadily faced environmental deterioration, ecological decline and depleting water reserves; the countrys main political parties campaigning for elections have all but ignored environmental issues which were utmost crucial to whole of Indias population and this omission has resulted in so many alarming problems which now India faces. We Reap What We Sow. In 2014, World Health Organization confirmed that Indias capital, New Delhi, has the most polluted air in the world, according to data reported by 1,600 cities in 91 countries.Also India being one of the most polluted country in the world with half of worlds 20 most polluted cities in India. The World Bank estimates that environmental degradation costs India 5.7 percent of its annual gross domestic product, and causes a quarter of the countrys 1.6 million deaths among children each year.Past trend has been that main national political parties competing in the elections have published manifestos that touch on the environment, but say little about major problems such as worsening pollution or projections that the country will have only half the water supply it needs by 2030 or how lack of Waste Management mechanism and adequate landfills is turning cities and villages into garbage dump yards.Lets all get united and ask for our environmental rights:Punjab Legislative Assembly Elections are going to be held on March 4, 2017 and all the major political parties have started coming up with their election manifestos, covering all the populist measures under the sun to make it look like all rosy pertaining to the needs of the common man.The population of Punjab was 2.77 crores as per Census of India, 2011 with population density of 550 km2 (highest in Ludhiana, followed by Amritsar), 2.98 crores (Census 2012) and it is estimated to touch 3 crores in 2017. Thus, as the population increases, urbanization and industrialization will increase and take its toll on the already burdened ecology and environment.Thus we, at KIB, on behalf of people of Punjab and India on the whole, have come up with a Questionnaire addressed to each major political party contesting Punjab 2017 Assembly Elections (With copies marked to President of India, Central and State Election Commission, PMO) to understand how they intend to solve below mentioned environmental issues in Punjab if they get elected to power:Please tick the options (Yes or No) and/or answer in complete sentences.1. Although Punjab is known as the Land of Five Rivers, there are locations where water is scarce and women have to fetch clean water from as far as 3 Kms. In the Malwa belt of Punjab, the water table is low; the water is brackish and contaminated with pesticides.Even the districts of Moga, Muktsar, Sangrur, Bhatinda, Ferozepur, Faridkot have been facing similar issues and Abohar, Talwandi Sabo, Pathankot, Fazilka, Malout, Muktsar, Hoshiarpur, Mudki, Malsingh wala, Buladewala, Shekhu, Bagha, Garhshankar are the worst-affected areas.Though, RO plants were set up in some of the villages, the villagers were charged Rs. 60 per month. Thus, unable to pay for water, poor villagers continued to drink water contaminated with uranium, radium, thorium etc. with the result that this region is badly hit by cancer. On the other hand, technologists insist that RO technology is not good for purification of this kind of water.Are there any plans to augment and/or improve clean water resources in the above-mentioned districts/locations of the state?Yes | NoIf yes, how do you plan to do it?________________________________________________________________________2. Waste Segregation & Management is of utmost importance since improperly stored waste causes enormous health, safety and economic problems. We simply cannot bury or burn our waste in dump yards as it causes pollution (air, water, soil, land) and precious resources depletion. The major issue being segregated waste collection from homes as per Punjab Model MSW Plan  2014 followed by their proper disposal.Does your party plan to work on this across Punjab and by when this would get implemented?Yes | NoIf yes, how does your party plan to implement the same if given a chance to govern the State?________________________________________________________________________3. Municipal Solid Waste generation in Punjab is 4300 MT per day (Source: PPCB, 2015). By 2031, the waste generated is expected to rise to approximately 5000 MT per day (Source: TERI, 2015). Almost all the MSW in the state is disposed in unscientific disposal facilities.Two Solid Waste Management (SWM) plants are fully functional in the state, one Municipal Solid Waste treatment plant at Village Waryana, Kapurthala Road, Jalandhar and other at village Pandori Mehtama, Sham Churrasi, Distt. Hoshiarpur. Under Punjab Model MSW Plan  2014, State has been divided into 8 clusters for SWM facilities (collection, transportation, segregation, processing) of which only 4 clusters (Mohali, Bhatinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar) have got environmental clearances for selected Engineered Sanitary Landfill Land.Given the amount of waste generated and current status, by when all the Landfills in 8 clusters would get operational? Would these be sufficient to handle all the garbage generation?Yes | NoIf yes/no, what is your partys agenda on this?________________________________________________________________________4. E-waste generation in Punjab was 11788 tons in 2012 and would rise to 18216 tons by 2021 as per a recent study by ENVIS Centre, Punjab. PPCB has 14 authorised collection centers, 1 producer and 1 dismantler to take care of E-waste.Do you think that it should suffice given the demography, population of state and the amount of e-waste generated? How do you plan to collect e-waste from households?________________________________________________________________________5. Recently, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and Volunteers raised a temporary barrage on the Kala Sanghian drain in Jalandhar to divert the sewage flow towards a sewage treatment plant in Basti Peer Daad.Since it was built in a tizzy, the residents have complained that the polluted water is flowing into the Chitti Bein drain (tributary of Sutlej river) and found the water to be contaminated with heavy metals. The recently built STP (processing capacity of 50 millions litres daily) in Basti Peer Daad (Jalandhar) has been designed to cater the needs till 2025; however it is unable to meet even the present day requirements.If raised to power, how do you plan to check these grave issues since most of the rivers are getting polluted beyond remediation?________________________________________________________________________6. Air pollution is a huge issue of concern in India including Punjab at present. Various reasons for this worsening situation are  huge number of vehicles, construction activities, fuel adulteration, agricultural fires etc.Do you have any plan to control air pollution in different ways?Yes | NoIf yes, how do you plan to do that?________________________________________________________________________7. Industrial city of Khanna is among the worlds 20 most polluted cities. Though the officials claim a reduction in the air pollution levels, the particulate levels PM10 always seem to be beyond the standards of 100g/m3. The residents complaining of respiratory illness has been rising steeply. This proves that the authorities do not take actions against industries, which are polluting the atmosphere.How do you plan to monitor this and take action against the violating industries?________________________________________________________________________8. Agricultural fires are deliberate in Punjab as farmers have this perception that it results in removal of pests and convert crop residues from previous seasons harvest into fertilizing ash. Punjab burnt 80% of its rice residue in 2012.This is a major source of air and soil pollution. Since particulate matter and smoke travel long distances, it becomes one of the major sources of air pollution in neighboring states of Haryana and Delhi also during winters.Despite several Court Orders banning stubble burning and instituting fines for violators, not much action has been taken for strict enforcement. In 2015 and 2016 only 16 and 8 prosecutions were made respectively against violators. Public awareness and educating the farmers about the ill effects of the above mentioned problem seems to be the best solution in sight but they also have to be provided with alternative environment friendly technologies to manage crop residue.Does your party intend to tackle this problem?Yes | NoIf yes, what actions are you planning to tackle this pressing issue?________________________________________________________________________9. The heart of Punjabs industries is in Ludhiana followed by Jalandhar. Textile, manufacturing, leather, rubber and sports goods constitutes major share of industries there. Smaller industries do not follow prescribed rules for effluent disposal and polluting the rivers with dumping of their effluent wastes.Does your party intend to work on this issue?Yes | NoIf yes, how do you plan to do this?________________________________________________________________________10. According to Punjabs Water Supply and Sanitation Ministry, 75% of rural population has access to public toilets while rest of the population will have the same by October 2017. However still a large segment of rural population do not use public toilets and in many cases have demolished them.What plans you have to spread awareness against open defecation and by when Punjab can be declared an open defecation free state?________________________________________________________________________11. The safai karamcharis in the State work in pathetic conditions with no protective gear and no insurance cover for their health.Would your party work for their betterment if given a chance to govern the state?Yes | No________________________________________________________________________12. National Green Tribunal (NGT) has announced a fine of 10,000/- per default for people who litter in public places/ roads in Delhi. NGT has also ordered to slap fines on vegetable vendors and slaughterhouses that throw wastes in public places.Are you planning to take similar initiatives on this front?Yes | NoIf yes, what would be the key steps/initiatives?________________________________________________________________________13. How do you plan to spread awareness among the masses regarding environmental, sanitation and cleanliness issues?________________________________________________________________________How do you plan to educate people in rural areas?________________________________________________________________________How do you plan to educate housewives regarding waste disposal?________________________________________________________________________14. Four-laning of Jalandhar-Barnala highway proposal to boost Punjab-Haryana road connectivity has seeked to clear 160 hectares of forest area which includes felling of 22,700 trees. It is also proposed that the forest department would plant more than 10 times the number of uprooted trees and Public Works Department would bear the cost of the felled trees.Do you think new plantation of trees would be strictly enforced?Yes| NoWhat is the status of the project now and how would you ensure new plantation of Trees as is proposed?________________________________________________________________________15. Major wetlands in Punjab are Harike, Kanjli, Ropar and Nangal. These wetlands are inhabited by diversity of flora and fauna including some rare and threatened plants and animals..The major threats looming on these wetlands include the following: Severe problems of siltation in the reservoir leading to shrinkage of wetland area. The disturbance to the resident and migratory birds, illegal fishing and poaching of wildlife. Accidental outflows of pollutants from industries located in the vicinity affects water quality of wetlands. Inflow of pesticides and fertilizers as run off from agricultural fields and sewage from towns also affects water quality of wetlands. Invasion and growth of weeds in the wetland area is also a cause of concern. Lack of cooperation from people due to their ignorance about wetland values and functions.How do you plan to conserve these wetlands if votes to power?________________________________________________________________________Credit: Thanks to Neha Agarwal for special inputs.

58f4fdbfa3d24b0b70c1be9a,Focussing on the marginal farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Focussing-on-the-marginal-farmer/article17057550.ece,2017-01-19,"The sluice gate on the Bhakra main line canal in Khanauri-Kalan village in Sangrur district, Punjab, has become infamous. According to reports, it is a suicide point for farmers and their families. Typically, 30-45 corpses are found in the canal on average every month. Farmers suicide in Punjab is a major worry: over 2,632 farmers are reported to have committed suicide between 1995 and 2015,in the land famed for its Green Revolution, according to State government records. Mansa district alone accounts for 1,334 suicides. Adding farm labourers raises the total to 4,687 reported suicides. The reasons for this vary: cotton crop has been whittled by whiteflies, basmatis market price has declined, the local moneylender has hiked up rates to 20 per cent. The farmer ekes his way to penury.Farmer suicides are not a new trend. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 2,195 marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in 2015 (of which 834 were in Maharashtra), while 3,618 small farmers undertook such drastic steps, with Maharashtra alone seeing 1,285. More curiously, a larger number of small farmers rather than marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in States like Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. Somehow, small farmers are also bedevilled by the agricultural crisis, and this is not the case in just the traditional drought-stricken States.On input costsAgriculture in States like Punjab is typically a monoculture of wheat and paddy. When input costs associated with fertilizers, crop-protection chemicals and seeds rose, along with fixed costs associated with agricultural equipment such as tractors and submersible pumps, agriculture became economically unviable. Prices have risen  of arhar seeds and staple crops like paddy and sugarcane, of fertilizers and plain barley. The old days of farmers handing seeds as family heirlooms to their sons are long gone. Hiring labourers and animals is expensive. With an increase in application of crop-protection chemicals, soya bean has seen a massive jump in pesticide cost. Given a jump in input costs, cultivation costs have gone up in multiples. The total cost of cultivation for wheat rose three times from 2004-05 to 2012-13.While traditionally the blame is cast on the usurious local moneylender, NCRB data highlight that 2,474 of the 3,000 farmers who were reported to have committed suicide in 2015 had loans from local banks, while those who had loans from moneylenders were just 9.8 per cent of the total. Maharashtra reported 1,293 such suicides for indebtedness, while Karnataka had 946. Meanwhile, farmers in Punjab are estimated to have an outstanding debt of Rs. 69,355 crore. Somehow, the traditional moneylender is seemingly more flexible than local banks.Retailoring agricultureSolving this crisis requires an inclusive approach. Our policies should encourage integrated pest management, an approach that focusses on combining biological, chemical, mechanical and physical means to combat pests with a long-term emphasis on eliminating or significantly reducing the need for pesticides. In Vietnam, over 2 million of the Mekong Deltas rice farmers adopted a no spray early rule, curbing insecticide applications within the first 40 days of rice planting. Predatory beetles that commonly prey on rice pests were sustained, encouraging the crop while cutting pesticide use by over 50 per cent.The local fertilizer industry needs support  timely delivery of subsidies would improve working capital requirements, enabling them to manage costs through internal sources rather than external loans. Delayed payments can cause an interest outgo of Rs. 3,500 crore for fertilizer firms annually. State seed policies should focus on encouraging contract farming, along with identification of new genotypes for treating pest and disease syndromes, as well as adverse weather conditions. Precision-farming techniques like Systematic Rice Intensification can help increase seed production in this regard.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment and implements that are currently imported. Subsidies should be rerouted to ensure lower collateral requirements, longer moratoriums and payback periods for farmers seeking to buy equipment and entrepreneurs seeking to setup Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) for agricultural equipment. Companies with a corporate social responsibility focus on agriculture can be further encouraged to invest in capacity-building initiatives, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.We need to ensure that institutional financing is available and accessible and benefit provision is simplified while disbursed funds are effectively monitored. States should seek to establish early warning signals, monitoring farmers who go past set limits and seek unsustainable loans. Village-wise lists of deeply indebted farmers must be prepared annually to identify farmers on the flight path to penury and potential suicide. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, along with the local administration, should be tasked with analysing such lists for macro and local policy interventions, along with devising timely loan restructuring initiatives, insurance claim settlements and better counselling.Finally, such individuals must be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Given the hard struggle of making a living in agriculture these days, such farmers face big odds for sustaining their families and educating their children. Travelling through the by-lanes of suicide-stricken villages in Bijnor, Bahraich, Kheri, Allahabad, Aligarh and Moradabad is a humbling and disconcerting experience. Even distributing Rs.50,000 per distraught marginal farmer family has had little impact; so deep is the scale of agrarian distress. Our efforts in crowdfunding have been a palliative for over 3,000 farmers, but only systemic change can transform their situation. The marginal farmer requires more than just hope now.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency for the BJP.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment that is currently imported"

A sudden jump in cashless transactions was registered in the city after the note ban. ""Before November 8, 2016 there were hardly 2% buyers who were using credit/debit cards at the petrol pumps. However, the number shot up to 35% after the demonetisation,"" said MP Petrol Pumps Dealers Association president Ajay Singh. The situation changed by the end of December last year. ""The number of customers using cards to purchase fuel dipped to 25%,"" said Singh. There are 105 petrol pumps in the city. About the reason behind the decline in customers using cards, he said it might be because of the availability of cash in the market. ""I can't say it for sure, but it may be because of the easy availability of cash now,"" he said.The scenario is no different when it comes to grocery stores. There are around 50,000 grocery stores in Bhopal. Bhopal Kirana Vyapari Sangh president Sunil Punjabi said the customer is not prepared to shift to cashless transactions at present. ""Hardly 4 to 5 per cent retailers are into cashless transactions. The situation is even worse among the dealers. Hardly 2% dealers are into cashless transaction,"" said Punjabi.Citing the reason for not much cashless transactions, he said, ""For buying a chocolate or even one kg of rice neither customer nor vendor are ready to swipe card or paying through any other payment gateways. It will take time."" Even the roadside vendors who have started using payment gateways felt that people are also keen on making cash payment as the flow of cash is returning to normal in the market. ""For past one week I am getting more payments in cash. I had started the service to facilitate cashless payment, but people are in such haste that they do not want to spend much time on making payment for a tea or samosa,"" said Prakash Chandra, a small breakfast shop vendor.Few vendors felt that it will take time to inculcate the habit of cashless transaction. ""After the increase ATM withdrawal limit to Rs 10000 a day customers have started returning to the cash mode,"" said another street vendor selling Chinese food."

Its at a food festival that you can relish all at the same table. Rivayaat, the food festival, by Trident Hyderabad at its restaurant Kanak is highlighting authentic recipes from different parts of the country.Noteworthy about the food promotion is that none of dishes are overpowered by spices or oil. The taste is balanced much like ghar ka khana that makes you feel asking for that extra helping of Punjabi Matar Pulao. The rice was done with butter and crushed fried onions. It tasted well with Puran Singh Ke Dhabe Wali Chicken Curry. The curries served had neither too thick nor too thin gravy.

The result was a succulent and juicy fish piece.The Lucknowi Dal served along side the rice was roasted and then cooked which gave it a smoky flavour and home-like taste. Baigan Ka Bharta was simple as was Sarson Ka Saag which we enjoyed with Makke ki Roti. In the appetizers you must not miss Kumbh Ki Gilavat as its quite a challenge to find out that its not a mutton kebab, but is made from mushrooms. The taste is as good as the mutton kebab that dissolves in mouth. The festival is on till January 25. Time: 7 pm  11:30 pm. Charges: for the set menu is `2,100+ per head"

The price of the popular brand, which was Rs. 32 a kg last month, has touched Rs. 42 a kg in the retail markets.Crop failure of this paddy variety has been blamed for the shortage and the next crop is due for harvest only in April.The commodity mainly arrives from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana though Tamil Nadu and Karnataka partly meet the demand.The crop has failed in the latter two states too following drought. This could compel merchants in the southern districts to depend on rice varieties from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, which are not popular among consumers.Varieties from Uttar Pradesh sell around Rs. 32 a kg and that from Punjab Rs. 33 a kg in the retail markets. Andhra rice, which was earlier used only in Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and parts of Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts, is now gaining popularity in Ernakulam and Thrissur too.Rice merchants here said on average three trains carrying 30,000 sacks of Andhra Pradesh rice used to reach Kollam a week. Now, only two trains have come in the past two weeks.Retail merchants, who source rice from wholesalers, said since the past two or three days they were unable to get the required quantity. Wholesalers said they had to meet the demand of their clients and there was a shortage of stock.There is also uncertainty over the stock position of the Jaya variety rice in Andhra Pradesh. There are concerns that the rice variety may go out of stock in the wholesale market if a train carrying the commodity fails to arrive this week.Dealers said the situation was critical. Such a shortage of Andhra rice in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram was witnessed last in April 2008, the wholesalers said."

In an interview with TOI, he claimed that the way Congress and Shiromani Akali dal (SAD) had been training their guns on his party, it was a sign of their desperation over AAP's rise as a political entity.It is party to a political conspiracy to vitiate peace in the state. I have demanded that there should be action against SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, as there could be more trouble. Political rallies are usually safe. The reports we are getting about sophisticated explosives being used points to a conspiracy.It has to be understood what is happening. Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh have become desperate due to AAP's popularity. Captain has declared that the 35,000 NRIs coming down to Punjab for campaigning are terrorists. They (NRIs) are sons of the soil. When we bump into a Punjabi boy or girl at a showroom in Canada or Amsterdam, we feel proud of them. Have they become terrorists for supporting AAP? At the same time, Badal's business interests and the conflict of interest with governance is at the root of most problems in the state.That's rubbish. In Delhi, we had said that we will take action against any state leader or minister if found guilty of financial misappropriation. In case of Chhotepur, we adopted the same policy of zero tolerance. He was our own-state level leader and we ourselves took action on realizing that he accepted money. The party leadership cannot ignore such things.Badal's own people are going to constituencies and saying if you don't want to vote for SAD, vote for Congress and not AAP. They don't want to let people think independently. It is a clear sign of their being hand in glove. Captain has foreign bank accounts and everyone knows Badal cannot take action against him.In my opinion, it will be a repeat of Delhi. AAP will win with an overwhelming majority. I can feel a positive energy when I meet people in markets and suburbs. I was in Jagraon today as the local candidate revived her campaigning. Before that in Ludhiana, I went for a morning walk and a person rushed home to gift me a ""Gita"" and said we need to get rid of evil forces in the state.We have changed the course of political discussion. The industry in the state has been deliberately killed so that Badal family's own businesses prosper. The policies for the common traders are such that they can never comply and no one can dare to question those in power. AAP will bring in industry-friendly policies for Punjab. Badals should have focused on running the government, not their businesses. It can be done when out of government. The family that decides transport policy also has its own fleet of private buses. Meeting traders from the state has been a very overwhelming experience for me. They told me: ""Bahar taale, andar jaale (locks on the outside, cobwebs inside)."" That sums up the state of industry here. Rice millers from Abohar were equally disillusioned.My statement was misinterpreted. The party works on an agenda and feels that the reforms in education and healthcare that have been implemented in Delhi will be replicated in Punjab if AAP forms the government."

590467297be9e04154df660f,Untested Sasikala to take over as chief minister of Tamil Nadu at a point when the job description just got tougher,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/untested-sasikala-to-take-over-as-chief-minister-of-tamil-nadu-at-a-point-when-the-job-description-just-got-tougher/,2017-02-07,"Mass protests in January to express unhappiness over a Supreme Court verdict which ended jallikattu was Tamil Nadus most defining moment in recent times. The protests, which were catalysed by improbable groups using social media for mobilisation, defies categorisation. But it does show there is deep-seated public resentment against the states prevailing political culture.In this backdrop, VK Sasikalas ascent to the chief ministers office is incongruous. The events which led to her election as legislature party leader of AIADMK represent a political culture which runs counter to what protesters seemed to want. Unsurprisingly, it led to a flurry of unflattering jokes on social media. Sasikala, who has never won an election, will take over the administration when both the state and she face significant challenges.The disproportionate assets case is likely to resurface this month as a division bench of the Supreme Court is expected to pronounce a verdict soon. The events which led to the case remain in public memory and they will make it difficult for Sasikala to quickly earn wide public support.Beyond the personal challenge, as chief minister she has to lead a state that faces social and economic problems. Tamil Nadu is in the grip of a terrible drought and some speeches at the jallikattu protests reflected the attendant anguish. This is not a one-off issue as recent weather patterns and water scarcity have made farming a highly risky venture. In 2012-13, agricultural output in Tamil Nadu contracted by a little more than 10% on account of water scarcity.Both AIADMK under Jayalalithaa and DMK have used enhanced welfare spending to blunt the edge of erratic weather patterns on the agrarian economy and job insecurity in urban areas. Sasikala will presumably do the same but will face tougher challenges compared to her predecessors. Tamil Nadu has a problem with its tax collections even if it does not have a debt problem like Punjab.On some crucial indicators such as the ratio of interest paid on debt to the annual revenue, it does fairly well. But going ahead the space to manoeuvre is shrinking just when social problems have begun to show up. O Panneerselvam, in his role last year as finance minister, complained that growth in commercial taxes was low. The problem isnt new and there dont seem to be cogent ideas to deal with it. Sasikala, as a CM without experience at this time, presages a long and frustrating summer for the people.She represents a phase of Tamil Nadus political trajectory which saw institutions being hollowed out alongside harsh suppression of dissent. It may have worked for a while as this phase was also accompanied by an expansion of welfare architecture, best represented by free rice distributed through PDS. But the environment is far more challenging now and the next chief ministers stock response for everything has been Amma.Neither Jayalalithaa nor M Karunanidhi had a response for the social fault lines which crisscross rural Tamil Nadu. The state has an unfortunate reputation for honour killings, particularly on the heels of inter-caste marriages. The Dravidian parties have sidestepped the issue as their politics has increasingly become devoid of substance. It is difficult to see how the person set to become CM of Tamil Nadu is going to deal with the issue. It is not just an issue of local caste conflicts. The problem also comes from caste-based political mobilisation which tries to frame economic challenges as identity issues. An inevitable fallout is friction, which sometimes takes violent forms.Not only has Sasikala plenty of internal problems to confront, there are also inter-state issues. All through the tortuous negotiations to bring about GST, Tamil Nadu has been a reluctant participant. Neither AIADMK nor DMK have been comfortable with it. But with GST almost through, the state needs its leadership to protect its interests. Also, the Cauvery issue will resurface soon enough and needs deft handling. It is anybodys guess if Sasikala will have the inclination to network and thereby secure a good deal for the state.Given the magnitude of challenges Tamil Nadu faces now, Sasikalas ascent represents inability of the political culture to adapt to change. This may not be the best of times for Tamil Nadu."

Crop-residue burning had led to air pollution across the region and also severely affected air quality in the National Capital Region.According to the Hisarbased Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), the area in which stubble was burnt in 2016 was more than what it was in the previous two years and the same as 2013.""Stubble was burnt (during the harvest period) in over 2,08,000 hectares in 2013 and the successive two years showed declining trend. However, in 2016, stubble was burnt over the same area as it was in 2013,"" HARSAC chief scientist R S Hooda said on Tuesday .HARSAC has been doing this study for the last four years. A few years back the National Green Tribunal wanted the centre to find out how much area was involved and look into the magnitude of the problem (stubble burning), he said.""Satellite data showed that in 2013, stubble was burnt in 2,08,000 hectares of land, in 2014 in 1,78,000 hectares and in 2015 in 1,63,000 hectares. However, in 2016, it suddenly increased to what it was in 2013.Last November, we saw smog engulfing the Delhi and the NCR,"" Hooda said.The chief scientist said North and northwestern districts of Ambala, Yamunanagar, Panchkula, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad and Sirsa are the major rice growing areas.""Last year, we got this data from the districts. Major fire points were identified and as many as 12,500 points were seen,"" he said, adding daily satellite data indicates active points during harvest season.Many farmers in Haryana and neighbouring Punjab have over the years continued with the practice that has led to health risk and adversely affected soil health."

As Pusa Institute is situated in Delhi, there has been continuous development of agriculture in the adjoining States like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Two more agricultural research institutes, in Assam and Jharkhand, have been opened for the holistic development of agriculture nationwide, he said.Because of the adoption of crop varieties developed by Pusa Institute, meaningful and multiple changes had come about, he said. Earlier, we depended on other countries for grain, but now we are helping other countries by providing [them] food security. With the cultivation on 10 million hectares of wheat varieties developed by the IARI, 50 million tonnes of wheat was being produced. Basmati rice accounts for Rs. 22,000 crore in the agricultural exports totalling Rs. 1 lakh crore, and of this, the Basmati varieties developed by Pusa Institute account for 90%, he said.A state-of-the-art automated phenomics facility, established by the IARI, would be useful in studying the environmental stress. This facility will be used for developing plants that yield more by consuming less water and fertilizer, he said.Mr. Singh said the ICAR-IARI had developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective technology for making waste water pollution-free and useful for irrigation."

The State of Global Air 2017 study, conducted jointly by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, quantifies further what has been reported for some time now: that the concentration of the most significant inhalable pollutant, fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5), has been growing in India. The rise in average annual population-weighted PM2.5 levels indicates that the Centres initiatives to help States reduce the burning of agricultural biomass and coal in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi have failed. The directions of the National Green Tribunal to Delhi, which were reviewed last year, could not end open burning of garbage and straw, or curb the urban use of diesel-powered vehicles. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the weighted national PM2.5 level estimated in the international report rose from 60 micrograms per cubic metre in 1990 (the acceptable limit) to 74 in 2015, with a steady rise since 2011. Weak policy on pollution is leading to the premature death of an estimated 1.1 million Indians annually, and the number is growing, in contrast to Chinas record of reducing such mortality.Several studies show long-term evidence of a steady deterioration in air quality in many countries, and South Asia, dominated by India, is today among the worst places to live. Although the central role played by burning of crop residues in causing pollution is well-known, and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute proposed steps to convert the waste into useful products such as enriched fodder, biogas, biofuel, compost and so on, little progress has been made. Last year, helpless farmers in the northern States who wanted to quickly switch from rice to wheat burnt the waste in the fields, in some cases defying local prohibitory orders. The government has no one to blame but itself, since it has not been able to supply affordable seeder machinery in sufficient numbers to eliminate the need to remove the straw. In a country producing about 500 million tonnes of crop residues annually, the issue needs to be addressed in mission mode. Easy access to cheap solar cookers and biogas plants will also cut open burning, and help the rural economy. Yet, there is no reliable distribution mechanism for these. On the health front, it is a matter of concern that in the most polluted cities, even moderate physical activity could prove harmful, rather than be beneficial, as new research indicates. Indias clean-up priorities need to shift gear urgently, covering both farm and city."

The main accused in the case, Mandeep Singh Brar, owner of Avtar Rice and General Mills located in Rajeana village, is still absconding. He is the son of SAD leader Jagtar Singh Rajeana, and also the chairman of Punjab Agricultural Development Bank (Baghapurana branch).Watch What Else Is Making NewsA SIT, constituted in February 2012 after an FIR was filed against four persons by the Moga police, completed its probe and submitted its enquiry report, following which the arrests have been made. The SIT of crime branch was led by Sushil Kumar, AIG crime Patiala.The FIR was registered on the statement of Harpinder Singh Dhaliwal, then district manager MARKFED Moga. A case was registered under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant)and 120 B (conspiracy) of IPC.The SIT enquiry report stated that Brar, in connivance with MARKFED employees, embezzled paddy worth Rs 18 crore. The report adds that embezzlement of such a huge extent was not possible without involvement of MARKFED employees. The report, nailing all four persons initially named in FIR along with two others nominated in the case, has ordered Moga police to immediately arrest all the accused.The rice mill owned by Brar was allotted to The Punjab State Co-operative Supply & Marketing Federation Ltd (MARKFED)- one of the government agencies procuring foodgrain from farmers for custom milling of paddy and delivery of rice to Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 2010-11. 5.49 lakh bags of paddy weighing 19,241 MT were allotted to the said rice mill but they milled 5,632 MT only and a remaining of 13,609 MT that is 3.88 lakh bags worth Rs 18 crore was found missing. The remaining stock never reached FCI godowns and police filed FIR against Brar and three others in 2012.The arrested includes Amarjit Singh Sandhu, the then district manager MARKFED, Sham Lal, then salesman MARKFED Baghapurana, Vakeel Chand alias Vicky, the accountant of Avtar Mills and Makhan Singh Langeana, another rice mill owner.Sham Lal and Sandhu were named in FIR in 2012 while two others were nominated later in case by SIT. Another MARKFED employee Kamal Kumar named in FIR died during the probe period.SAD leaders son abroad, police unsure of countryBrar absconded soon after FIR was registered in 2012. He reportedly flew to Canada. However, on December 4, 2016, he was spotted at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, from where he even managed to take a flight to Amsterdam. He managed the flight despite the fact that the Punjab police had issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) against him. It was later found that he used a forged passport to get a boarding card. He was consequently booked in another FIR for cheating, impersonation and forgery by Delhi police.Sukhdev Singh, DSP Baghapurana said, Of four persons named in FIR two are arrested while one died. Brar is absconding. Two others nominated by SIT are also arrested. He added, We suspect that Brar is in Canada currently but now with SIT report finally with us, we will find his exact location.

This strong statement has come from one of Punjab's respected economists R S Ghuman in his study titled 'Water Use Scenario in Punjab beyond the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal'.The study was published in 'Economic & Political Weekly' journal in its January edition and some of its observations are crucial at a time when Punjab and Haryana are eyeball-to-eyeball over the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.Ghuman, professor at CRRID, who was earlier heading the economics department of Punjabi University, has pointed out that there is need to address the problem of excessive irrigation for paddy, lesser rainfall and canal water coupled with growing number of tubewells and its result in depleting water table in the state.Ghuman told TOI, ""On the SYL canal, there is need for review of the water supplies of the Beas and Ravi calculated to be 17.17 million acre feet (MAF) as part of the agreement in 1981. The situation in Punjab has changed drastically since then.""""A serious review, taking into account the current availability of the quantity of water, is of utmost importance. The optimum use of water, especially for paddy irrigation, can save substantial amount of water, thus, reducing the intensity of conflicts over river water sharing. The two states need to give increased attention to sustainable use of water, along with asserting their claims over the river waters,"" said Ghuman, who is former vice-president of Indian Society of Labour Economics.""There is also an urgent need to have a strong policy intervention to reduce the area under paddy or find less water consuming varieties of paddy. Micro irrigation, direct sowing and sowing on raised beds need to be promoted in a big way. Rainwater harvesting, conservation of water and sustainably-informed use of water are necessary routes to save Punjab and Haryana from turning into a desert,"" added Ghuman.PADDY PROBLEMTraditionally, Punjab has never been a rice producing and consuming region. Paddy accounted for only 6% of the cropped area in 1960-61 which increased to 69% in 2012-13. The share of area under paddy in kharif cereals increased from 33% in 1961 to 96% in 2013.Paddy has been the main culprit for depleting water table as it needs 22-25 irrigations in a span of four months. The combined evapotranspiration in wheat and paddy is 1,030mm.The problem of groundwater scarcity started raising its head during the 1980s and was highlighted by the Johl Committee reports on crop diversification. However, the Punjab government responded for the first time in 2004 by constituting a state-level committee on ground- water resources estimation. The committee submitted its report in 2012 without any effective recommendations. The state's policy of giving free electricity to the farm sector (followed also by Haryana) further hinders crop diversification and results in unsustainable use of water.LESSER CANAL WATERAt the same time, availability of canal water to the state has been drying up. ""Out of the total irrigated area of 20.20 lakh hectares in 1960-61, 58% was under canal irrigation. It declined to 27% in 2014. The area under canal irrigation reached at its plateau (16.60 lakh hectares) in 1990-91, thereafter it started declining.""TUBEWELL TROUBLEThe result was, says Ghuman, that most of the farmers have already deepened their tubewells six to eight times during 1975-2005. ""The number of tubewells in Punjab increased from 1.92 lakh in 1970-71 to 13.85 lakh in 2013-14. The per hectare tubewell intensity, in terms of net sown area, increased from 0.047 in 1970-71 to 0.334 in 2013-14. In 2000-01, the share of tubewell irrigated area increased to 76% (30.74 lakh hectares) and thereafter, its share remained around 73%. Not only the area under irrigation - and that too under tubewell irrigation - increased but irrigation intensity also increased from 54% in 1960-61 to 99% in 2011."" The net deficit of groundwater for irrigation development in Punjab increased from 8.01 million hectare feet in 2004 to 12.02 million hectare feet in 2011.POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS""In view of the ensuing assembly elections in Punjab in February 2017, the political atmosphere is highly surcharged over the SYL canal issue. There has been a water war between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over Cauvery water. The SYL canal has similar seeds in its bed,"" adds the study."

There are 109 lakh beneficiaries who are eligible to get rice and other grains under this scheme from nearly 21,000 fair price shops.Sources from the department said they procure 2.17 metric tones of rice every month from the Government of India for `3 per kg.We give 5kg of rice per person for BPL families. But many are not using it as the rice is thick and not ideal for cooking. They use it to make dosas or idlis. Since they do not need the rice in large quantity, they either sell it to shops or strike a deal with fair shop owners.In a few cases, the fair shop owners who will have excess stock will sell the rice to other shops for extra price. Grains given by the state government, especially rice are being misused. Cases have also been registered against some individuals, fair price shop owners, rice mill owners and truck owners for transporting the rice illegally, sources said.Bhagyamma (name changed), resident of Gangondanahalli said they make ragi mudde, twice a day. As we are a family of six members, we get 30 kg of rice per month. We hardly eat rice, so we sell it to a nearby shop, she said.How many days can we eat dosas and idlis. We get rice for cheaper price, so we buy it, she added.As per the data available with Express, since 2013-14, 33,995.47 quintal of rice (close to 34 lakh kg of rice) and 9,202.57 qunital (close to 92,000kg of wheat) has been seized by the department officials. They also seized some quantity of ragi, sugar, oil and other products.However, when compared to rice, the supply of other products is less in terms of quantity. We supply rice per person. Whereas, other products like sugar, ragi and oil are given based on number of family members, said sources.When contacted, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said more number of cases are detected due to sincerity of officials.According to World Health Organisation, the intake of carbohydrates by an individual should be more so we are increasing the quantity of rice per person in our budget, he said.Over thick rice being supplied, Minister said they get rice from Punjab and Haryana which might be little thick. People who are illegally selling it will anyway find an excuse, but the thickness is not the sole reason to sell rice, he said."

Abhinav Saha Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh with Chief of National Bureau Maneesh Chhibber at The Indian Express office . Abhinav SahaCongress leader and the partys in-charge for Goa polls, Digvijaya Singh, reflects on why they failed to form a government in the state, says the party in power at the Centre forms the government in Goa, calls for strengthening the regional leadership and insists that only Rahul Gandhi can help build a new CongressManeesh Chhibber: What do you think went wrong in Goa?Nothing. Let me give you a blow-by-blow account. I was made in-charge of Goa sometime in late 2013. The party was in a disarray. As far as this election goes, I as general secretary had strategised that we should have an anti-communal front. There were these two people, Babush Monserrate and Vijai Sardesai Babush was a sitting Congress MLA, but he had walked out. Sardesai was also in the Congress earlier, he wanted to contest the 2012 election, but was denied a ticket.I touched base with him (Sardesai). I was in constant touch with Babush also, and as a strategy they said let us have a secular front, with the Congress in the lead. So, Babush, Sardesai and the NCP, were invited to discuss a pre-poll alliance. We went for the elections, we ran a very low key campaign and attacked AAP more than the BJP, because they were encroaching on our votes.We were successful in reducing the AAP to zero. Their CM candidate lost, he got only 1,400 votes, and the party was decimated. BJP came down from 24 to 13. We got 17 plus one, 18 seats. Churchill Alemao of the NCP won. I was there since the evening of March 10. We wanted to have a CLP meeting on March 11 itself at 6pm. But I dont know what they did with the counting. It is such a small state with each constituency having no more than 25-30,000 votes. Counting only finished at 7.30 in the evening. After that there were rallies etc and the Congress MLAs could not reach the PCC office even till 9.30 pm. They called me and said we are very tired, lets meet tomorrow. I said, fine, lets meet tomorrow.Then, we went to meet Sardesai late in the night, sometime around 12.30 am. He was angry that my party had put up a candidate against him. But we convinced him and promised to meet all his demands. He said that my primary demand is that X should not be the chief minister. We agreed.We returned from his place around 1.30 am, without realising that things will change again. Next day I found out that Brij Bhushan Singh, the MP from Gonda, who is the All India Wrestling Federation president, had accompanied Nitin Gadkari to Goa. Now, Vijai Sardesai is the state level wrestling federation president of Goa. So, Brij Bhushan Singh walked in after we left, and the wrestling started. He took Sardesai to Gadkari, and they were together between 4 am and 7 am.I came to know much later that this was done. I trusted him. Around 10 am the next day I started calling Rohan Khaunte and Vijai Sardesai, but there was no contact. I called his PA, security, no reaction.We called our CLP meeting at 11 and by 3.30-4 PM the exercise was over. Sardesai wanted Digambar Kamat to be the CM, so we decided to elect him. We called Digambar Kamat and told him that please make us talk to Sardesai so that we can tell him that you are our leader. He kept on calling, again no response.Then the press informed me that Sardesai was with Nitin Gadkari, since 4.30-5 pm. So then I called up Sardesais mentor, who said there is no question of GFP going with the BJP. Then, GFP president, Prabhakar Timble, he also said there was no question of allying with the BJP.Suddenly there was a phone call, and they said, Sir sorry, they are going to the Governor.See, my basic objection is that in Parliamentary democracy of course numbers count, but it has to be on the basis of the mandate received. Any political party if it gets the majority, they are invited to form the government. In case of a fractured mandate, the single largest party has the largest mandate. This was not followed in Goa. The Governor should have waited. By doing this she has contravened constitutional provisions.See, the letter to the Governor only goes once the leader is elected . When we called the Governors office we were told there is no one here today because it is a Sunday, so you leave the letter at the gate.We have also now moved a substantive motion against the Governor, which will be discussed on Monday, asking for a recall.P Vaidyanathan Iyer: Do you feel completely outsmarted by the BJP, given the pace with which they moved in Goa?The new government is fragile and I dont think it will last.Let me give you some background. In 94 there was a fractured mandate in Goa. Congress was in power at the Centre, and the party formed the government in the state as well. In 1999 Congress got the majority, Congress formed the government. In 2002, there was a fractured mandate, there was a BJP government in Delhi, BJP formed the government (in Goa). In 2007, again fractured mandate, Congress was in power in Delhi, Congress formed the government. In 2012, BJP got the majority, and in 2017 again when we have a fractured mandate, BJP is in power in Delhi and they formed the government. This is history.Vandita Mishra: You pointed out the history of Goa, and said that in times of a fractured mandate in the state, the party that is in power at the Centre forms the government in the state. So what you are saying, in other words, is that the Congress has been as responsible for flouting the constitutional principles in government formation in Goa, as the BJP is being accused of now.No. What I am saying is that every time there has been a regional party which doesnt have a mandate, we have seen that the single largest party has been given the opportunity. It has never been the case that the party with the lesser number of MLAs has got the opportunity, overlooking the rights of the single largest party.Anand Mishra: As a senior leader of the Congress, what, in your opinion, is ailing the party?Nothing. The issue is that Congress is not a cadre-based party. We have not been able to build up enough regional leadership, which is necessary in todays times. Leaders such as Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had a larger than life presence, because of which we could ignore the regional leadership. Post the Narasimha Rao period, regional leaders have emerged, even in the BJP. Now the Congress party has to basically look into building regional leaders more aggressively.Anand Mishra: But there are several states, such as Maharashtra and Haryana, where the BJP has won the elections without a state face. Dont you think the problem is at the national level?Rahul Gandhi is now our vice president, and by and large, Soniaji (Gandhi) has abdicated in favour of Rahul Ganhiji. He is the person we are all reporting to. He is calling the shots now. As far as he is concerned, I think he has got a raw deal from the media. Whenever the party wins, he doesnt get credit for it, but when the party loses, he is blamed. We have won in Punjab, but the credit has been given to Amarinder Singh. If we had lost the state, the discredit would have come to Rahul Gandhi.We have beaten the BJP in Manipur and Goa, but no one gives him credit for it. At the same time, there should be a fresh move to rejuvenate the Congress.Coomi Kapoor: In UP, do you think it was a mistake to go along with the SP?What is the basic strength of the Samajwadi Party? It is a party of Yadavs. What is the strength of the Yadavs? Lathi. Without the lathi, the strength of the Yadavs goes away. So, when this break up took place in the family Akhilesh is a softer face of the Yadavs, Shivpal is the lathi face of the Yadavs. So because of this (family feud) they did not even do well in their home grounds. Break-up of the family just before the polls went against them. Rahulji and Akhilesh, they make a great pair, but BJP very successfully polarised the voters, which sort of went against us.Liz Mathew: Who do you hold responsible for the lack of a regional leadership in the Congress?Every Congress leader is responsible, but at the same time there are certain basic issues on which we need to work on, such as bringing up a new leadership. There is no dearth of new leaders in the Congress, it is just a question of giving them opportunity. In 2005 I told Sonia Gandhi that we have to bring out a new Congress. A committee headed by Veerappa Moily was formed. Unfortunately, we could not act on the ideas we discussed then.The demographic profile of this country is changing. We cannot attract Dalits, tribals, anymore by giving them rice for Rs 1/kg, and wheat. Their aspirations have changed. Dalits and the tribals have moved into a middle class society and they are different from the Scheduled Castes of the 70s and 60s. We need to take that into account and formulate strategies according to that.Krishn Kaushik: The Congress has lost some important leaders in the recent past who say the high command was not willing to listen to them  Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, N Biren Singh in Manipur.Himanta Biswa Sarma is an amazing fellow. I have been in-charge of Assam for seven years. He is a political animal par excellence. He is also a great operator and manipulator. We shouldnt have lost him. As far as our friend, the new CM of Manipur is concerned, he was the Himanta Biswa Sarma of Okram Ibobi. So, they must have fallen apart.Krishn Kaushik: These leaders claim that the Congress party rewards loyalty to the family over talent.I dont agree with that. This is a family which has political instinct, a political heritage and acceptability among the Congressmen. This family binds the Congress together. That is their strength.Liz Mathew: The BJP and Narendra Modi have managed to successfully project the Gujarat model in their campaigns in other states. When it comes to the Congress, is there any state that can be projected as a governance or development model?I admire the marketing skills of Narendra Modi. Gujarat has always been a developed state, it is not because of Modi. Also, the Gujarat development model is totally centralised, whereas the Congress believes in decentralised functioning of the government.Karnataka has empowered its elected representatives, and the state government has done exceedingly well on all fronts, but it has failed to market itself. I am in-charge of Karnataka, I have been telling Siddaramaiahji, if Narendra Modi, without anything, can market himself on the national, international scene, why cant you market Karnataka.Liz Mathew: You said that the Gandhi family is the binding factor of the party. There are three members of the Gandhi family, would the Congress consider a change in the leadership?Thats a family affair, I dont want to get involved in it. Let them decide. But I can tell you one thing, Congressmen throughout the country will be very happy if Priyanka Gandhi joined active politics.P Vaidyanathan Iyer: One thing that the Congress appears to be failing at is providing a counter-narrative to the politics of the BJP.Yes, that sums up the weakness of the Congress party. A clear distinction between the ideology of the BJP and Congress has to be made and conveyed aggressively to the public. I have been saying this for a long time. Sometimes, I feel, the Congress party holds itself back when there is need for a punch. BJPs ideology is that of hate and violence. Congress is a party of love, compassion and non-violence. We are Gandhians, Nehruvians.We cannot have some form of soft Hindutva, there is no such thing. Mahatma Gandhi understood India. India is not a communal country, it has a secular mindset. We have absorbed Islam. Sufism came here. We have absorbed Christianity.The problem with Islam now is that the Wahhabis are getting more acceptance in the Muslim world. Wahhabism and the RSS are basically two sides of the same coin. We have to drill into the minds of people that this country will not take religious fundamentalism of any kind, Hindu or Muslim. Jawaharlal Nehru had rightly said that majority communalism is more dangerous than minority communalism.This is the country of Gautam Budh, Bhagwan Mahavir, Mahatma Gandhi, love, compassion, non-violence. Our country cannot see this violence. War is always the last option. Here we have people shouting about why we should go to war with Pakistan. Is it good for the country? Who suffers in a war? The entire nation suffers. Narendra Modi is a warmonger. He will take this country into a limited war before the 2019 elections. Mark my words.The Congress party has to aggressively take up Gandhian-Nehruvian socialism against the religious fundamentalism of the Sangh.Sanchari Bhattacharya: Why has there been no action on the observations of the AK Antony Committee report?I would say that we want a new Congress, a new charter, a new road map, a new style of campaigning A new Congress has to be built and there is no other person who can do it better than Rahul Gandhi. He has to act. My complaint against Rahul Gandhi is that he is not acting decisively. I have told him this a number of times. Sometimes he gets angry when I keep repeating the same thing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

58feeefc7be9e0429666b929,Discover Delhi: A runaway poet from Kashmir and her poem about running away,http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/discover-delhi-a-runaway-poet-from-kashmir-and-her-poem-about-running-away/story-d82BfjOavQ3OGp3XnL6eEI.html,2017-03-24,"A paperback of Aga Shahid Alis poetry is lying on her living room mattress. The small table has an old copy of The New Yorker. The shelf is stacked with authors such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Marcel Proust, and Mirza Waheed.And then she wants us to believe she is a qualified biotechnology engineer.But that is nothing more to her than a graduation certificate.We are meeting Samia Mehraj this afternoon in her capacity as a poet. Mehraj, who recently received the coveted Young India fellowship, is looking forward to spend a year in Ashoka University, Haryana, where she will study liberal arts.In her 20s, she lives alone in her apartment with her books, her rice cooker, her laptop, and her note pads. There are no windows, which is probably a good thing because her neighbourhood in south Delhis Maidan Garhi is mostly a mumbo-jumbo of dusty lanes and concrete structures built without any concession to conventional architectural aesthetics. Even if Mehrajs flat was in a less congested locality, the window view might still have not been as beautiful as the one at her parents home in Kashmir.Mehraj grew up with a younger brother in Srinagar and Sopore where her father works as a civil engineer and mother as a Zoology lecturer. The window of her room in their Sopore house looks to an atmospheric street, an old dilapidated building and lots of poplar trees.Non-Kashmiris gather the stories about Kashmir from books, magazines and newspapers, says Mehraj, While an average Kashmiri like me knew it all merely by gazing out from our windows.Referring to her lands decades-old insurgency, she says, It hurts to see people dying.Actually, Mehraj does have a window in her Maidan Garhi flat but she keeps it closed and has instead decked it with yellow notes scrawled with Aga Shahids lines. One chit says: My memory is again in the way of your history. Another says: Your history gets in the way of my memory.In a way, Mehrajs life is full of gentle rebellions. When I was in Kashmir, I had to struggle with its conservative ways. I could never be myself. I wanted to run away. But when Im in Delhi, I want to run away back home.Mehraj moved to Delhi in March 2016 despite the reservation of her parents. She briefly worked as a creative content writer for a start-up in Gurgaon. To me, Delhi is like the Paris of runaway girls. This city challenged me. It is here that I became an independent woman.In the beginning, Mehraj wanted to be an engineer but her parents insisted on a career in medicine. Apparently, she says, most parents in Kashmir want their daughters to be doctors.But Mehraj did not budge and studied engineering in a university in Punjab. She started writing poetry only a year ago, though was always drawn towards it because of her father who tends to hum (only hum) ghazals in his melancholic voice.Mehraj shares excerpts of her poem - The runaway girl - with us.Doesnt thunder come homein the hottest of summerwhen the vows are broken and a girl runs away from her home?You must have adored her gold anklets.It must have been tinkle in their sound that never gave it away.Or maybe they shone too darkly in your stone eyesand blinded you so.Pray, why else didnt you see how they weighed her down?And now she tiptoes down this ghostly town.while you fret and fondle in your pitch dark beds.The little light that shed been kindlingso carefully, so secretlynow guides her out, guides her away!And how you wish that she was more obedient to you,and not to her waywardness,this runaway girl!Explaining the story behind this poem, she says: Leaving home with a hope that Ill be a writer one day wasnt easy. Crowded city, small rooms, hot weather and a purpose to find. I did survive it but convincing my parents to let me experiment and live in a city alone instead of doing a masters in engineering was hard. They loved me but couldnt understand me.She goes on to say, This was extremely stressful for me and my parents. At that point of time, I found Alok Dhanwas Hindi poem titled Bhagi hui ladkiyan somewhere on the internet and it instantly filled me up with emotions. Later, I clenched my fists and penned down this poem. I slept well that night."
58ff1b117be9e0429666d8b7,"VIDEO | Blooming business, but for a few: The state of floriculture in Punjab",http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/blooming-business-but-for-a-few-the-state-of-floriculture-in-punjab/story-hepFJM6tIe6MZQjsiwAZ5M.html,2017-03-25,"A teachers vision and a students passion gave India its first floriculture farm in Punjabs Patiala district in 1985. Thirty-two years on, Avtar Singh Dhindsa, 61, takes a deep breath as he sits in the gazebo overlooking rows and rows of flowers daintily dancing in the spring breeze in his 800-acre farm at Gabhrian village on the road to Malerkotla. Im happy I fulfilled my teacher Ajay Pal Singhs dream of seeing flower seeds made in Punjab bloom across the world, particularly in Europe. Today, I dream of seeing floriculture flourish in Punjab.Watch the video here:The pioneer in the business walks fast, often leaving his better half Sukhvinder behind, but knows growing flowers, like love, takes time and patience to blossom. Going from zero to 2,000 acres under floriculture in three decades is no mean achievement for Punjab, he says when asked why growing flowers hasnt taken root as a diversification option beyond the Patiala, Sangrur and Ludhiana belt.Whether it is the business of cut flowers, raising saplings in nurseries, growing bulbs, producing seeds or processing extracts, floriculture fetches high returns. But conditions apply. This field needs an isolated vast area, water that is not saline, specialised training, skilled labour, and the owners hands-on involvement.HOW THEY GREWDiversification in floriculture has been limited so far because it is labour and technology intensive, needs a vast field to avoid cross-pollination and is demand driven. The demand for flowers is catching up slowly so progressive farmers are warming up to this niche crop, says Ajmer Singh, the head of the department of floriculture at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana.For those keen on adopting this field, the three national award-winning floriculturists of Patiala district suggest starting out small. Avtar Singh began with floriculture in 3.5 acres of the 18-acre ancestral land in 1985. Start with an acre as you need to be directly involved even if you have trained labour. I drive down from my home in Ludhiana daily because I cant ignore my flowers for even two days between October and May, he says.A mechanical engineer-turned-floriculturist Gurpreet Singh Shergill, who owns 36 acres at Mujhal Khurd, 15km from Patiala on the road to Samana, says, My father Baldev Singh was a regular farmer who followed the wheat-paddy cycle. When I joined my elder brother Karamjit Singh in farming, we decided to diversify. I equipped myself with knowhow in floriculture, fish farming and beekeeping. We started with an acre of marigold in 1996.Today, he transports 10 quintals of fresh flowers, most of them red rose stems, daily in his pick-up jeep from his fields and polyhouses to florists in Patiala. Wholesalers pick up his fresh flower supply for Ludhiana and Chandigarh. I grow a variety of flowers from marigold, gladioli, statice to the desi rose. This is a perishable product that needs care and supervision so I dont venture out too far like Delhi. I started seed production two years ago, he says.Farmer Gurpreet Singh in his farm house in Mujhal Khurd village in Chheka road in Patiala. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)NOT SO ROSYAbdul Wahid, 52, a mechanical engineer from Patialas Thapar University who turned flower seed exporter, is the eighth generation of the family to stick with the business of horticulture. I could have made more money had I set up rice mills but I stuck to horticulture. My passion drives me, he says of his farm set up in 1990 and spread over 30 acres at Dhablan village on the Patiala-Nabha stretch.In 25 years, we have trained 500-600 contract farmers in the vicinity to supplement our flower seed production and export. Many new farmers give up on floriculture when they face rough weather or encounter hardships as retaining labour is difficult and one has to be hands-on, he says.The labour cost is high as plucking dry flowers and processing for seeds involves manual work that calls for patience and diligence. No wonder these farms prefer employing women from surrounding areas.We grow seeds for foreign companies on contract. The labour cost is $80-100 (Rs 5,200-6,500) a day in Europe, while here it is $4-5 (Rs 250-300). Yet these women earn more than their husbands, says Avtar Singh.Since the demand for flower seeds is less in India, Wahid exports them to Holland, Poland and Germany. As an exporter, he hopes the government streamlines the certification for seed quality and germination standards. We need an independent liaisoning and certification authority that both the exporter and customer abroad respect. Otherwise, we face exploitation and harassment at the hands of foreign companies, he says. He cites stricter laws for foreign customers in China, Vietnam and even Tanzania.Another concern he flags is hurdles at the Customs. The import procedure is so slow that at times the mother seed stock from abroad arrives after the sowing season is over. This despite having all permits, Wahid says. The productivity of seeds falls if not sown the same year.STAY STUBBORNDespite their struggles, all three floriculturists believe the secret of their success is staying rooted. Im a little stubborn, admits Avtar Singh, but you have to be stubborn to succeed.Shergill says the turning point for him was the winter of 2000. Two acres of the marigold crop was damaged due to fog. When I reported the loss to my father he said: Kamana jaante ho toh khona bhi seekho (You know how to earn so learn to take loss too). I stuck to growing flowers and it has paid off.Another common feature with the three is that they have diversified to shield themselves from losses.WHAT FARMERS WANTTo make floriculture a viable diversification option, the three farmers want the government to take up landscaping in its offices, grow flowers in public spaces, and improve infrastructure and connectivity. If the demand increases, more farmers will take to floriculture.The 1.5-crore population of Holland consumes more flowers than the 100 crore-plus people in India, says Wahid.He also suggests replacing rather than recycling seeds every season for sharp colours and uniform features.Highlighting market fluctuation, Shergill says, Jab tara doob jata hai toh hamara bhi tara doobta hai (During inauspicious times, we run out of luck too). But Shradh (the period of rites for the departed) is followed by the Navratras (nine days of festivities) so we have learnt to adapt.Avtar Singh hopes his alma mater, PAU, looks at innovative agriculture and studies market intelligence worldwide to help boost floriculture in Punjab.The government can also support flower growers in marketing the produce in other states. We need more automation in farming. PAU can help by developing specialised harvesting machinery. Make farming an attractive option for the youth, says Wahid.Meanwhile, a centre for excellence for floriculture is coming up at Doraha near Ludhiana in collaboration with Holland. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 7.5 crore and the state has received the first installment. Farmers will be trained in applied floriculture technology to enhance profitability, says Punjab horticulture director Gurkanwal Singh."

Gurmeet Singh Farmers buy seeds during Kisan Mela at PAU in Ludhiana Saturday. Gurmeet SinghThe Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) sold more than 300 quintals of seeds of its new paddy variety PR-126 during the two-day kisan mela which concluded here Saturday.A short-duration variety maturing in just 125 days, PR-126 takes less water, making it suitable for water scarce conditions in Punjab. It has a yield of 30 quintals/acre.Currently, it is PUSA 44, the variety developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and HKR-48 by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), that dominates fields in Punjab.However, the scientists at PAU have warned farmers against PUSA 44 cultivation. This variety falls under non-recommended category of PAU. It is to shift farmers preference from PUSA 44 that PAU introduced a better variety in form of PR-126 last year. However, last year, its seeds were available for trial basis in limited quantity only. This time, they were sold in bulk to the farmers at Kisan Mela.Speaking to The Indian Express, Tarsem Singh Dhillon, director (seeds) at PAU, said, We do not recommend or sell seeds of PUSA 44. This variety is not only long-duration one taking more than 160 days to mature, but it also requires more water. Also, it is prone to various diseases. On the other hand, PR-126 introduced by PAU now takes just 125 days to mature, consuming less water and more resistant to various bacteria. This year, our target was to encourage farmers to grow PAU recommended varieties only.Although yield of PUSA-44 is near 32 quintal/acre, a little more than 30 q/acre of PR-126, it is prone to diseases and takes too long to mature, said Dr RS Sidhu, director extension, PAU.As per data accessed by The Indian Express from the seeds department of the varsity, PAU sold 327 quintals of seeds of PR-126 in two-day Kisan Mela at the campus.However, PAUs two old varieties, PR-121 and PR-114, recorded the highest sale of 444 quintals and 369 quintals, respectively. PAU also sold more than 300 quintals of PR-114 and 211 quintals of PR-122.Considering it was the first year of bulk seed sale of PR-126, it has recorded excellent sales, said Dhillon.When it comes to basmati rice seeds, PUSA-1121 of IARI recorded the highest sale of 295 quintals. The two new basmati varieties introduced by PAU this year, Punjab Basmati 4 and 5, recorded low sales at 14 quintals and 4.30 quintals, respectively.In his address, PAU Vice-Chancellor BS Dhillon had told farmers to buy new basmati variety seeds for trial basis only.Of the total area under rice cultivation in Punjab, around 64% is under paddy and rest is under basmati high quality rice.In basmati, PAU variety Punjab basmati-3 covers just 1.5% while 23% is under PUSA-1121 and 11.2% under PUSA-1509, both of IARI.In paddy, PAU varieties cover 26% area only while rest 38% is under HAU and IARI varieties, approximately.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 5:27 am"

Source: Gurmeet Singh A farmer taking bags of PR-126 paddy seeds purchased from the Punjab Agricultural Universitys Kisan Mela at Ludhiana. Source: Gurmeet SinghA new variety maturing within 125 days, yet yielding nearly as much as those now grown over 135-160 days, could provide the ultimate solution to Punjabs woes stemming from farming of water-guzzling paddy.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has released a paddy variety PR-126 that gives an average of 30 quintals per acre. This is only marginally below the 30.5 quintals from PR-121 and PR-124 or the 32 quintals of the other popular variety Pusa-44.But the real difference is in the duration, from the time of sowing seeds in the paddy nursery to harvesting of the ripened grain. This ranges from 135 days for PR-124 and 140 days for PR-121 to 160 days in the case of Pusa-44. PR-126 matures in just 123-125 days, including 30 days of nursery raising and 93-95 days after transplantation of seedlings.The average yield per day from the new variety, at about 24 kg per acre, is more than the 20 kg of Pusa-44 or 22 kg for PR-121 and PR-124. The shorter duration also means less water consumption. If farmers have to give, say, 26 irrigations for Pusa-44, this would be only 21-22 in PR-121/PR-124 and 17-18 in PR-126, claims G S Mangat, head of PAUs rice improvement programme.PR-121 and PR-124 were released for commercial cultivation in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The PR-126 variety was officially released for planting in the coming 2017 kharif season at last weeks PAU Kisan Mela here. Last year, about 400 quintals of seeds was made available on trial basis to select farmers. This time, we are distributing another 1,000 quintals. At 8 kg planting per acre, it will again cover only a limited area, adds Mangat.PR-121 has, within a span of three years, become Punjabs most widely-cultivated paddy variety. Last year, it covered over 7.7 lakh hectares (lh) or 30.7 per cent of the states total non-basmati paddy area, with PR-124 accounting for another 9.8 per cent. In the process, Pusa-44s share, which was 39 per cent in 2012, fell to 20.3 per cent.We have not recommended cultivation of Pusa-44 (developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi) in Punjab mainly due to its long duration. The nursery sowing has to be before April last week and transplanting by mid-May, to enable harvesting from October and timely planting of the next wheat crop. The water requirement will obviously be high during this peak summer period. Secondly, Pusa-44 is susceptible to bacterial blight. There is no chemical control available against the Xanthomonas oryzae pathogen causing this disease that can result in significant grain yield loss, explains Mangat.Released in 1993, Pusa-44s main attraction was its yields. At 32 quintals per quintal, this exceeded the average 26 quintals of PR-106, a 145-day PAU variety that was till then Punjabs workhorse paddy following its introduction in 1976. Being a medium-slender (fine) grain giving higher head rice recovery than PR-106, which produced long-slender or superfine grains, also made Pusa-44 a favourite with millers. The Union governments decision merging fine and superfine paddy into a single Grade A category from October 1997  entitling Pusa-44 to the same minimum support price (MSP) as PR-106  further tilted the advantage in favour of the former.The last straw came from the Punjab governments policy of supplying free power to farmers. When water could be freely pumped out to allow transplanting even in May, the farmer had reason to grow a long-duration variety that gave him extra yield. But it came at the cost of the stateswater table, points out Satinder Singh Brar, a retired senior extension specialist with PAU, who has advocated a ban on Pusa-44 cultivation.According to latest official data for 2010-11, groundwater resources in 110 out of Punjabs 138 blocks were overexploited, with average extraction rates from aquifers exceeding recharge levels. Underground water being overdrawn has been attributed to paddy cultivation area in the state rising from under 3 lh to over 30 lh between 1965 and 2016. It has led to the enactment of the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act in 2009, barring any nursery sowing and transplanting of paddy before May 15 and June 15, respectively.PAU vice-chancellor B S Dhillon believes that weaning the Punjab farmer away from paddy is impractical, as it is a crop entailing less production risk and with an assured market based on MSP procurement. The more sustainable solution is in breeding short-duration, but high-yielding, varieties that require less water. The new PAU varieties, from PR-121 to PR-126, can be comfortably transplanted after mid-June 15 or even towards the month-end with the monsoons arrival.We bred these mainly by crossing PR-106 and PR-116 (a high head rice recovery variety released in 2000). Further, the PR-106 parent itself incorporated three bacterial blight resistant genes Xa4, xa13 and Xa21 (sourced from traditional landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy).The transfer of these genes in pyramided combination lines (to confer durable resistance) involved use of molecular breeding and marker assisted selection techniques, informs Mangat. The end-result has been reduced-duration paddy varieties having bacterial blight-resistance, and with yields and head rice recoveries comparable to Pusa-44.Last year, I sowed PR-126 on 20 acres and harvested 33 quintals per acre, despite undertaking transplanting only on June 27. This time, I plan to increase my area under the new variety to 25 acres, says Kulwinder Singh, a 30-acre farmer from Mardanpur village in Patiala districts Rajpura tehsil.For over a decade, we grew Pusa-44 because yields could even go to 35 quintals per acre. But with PR-126, I am getting around 31 quintals, while also saving money on running my diesel generator to ensure standing water for the transplanted paddy, notes P P S Pangli, a progressive farmer from Ludhianas Panglian village, who grew PR-126 on 22 out of his 82 acres.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Located off Marquis Street, the only temple in Kolkata for the 1,900 Sindhi families in town, turned into the centre of festivities. The celebrations that started last Sunday ended on Wednesday with prayers and feasting on the special prasad.After losing Sindh to Pakistan during Partition, jewellers Mehtanis were the first Sindhis to make Kolkata their home. ""We are Hindus, but we also believe in Sikhism,"" said Nanik Sambtani, one of the oldest members. Chetti Chand starts with the families carrying out Bahrana Sahib at home. ""It's the lighting of a five-pointed diya made of atta on a thali with fruits, rice and sweets,"" Sambtani said.At the temple, the members help prepare the elaborate prasad. The traditional feast comprises tairi (sweet ri ce), pulao, sai bhaji (spinach with chana dal) and alu tuk (deep fried potatoes).

Also, if you are lucky like me, you might even witness a flash mob by the staff on Bollywood chartbusters.Despite the menu sporting dhaaba food, the lip smacking dishes and cocktails are anything but street side and is definitely up in style and Punjabi flavours. Chef Shivam Bose introduced us to the menu that included Paneer Tikka, Veg Galouti and Tandoori Bhune Aloo as starters for vegetarians. For mains, you can pick from Dal Dhaba, Paneer Makhani and Amritsari Chole along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan.For non vegetarian starters, choose from Highway Chicken Tikka, Tawa Mutton and Tawa Chicken. For the mains, pick from Butter Chicken, Rarra Ghost, Kadhai Chicken and Dal Dhaba along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan. For sweet endings, go for some rabri, gulab jamun and phirni.For the Chaat FlavourIf you love chaat flavours, I would recommend you to order Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Paneer Tikka. The paneer cuts through smoothly and is tempered very well with spices. The Bhune Aloo are roasted baby potatoes, tossed in spices and served beautifully with onions and tomatoes. Two of my favourite things  potatoes and tomatoes  put together with roasted flavours and tempered with chaat. Was I a happy woman? Damn, right.While I have heard of Galouti Kebab, I had always perceived as a non vegetarian dish. But here, thanks to chef Shivam, I got a taste of its vegetarian version, where just like the meat one, the vegetable is minced to smoothness through slow cooking, flavoured with cinnamon and black cardamom and placed over a maida crispy base. The galouti is buttery smooth and the base adds the crunch to this dish.The non-vegetarian version of the galouti had lamb minced and cooked to buttery smoothness. The chef definitely earned respect on the dinner table having cooked the meat so well. The effort of the kitchen and its use of technique shows beautiful with this starter.Be it the medium rare Mutton Seekh, the Amritsari Machli or vegetarian starters, the kitchen at Dhaba by Claridges has got its flavours and cooking technique right on the money.The Chitta Butter Chicken is served with white sauce. Flavoured in kasoori methi, this dish is cooked in tandoor with the marination of hung curd and spices. The meat is well cooked and bursts of zesty flavours.The Balti Meat is the houses signature dish, which steals inspiration from the famous mutton curry of dhaba. The curry has all the flavours of a Punjabi house kitchen. Although the gravy looks spicy, at no point do any of the favours overpower the centre-piece sticking out of the bucket serving bowl  the mutton.The Tawa Mutton Pulao has flaky Basmati rice that is tossed in spices and tempered with spices that you will find in any Punjabi kitchen. The dish is light on the stomach and has a fresh mint garnish with well cooked meat pieces. If you are a rice fanatic, do give this one a try.Gujju Dreams Come TrueBeing a Gujarati, I had to ask for the Kadi Pakora, and boy, was I impressed. The thick curd-flour consistency, flavoured well with turmeric and spices, served with pakoras drenched in the gravy won my heart. I definitely missed home a little less with this preparation that is famous across North India.While theres so much to talk about the food, one place where Dhaba by Claridges proves its versatility is the cocktails. They are all flavoured with chaat spices and my God, are the one of the most impressive mixes I have had so far."
593aebc37be9e00e1ecd4969,Strain on 'buffalo power',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170403/jsp/nation/story_144240.jsp,2017-04-03,"INDIAN EXPORT SHRINKS, PAK SMELLS CHANCE Beef exporters like Priya Sud have started to chicken as meat shops were targeted in Uttar Pradesh in the past week after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to crack down on illegal abattoirs. ""There is unease within the industry... our local supplies have been cut off. Our importers want to know what is happening in this country,"" says Sud, a partner at Al-Noor Exports that prides itself as one of the oldest and largest exporters of frozen buffalo meat in the world. India accounts for nearly 56 per cent of the world's buffalo population and racked up exports worth Rs 26,685.44 crore in 2015-16. Exports of carabeef - the meat of the water buffalo - were 17.5 per cent higher than basmati rice exports of Rs 22,718.44 crore. In the first nine months of this year (April-December), carabeef exports topped Rs 20,000 crore, around 1.4 per cent of overall exports from the country. Uttar Pradesh is the epicentre of the country's $4-billion meat export business with 43 of the 79 central government-approved abattoir-cum-meat processing plants located in the most populous state, churning out nearly half of India-labelled meat sold abroad and a fifth of all meat produced in the country. The state has over 300 registered slaughterhouses and 41 export-oriented meat processing plants run by some of the top meat exporters in the country, including Allanasons, HMA, M.K. Overseas, AOV Exports, Al Kabeer, Mirha Exports and the Al-Noor Group. Despite their Arabic-sounding names, many of these companies are owned and operated by Hindus. A sense of fear hovers in the air and everyone involved in the meat business - farmers who rear cattle, middlemen, factory owners and transporters - is uncertain about the future of the industry itself as hotheads scout for targets and the state government comes under pressure to come good on its poll promise to close down the abattoirs. Sources say nine of the 41 export-oriented meat processing plants in Uttar Pradesh have closed down since the new government came to power in the state. The others are operating at barely 10 to 15 per cent of their capacity. The campaign against meat consumption has resonated in other areas with Gujarat tightening its law on Friday by prescribing life imprisonment for those found guilty of slaughtering cows, calves, bulls and bullocks. Although buffalo meat processing is not covered by the legislation, meat factory owners live in fear that they could become soft targets as rabid rhetoric finds violent expression in the northern parts of the country. Already, the Shiv Sena has enforced a ban on meat and fish consumption in Gurgaon, one of north India's largest industrial hubs and home to several technology and financial services giants. ""The crackdown on the meat retailers and the closure of several small units have forced exporters to adopt a wait-and-watch attitude. Nobody is taking fresh orders and many are weighing the option of shifting their units to other states like Punjab,"" said S.P. Sabharwal, secretary-general of the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters' Association. Punjab is emerging as a new centre for the meat trade after Uttar Pradesh and the Andhra-Telangana region. While India's largest meat exporter, the Cdr Satish Subberwal-run Al-Kabeer, is located in Medak in Telangana, Punjab's Derrabassi in Mohali district is fast turning into a new centre for meat processing with the earlier Akali government and the current Congress one supportive of the meat business. Most of Punjab's modern abattoirs are processing buffalo meat but the government is working on a pig meat processing plant with an eye on the market for pork, both within the country and abroad. ""India's Hindi-speaking, north Indian cattle belt is also the country's buffalo belt as well as sheep and goat belt, which is why most of the large, modern factories exporting meat are located in Uttar Pradesh, with a spillover in Haryana and Punjab. ""Direct cargo flights from Delhi to West Asia, which is an important market for us, is another reason why the meat processing industry is located here,"" said Vishal Johri, a merchant banker who advises exporters. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, along with Andhra and Telangana, have the largest livestock population in the country. The antipathy towards meat consumption in the north has coincided with the electoral fortunes of the BJP, sparking fears of a backlash against those who resist attempts to force people to adopt a lifestyle that doesn't offend Hindu sensibilities. ""The current mahol (atmosphere) against meat-eating is strange because 71 per cent of Indians are non-vegetarians,"" says Hafiz Mohammed Sahid, a Delhi-based meat trader and exporter, quoting a 2014 census of food habits in the country carried out by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner. Data show that Telangana has the highest number of non-vegetarians at almost 99 per cent, followed closely by Bengal (98.55 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (98.25 per cent), Odisha (97.35 per cent) and Kerala (97 per cent). But the rise of Hindu extremism has coincided with the gradual decline in meat exports and the fortunes of the industry as a whole. Meat exports have fallen by 15 per cent from $4.78 billion in 2014-15 to $4.07 billion in 2015-16. Data sourced from the Registrar of Companies show that the turnover of Al-Kabeer Exports declined to Rs 469.75 crore from Rs 761.76 crore in the previous year, largely the result of a decline in exports to Vietnam and Egypt. Net profits of the company also shrank. Indian buffalo meat is preferred because of its competitive cost. It is especially sought after in West Asia and regions with a high Muslim population since many factories use the halal or kosher techniques in their slaughterhouses, which religious Muslims and Jews prefer. While India accounts for 12 per cent of all halal or kosher meat exports worldwide, its next-door neighbour Pakistan accounts for 8 per cent. In the West Asian market, the two are keen rivals. ""Pakistan has always been our rival in the Middle East, but India has wider acceptance globally as a source of hygienically processed, quality meat,"" said Johri. However, Pakistan has been working to increase its livestock to compete. Between 1996 and 2006, it has managed to increase its buffalo population from 20.3 million to 27.3 million. India, of course, remains the bigger ""buffalo power"" with some 108 million buffaloes, up from 83 million in 1992. ""The so-called 'pink revolution' of meat processing and exports has been possible because of our ever-expanding livestock population, which again is a result of our white revolution. If we reduce our exports, competitors like Pakistan and Brazil will weigh in; that's natural,"" Johri said. Older buffaloes, which stop yielding milk, and male buffaloes are the ones that are sold to slaughterhouses as farmers primarily rear cattle, buffaloes as well as goats for milk in India. ""The meat industry is the byproduct of the dairy business. If there is a threat to the meat industry, the dairy trade will also collapse and farmers will be the biggest losers. India is at the top in the dairy business because it tops in meat production,"" said Fauzan Alavi of Allana Group. Alavi, who is also the general secretary of the All India Meat & Live Exporters' Association, said licenced slaughterhouses or export-oriented units have to comply with at least 21 permissions, both from the Centre and the state, to operate and that the government should not ignore the importance of the sector. The meat factories in Uttar Pradesh provide direct jobs to around 5 lakh people. If one plant closes down in the state, 1,500 jobs are at risk. Sources say the government has clarified that it is not against legal slaughterhouses but the word has yet to percolate down to lower-level officers. So, several plants have been shut on flimsy grounds. ""If some minor lacuna is found, the government should give the industry some time to resolve the matter,"" Alavi said."

(Representational Image) Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has already taken up the matter twice with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (Representational Image)Three days after the wheat procurement season commenced in Punjab, the state is yet to receive the Cash Credit Limit (CCL) as the Ministry of Finance now wants it to update its accounts of the previous kharif season. The state government had cleared its dues pertaining to last Rabi season on March 16 after Captain Amarinder Singh, took over as the Chief Minister, and directed the finance department to clear Rs 270 crore to ensure CCL for wheat procurement was sanctioned in time.However, sources in the finance department said the Centre had asked the state to update the accounts of the kharif season as well. The functionaries of the department said it is an harassment by the Centre as the paddy procurement season end in May.After all five agencies procure paddy in September every year, the process of milling and filling of godowns goes on till May as it requires time. There is no way to keep the accounts updated till the entire rice reaches the godowns. Huge amounts of rice are still lying with the millers, said a functionary.As the CCL is caught up in the wranglings between Centre and state, Finance Secretary Anirudh Tewari, who was transferred to the department on Saturday went to Delhi on Monday to get the CCL released.Amarinder has already taken up the matter twice with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal too met the Union Finance Secretary three days ago to get the CCL released. It should be released by today or tomorrow. There is no need to panic as the procurement season would start full throttle only around April 9, said Badal.He added they were expecting a yield of 105 lakh MT but they were prepared for lifting 120 lakh MT. Punjab had sought an advance of Rs 20,660 crore from the Centre for the procurement. Sick of the delay, the state government is even mulling following the Harayana way to procure the grains.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

From customary rituals in the morning to savouring langar and enjoying cultural performances, the revellers are in for a grand treat...Baisakhi celebrations are incomplete without a visit to Gurdwara in the morning. General secretary of Gurdwara Singh Sabha committee, Prakash Singh Jabbal, says, ""Baisakhi is not only the harvest festival for the farmers in Punjab, it also marks the formation of Khalsa Panth for us. After the shabad kirtan in the early morning, around 5000 people participate in Amrit Paan ceremony, which is a very important ritual for all of us.""After prayers, people savour langar, prepared by the volunteers of the community. Jabbal says, ""More than 20,000 people will savour the special Baisakhi feast throughout the day at the Kamptee Road Gurdwara today. To feed so many people, we are using 17 huge sacks of flour, 500 kg daal, 600 kg rice and 20 large woks full of vegetables. We are also serving matar paneer, kulche, chole, doodh jalebi, rajma and tomato chutney. Anyone can come and join us for the langar today and celebrate with us. Also, the youngsters of the community have volunteered to serve this grand feast to people because it promotes the feelings of seva.""On the occasion of Baisakhi, the Jaripatka Sikh community is organising various cultural programmes. One of the organisers of this cultural medley, Amrit Singh Sindhu, shares, ""We are organising the traditional giddha dance today at 11am at Jaripatka community hall, followed by a magnificent performance of gatka  a Sikh martial art technique. These events are important to keep the youngsters connected to our roots and culture.""While community meals, rituals and cultural performances add a festive touch to Baisakhi celebrations, they also provide an opportunity for families to spend time together. Educationist Tanpreet Kaur Tuli says, ""Since Baisakhi is also the beginning of the new year, all of us celebrate this festival together at home. We are making a delicious Punjabi dinner for our family and friends, wherein I will serve dal makhni, rice, naan, paneer and a lot of vegetables. What makes Baisakhi special for us is that all of us spend quality time together and share laughter. Nothing can beat this joy."""

Agricultural experts are recommending a major overhaul in policies to address this ""deep-rooted"" problem.At a conference on 'Connecting the Dots  Air quality challenges in monitoring, implementation and health' on Wednesday, air quality and agricultural experts said the government needed to address the issue holistically and not just by penalising farmers. National Green Tribunal has imposed a fine ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000  depending on the farm size  on farmers who indulge in burning stubble.""Banning and penalising farmers will not help because how will you identify which farmer is burning crop? It's difficult. Plus the farmer is burning it out of compulsion. The government can support some mechanisation at the village level for taking out the straw and then putting it to use by, say, composting it. The farmer should see economic value in the exercise,"" Ramanjaneyulu G V, executive director at Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , said at the conference organised by Global Strategic Communications Council. The government now gives subsidy on equipment to sow stubble in Punjab and Haryana.The paddy-wheat system leaves farmers with the sowing time of less than a month between the two crops, pointed out Umendra Dutt of Punjab-based Kheti Virasat Mission. Mechanised harvesting and monoculture of wheat and paddy are also behind the problem of stubble burning. ""The cropping pattern should change . In Andhra, bean gram and black gram are planted while rice stubble decomposes on its own. The government should also procure pulses and oil seeds which are suitable for north India. The problem of stubble burning will never be solved otherwise,"" added Ramanjaneyulu. He explained that the amount of stubble generated is higher than the harvest. Every four tonne rice or wheat leave behind about six tonne straw. Nearly five-seven tonne straw per hectare stay unused. Just one tonne of straw burning can release up to 3kg particulate matter (PM), 1,460kg carbon dioxide (CO2) and 199kg ash.While Delhi and the rest of the NCR are exposed to severe levels of pollution, burning also leads to an immediate decline in the bacterial and fungal population in the top 2.5cm of the soil. Repeated burning permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50%, increasing farmers' dependence on fertlisers and pesticides. ""The government subsidises nitrogenous and other fertilisers. Burning stubble in Punjab is equivalent to wasting subsidies worth Rs 500 to Rs 1500 crore,"" estimated Ramanjaneyulu.'Proof on health impacts'Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Centre for Atmospheric Sciences in IIT Delhi, said several studies in India showed that air pollution was strongly linked to severe health impacts like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, heart disease and mortality. ""I think policy-makers are looking only at traditional journals,"" Dey said while answering a question on why the Centre is suspicious of reports linking air pollution and mortality.He quoted nearly 21 medical studies published from 1980 onwards by Indian physicians and scientists linking air pollution with upper respiratory symptoms in the 1980s and lower birth weight due to mothers' exposure to polluted air in the 2000s."

""The young generation needs to know about their guru. In the countryside, the New Year is marked with crop cutting.Shivanjali Mendiratta, a chartered accountant said, ""On the occasion of Baisakhi, Punjabis usually wear yellow clothes and cook yellow rice. Bhangra is also performed to celebrate the festival but the festive zeal is seen more in the countryside.""As a part of the celebrations, in rural areas, people pray for healthy crop and good production. However, not much happens in the city,"" she added.Not just Punjabis, but several communities who observe the solar calendar will also be marking their new year on Friday. Odias, Keralites and Tamils will also mark their new year on Friday. Coincidentally, the day will also be observed as Good Friday for the Christian community. Adding to the string of auspicious days, April15 will mark the start of Bengali New Year. The festive atmosphere will culminate with Easter on Sunday.""Good Friday is the day when Jesus was crucified which we observe by fasting,"" said Dintis Thomas, a member of Kerala Catholic Association and a resident of Narendra Nagar. The cross will be taken to 14 stations across the city as part of a rally from Grotto near Seminary Hills on Friday. ""Entire meal for each us for the day is just a spoon of bitter juice, rice and water. In the evening, a mass will be organised,"" said Thomas.Vishu, the New Year for Keralite, is celebrated by decorating lord Krishna's idol a night before the new year. Fruits and vegetables along with a mirror are also kept near the idol. ""This ritual is performed by eldest person in the house,"" said Ravi Nair, a software engineer and a resident of Besa.""We also put a diya, coconut, jackfruit and drumsticks. In the morning of the New Year, the eldest member then calls everyone blindfolded and makes them see the mirror. Money is also given to all the younger ones in the household. At the temple, the priest gives a coin to all the devotees,"" he added.Tamils celebrate Puthandu just like they celebrate Pongal, said Mohan Chandran, a resident of Ram Nagar. ""We wear new clothes and make sweets such as kheer and rice dishes. At the temple, the pandit tells us what to expect in the New Year such as the position of the stars and the rain,"" Chandran said.We work through the year accordingly. Puja is performed and prasad is distributed,"" Chandran said, adding the relatives also visit each other's place to mark the occasion.Artabandhu Behera, who lives in Dabha, will be celebrating Odia New Year typically called as 'Pana sankranti.' ""On this day, we make a sherbet made of sugar, lemon, Indian bael, milk, curd, fruits and coconut. We will offer it to all our guests. The Jagannath temple will also offer this sherbet to the devotees. This is our way to beat the heat. Besides, our food will have preparations of rice and kheer.Bomkesh Dutta, who runs a catering business and resides in Borgaon, said his club named Rooprang has Bengali people as members. Hence, we organize a cultural festival every year near Durga mandir at Katol road. We sing, dance and have non-vegetarian dishes, especially fish, and sweet dishes such as kheer to celebrate the day.

The evergreen revolution involves the integration of ecological principles in technology development and dissemination."" He has made this observation in context with the 50 years of Green Revolution in the country in an article written by him that was published in the Elsevier Journal.The former director general (DG) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) had worked closely with noted American farm scientist Norman E Borlaug to introduce high yielding varieties (HYV) of wheat in Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh.""The major problems associated with the Green Revolution are related to environmental factors like depletion and pollution of groundwater, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. It is these deficiencies that can be remedied through the 'evergreen revolution' pathway developed by me over 30 years ago. Therefore 50 years later we should work for a transition from the green to an 'evergreen revolution', leading to an enhancement in productivity in perpetuity without ecological harm. The technology involves the mainstreaming of ecological factors in technology development and dissemination,"" Prof Swaminathan has mentioned in his article.He further stated that to achieve the goal of food security by ending hunger and to promote sustainable agriculture, it is important that in the field of social protection as well as the scientific measures needed for achieving food and nutrition security, we should move from the green to an 'evergreen revolution' approach.The 91-year-old plant geneticist, who also served the DG of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Manila, has stated, ""Also agriculture, nutrition and health should be brought together in terms of design and delivery systems relating to public health and agriculture production.

Farmers cannot wait to sell their crops in the wait of good price as they neither have heavy storage capacity nor enough money. Just a handful of big farmers can afford to wait for a good price to sell their crop.In the past six weeks, the rate of 1121 Basmati has been going for Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal and 1509 Basmati Rs 3,200-3,300 per quintal which is said to be one of the best prices in the recent past since the crop has met with poor fate in the past few years. This is one of the best prices since 2014, said rice sellers.We are getting Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal for 1121 Basamti rice as the rates of Basmati have gone up since March, said Vinod Gupta, a Fazilka-based commission agent and former president of Arhtiya Association where basmati has one of the biggest mandis. He said since March, the rates have gone up from Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal.He admitted that farmers could not sell it beyond Rs 2,000 and Rs 2300, which was almost half the current price of the crop per quintal after harvesting as they cannot hold the crop for long. Not only 1121, which is fetching around Rs 4,000 per quintal, but the 1509 variety, too, is getting a very good price between Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,300, said rice seller Sanjiv Anad from Mukerian, adding that the crop rates are decided by the rate in the international market and this time, it is fetching good price.We are growing basmati on 5 to 7 acres and after selling it, we have to make arrangements for the next crop with the income, said Jaswinder Singh, a farmer from Mukerian, adding that whatever price was available at the time of harvest, farmers have to do with that only as there is no minimum support price (MSP) for it like paddy crop.Farmers cannot hold the crop for long as they do not have the space to hold it and they have to sell it then and there only, said another farmer Ramanjit Singh, adding that traders and commission agents have huge space and godowns where they can hold the crop and wait for a good rate.Another farmer, HS Shergil, said the government should fix MSP for basamti so that farmers can also benefit. He added that only the big farmers can hold the crop for few months, not the small and medium ones.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5922d9487be9e01fc7f5aa70,Why crop burning may continue this year too,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/why-crop-burning-may-continue-this-year-too/articleshow/58307362.cms,2017-04-22,"KARNAL: A few patches of black disturb the golden spread of ripe wheat ready for harvesting in Haryana's Karnal district. These are tracts that were set on fire recently after the standing crop was reaped to ready the field for paddy planting in the monsoon. Many more fields will be set afire in a week or so when harvesting work ends in Punjab and Haryana. This year , however, such fires will be covert actions. Already farmers are claiming the field fires of recent weeks were accidental. Satellite surveillance by the Punjab government and stringent monitoring by Haryana government to prevent stubble burning have left farmers apprehensive.Stubble burning is being discouraged for its massive pollution impact. For the moment though, despite wheat and paddy stubble burning destroying the soil and causing severe heat stress on farmland, the cultivators cannot change this farming tradition, they say. Subsidies for agri equipment, such as happy seeder or rotavor that can sow seeds without the need to remove the remains of the paddy stubble, haven't reached most farmers. Wheat farmers who can afford it use a reaper that costs around Rs 2 lakh. It only leaves a short stubble close to the ground that is burnt by most or ploughed back into the soil by some. Those who plough the stubble into the soil are not happy because, they claim, this method can damage the paddy seedlings. Plus, ploughing back is often labour and time intensive.Satellite images show fires have just started in Punjab and Haryana, though Karan Avtar Singh, chief secretary of the state, insisted, ""Only 5 to 10 incidents have been reported this season. Many panchayats have assured us of zero stubble burning.""But Rattan Singh Mann, Haryana chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union, admitted, ""We recently courted arrest when we set our fields on fire."" He explained that wheat can be cut low to leave less stubble, but all alternatives to burning the rice stalks was too expensive.Among the options, the stubble doesn't have many takers as fodder either. ""Cattle don't eat stubble because of the frequent fuel spill during cropping,"" explained Ramanjaneyulu GV, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture.At the root of the pollution-causing problem is Punjab and Haryana's wheat-paddy combination. After harvesting paddy in October, burning the residue is the quickest way to prepare the field for wheat sowing in late October or November. ""Rice cultivation should be banned in these regions, but not many agree with me,"" said Mann. Rice plant stubble is not the only problem, paddy requires a lot of water too. ""Farmers here have to dig down 400 feet to get water,"" revealed Mahtab Kadyan, another farmer leader.At Jundla village, Sulakhan Singh Kamboj argued, ""We cannot plant replacement crops such as oilseeds or pulses unless the government procures our produce at good prices. Last year I planted peas that I finally sold at Rs 5 per kilo. That did not even cover the labour cost.""Farmers with the Kheti Virasat Mission in Punjab are, however, gradually moving away from paddy. They claim not to burn the wheat stubble also, but ""either make manure of it or mulch it"", according to Umendra Dutt Recent NASA images show large fires in Madhya Pradesh and parts of east India. According to Ramanjaneyulu, these could be signs of forest fires, stubble burning or slash-and-burn cultivation. ""Wheat stubble burning across the country is on the rise because getting labour to deal with it is tedious and expensive,"" he added."

Amjyot Singh Gill (L) and Amritpal Singh pose with cheerleaders of Tokyo Excellence.Palpreet Singh Brar was to feature in an NBA draft. Instead, the 23-year-old is close to signing a deal that will take him in the opposite direction to Japan. This is not the first time that an Indian will look east for exposure. Amjyot Singh Gill and Amritpal Singh have quietly put in the hard yards in Japans National Basketball Development League. Shahid Judge retraces the steps of the two trailblazers, who might have taken a giant leap for Indian basketball.Bowing and BrellasTwo summers ago with the cherry blossoms in all their May glory, hoopsters Amjyot Singh and Amritpal Singh took their first trip to Japan. They were in Hyogo, training with the Hyogo Impulse ahead of the summer league. Abroad and alone for the first time with only each other for company, doubts steadily crept into their heads  as the first wave of home-sickness hit. How will we adjust? Yahan roti bhi nahi milta, alag khana hai recalls 25-year-old Amjyot. Wasabi was yet to hit the Punjabi palate that had grown up on the slow charred cook of the paneer tikka.But they found support from Rohit Bakshi, an Indian businessman born and brought up in Japan, and co-owner of the Team Hamamatsu, a 33 basketball team that would sign Amjyot a year later. He would take the boys around the area to help get them acquainted with their surroundings.One night, returning from dinner, the trio would get caught in the rain. Theyd find shelter under the shed of a shop, needing to sprint the remaining 100 metres back to their apartment. Japan suddenly didnt seem like a bright idea. That was until an elderly lady, almost half their size, approached them with three over-sized umbrellas.It was around 11 at night, and we didnt even notice the lady pass us by, recalls Amjyot. A few minutes later she handed us the umbrellas and walked away. We tried looking for her the next few days but we never found her, and those umbrellas stayed with us.For the two cagers, it was their first experience of Japanese hospitality. It helped them overcome their fears faster than they thought. A few days later, they walked to a grocery store in Hyogo. Before they could enter, a staff member rushed out to meet the pair. We couldnt understand him, and he kept bowing. So we bowed back because thats how Japanese greet each other, Amjyot recalls. But he was actually telling us to mind our heads when we walk in! Surprises were not in short supply for the tall twosome in Japan.Indians Can Play Basket ballGetting the pair to Japan however, was never an easy prospect. The misconception in Japan was that Indian players cannot even hold a basketball, Bakshi says. According to the rules, a foreign player has to be associated with a recognised FIBA agent before travelling abroad to play professionally. No agent wanted to take on these two Indians. I was quite upset. I was meeting my old college coach for lunch one day, and he asked me what was bothering me. I told him, and he gave me a contact. Turns out, one of his juniors was an agent, Bakshi recalls, vividly.He got in touch quickly, and the deal was finalized. Amjyot and Amritpal were to play for the Impulse for the duration of the 2015 summer league  the contract double their Indian salaries with PSU employers in India. But there too the agent was clear. He told me that this was just a favour and that he had no interest in the boys, Bakshi says.In the first week of matches, they averaged 40 points each in the 20 odd minutes they got on court. Teammates and opponents, were stunned by the level of skill and flair the duo brought into the game. All of a sudden, everyone was taking the Indian pair seriously, agent included. More importantly, the pair managed to capture the imagination of the Tokyo Excellence coach who was scouting from the stands. The summer league ended in August 2015. A month later, the pair signed up for the Itabashi-based outfit.GulliversHome & AwayOvernight, new posters were put up, decorating the streets and bylanes of Itabashi City, in the Tokyo Metropolis of Japan. From the local barbers shop, to any grocery store, the posters would be there, bearing photographs of the Tokyo Excellence team, and the schedule for the National Basketball Development League (NBDL) final the squad was to play in. Amjyot Singh Gill and Amritpal Singh remember seeing themselves on those posters for the first time at their usual grocery store.The pair walked in, ducking to pass through the door frame that was too short for Amjyots six-foot-nine and Amritpals seven-foot figures. They saw a poster neatly pinned up on the board that would normally exhibit the price list. It was their first glimpse of the fame the sport could bring to them.With Indian businessman and co-owner of Team Hamamatsu. They are on the posters of Tokyo Excellence. With Indian businessman and co-owner of Team Hamamatsu. They are on the posters of Tokyo Excellence.By now they were used to eyes following them wherever they went. Theyd experienced it in India as well. It wasnt too dissimilar in Japan, as they towered over the locals. Its a given, that if you are tall and in Japan, you probably are a basketballer, Amritpal says. In India, we get stopped all the time for photographs, but because people think were freaks of nature to be so tall. In Japan, they know we are professional athletes and people are respectful, adds the 26-year-old.When it was time to pay their bill, the store manager approached them. We had picked up just a few things, like some pancake mix. But the manager refused to let us pay. He didnt speak English, but he kept saying win, win, recalls Amritpal.Its into this very culture that another Punjab lad, six-foot-nine Palpreet Singh Brar may soon be venturing into. The 23-year-old was drafted into the NBA D-League, by the Long Island Nets, but could not secure a spot for himself in the starting roster. The team had a few players from the senior side (Brooklyn Nets) and wanted to take a few players they had waitlisted from the last two years. So they told me they will pick me next year, Palpreet says. So he followed Amjyot and Amritpal to Japan.Cook and Not-so-CleanLiving abroad meant that the pair would have to fit in the household chores into their daily schedule. And they started quite well, looking after the two-bedroom apartment the team had allotted to them. Simple cheez tha, main khana banata tha, Amjyot bartan saaf karta tha, Amritpal says. They also managed to find a store that stocked Indian ingredients  complete with garam masala.At the beginning, theyd work together to keep their apartment tidy. But it wasnt long till they slacked off. Theyd start cleaning up the place when they knew I was coming over. Paaji aa rahe hai, chalo safai kar lete hai, Bakshi recalls laughing. Eventually, they didnt bother cleaning whether I was coming or not. Until I told them that you guys are disgusting.Then there was the problem of getting them ready on time. On occasions, the Tokyo Excellence team would provide a bus service to the players. True to the stereotype of Punjabi punctuality, Bakshi had warned the team officials to give the boys an earlier timing to make sure the team doesnt get delayed. A lady was in charge since she could speak English. So I told her to tell the boys 10:30 if it was actually 11. And theyd still get late, Bakshi laughs. Eventually they improved, but it was more out of respect for the lady than for them wanting to be on time.Fans Favourite AmjyotLife in Japan also required them to travel on their own, particularly in the metro, during rush hour. It was a sight to see. Both of them had to bow down to get inside the train. Amjyot was still alright, but Amritpal had to bend the entire time because his head would touch the top if he was standing, Bakshi says  the roof roughly at 72 same height as Amritpal.(Clockwise from top) Amjyot, six-foot nine, and Amritpal, seven foot, tower over locals at a metro station in Tokyo. (Clockwise from top) Amjyot, six-foot nine, and Amritpal, seven foot, tower over locals at a metro station in Tokyo.A translation application they had downloaded on their mobile phones was their key method of communication. Eventually they didnt need much of that to get around. The rage they had created on court started making waves around Itabashi. People around the neighbourhood recognised the pair as the two tallest players in their local team. Even if the language proved to be a barrier, a simple smile from the duo had the Japanese locals bowing down in greeting. Amjyot anyway has a very charming personality. Hes always smiling and talking. Amritpal is the quieter one, but still very polite. And together these two giants were easy to get noticed, Bakshi says.Outside, they would not remain unknowns for too long. But on court, they became an instant hit with fans. The cheerleaders only wanted to pose with those two, Bakshi laughs. On some match days, fans queue up for autographs. Amjyots was always the longest queue, and he ended up getting the team bus delayed because of it.Mini Punjab in TokyoBakshi initially was sir, but soon became paaji. The 35-year-old grew fond of the pair and found himself spending more time with them, sometimes even staying overnight at their apartment. He took them around  sometimes for dinner or even a movie. On Baisakhi, he took them to a Gurudwara in Tokyo.Amjyot, had been a budding fast bowler in Chandigarh before a back injury took him out of the game. Once he recovered, his father, who played the game as a form of physical fitness in the police force, nudged him towards the big ball. Meanwhile, Amritpal was first introduced to the game as an 18-year-old at the Ludhiana Basketball Academy where he first met Amjyot. Before that, the Fattuwal village resident used to play circle kabaddi and spent most of his time helping his parents in the family farms, tending to the wheat and rice crops. Even today, he enjoys working on the farm when hes at home.As soon as I get home, my parents give me a broom and some tools and tell me to get to work. It doesnt matter that Im a professional athlete, Amritpal laughs. In Tokyo, steadily, Bakshi became their elder brother, as they would confide in him and seek advice on a range of topics, be it family matters, their love lives, boarding, and even basketball. In turn, he found that he steadily started speaking in the North-Indian dialect.Earlier, I could only understand it a bit and spoke more in Hindi. But because of them, I started talking in Punjabi. Through them, he learnt and often finds himself humming tunes of the latest Punjabi and Bollywood tracks. They were heavily into Diljit Dosanj, Badshah and Honey Singh. It grew on me too.India First AlwaysThen there was Amjyots fiery ambition on court. Considered among the most naturally talented players India has produced, it wasnt uncommon to see the Chandigarh-lad shouting instructions to his teammates. Only, the language was a problem, and Amritpal was the only one who could understand. The pair would more often than not pull the team through to a win, but sometimes, they would fall short. Ive seen Amjyot crying on the sidelines whenever that happened, Bakshi says.At the end of the season, Amjyot would prove to be second best shot blocker in the league, and Amritpal would have the third highest field goal percentage  stats that helped the pair pull the team to another title. Their talent got them the opportunity to play in Japan. Still, they would not neglect their responsibilities to the national team where they were the tallest players on the Indian team  and not reluctant to play back then like Satnam.On one occasion, Amjyot and Amritpal reached Bangalore from Japan early morning, while the team was expected to fly out to Hong Kong later in the evening. Tired and jet-lagged, the duo reached the court half an hour after landing for the last practice session before the tournament. They were tired, but they came, dressed in their kit for that session, says current India captain Vishesh Bhriguvanshi. I told them that since theyre here, that wed walk on court and go over a few drills. It was the only chance for us to train together, but they ended up doing a full session.How the East was WonThe first time the pair got on court at Tokyo Excellence, they were asked to play in unfamiliar positions. Both were used to passing and shooting outside the area, charging in occasionally. But the coach wanted Amjyot to drive in every time, and Amritpal to play as a centre  win rebounds and tap home two pointers from under the basket. Then the coach decided to let them play their natural game, and they started using their old skills and the new ones they developed. It scared the Japanese players, Bakshi says.They had become an integral part of the team, and the management knew it. So much so that when Amjyot injured his back before the semi-finals, team officials stepped in to provide him with as much medical assistance as possible. There was no way he would recover for the semis. But the team brought in lots of physios who worked hard on him. He was declared fine to play just a day before, Bakshi adds. Amjyot followed up the successful 2015-16 campaign by helping Team Hamamatsu reach the final of the FIBA 33 World Tour Finals in Doha, Qatar last November.The pair are looking for greener pastures now. They recently attended the two-day National Basketball League (NBL) Draft Combine in Australia, and are rumored to have impressed scouts. But theyve paved the way for Palpreet to take over in the far East. He wasnt getting a chance in the US, but in Japan hell get playing time and exposure, Amritpal says. They have left a legacy behind in Japan, along with the umbrella.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
5922cb627be9e01fc7f59d07,"Delhi's air quality may improve as UP, Haryana, Punjab take steps to discourage stubble burning",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-air-quality-may-improve-as-up-haryana-punjab-take-steps-to-discourage-stubble-burning/articleshow/58454180.cms,2017-05-01,"NEW DELHI: Northern states are working on concrete steps to prevent large-scale crop burning that shrouds Delhi in a pall of black smoke and raises air pollution to a level that creates a health emergency and prompts people to wear surgical masks.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  which have the countrys most fertile fields have initiated steps to discourage the low-cost but polluting farm practice and discussed the matter in a recent meeting between farm ministers of states and the Centre where strategies for the summer-sown kharif crop were discussed.The situation was so bad late last year that the Capital was referred to as a gas chamber by health experts, forcing authorities to declare holidays for schools and ask people to stay indoors. For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice.The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems.Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste.Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjabs agriculture department.We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops. Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules.The states pollution control board will take action against farmers who dont follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters  which harvest both wheat and rice  till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw, he added.In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May, said AK Bihnoi, director at the states agriculture department.With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies.Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryanas agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesnt see any need for a central subsidy for such steps.The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said."
593ad9d37be9e01228650162,"Green tribunal wants report on crop burning from Punjab, Haryana &amp; Uttar Pradesh",http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/green-tribunal-wants-report-on-crop-burning-from-punjab-haryana-uttar-pradesh/story-yjDeHViCnBIjKxUuVwdBEK.html,2017-05-03,"The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday asked Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to file status reports on actions taken by the respective state governments to stop crop burning.Agricultural fires in the fields of neighbouring states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, are a major contributor to the deteriorating air quality of Delhi.A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar on Wednesday came down heavily on the three states after fresh incidents of summer-crop burning were brought to its notice on Wednesday.Let them file an affidavit saying how many machines have been purchased with complete details, the farmers who received the machines either freely or against a nominal charge, where was the crop residue being treated and the quantity of biomass produced, the bench directed.The counsel of Punjab claimed that the state has distributed at least 600 machines for sowing wheat without any burning of rice residue and at least R 86 crore have been spent on the machines.The bench, however, lashed out at him saying, It is a plain and simple lie. Everybody is a foul person. Show us the investment proof. Bring in the farmers who received the machines.The NGTs order came on a plea by environmentalist Vikrant Tongad who had sought a ban on burning of agricultural waste and remnants in open fields.The pollution caused by these fires travel to Delhi because of the westerly winds, causing major health concerns among people, say environment experts.Apart from the lungs, the smoke also affects the brain, eyes and the nervous system, say doctors.A study by IIT Kanpur has listed stubble burning as the third highest contributor to Delhis winter air-pollution, after construction dust and vehicular fumes.The green court had earlier fixed the environment compensation amounts per incident of crop burning to be paid by small land owners having less than two acres of land at R 2,500, medium land owners holding over two acres and less than five acres at R 5,000 and those owning over five acres at R 15,000.It had also directed the state governments to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters of crop residue burning and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers.It had said that the five states -- Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi -- which have issued notifications prohibiting agriculture crop residue burning should ensure that these are enforced rigorously and proper action is taken against the defaulters.The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA) in April had also expressed concern over the crop burning gaining pace in the northern region. The EPCA, which has been spearheading crucial anti-pollution measures, warned the state governments of the northern states to stop being in denial and get their act together.According to satellite data, as pointed out by EPCA, the agricultural landscape of Punjab and Haryana is dotted with fires billowing out pollutant-laden smoke as farmers have set fire to the residues of the Rabi crop to usher in the Kharif season."

Picture by Sanjay Choudhary Two relatives of the national president of the JDU youth wing were among six people arrested on Sunday in connection with the seizure of 120 cartons or around 1,036 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) in Rohtas district. The arrest of the JDU leader's kin is likely to come as a major embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar-led government, which has made war against liquor the cornerstone of its politics. Confirming the arrests and seizure, Rohtas superintendent of police (SP) Manavjit Singh Dhillon said: ""Investigations are going on in the case. We won't be able to provide much details about the case."" However, sources in the police said the people arrested from Kargahar, around 160km southwest of Patna, included Ramchandra Rai and Sadanand Singh, the father-in-law and the brother-in-law of Sanjay Kumar, the national president of Yuva (youth wing) JDU. ""We came to know about their connection only when they started dropping Sanjay's name. We found the relations to be correct. All the arrested are being interrogated and would be produced before a magistrate later on,"" a senior police officer told The Telegraph. The Telegraph could not contact Sanjay despite several attempts. However, JDU spokesperson and Legislative Council member Neeraj Kumar said: ""Sanjay is not involved in the case because he lives in New Delhi. How would he know what his in-laws are doing in Bihar? People can see that the rule of law in the state does not even exempt relatives of top leaders. If they commit wrong, the law will take its own course as in this case."" Manoj Gupta, Shashi Kumar, Chandan Kumar and Rasbihari Yadav were the others arrested in the case. They all belong to different parts of Rohtas district. The police officer said investigations were on to ascertain whether or not Sanjay colluded with those arrested in their operations. All the bottles belong to Royal Style brand and their labels show that they were manufactured and bottled in Chandigarh. Sasaram sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Alok Ranjan said: ""The seized liquor bottles were hidden in a distributary of Sone river at Karpura village under Kargahar police station area in the district. The distributary (water distributing channel) was dry."" ""The arrests and seizures were done on the basis of our increased surveillance across the district in light of prohibition. We were probing a case related to the seizure of around 900 litres of IMFL from a container truck here by the economic offences unit on January 30 this year, when the involvement of the people arrested today (Sunday) came to light. We were conducting technical surveillance and the mobile numbers of Ramchandra and Sadanand cropped up. They procured IMFL illegally from other states and distributed in Rohtas,"" Alok added. Sunday's seizure was also made on the basis of mobile surveillance of the accused, sources in the police said. Sadanand supplies broken/residual grains of milled rice to distilleries in Punjab and Haryana. The police believe he started dealing in illegal liquor in Bihar by using his connections in those states. Rohtas has seen around six major seizures since total prohibition was implemented in Bihar on April 5, 2016. Its location along Bihar's border with Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand helps bootleggers and liquor mafia, who have opened several channels to smuggle in liquor."

59355c3e7be9e061b1737066,Mumbai foodies get ready to celebrate Indian food days,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-foodies-get-ready-to-celebrate-indian-food-days/articleshow/58750422.cms,2017-05-20,"Food has always been an inherent part of India's cultural fabric. With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"

In addition, it has given special facilities to these places.Similary, the Karnataka government is providing special incentives to farmers who grow tur. A policy needs to be framed to encourage this, he added.To provide free tur of 1 kg to each BPL family through the public distribution system, a sum of Rs 1,100 crore is required. This needs to be discussed in the Cabinet meeting, he added. Jayachandra said even villagers are suffering from diabetes and anaemia. People need protein-rich food. Tur can help as a good supplement, he said.The state has witnessed bumper production of tur this year. About 31 lakh quintals of tur has been procured through 191 centres, he said.He said it is better to ban polished rice as it is not good for health. Even under the Anna Bhagya scheme, polished rice is being given. Unpolished rice has good protein content, he added."
593adcca7be9e07e719f29ae,Punjab goes 'Amma' way to feed the hungry,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/613936/punjab-goes-amma-way-feed.html,2017-05-27,"Gautam Dheer, Chandigarh, May 28 2017, 10:28 ISTPopulist measures initiated by governments in the name of food often win hands down. They are an instant hit with masses, especially with the large chunk of poor and deprived who struggle for food.Be it atta-daal schemes run by the state governments or the famous Amma Unavagam (Amma canteens) serving highly subsidised food to about 2.50 lakh people across 300 outlets in Tamil Nadu, politicians in Punjab have realised the benefits of serving good food, not just on health, but on popularity as well.The Capt Amarinder Singh government in Punjab has now got the right recipe with all the perfect ingredients, perhaps, a cue from the popular Amma canteens.The chief minister has chosen the business of food to ride on popularity, but with a philanthropic twist. Several centres under different names like Sasti roti and Sanjhi rasoi have started serving food to the underprivileged through community kitchen.A meal costs just Rs 5 at some centres. And there isnt any compromise on the hygiene or quantity. Sample this: for Rs 5, a poor is served six chapatis, lintel, seasonal vegetables and rice. Thats quite a mouthful for Rs 5 a meal, and clearly a tough competition for Amma canteens where sambar rice is served at Rs 5, besides other options on the menu.Punjabs experiment with the politics of food so far is not entirely submerged in political flavour, unlike in Tamil Nadu where the food canteens branding the name Amma was in unequivocal reference to chief minister the late J Jayalalithaa who introduced the concept for the economically disadvantaged majority in that state.In Punjab, the experiment to offer subsidised food to the poor and the working class began this month in the districts of Bathinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Muktsar and SBS Nagar.At some places it is run entirely by the government under the aegis of the district red cross societies, while the scheme is operated in collaboration with NGOs at other centres. In Bathinda, the facility has been entirely outsourced by the government.The magnitude of the exercise in this border state may not be as elaborate and widespread as in Tamil Nadu or even in Odisha where such arrangements have been named Aahar (food) centres, but officials say the initiative has only begun.The plan is afloat to take the food scheme to a new high where the concept will not be limited to merely serving food to the deprived. Jalandhars Sanjhi Rasoi intends to offer porridge and khichdi as well. The idea is aimed at providing nutritious food to all, especially women and mothers, who may suffer from various deficiencies for want of adequate healthy food.Senior officials in the district administration say nutritious food will add value to the initiative and make it more fulfilling and rewarding to say the least. Chapati-making machines have been set up at one centre in Punjab where the rush is growing by the day.Thousands belonging to the underprivileged section queue up every day to eat subsidised food. In some centres serving community food, a meal costs Rs 10. The authorities make sure the menu doesnt remain staple all the time. Aloo puri and Halwa (dessert) are also on the menu once a week. Subsidised food for the poor was a poll promise of the Amarinder Singh government and one of the early promises to have started taking shape.But the initiative has its limitations. Initially food packets ere prepared in bulk and intended to be distributed at a low cost. But the authorities soon realised its pitfall. A large number of employees walked away with the food meant for the deprived. The practice was discontinued. Food was only made available at the counter and served in plate.A food contractor spends about Rs 15 per meal. The price being charged from people at some places is only Rs 5 and the rest of the deficit money has to be borne by the Red Cross Society. Funds available with societies are limited which is why the government may have to consider a viable option that could sustain the initiative.The government has already promised the moon for the people of Punjab, something that may be a drain on the exchequer. The meal option for the poor is so far limited only once a day for lunch. Round-the-clock kitchens have been entirely ruled out. But the authorities say, they are contemplating extending the facility for dinners as well.Public participation has started to pour in. The authorities are hoping the scheme will catch the attention of non-resident Indians or corporates that will help sustain the initiative. Officials say traders and good Samaritans are offering help. There have been days when the poor dont have to pay a penny and get a scrumptious meal for free.Officials say good Samaritans often buy coupons on some days for Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 and distribute these for free to the people queuing up to have a meal.Community kitchen in Punjab is a way of life as enshrined in the Sikh religious ethos.

According to sources, department's different teams comprising of 200 officials under instructions of Principal Director (Punjab and J&K) Parneet Sachdev struck at 20 premises including offices, rice shellers, houses, godowns belonging to these three companies.Sources have also revealed that the teams which were being led by Additional Director Ritesh Parmar have so far been able to unearth Rs 2 crore worth cash and jewellery while a large number of documents related to properties,cash transactions and bogus billing have been seized by the department which point towards suspicion of black money to the tunes of Rs 50 crores. TOI has also learnt that these rice sheller owners have amassed huge amounts of black money and along with evading tax they had invested this in real estate projects. Department's action which started yesterday continued today as well and it is being anticipated that the search will continue on Friday as well and exact amount of tax evasion will be ascertained once the investigation of department is over."

The BJP-led regime has now completed three years in office  on May 25 this year  which is also a fair enough time to critically examine the track record of this government. I let the facts speak for themselves in light of a series of unkept promises.Upholding farmers welfareIn one of his Chai Pe Charcha programmes on March 20, 2014, Narendra Modi, then Gujarat Chief Minister, termed farmer suicides as a national agony and added that the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) shall stand behind all farmers hit by natural calamities like the recent hailstorms, or economic crises. I shall not be able to sleep peacefully till I do something for you. He wanted a system where with the infusion of modern technology, water resources and efforts to double agriculture output, farmers were not driven to end their lives. Thus his attention was focussed on ensuring farmer welfare.According to a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, titled Accidental deaths and suicides in India, 2015, the number of farmers who committed suicide was 8,007. The corresponding number in 2014 was 5,650. Thus there has been a 42% increase in loss of lives between 2014 and 2015. After blaming the UPA and its policies for farmer suicides, in the run-up to the 2014 general election and much after, this government now attributes suicides to reasons which it says have nothing to do with its policies.For instance, in reply to a question in Parliament on July 24, 2015, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh even cited among several other reasons, love affairs and impotency as key factors. To make matters worse, Haryanas Agriculture Minister, O.P. Dhankar, in a statement on April 29, 2015, termed farmers who commit suicide as cowards.Now back to Mr. Modi. Addressing a rally in Pathankot in Punjab, on April 25, 2014, as the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, he said: If the NDA comes to power, it will ensure remunerative prices to the farmers by adding 50% profit into the peasants input cost. In addition he said: We will fix the Minimum Support Price of crops incorporating 50% profit in farmers cost of production including seed, irrigation, manure, labour. And he ended by saying that no one will be allowed to loot farmers.Fast forward to February 2015. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Modi government did a U-turn, stating that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) cannot be fixed on the basis of cost+50 percent as that would distort the market. Between 2009 and 10, the MSP for paddy was Rs. 950 a quintal as against a production cost of Rs. 670 a quintal  translating to a 42% margin of profit for farmers.In 2015-16, the MSP for paddy was Rs. 1,410 a quintal against an estimated production cost of Rs. 1,324 a quintal, which is only a 6.5% margin of profit to farmers. It is clear that the procurement prices of wheat, paddy and other agricultural produce have been much less than the price received by farmers during the UPAs tenure.Between 2014 and 2016, the Modi government hiked the MSP of rice only by 3.9% per year. In comparison, during 2011 and 2013, the UPA increased the MSP of rice by 9.5% per year. For wheat, the figure is 4.1% per year under the Modi government as against 7% per year under the UPA.Bringing back black moneyAnother major issue for the BJP government has been the subject of black money. In his Chai Pe Charcha campaign, launched in Ahmedabad on February 12, 2014, Mr. Modi had said: The whole country is worried about black money... We will bring back each and every penny deposited abroad by Indian citizens. I am committed to this because this money belongs to the poor people of India and no one has the right to do this kind of anti-national activity.The facts. In the last three years, the Modi government has received the names of those with illegal bank accounts in foreign havens. Yet, they remain a closely guarded secret.On October 17, 2014, nearly five months after assuming office, the Modi government told the Supreme Court that it could not reveal the names of Indians with accounts in foreign banks due to double taxation avoidance treaties with other countries  a position taken by the UPA. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley dismissed the governments reluctance in revealing the names by saying: Is the present NDA government led by Modi in any way reluctant to make some names public? Certainly not. We have no difficulty in making names public. But they can be made public only in accordance with due process of law.The Modi government now states that any account opened after 2017 will be made public, pursuant to an agreement between India and foreign powers under the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) or the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Informations, an information standard for the automatic exchange of information (AEoI).The resulting question is this. Why not the names of account holders before 2017? This was a demand made on the floor of the House by the BJP and the rest of the Opposition who attacked the UPA for not revealing the names of account holders.Job creationLet me focus on another Modi promise  of creating one crore jobs. Addressing an election rally in Agra, on November 22, 2013, Mr. Modi had said, If the BJP comes to power, it will provide one crore jobs which the UPA government could not do despite announcing it before the last Lok Sabha polls. Incidentally, the point about farmer interests becoming paramount under BJP rule was also made at this rally.The facts. In the three years 2009 to 2011, when Indias GDP was still growing at an average 8.5%, the organised sector was producing on average 9.5 lakh new jobs every year. In the last two years, 2015 and 2016, average employment generation has plummeted to less than 2 lakh jobs a year. This is less than 25% of the annual employment generated before 2011. In 2015, employment generated in eight labour intensive sectors collapsed to an all-time low of 1.5 lakh jobs.By adding service sectors to the organised sector employment data, the figures show a slight improvement in the growth of new jobs in 2016. New jobs generated increased from 1.55 lakh in 2015 to 2.31 lakh in 2016. But this is still only 25% of the organised sector jobs generated in 2009.Data on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act show that unemployment continues unabated, and in fact seems to be worsening. In Mr. Modis first year as Prime Minister, 4.65 crore households demanded work in the scheme. In 2015-16, this number had increased by 15% to reach 5.3 crore. In 2016-17, it further increased by 6% to reach a staggering 5.69 crore households in search of work.Another promise  on the safety of women. In a public rally in Pune, on November 1, 2013, Mr. Modi, while accusing the Congress of failing to ensure safety for women in the capital, said: In spite of Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi being women, Delhi is known as the rape capital. People dont know who to trust anymore.Womens safetyInterestingly, at the BJPs National Executive in New Delhi, in January 2014, Mr. Modi, while speaking about empowering women and ensuring that they went from being homemakers to nation builders, said: What is happening with our mothers and sisters in the country leaves us shame-faced. Dignity of women should be a commitment.The facts. According to an NCRB report, though there was a slight reduction by 3.1% in crime against women in 2015 as compared to 2014, there was an increase of 2.5% in instances of sexual offences against women. There was also an increase in instances of kidnapping and abduction of women in 2015. Delhi recorded the highest overall rate of crime against women. Data from Delhi, the epicentre of the Nirbhaya rape protest movement, shows that, contrary to expectations, under a new government and with a new law  in 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013 or the Anti-Rape Bill, later called the Nirbhaya Act, came into existence  the number of rapes has gone up in the capital of India. As in Delhi, national data on rape too showed a substantial increase in 2015, when compared with 2012 data. In 2012, there were 24,923 cases while in 2015, there were 36,651 cases.Curbing inflationAnother Modi statement made in early 2014: The Congress had promised to curb inflation in 100 days, but did they live up to their promises? Dont trust those who betray public trust. If the governments of Vajpayeeji and Morarji Desai could stop price rise, why cant we? The BJP government in 2014 will do it, I assure you.The facts. Food inflation has not shown any trends of reversing. Instead, prices of essential commodities are on the rise, with pulses especially selling at Rs. 100-Rs. 150 a kg. Petrol and diesel prices continue to be raised with shocking regularity. Industrial production is down, the rupee is down and somehow people have stopped believing in GDP figures that this government relies upon.On corruptionFinally, I focus on yet another Modi promise  of delivering a corruption-free India. At a rally in Sujanpur, Himachal Pradesh, on February 16, 2014, Mr. Modi had said:  Mere liye na koi aagey, na peechhey. Kiske liye bhrashtachaar karunga (I have no family ties. I am single. Who will I be corrupt for)?He added, This mind and body is totally devoted to the nation. Then again on February 23, 2014, he tweeted: When we come to power, we will serve as Chowkidars who will never allow any Hand to loot coffers of our nation. Again on April 13, 2014, he tweeted: [The] NDA is firm on its commitment to create a corruption-free India so that best opportunities are created for our youth.The facts. There has been an increase  by 67%  in complaints received of corruption in various government departments. According to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), the Railways tops the list with over 11,000 complaints.The probity watchdog received a total of 49,847 complaints in 2016, as against 29,838 in 2015  an increase of about 67%, according to the CVCs annual report tabled recently in Parliament.Kapil Sibal is a former Union Minister and senior Congress leader"

Sukhwant Kaur, 55, arrived to an emotional reunion with her husband, Kulwant Singh, and daughter, Ranjeet Kaur, at the Amritsar airport on Wednesday, five months after she left for Saudi Arabia on a tourist visa only to be sold as a slave by a dubious travel agent.Hindustan Times was the first to highlight Sukhwants plight. Her husband, Kulwant, appealed to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for help on Twitter.Sukhwant arrived at Mumbai from Sharjah at 4.15am before she took a flight to Amritsar. We are happy now that she is finally back, said Kulwant. She had gone for three months. For two months, things appeared normal. After that we learnt that the agent had sold her as a slave. Her captors were demanding money for her release. The agent also went missing. We appeal to the Punjab government to act against such fraudulent travel agents, he said.Sukhwants daughter said, We had lost all hope of seeing her again in this life so you can imagine how grateful we are. I was not able to see my mother before she left for Saudi Arabia but now Im glad I could welcome her back.She was received by former Jalandhar Central BJP MLA Manoranjan Kalia, former local bodies minister Anil Joshi and Amritsar mayor Bakshi Ram Arora. Later, the family left for its native Ajtani village in Nurmahal near Jalandhar.A relieved but tired Sukhwant said: I was only given some rice and meat and rice to eat. I felt like I was living in hell.After reaching Hail city in Saudi Arabia, I was sold as a slave to a family of five members, including three women, who were teachers, said Sukhwant, adding that she was made to do all household works and was beaten up almost every day. The women members of the family also used to lock me up in a room, said Sukhwant.I was admitted to a hospital a month ago after I contracted infection. There, I met a nurse from Kerala with whose help I contacted my husband on May 7. Some 10 days back, a man from the embassy came to visit me in the hospital and assured that I will soon be sent to India, said Sukhwant.She said a debt of Rs 2 lakh forced her to go abroad for work. With no financial support from children, Kulwant and Sukhwant have to fend for themselves. Kulwant works as a daily wage labourer and earns Rs 250 a day.Capt thanks Swaraj for Sukhwants returnPunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh thanked external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for facilitating Sukhwants safe return from Saudi Arabia. He also promised a time-bound action plan by his government to prevent unscrupulous travel agents from duping innocent people. The CM also urged the external affairs minister to use all political and diplomatic channels to put an end to illegal practice of travel agents, who fraudulently send innocent people abroad, where they are victimised."
5a0527859855b76bf13bfe86,From plate to plough: Farm and the tax,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-farm-and-the-tax-gst-4689101/,2017-06-05,"Thinkstock image Thinkstock imageAfter more than a decade of intense discussion and debate, the GST is finally becoming a reality. Although in its current form, it is not as perfect as was originally envisaged, yet it is being lauded as one of the most transformational reforms since 1991. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was humble and right in saying that the credit for this goes not just to this government but also to previous ones that conceived and steered it from time to time.Here we assess the likely impact of the new GST regime on agriculture and farmers. One can look at it from three angles: One, is the GST going to be inflation neutral, given that food has 45 per cent weight in consumer price index (CPI)? Two, is the GST going to be revenue neutral, and especially, which states could lose revenue and how will they be compensated? Three, does it give some incentives to link farmers with the food processing industry, which may help them reduce market risk, augment incomes and create new jobs in rural areas?Let us look at major inputs first. Fertilisers, which currently attract VAT varying from 0 to 8 per cent in several states, will now attract 12 per cent tax under the GST. That means the price of fertilisers is likely to go up by 5-7 per cent, unless the government decides to absorb this by increasing the subsidy. Pesticides are put in a slab of 18 per cent, up from the 12 per cent excise today and a VAT of 4-5 per cent in some states. Tractor rates are tricky: Several components and accessories are put in a slab of 28 per cent, while tractors are under the 12 per cent slab, up from zero excise and a VAT of 4-5 per cent. It is not very clear yet whether the input credit claims to cover taxes already paid on components and accessories will exceed the final tax rate of 12 per cent on tractors, and therefore, there could be a scope for reduction in tractor prices; or the taxes on components may be rationalised and brought down from the 28 to 12 per cent slab. There is quite a bit of confusion here.Overall, it seems from the inputs side that the cost of cultivation for farmers may increase marginally, which in turn may put a mild pressure on agri-prices. But the story is not complete unless we see the taxation structure on agri-output prices.Most raw agri-commodities ranging from rice, wheat, milk, fresh fruits and vegetables, are in the zero tax slab, rightly so, as they are consumed by the masses. However, it may be interesting to note that a state like Punjab which contributes maximum grains to the central pool, imposes taxes and various cesses to the extent of 12 per cent on wheat and rice. On top of that, there is the arhatiya commission of 2.5 per cent making the transaction cost of these staples in Punjab mandis as high as 14.5 per cent. In a country still ridden with poverty, imposing such high taxation on wheat and rice was nothing short of rent-seeking from the Centre and distorting the markets. Now, with the new GST regime, even if a commission of 2.5 per cent stays, one hopes that all other taxes and cesses will go away. As a result, the purchase cost of wheat and paddy (rice) from Punjab mandis will go down by 12 per cent. This would be a major gain with several ripple effects. One, that the price of these basic staples in the open market should come down by say 5-7 per cent, as most grain surplus states impose at least that much tax. This was a major distortion in the mandis, driving the private sector from Punjab. Now, with zero taxes, the private sector may come back to buying wheat and rice from these surplus states, giving a fillip to grain milling.At an all-India level, Food Corporation of India (FCI) may save anywhere from Rs 6,000-8,000 crore, which could show up in a lesser food subsidy bill. But surplus states like Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh may lose this tax revenue, which they are getting from the FCI or GoI under the current system. How they will be compensated is not yet clear even to the FCI, although there is a provision for compensating losing states for five years by the Centre. The rationalisation of mandi taxes and associated cess and levies will be the biggest gain from the GST as far as agriculture is concerned.However, the taxation structure for processed food is not very encouraging. For example, fruit and vegetable juices will be taxed at 12 per cent, up from the current 5 per cent; fruit jams, jellies, marmalades, fruit and vegetable purees, etc. are taxed even higher at 18 per cent, up from 5 per cent. This is surprising as it will discourage the development of the food processing industry, especially for perishable fruits and vegetables. Even the humble aloo tikki will attract 18 per cent tax, if it is in frozen form! This is contrary to the wishes of even the prime minister who wanted fruit juices to be put in aerated drinks to ensure a good market for farmers.It may be worth reconsidering these rates and bringing them down to the 5 per cent slab for stronger linkages between farmers and the food processing industry and creating jobs in rural areas. Since the raw material could be sourced directly from farmers instead of being entirely depending on middlemen in mandis, e-NAM provides this opportunity to graduate to a real pan-India market for agricultural products. A smooth GST regime can break inter-state barriers on movement and facilitate direct linkages between processors and farmers. This can transform the operations of mandis too if other necessary reforms to free up agricultural markets are undertaken. If this happens, farmers would also welcome the GST the way organised industry seems to be.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

On Sunday, all news channels bombarded us with Virats Surgical Strike (News India) as India beat Pakistan at cricket  all, that is, barring Zee, which said it would boycott Pakistani cricket and added, rather obscurely, that its news channels would support only actual heroes. Whereupon it set off in pursuit of Pakistan, across the border instead of on the cricket field. And, even as Star Sports promoted the Champions Trophy match with its Sabse Bada Moh advert, Zee hit back with Sabse Bada Droh  you know woh they mean.Meanwhile, Times Now went after crime in UP where Goonda Raj thrives and India Today had Operation Romeo: (Is) CM Yogis pet project going rogue?  this, when Adityanath has been the most celebrated chief minister on air. Not to be left behind, Republic went rogue, pardon the expression, on the Sriram Sene and the Bajrang Dal, asking hard questions of the Fringe, and India Today discussed what it called BJPs meat hypocrisy as it plays out in the north-eastern states.Then, on Wednesday, after farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh led to the death of five farmers, possibly in police firing, the same channels led the onslaught: BJP reels from farmer backlash (Times Now), a jai kisan litmus test for the BJP (India Today), the role of police in firing confirmed (Republic). Farmers protests in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh dominated news headlines throughout the day, but it isnt as if they began yesterday, its just that they have been given short shrift by news channels obsessed with the army, Kashmir and Pakistan, not necessarily in that order. Will the violence and deaths now lead to ultra-big debates on evening prime time? Lets wait and see.Its been a long, long time since so many questions were raised on these channels about the BJPs governance  even in states  or its fringe elements. Which is not to say that the usual agenda and suspects were not relentlessly pursued alongside: On Tuesday, it was the CPMs turn to be called out for questioning General Rawats comments on the army in Kashmir (Times Now, India Today). Speaking of agendas, NDTV made news for all the wrong reasons when anchor Nidhi Razdan and BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra got into an unnecessary, unseemly and unbecoming row over the channels alleged agenda (Left, Right and Centre) with Razdan asking Patra to leave her show.Worse followed when its promoters Prannoy and Radhika Roy were raided by the CBI, prompting Ravish Kumar to dwell darkly on the dangers of dar ki rajdhani for the media (NDTV India). The oddest news of the week came from India News and Zee Business: The former was incensed by videos on social media revealing plastic rice  perhaps from China  that bounced when squeezed into a ball, while the latter discovered videos of fake eggs, also on social media  again allegedly from China. News Nation went to Ujjain where it caught Pyare Mohan chomping green and red chillies  for a Guinness World Record?DD News showed us Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while other news channels carried its live feed to cover the launch of the GSLV MkIII. Told you it was an odd week. Other oddities? Well, what would you say about a TV commercial to promote mutual fund investments which shows that other gentlemans game in progress  golf  when one player advises another to invest in MFs and the latter doesnt seem to know a thing about MFs. Someone who plays golf doesnt know mutual funds? Decidedly odd. No odder than the Vrat Ayurdeva item on haemorrhoids, more indelicately known as piles (EPIC). While the information was extremely useful for those who suffer from this painful and uncomfortable ailment, the graphic which accompanied the discussion with doctors was, er, too graphic and in poor taste, tracking the movement of faeces through the intestines.And while this has nothing to do with anything, the accents of actors playing British characters on shows like EPICs Bandits of British India and Sher-e-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Life OK) sound about as British as Punjabi. Very odd  and unconvincing indeed.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
593c71f57be9e00ed19a34eb,Opinion| Farmer protests:&thinsp;Rewrite the rules to stop this cycle of agrarian dist...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farmer-protests-rewrite-the-rules-to-stop-this-cycle-of-agrarian-distress/story-ahjhxzLpA2CtCSRTOjVUHM.html,2017-06-08,"The farm protests in Madhya Pradesh that left five people dead this week is symbolic of a wider agrarian distress engulfing India. Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5a0439229855b76bf13bcf9d,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."

Found six months ago in the bylanes of Durgapur, a baby girl and boy have been brought up by nurses of Durgapur hospital ever since police handed them over to the hospital.On Friday, the nurses  who've by now developed a strong bond with the two babies  went through the tradition of feeding them their first spoonfulls of rice during an annaprashan ceremony organised by the hospital. At the end of their six-month stay in hospital, the babies will be handed over to Childline on Saturday.Annaprashan is a Sanskrit word which literally means ""grain initiation"", when babies feed of rice. It is variously referred to as mukhebhaat in Bengali, choroonu in Kerala and bhaatkhulai in the Garhwal hills.Durgapur subdivisional hospital superintendent Debabrata Das said, ""Six months ago, police brought a male and a female baby to us with severe malnourishment. We nursed them back to health after admitting them to our neonatal care unit. Now, both babies are fit but no one came forward to claim them. Our nurses, who brought them up, have named the baby boy Krish while the baby girl is called Trisha. We organised annaprashan before we hand them over to Childline on Saturday.""On Friday, nurses dressed Krish in a dhuti and punjabi while Trisha was draped in a sari. Both had the traditional sandalwood spots on their foreheads and garlands. The nurses themselves cooked a meal of rice, dal, fish curry, laddu, payesh for the 50-odd hospital staff invited to attend the ceremony."

Contractual farmers will have to pay GST,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tax-on-agriculture-income-contractual-farmers-will-have-to-pay-gst/articleshow/59119396.cms,2017-06-12,"CHANDIGARH: Even as different sectors are still trying to comprehend the impact of goods and services tax ( GST ) regime, certain clauses of the new system could hit the agriculture sector in Punjab as it will make income from renting of farm land taxable.Member of indirect tax committee of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and an expert on GST Keshav R Garg pointed out that only the person who cultivates the land for personal consumption or sale would be exempt from GST. Any other income like leasing of agricultural land or contract farming would become taxable under GST.""Tax on renting of agricultural land would be a big blow because once it is taxed under GST, it might also come under the income tax net. Farmer leasing out his land would be liable to pay GST at the rate of 18%. He would also need to take registration under new tax regime, and file 37 returns annually,"" he said.Reacting to the move, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Bhupinder Singh Mann said the move would badly hit a sizeable chunk of farmers in the state. ""With landholdings becoming smaller in Punjab, farming is becoming unviable. In such a scenario, farmers are forced to lease out their land while they take up other vocations. It would be unfair to tax them. A farmer who has 2-3 acre of land has no option but lease the land out,"" the ex-MP said.Besides, under the GST, where the farmer sells the pulses and cereals in open, no GST would be charged but where he sells them under a brand name, he shall be charged GST at 5%.This would discourage the cultivator of land to promote his brand name. Where the exempted goods like rice and wheat are supplied as part of the mixed supply, they would attract the highest rate of the commodity in the mixed supply. Government should exempt these commodities irrespective of the mode by which they are sold, he said.Meanwhile Congress leader Gurpartap Singh Mann added that the Centre should not include mindless clauses in the GST system that could further dent the income of the agriculture sector in a state like Punjab which is agricultarally rich. ""Already there have been anti-farmer statements from members of the NITI Aayog that reflect on the mindset of the BJP government,"" he said categorically."
5a05aac39855b76bf13c09c1,Karate kid fights to put poverty on the mat,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170612/jsp/calcutta/story_156378.jsp,2017-06-12,"Mamata Hansda demonstrates a high kick. Picture by Mayukh Sengupta June 11: Mamata Hansda, 18, has won multiple medals in state and national karate championships in the past three years. She can break a thick stack of tiles with one blow of the right hand. Or rain five kicks with her left leg without the foot touching the ground. But ask the diminutive teenager about her biggest achievement and she replies with a shy smile: ""Not being afraid to return home late at night."" Mamata won a bronze (under-21, 45kg) at the recent national karate championships in Delhi, the latest in her medal kitty. Her mother Sumitra is a mason. When she doesn't get work, she sells goat milk to feed her family. Mamata's father died when she was four. The third member of the family from Sukanta Pally village near Durgapur station is Mamata's elder sister, Chinta, who is training to be a nurse. Karate has not been able to lift the Hansdas out of abject poverty but it has given Mamata hope and courage. ""Earlier, I was very scared of returning home after tuitions. The road that leads to my home is dimly lit and it feels like midnight at 7pm. Now, I often train till 10pm and return home without any fear,"" Mamata told Metro. The Class XII student at Durgapur Rai Rani Debi Girls High School had her first brush with karate at a self-defence camp in 2014. About 100 girls had taken part in the camp, which was for most their first and last exposure to karate. But Mamata stuck to the sport. It seemed a natural progression for the girl who was a regular participant at school athletic meets - 100 metres, high jump and long jump. ""The kicks, punches and roar were the gateways to an unknown world. There was an instant liking,"" Mamata recollected. She started training with Sensei Samir Kumar Mondal at the centre in Sagarbhanga where the camp was held, a 20-minute walk from her home. In August 2014, with barely two months' training, Mamata participated in the state championship and won a bronze in the 40kg category. In 2016, Mamata took part in the junior national school games in Punjab's Rupnagar. She did not win a medal but learnt a lot by competing with the top fighters in the country. She put in longer hours of practice and the results followed. The same year, she won bronze in the under-17 category at a national open meet in the city. ""Consider her background when you look at her medals. Then, a bronze would look like a gold,"" Mondal, her coach, told Metro. Mamata's day starts at 4am with two hours of practice, followed by school and tuition and then more practice. Her lunch is puffed rice. Egg or milk is rare, so she makes do with bananas and sattu. For dinner, the family has rice with one side dish. ""She needs much more protein. She is short for her age and lacks strength because of her meagre diet,"" said Mondal. ""But her spirit is indomitable. What she lacks in height and strength, she makes up in speed."" Before the national games in Delhi, Mamata found hope in the form of a sponsor - the Emami Foundation, the CSR arm of the Emami Group. The foundation paid for all her expenses for the meet and has promised to provide all future help. ""We not only want Mamata to realise her dream but to complete her education,"" said Sushil Goenka, group MD and foundation head. For Mamata, winning medals is a matter of pride. So is teaching the local boys some manners. Two youths used to taunt her when she started taking karate lessons. ""They used to shout 'Kha-khu girl' every time they saw me, mocking the roars we make during bouts and practice. After a few months of training, I challenged them to a fight. They had no answer."" Mamata counts her family as her biggest strength. ""My mother toils hard to earn us two meals a day but not once has she asked me to quit karate. She and my sister are my biggest supporters. Whenever I take part in a tournament in Bengal, my mother is in the stands,"" she said. Even the teenager's leisure time revolves around martial arts: her favourite film is the Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan-starrer Karate Kid, which she has watched ""over 20 times""."
5a05f1d99855b76bf13c223d,More to it than MSP,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/more-to-it-than-msp/article18968876.ece,2017-06-13,"Agricultural distress is often viewed as a short-term phenomenon in which farmers look for support from various quarters on account of being unable to get a gainful return due to price crash, poor marketing facilities, rising credit burden, increasing cost of inputs and frequent occurrence of natural calamities. A prolonged unrest in rural India  such as the decision of Andhra Pradesh farmers not to sow in the 2011 kharif season and mark a crop holiday protest  will have serious consequences for food security.Agricultural distress has become a permanent feature due to the failure of not only elected governments to find a lasting solution but also local institutions such as community or social networks which are supposedly weakening because of increasing individualisation. The consequence is that helpless farmers are increasingly pushed to the brink of committing suicides.A tipping pointThe distress seems to have reached a tipping point, with scenes of dejected farmers throwing agricultural produce such as vegetables and milk on the roads becoming a routine feature in recent years. Rather than addressing the genuine problems of farmers, politicians are unfortunately busy scoring points over the deaths of innocent farmers.Are demands of our farmers unjust? Not really. They want a reasonable price for their produce, better marketing facilities, institutional credit, irrigation, quality seeds and fertilisers, procurement during times of market glut and a social safety net during natural calamities. These are the basic inputs and services farmers need to continue to engage in agricultural production. Many committees and commissions constituted in the past have looked into Indias farming conditions. Their recommendations have been shelved by successive governments.The non-availability of remunerative prices to farmers on agricultural produce is a vexed issue and emerges as the prime issue in various research studies wherein farmers are asked to rank production constraints. Will a rise in the minimum support price (MSP) solve the problem? Some critics argue that a rise in the MSP will lead to increase in food inflation, while others that it will augment farmers income. Both arguments rest on the mistaken notion that the MSP is a remunerative price. It is actually an insurance price, a floor price of sorts. Besides, a vast majority of the farming population is unaware of its existence.The Government of India has an MSP for 23 crops, but official procurement at the MSP is effectively limited to rice and wheat, and that too concentrated in a few States only. Awareness about the MSP is limited to States such as Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh where such procurement takes place. According to the National Sample Surveys (NSS) Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households 2013, even for paddy and wheat, less than one-third of farmers were aware of the MSP; for other crops, such awareness was negligible. Further, a substantial proportion of crops are sold to local private traders and input dealers to whom the resource-poor marginal and small landholders are obligated to sell their crops due to tie-up with credit.Since 2004, successive governments claimed to have increased institutional credit flow to the agricultural sector through increased budgetary allocation on crop loans. According to NSS data, over 40% of farmers still rely on non-institutional lenders, who mostly happen to be moneylenders-cum-traders and input dealers. Further, analysis of credit disbursement data from the Reserve Bank of India reveals that out of total advances to agriculture, the share of indirect finance has increased substantially over time, while that of direct finance to farmers has declined. This means that at the macro level, it would appear that there is an increase in credit flow to the agricultural sector but this has actually accrued to agro-business firms/corporations and not directly to the farmers. Consequently, marginal and small farmers continue to rely on traders and input dealers. Unless the fundamental problems of crop and regional bias of MSP policy, government procurement and access to institutional credit are addressed, mere increase in MSP will not benefit most farmers in the country.Further, the response of various State governments to a glut in the market appears to be muted. There exist intervention schemes to undertake the procurement of commodities whose market prices go below the MSP, but on most occasions the marketing season of bumper crops gets over by the time a bureaucratic decision on procurement is taken. Ultimately, the farmers are left at the mercy of unscrupulous traders to sell at whatever price they offer, with resultant repercussions such as the burning of the entire crop or throwing the harvested produce on roads in protest.Various studies show an increasing divergence between agricultural and non-agricultural income. And the rising aspirations among rural youth to emulate urban lifestyles put enormous pressure on them to find ways to increase income through various agricultural activities. Unfortunately, income from crop cultivation, which is a major segment of agriculture, is not growing enough to meet the expected level. On the contrary, the increasing market orientation and reforms in the input sector have resulted in a substantial rise in input costs.Dipping incomeAnalysis of data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare reveal that income from cultivation of many cereals and pulses has declined between 2004-05 and 2013-14 despite a considerable increase in MSP during this period. In the case of paddy, out of 18 major rice-growing States, net income has declined in five, and it is negative in six States. In seven States, it has increased only marginally. Income from the cultivation of even horticultural crops is uncertain due to the heavy investment involved and the high volatility in market prices. Most acute is the rise in prices of fertilisers: between 1991-92 and 2013-14, while the price of urea increased by 69%, that of DAP (diammonium phosphate) and potash rose by 300% and 600%, respectively.Recent policy pronouncements have added to the woes of already beleaguered farmers. The promotion of traditional farming at this juncture of agricultural development will take the sector to where it was decades ago. Most existing modern crop varieties will not respond to these practices in the medium term; consequently, yield and income will decline. Further, facilities to produce adequate organic inputs have not been developed either. Animal husbandry has been practised as a supplementary activity since time immemorial. Livestock acts as a cushion against crop loss during times of drought. The new rules on animal markets will put poor farmers and landless labourers in a fix. These developments do not augur well for rural youth whose interest in farming is already dwindling. While other developing countries are moving towards modernisation of agriculture which would reduce dependence of labour force and enable a rise in productivity, Indian agriculture is cluelessly plodding ahead.Elumalai Kannan is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

Picture by Ashok Sinha The monsoon will take another three-four days to hit Bihar, the Met department said on Thursday. Earlier, the rains were expected to arrive in the state between June 12 and 14. The monsoon usually arrives in Bihar by June 10. Though rain lashed Patna early morning on Thursday for nearly 45 minutes from around 5.30am, there was no respite from the scorching sun and high humidity - that made the temperature seem higher than it actually was - throughout the day. ""It feels like a heat wave,"" said Santosh, who works at a electronic goods shop on New Dakbunglow Road. ""It seems we have to make some offering to God to please him so that it rains here."" Patna Met director Sumendu Sengupta said: ""Monsoon has been delayed in the state by three to four days. Now it is expected to hit Bihar after June 17. We were expecting monsoon to arrive in Bihar by June 13 as a very strong low-pressure area was witnessed in the Bay of Bengal. However, the warm westerlies changed the direction of the trough line of the monsoon."" A trough line is an imaginary line that generally extends from west to east. Weather-related activities like rainfall and thunderstorms are very common in and around the region a trough line passes through. Sengupta attributed the early-morning showers to localised factors and a cyclonic circulation prevailing over the state. ""In this season (pre-monsoon), local systems develop frequently. This was the reason behind today's short spell of rain in the state capital,"" he said. The monsoon has not yet covered the entire country as it still eludes Bihar and Jharkhand, he said. ""We can say that the system responsible for the onset of monsoon is lying on the Bihar border and it will take another couple of days to break in the state,"" he added. A forecast by private weather agency Skymet said: ""A cyclonic circulation is embedded on the trough over east Uttar Pradesh. Due to these systems, good rain is likely to occur over Bihar and the foothills of east Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile Gangetic Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha may also witness thundershower activities during the next 24 hours."" A Met official said a western disturbance was seen over Jammu and Kashmir. ""Its induced cyclonic circulation is over Punjab and adjoining areas. It will rain over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Showers today in some parts of Bihar can be attributed to this factor also,"" the official said. At other places in the country there was excess monsoon rain, the official said, including over north-eastern states such as Assam and Meghalaya.As per Skymet, during the past 24 hours, the country received 49 per cent surplus rain. While the south peninsula is surplus by 29 per cent, central India has seen 42 per cent more rain than usual. ""The timely onset of the south-west monsoon is crucial for sowing of kharif (summer) crops such as paddy, and a deficit in rainfall may hit rice output,"" said Gopal Sharma, a farmer in Rohtas district."

In Punjab, farming is quite diversified. Mixed farming incorporates field crops, fruits, vegetables and livestock.With an objective to providing integrated solutions to problems faced by the farm sector, agricultural universities were set up in every state on land grant pattern of US universities. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was the second such university after the one at Pantnagar in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962. PAU played a leading role in ushering in the Green Revolution, especially in Punjab, and contributed in making the nation food self-sufficient.The university carved its place among the countrys leading institutions and has been recognised at the international level for its research output, quality of education and contribution in the development of the farm sector. In recent years, it has developed less-seeded kinnow, improved Bt cotton variety, high-yielding short-duration varieties of rice and the first zincated variety of wheat.In 2006, PAU came under the political knife, and a veterinary and animal husbandry university (GADVASU) was carved out of it, maiming it by one-fourth. Ridiculously, even the fodder section was transferred to the new university on the plea that animals eat it. One wonders why then by the same argument wheat, rice, corn, vegetables and fruits production should have not been transferred to the medical university because humans eat these products! However, the financial position of the government permitting, there could have been no objection to setting up a new university separately, which could compete, supplement and complement the research at PAU. Yet, to take away its departments, and divide assets, infrastructure and budget hit the very vitals of this academic institution, negating the integrated concept of growth and development of the farm sector.ANOTHER SURGICAL STRIKE?Now, once again, it seems some person(s) with access extraordinary to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is/are planning another surgical strike on the PAU, mooting a proposal to carve a horticultural university out of this institution, which, if pursued, will render the PAU a non-entity. Research and education in horticulture crops will need most of the same department as for other field crops such as genetics, bio-chemistry, molecular biology, entomology, plant pathology, food technology, farm machinery, soil and water engineering, agricultural economics and marketing, agriculture business management, agricultural extension etc. How can these departments be divided without debilitating the agricultural institution beyond repair!Stretching the same logic, should there be an independent vegetable university, fruit university, cereal crops university and pulse crops varsity? Though PAU as a premier institute catering to agricultural research and education in the state has been ranked number two by the Union ministry of human resources and development, the university itself needs strengthening financially rather than weakening through bifurcation.BETTER, VIABLE OPTIONSFor impetus to horticulture in Punjab, there are better and viable options. The first is to strengthen the fruits and vegetables departments along with other related departments through additional funding and staff positions. A centre of excellence in horticulture crops can be created within the university, which would complement the research activities of the above departments by focussing on basic and strategic research in horticultural crops. No additional infrastructure will be required. For a fund- starved state this is a better option.Another option is to strengthen specialised horticultural research in production areas. There is a northern belt where kinnow and vegetables are grown and the second is the south-western belt where mainly kinnow is grown. In these regions, PAU has its research farms that can serve as specialised centres of research. These should be research centres focusing on seed and nursery production of fruits and vegetables. The state government may provide additional land and funds for this purpose to the PAU.Yet another and the most important viable option to strengthen horticulture research in the state is to expedite the setting up of the Postgraduate Institute of Horticultural Research and Education (PGIHRE) in Amritsar, which has been approved by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The setting up of PGIHRE was announced by the Union finance minister in 2015. The institute is to be funded by the Centre and only land is to be provided by the state government.For research, land at Attari (Amritsar) and Abohar have been marked. This institute requires 10 acres near Amritsar for an administrative complex and residences. PGIHRE has the provision of more than 200 scientific positions for horticultural research and education. Funds earmarked for the institute by ICAR are held up due to delay in land acquisition for building the campus near Amritsar.This is the best option for the cash-strapped Punjab government. Under this option, long-term financial sustainability of the institute is also ensured.The state government must not commit the blunder of acceding to vested interests to carve out a horticulture university out of one of the top-ranking agricultural universities of the country and weaken agricultural and horticultural research in the state.It is hoped that the powers that be are listening.(The writer is the chancellor of Central University, Bathinda, and a noted farm economist.

5a048eac9855b76bf13bdcea,Look beyond waivers for Kisan 2.0: Agri policy must set market mechanisms free to work effectively,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/look-beyond-waivers-for-kisan-2-0-agri-policy-must-set-market-mechanisms-free-to-work-effectively/,2017-06-20,"When Lal Bahadur Shastri first shouted Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan at Delhis Ram Lila Maidan in 1965, he fleshed out a cardinal truth about Indias political imaginary: the idea of the brave soldier and the hardworking farmer as bulwarks of the nation. BJP, in the past three years, has adroitly managed to hook its political messaging to the martial constituency with its uncompromising nationalist rhetoric and chest-thumping machismo. The question is whether growing kisan unrest from Madhya Pradesh to Rajasthan will prove to be an unexpected political googly as we head towards 2019.After all, the imagery of the hard-pressed exploited farmer running the engines of the nation  deified from the beginning of the republic in films like Mother India and Do Bigha Zamin  remains an unshakeable shibboleth of the Indian political imagination. So, will the kisan agitations prove to be an effective political lever for a desperate opposition looking for evocative handles to block BJPs electoral juggernaut or will this crisis taper off?At the political level, BJP has, of course, been acutely focussed on the power of the farmer vote. Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly declared his governments intent to double farmers income by 2022 and BJPs 2014 manifesto promised to ensure a minimum of 50% profits over the costs of production in agriculture. Yet, at the policy level, it has been confounded by the fact that the toolkit that our governments have traditionally used for managing agriculture is outdated and faulty. It is essentially trying to fix the wrong questions with the wrong answers.The irony of MPs predicament is instructive. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan farcically went on a fast after his own police fired at farmers but agriculture is the one thing he has focussed consistently on since taking power in 2005. As the agricultural economist Ashok Gulati and his colleagues point out, the states agricultural GDP grew at a staggering 14.2% over the past five years and over thrice the national average over the last decade. This is unprecedented in the annals of Indias agricultural history. Even Punjab did not grow at this rate during the green revolution period.Yet, despite this, average earnings of agricultural households in MP continue to lag far behind the national average. This is basically because while farmers have been producing more, their input costs  water, diesel, fertilisers, etc  have increased substantially while prices for their products went down. A TOI analysis shows that between 2004-05 and 2014-15 in MP, the cost per hectare of fertilisers and seeds for wheat doubled while irrigation costs also increased substantially.This is of piece with the national agriculture story where after two years of drought, Indian farmers finally delivered a good crop for most commodities but saw their net margins going down  in many cases into the red. That greater farm production in 2016-17 would lead to a glut in the market, prices would collapse and farmer incomes would consequently go down is Economics 101. Yet, the problem is that most of our policies have been fixated on giving farmers a minimum support price (MSP) and not enough on creating conditions for market mechanisms to play out effectively.Government fixes MSP for 23 commodities but official procurement is limited to only two  wheat and rice  and that too in only a few states. It is estimated that over 90% of Indias farmers do not get the MSP price and are dependent on markets, which are circumscribed by arbitrary government over-regulation and the shortage of godowns and mandis.A good example of policy as a problem is the case of pulses farmers. After a bumper harvest, in February 2017, the India Pulses and Grain Association petitioned the Union commerce secretary to remove an old 2006 export ban since market prices in India had slipped below MSP. Tur dal was being sold at the time between Rs 35,000 and Rs 47,000 per tonne in MP, Karnataka and Maharashtra, against the MSP of Rs 50,500. Yet, inexplicably, the ban remains in place, along with limits on stocks, making it impossible for farmers to even recover their costs. Artificially choking the market and not letting it play out is a recipe for disaster.Second, farmer loan waivers only push the can further down the road. They dont solve the problem. After BJP came good on its UP loan waiver poll promise, Maharashtra caved in to a similar demand and Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are all facing the same music. In Punjab, Congress came to power promising exactly this.States simply dont have the money for such largesse. The combined debt-to-state GDP ratio of all states taken together hit an alarming 3.6% in 2015-16, breaching the mandated 3% ceiling under fiscal prudence rules. It will go through the roof with new waivers. A similar waiver by UPA in 2008 had no discernible long-term impact on improving agriculture.As TV pictures of the kisan agitations show, the blue jeans and T-shirt clad farmers of 2017 are very different from the downtrodden peasants of our collective national imagination. They ask why only big corporates should get loan waivers. It is a fair question.Yet, instead of temporary sops each year, government must do a fundamental rethink and address this Kisan 2.0 with a new deal on market pricing and a comprehensive deregulation of policy instead of old mai-baap sarkar type solutions that are past their use-by date."
5a04a1029855b76bf13be3eb,Sarah Todd - the model who became a master chef!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/sarah-todd-the-model-who-became-a-master-chef/articleshow/59354149.cms,2017-06-28,"After being a model for 10 years, Sarah Todd discovered her true passion, and it was something that took her in an entirely new direction  cooking. She became popular as a contestant from season six of MasterChef Australia, and is now a restaurateur who is focused on ethical food. Sarah was in Chennai last weekend, and spoke to us on how she discovered her passion, the emotional aspect of food, hosting cricketer Yuvraj Singh 's wedding party, her love for dosa and more...During her entire modelling career, for 10 years, Sarah says she kept trying different things because she knew that while she was lucky to have become a model, it actually wasn't her passion. Nothing ever stuck, until she started cooking. ""I just fell in love with it,"" she gushes.And it was because of her son that she started taking cooking seriously. ""I used to cook earlier, but I was a quick cook. I'd cook healthy food, but it'd be quite plain. And when I started feeding my son those, he would just spit them out. I realised that in addition to being nutritious, food has to be flavoursome because kids do not lie when it comes to food. So, I had to experiment, and started cooking different types of dishes. I realised that there is more to food than just fuelling your body,"" she recalls.She became obsessed with cooking and went to Le Cordon Bleu, where she'd be studying how to cook, and after coming home, in the evenings, she'd be watching cooking shows and taking notes and writing recipes. She knew then that she had found her passion. And once she got into MasterChef, she completely quit modelling. ""I said to myself that I'm going to give it a year and try and make food my career; if I can, I'll continue with it, and if not, I'd just go back to modelling. Now, here I'm, in India, cooking and running a restaurant,"" she says.The confidence that she gained was crucial in her pursuing cooking, she says. ""Especially, when we used to do the mystery boxes, we had to become creative and think on our feet. For instance, when one is cooking at home, you research a recipe, see what all you need and make that dish following the recipe. Whereas, while cooking from the mystery box, you would lift off the lid to find just some ingredients. You have no recipes and have to make something up, on the spot. Now, I can go into any of your houses, open your fridge  it would be like a mystery box to me  and make a dish,"" she says.But is it possible for people at home to plate their food just like how fancily the food is presented on the show? And does it even matter? ""Of course,"" feels Sarah, and adds, ""I believe we eat with our eyes first. So, no matter what dish I'm cooking at home, I'll make an effort to make it look nice. I won't just slap it into a bowl; I'd, maybe put some fresh herbs or plate it nicely. In Le Cordon Bleu, we were scolded every day. Say if you were using your chopping board to chop some herbs, you'd have to wipe it clean before you moved on to the next thing. That way, when I'm cooking, I'm finishing every step, and can start again quick, if I need something else. If you put a little bit of thought into the whole process, it shows in the final dish. And you are savouring the dish with your eyes. The first thing you see is the dish. If the same dish is plated sloppily and somewhat nicer on another plate, you are going to pick the latter. It's just a natural reaction. I like food to look nice and look like you have put effort into it as well.""Food is also emotional, she thinks. ""A dish could taste horrible, but if it reminds you of your childhood, say a dish that your mom cooked for you when you were down with cold and which made you feel warm and cosy, you would love it. So, if you can create emotions with your dishes, that's what counts. It might sound kind of stupid and crazy, I know, but if you do put more love into a dish, you can taste it,"" she says.Sarah decided to come to India after she got 50,000 followers on her Facebook page almost overnight when she was on MasterChef. ""I was like, 'Is that spam?' To just see if there are as many fans for the show in India, I flew over here. All along, people were recognising me  on the plane, at the airport once I got off the plane. I thought, 'Oh my God! It's real. People are indeed watching the show here,'"" she says.She already loved Indian cuisine, as her son is half-Indian, and had learnt to make some Indian dishes. And at a cooking demonstration, a couple invited her to Old Delhi. She describes the place as ""chaos"". ""You wouldn't go there unless it's for a special reason. The day we went there happened to be a holiday, so there was three days' worth of people there. You couldn't walk past without brushing another person. It was people's jam! But I was loving it. Everyone was really welcoming me, and I fell in love with this country straightaway,"" she says.Sarah chose to have her restaurant in Goa because it is tropical, like northern Queensland where she hails from. ""Goa has the same kind of climate, lots of beaches, lots of seafood. I love the water, having grown up near the beach, so Goa was amazing to me. And this property, in particular, made me go 'Whoa!' It was the ultimate place to have a restaurant, with the beach and hills,"" says the chef, who decides on everything  menu, interiors, staffing, and also cooks there.Her restaurant hosted cricketer Yuvraj Singh's pre-wedding party and she calls it a bit intimidating, but fun. ""It was five days of celebration. They flew in on their jets and came straight to our place from their previous party. We had a beautiful event and they absolutely loved it, and had a lot of seafood. It was amazing,"" she says.This is her second trip to Chennai. She had come here earlier this January, and stayed for a few days. ""So, yeah, I've seen a little bit and eaten a lot of food here,"" she quips. During that time, she had went to the Kapaleeswarar temple. ""It's really beautiful, with a lot of colour. And I went to a little store (Kalathi News Mart) down the temple street, and had rose milk there. I also went to the restaurant (Karpagambal Mess) that is a couple of doors away, with hopscotch colours on its floor. I had south Indian food served on the banana leaf.""She says she loves south Indian food because it's very different. ""My son's grandparents are from Punjab and the food here is unlike the food in the north. This time, I had lunch at the Dakshin restaurant and the food was amazing. I had the thali, and I tried everything on it. I found the banana fritter-type food, made using raw banana, amazing. It was quite strange to taste banana as a savoury. And the vegetable kurma was also very good. And dosa is my favourite food. Every time I come to India, on my first day, I have to eat dosa. If I don't, I feel like I haven't entered India,"" she says.It was in Mumbai that she had the dosa for the first time, and it was love at first sight. ""It was long ago and I instantly fell in love with it. The flavour was different from anything I had tasted before. I love having rice-based dishes, and the dosa is rice and lentils, so I found it amazing,"" she recollects. She says she had tried to make it in Australia, but couldn't then because the weather was not hot enough to ferment the batter. ""I'm actually contemplating sneaking in a bag of batter from here to Australia with me,"" she laughs.India, she thinks, is the number one place for showcasing the new trend in food  the produce. ""In this country, I find that every cuisine in a city or a region or a state is built around the ingredients produced in that area and that is how everyone has started to look at food today,"" she signs off."

But these will be phased out once the online e-way system becomes operational. Meanwhile, the mobile wings will be strengthened once the barriers go."" Excise and taxation commissioner Vivek Pratap Singh added that eventually the sale tax barriers will go under the GST system.It would be a hectic weekend for the department to monitor smooth transition from the value added tax (VAT) to the GST in the state. On Thursday, the department constituted a team of its officials to focus on the six excise divisions in the state on Saturday and Sunday. A GST helpline is also being launched.However, there is still no clarity about how long it could take for the new system to become fully functional in the state. Presently there are over 40 sale tax barriers, which are called information collection centres. As per the plan, under the GST system, the department would focus on mobile wings and their numbers will go up. Sources said due to technical glitches in e-way system, the sale tax barrier system, which was to end from July 1, would continue for some time.Traders in the state too are anxious about the new tax regime. Narotam Dev Ratti, former chairman, Punjab Trader Board, said the small traders who were not covered under VAT till now are the ones who will take time to come to terms with the new system. ""The online system has not been launched and there is lack of clarity on certain issues such as fate of traders who have already paid VAT. For instance, items like rice are exempt under the GST but there could be traders who would have paid VAT for trading in it as a single commodity. Will they get a refund? These are some grey areas,"" he said.Traders are also apprehensive about compliance as small and petty traders in the state may find difficult to meet the documentation and other statutory requirements for the GST.

But the newly-introduced GST is going to put an extra burden of over Rs 10 crore on this socio-religious activity at the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar and other gurdwaras, temple officials say.With purchases made for the community kitchen coming under various slabs of the new GST, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the mini-parliament of the Sikh religion that manages Sikh shrines (gurdwaras) in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, including the Harmandir Sahib (popularly known as the Golden Temple), is expecting an additional burden of Rs 10 crore from this year.Besides the Golden Temple, the SGPC runs the langar services in other famous Sikh shrines like Takht Keshgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib (where the modern day Khalsa Panth was established on April 13, 1699, by Guru Gobind Singh), Takht Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district and scores of other gurdwaras under it.The ""Langar Sewa"" (community kitchen) is a socio-religious activity that is part of the Sikh religious ethos from the time of the first Sikh Guru, Nanak Dev (1469-1539). The langar was started to emphasise equality in society regardless of religion, caste, colour and creed.With the new GST slabs likely to hit the SGPC 's purchases with an additional financial burden, Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has written to Finance Minister Arun Jaitely to exempt all purchases made by SGPC for ""langar sewa"" from the GST Act.""The Punjab government had earlier exempted all items purchased for langar by SGPC at Sri Darbar Sahib Amritsar, Sri Keshgarh Sahib Anandpur and Talwandi Sabo Bathinda from VAT. The SGPC spends around Rs 75 crore to purchase desi ghee, sugar and pulses. Now, it will have to bear a financial burden of Rs 10 crore on these purchases as they come under the 5 to 18 per cent GST bracket,"" Badal pointed out.SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar has also sent a communication to the GST Council, which decides on the tax structure and exemptions, to exempt the Sikh body from the GST slabs.""Sri Harmandir Sahib runs the world's largest mega kitchen, offering free meals throughout the year to hundreds of thousands of people. (It is funded by) offerings made by people,"" Badal pointed out.""The central government should immediately withdraw the GST on purchases made by the SGPC and other religious institutions that are doing community service of this magnitude,"" Prithipal Singh, a devout Sikh who has been doing voluntary service at the Langar Hall of the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar for the past nearly a decade, told IANS.Under the new GST Act, there is provision for exemption to institutions/businesses on the recommendation of the GST Council.Hundreds of people volunteer on a daily basis at the Golden Temple complex and other gurdwaras to prepare and serve food and wash used utensils at the langars. The volunteers include scores of women and children as well. People partake langar while sitting on the floor in the langar halls of gurdwaras.The langar service is funded from donations made by people at gurdwaras. The SGPC has an annual budget of over Rs 1,100 crore to manage the gurdwaras under it.""Anyone coming to the langar is offered food. No one is ever turned back. It is part of the Sikh ethos,"" volunteer Gagandeep Singh pointed out.Hundreds of tonnes of wheat flour, desi ghee, pulses, vegetables, milk, sugar and rice are used, along with millions of litres of water, annually at the Golden Temple complex and other gurdwaras to prepare langar.The langar is completely vegetarian."
5a0b40f79855b76bf13cd781,Why Indian farmers are distressed?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/info-nomics/why-indian-farmers-are-distressed/,2017-07-07,"On the eve of Uttar Pradesh (UP) election, Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi promised if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins then farm loan will be waived. BJP won, and the farm loan was waived-off. Sensing a case of political opportunism other states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka  joined the farm loan waiver bandwagon. Farmers usually take loan to grow crops and to buy farm equipment. However, waiving off farm loan does not makes sense economically. The cause of farm distress lies somewhere else. We find reasons for a farmer not realizing the market price has to do with inefficient supply chain management, with farm distress getting augmented because of lower farm size holding and lack of irrigation facilities.Between 2012 and 2015 over 10,000 farmers committed suicide. Globally, India has second largest amount of arable land (next only to USA) but less than 35 per cent of this land comes under irrigation. Fluctuation in Indias agricultural output is due to supply-side shocks resulting from inadequate rainfall. Investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification, rain water harvesting, and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures. Additionally, other factors such as lack of reforms to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power resulting from small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities are also important.If various state governments can addresses these issues it will be beneficial for the farmers than waiving-off farm loan.In India, not only percapita agricultural income is low, and but at times it is not possible to sustain this low income. Also, agricultural output fluctuates more than the outputs of the industrial and services sectors. Official output data shows that during the period between 1991-1992 and 2013-2014, the coefficient of variation for agricultural output is 191.34, in comparison to 50.48 for industry, and 22.03 for services sector. This has led to unequal income distribution in India with rural-urban wage gap at 45 per cent in comparison to around 10 per cent for China and Indonesia. Some 850 million people still live in rural India. India has around 260 million people living in poverty and 80 per cent of them live in the countryside. Increasing and sustaining farm income is important if India wants to reduce poverty.Majority of farming(65 per cent) is rain-dependent. Volatile rainfall patterns lead to lower farm income. The median annual wage for a farmer in India is around US $290 which is barely two months minimum wage in Mumbai  the commercial capital of India. Because of lack of proper irrigation facilities, and weather insurance schemes, farmers typically get stuck to growing low-value crops such as rice and wheat, although there is an ever increasing demand for high-value stuffs such as fruits, and vegetables.Inefficient supply chain management equally contributes to farm distress.In India, if farmers are to sell their produce, they have two options. First is to sell directly to the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in government outlets such as Food Corporation of India (FCI). MSP is the minimum price for a product established by the government and supported by payments to producers in the event of the market price falling below the specified minimum. The second option is to take their produce to the nearby government-designated mandi (market)where in front of state officers they can auction produce to the brokers. Mandis are the markets in smaller towns and cities to which farmers from nearby villages bring their agricultural produce to sell. There are around 7700 government designated mandis spread across India.Typically, MSP is higher than the market price, and one would assume that farmers gain every time the government announces the MSP. However, farmers are seldom able to sell their produce at the MSP. Every village does not have government outlets. FCI has a minimum presence in other major rice and wheat producing states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa. Compared to all-India average of 7340 farmers suicide committed between 1995 and 2010, only West Bengal has higher suicides numbering 19331 between 1995 and 2010. The corresponding figures for Assam, Bihar, and Orissa are 3566, 1235, and 4460, respectively. And, even if there is a FCI outlet, the government may not procure if the farmers bring their produce before/after the dates of procurement. The farmers are at whim of local traders and are forced to sell their produce in the informal market.In India, as much as 83 per cent of the farmers are smallholders, with less than 1 hectare of landholding. These marginal farmers do not have access to cold storage, and have no option but to sell their produce to the middlemen or traders. It is impossible for them to get a space in the state storage facilities without any political connection, and also because the smaller farmers do not have wherewithal to book crate in warehouses. Lack of reforms in the APMC Act prevents these small farmers to sell directly to supermarkets, exporters, and agro-processors. This prevent contract farming which otherwise can entail better price realization for these farmers.Rather than waiving-off farm loans there is a need to rise above party-politics and ensure reforms in the APMC Act. According to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report move to waive-off farm loan is likely to cost various state exchequers a whopping $40 billion (around 2% of Indias GDP).Timely procurement through MSP and training for increasing agricultural productivity will also help. Indias neighbor China produces more wheat and rice in spite of having lesser area of land cultivated in comparison to India. Finally, instead of spending on blanket subsidies (favoring the big farmers), investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification,rain water harvesting and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures."

Basmati-386 that once brought fame to the region for its aroma and the length of its grain, is now grown on only 10% of the area it was grown just five years ago, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has estimated.The reasons are many. These include the governments failure to put a favorable export system in place with the main reason being the inadequate returns to the farmer. Falling yields of the variety with newer more productive varieties being discovered have added to the farmer turning away from sowing the variety.Economics just does not add upGurjit Singh, a farmer from Chaguwan village that famous for this variety, says, This variety yields 8-10 quintals per acre. This is lower than other basmati varieties  PUSA-1121, PUSA-1509, Punjab-4 and 5  that yield 15 quintals per acre to 18 quintals per acre.Satnam Singh, another progressive farmer from Kuhala village, said, I sowed Basmati-386 on once acre and got only Rs 2,400 per quintal. I needed to earn Rs 5,500 per quintal to make ends meet. I sowed the variety only to make it alive. He added that the variety was also sown a month later than normal paddy, delaying the sowing of the Rabi wheat. This lowers the wheat yield by up to two quintals per acre. The government, however, in not serious on our concerns. Millers question quality of our produce on flimsy grounds, he claimed.Cultivation of Basmati-386 is no longer viable as the PAU and other agri-universities in the country have developed other look-alike varieties which give better yield, said Ashok Arora, owner of Dawat Basmati Rice, a prominent rice exporter. An attempt to make a similar variety, Basmati-370, also did not work as the aroma could not be reproduced.Apart from the two villages of Chaguwan and Kuhala, the other villages famous for the variety are Brar, Khyala, Bullar, Chawinda. These villages fall in Chugawan, Harchha Chhina, Ajnala and Attari blocks, respectively. Tarn Tarans Gaddiwind blocks and Gurdaspurs Batala area also situated in this belt.Chief agriculture officer Dalbir Singh Chinna said they aimed to ensure that growers got good price for their produce of older varieties to ensure survival.Why has Basmati-386 withered away?The main reason being the inadequate returns to the farmerThe governments failure to put a favorable export system in place withFalling yields of the varietyNewer more productive varieties have been discovered"
5a0662fd9855b76bf13c5f47,MGNREGA wages less than minimum farm wages in 15 states: Panel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mgnrega-wages-less-than-minimum-farm-wages-in-15-states-panel-4743412/,2017-07-09,"Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image) Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image)THE COMMITTEE for revision of wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarentee Act (MGNREGA) has found that minimum agricultural wages are higher than MGNREGA wages in 15 states. An upward revision in MGNREGA wages is estimated to require a Rs 4,500 crore increase in its budget.Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month.As per data being examined by the committee, the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers are significantly higher than MGNREGA wages in Karnataka, Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The other states where MGNREGA wages fail to match up are Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the minimum wages are marginally higher than MGNREGA wages.In the 15 states where MGNREGA wages are lower, we tried revising it to bring it on par with the minimum agricultural wages paid by the respective states. Where MGNREGA wages are on par or higher, we decided to protect it as it is. If a revision is done as per this formula, it is estimated that a Rs 4,500 crore addition to the existing MGNREGA budget would be needed, said an official from the Ministry of Rural Development.The Indian Express had earlier reported that despite official claims of this years MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore being the highest ever, the wage revision, at 2.7 per cent, was the lowest ever. It meant a per day, per person wage hike of merely Re 1 in some states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Rs 2-Rs 3 in several others.This was because the finance ministry, on account of financial implications, rejected the recommendations of the S Mahendra Dev committee, which had proposed to bring MGNREGA wages on par with minimum wages paid to unskilled agricultural workers in the states. The expert panel had said that the Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the current consumption pattern of rural households, should be the basis for revising MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL), which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983.The basket of goods for calculating CPI-AL comprises mainly food items. With the implementation of the National Food Security Act, rice and wheat is available for as cheap as Rs 2-3 per kg. CPI(Rural) gives lower weightage to food items, and hence, is found to be a better indicator of wage increase, said a ministry official.The Nagesh Singh panel has found that based on the second recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, if the existing MGNREGA wages are revised as per CPI(Rural), it would mean another Rs 600 crore increase in the budget.CPI(R) should be used to revise the wages every year instead of CPI(AL), as the former is more representative of the current rural consumption basket. Also, wage revision should take place every six months, in keeping with the practice for other trades and occupation, said Ankita Aggarwal from the peoples organisation, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha. Aggarwal said that with such low wages and delays in payments, MGNREGA fails to provide the livelihood security for which it was enacted.Jharkhand Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma had recently written a strongly-worded letter to the Ministry of Rural Development protesting against the growing divergence between the states minimum wage, which is currently Rs 224 per day, and MGNREGA wages of just Rs 168 per day after the wage hike.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Badungar said, The Union government has not responded to our first letter yet. We have written another letter to the PM and FM seeking their time to explain our case.

All these exemptions came to an end once the Goods and Services Tax came into force. Now, the state government has no power to exempt SGPC from paying any kind of tax.Hence, Harsimrat Kaur has shot off a separate letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to resume the old exemptions under the new tax system controlled by the Centre.Explaining the impact of GST on community kitchen, Golden Temple manager Sulakhan Singh said, Earlier, there was 4 per cent tax on desi ghee. We were exempted from paying this tax. Now, tax on ghee under GST has been increased from 4 per cent to 12 per cent. It means now we will have to buy 50 kg ghee by paying Rs 600 more. He added, We were spending around Rs 75 crore annually on buying ghee, pulses, sugar, vegetables, spices, wheat, rice and other items to run the community kitchen, where more than 50,000 devotees have langar every day on an average. Now, we are being made to pay tax which is even higher than the old system.SAD (Badal) has been an alliance partner at the Centre and there would not only be financial but also political ramifications if SGPC failed to convince the Centre to grant exemption from paying GST.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Gautam added that the IRRI will help introduce new varieties of rice, increase production and encourage rice cultivation in countries like Africa where it is not produced.The IRRI consultant explained there are some states in the eastern parts, including eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa which failed to benefit from the Green Revolution as these parts had no irrigation facilities like in Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. The productivity of paddy in the eastern part is low compared to northern and central regions and the IRRI regional centre would introduce flood and drought resistant varieties for them. IRRI would assist the farmers overcome weather challenges, said Gautam.This is another major international intervention in Uttar Pradesh in the Yogi government as earlier during the visit of the prime minister to Israel, UP Jal Nigam had signed an MOU for checking pollution in rivers and water management in the state."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

A higher crop output is anticipated following increased sowing of rice and pulses when compared with the last season.The latest Union Agriculture department data showed that across the country, kharif crops have been planted on 563.17 lakh hectares till now, as against 521.80 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year.Increase in acreageWith the sowing of crops apace during the past few days across the country, paddy (rice) has been sown in 125.77 lakh hectares in the current season till July 14, which is marginally higher than the 120.32 lakh hectares recorded in the 2016-17 season. The acreage under pulses has been recorded at 74.61 lakh hectares till now, as against the 60.28 lakh hectares of the corresponding period for the last season.The sowing of coarse cereals is up as well, at 113.06 lakh hectares against the 98.79 lakh hectares of last year. But the total oilseeds sown has come down to 103.92 lakh hectares, when compared with 115.75 lakh hectares of last year.Cotton acreage is up this season at 90.88 lakh hectares, against 73.93 lakh hectares last year in the corresponding period. Sugarcane, too, continues to see an increase in acreage and has been planted in 47.94 lakh hectares against the 45.22 lakh hectares last year. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), conditions are favourable for further advancement of the monsoon and overall rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over the next two weeks, from July 13 to July 26.Conditions favourableSowing of kharif crops has gained momentum during the past few days as the monsoon is progressing well. Paddy transplanting, though, has been a bit sluggish in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but it is likely to pick up in the coming days. Sowing of pulses is apace in the key growing states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, which is an encouraging sign, Anand Sharma, regional co-ordinator of the IMDs agricultural meteorology told, The Hindu .Apart from western parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the monsoon rains have covered most parts of the country, he added. The monsoon rain delivers about 70% of Indias annual rainfall and is critical for millions of farmers as nearly half the countrys farmland lacks irrigation and is dependent on rain."

Between 2006 and 2015, the states agri-growth rate plummeted to 1.6 per cent  less than half the all-India average of 3.5 per cent (see Graph 1). During this period, states such as Madhya Pradesh registered a growth rate of more than 9 per cent in agriculture.It is not that Punjab has a high value of agri-output per ha that is slowing down its growth rate. The state is nowhere near the top in that ranking (see Graph 2). Getting the state back to a 5 per cent growth path is thus a matter of serious concern. Punjab used to have the highest per capita income amongst the 21 large states of the country till 2003. But it has slipped to the seventh position, and unless there are drastic policy changes, the state is going to slip further.Punjab is endowed with one of the best possible infrastructures for agriculture in the country. It has the highest irrigation cover amongst all states  98.5 per cent of its cropped area is irrigated. Almost 80 per cent of irrigation is from groundwater sources, facilitated by highly subsidised power. Power subsidy in the states current budget has crossed Rs 7,000 crore. This is much higher than the subsidy provided to any other agricultural input. Much of the large power subsidy goes into the cultivation of rice, a water-intensive crop  it requires 25 rounds of irrigation in a season. The power subsidy, then, is leading to the depletion of the states water table. Punjabs water table receded at the rate of 70 cm per year during 2008 to 2012  110 of the 132 blocks have been declared as over-exploited. This is the biggest bane of Punjab agriculture.Punjab does have advantages in other areas. Almost all villages in the state are connected with pucca all-weather roads. The network of regulated mandis in Punjab is one of the best in the country. A robust and fast-moving procurement system has reduced the market risks of wheat and paddy growers in the state. Almost 90 per cent of the market arrivals is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). But this system has also made Punjabs farmers risk averse. This is today the biggest bottleneck in farmers diversifying from the wheat-rice cycle, which occupies more than 83 per cent of Punjabs cropped area.What can be done to make Punjabs agriculture sustainable, especially with respect to its groundwater resources, without hurting farmers incomes? Diversification from common rice to hybrid maize is one option, which can save power subsidy and groundwater, and yet give farmers almost the same income as paddy. But farmers are reluctant to switch to maize because there is no effective procurement system for this crop. Our suggestion to the Punjab government is to tap the savings in power subsidy  roughly Rs 10,000/ha  which could accrue once farmers switch from paddy to maize. The state could use these savings to cover the risk of maize farmers by promoting feed mills for poultry and silage units for milch cattle and encouraging starch industries that use maize.With the new GST regime coming into force, the processing industry could be incentivised to prefer Punjab over other states in purchasing agricultural raw material. To help the state regain ecological balance, any losses on account of procurement may be borne by the Centre. Measures have to be taken to offset the reduction in the area under paddy in Punjab (except basmati, which delivers much higher price to farmers). There should be vigorous efforts to increase productivity and procurement of rice in the eastern states which get much higher rainfall and are more suitable for paddy cultivation. Simultaneously, Punjab should promote the use of micro-irrigation, especially for sugarcane and fruits and vegetables.The dairy and meat industries are other sources of diversification for Punjabs agriculturalists. The state has the highest yield of milch animals in the country and its per capita consumption of milk is also the highest in the country. But the state processes just about 10 per cent of the milk it produces  Gujarat, in contrast, processes about half of the milk it produces. Punjab needs to incentivise private and cooperative dairies to invest in processing milk and milk products. It should target a 20 per cent increase in processed milk in the next five years. More than 67 per cent of milch animals in Punjab are buffaloes. If the state can eradicate the foot and mouth disease, buffalo meat from Punjab can be sold at premium rates in international markets, ultimately benefiting the states dairy farmers.The states farmers should also diversify towards fruit and vegetables. Less than 3 per cent of the cropped area in Punjab is under fruit and vegetables. This needs to go up to 10 per cent over the next five years. However, the government will need to invest in marketing infrastructure for fruit and vegetables, as it did for grains by creating a robust mandi infrastructure. With protected cultivation and an integrated cold chain, backed by a robust food processing industry, Punjab can tap the market for fresh and processed produce in West Asia and Central Asian countries. A modern expressway from Khanna to Kandla could be helpful in the faster transportation of fruit and vegetables.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

We are conducting a probe into all the expenses. They left us with pending bills of Rs 13,000 crore soon after we took over.He added, On the Rs 31,000 debt legacy on account of the cash credit limit, we are expecting some relief from the Centre. The food department officials have met the Union ministry and requested it to consider Punjabs case. We hope to get relief to the tune of Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 crore.Though buoyed over the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Manpreet said the new tax regime has left very little legroom for state governments to introduce new taxes.Manpower audit of deptsOther than a few local levies, no fresh taxes can be imposed. So we are trying to cut down on costs, he said, adding that the state government has ordered a manpower audit of all departments to restructure them.The manpower audit of a few departments has shown large discrepancies. The department does not know who is doing what, what is he being paid for and from where. It will help us restructure them, Manpreet said.Also, a part of the cost-cutting exercise, he said, is to settle pending litigation with the government.Our employees are in litigation with us. We are in litigation with rice shellers and other industrial units. We want to clear all pending liabilities and litigations by offering one-time settlement. Every department has pending liabilities  be it value added tax (VAT) dues or disputed C-forms. We are ready to waive off a part of it. As for litigation, why should our own employees be aggrieved with the government. We are ready to address their complaints against promotions or increments, the minister said.Manpreet, who as finance minister in the SAD-BJP government had advised the government against extending retirement age of employees to defer payment of retirement benefits, said he still believes it makes better economics to hire seven fresh faces than retain those on highest pay scale.The proposal is still under consideration of the government and the cabinet has yet to take a final call on it, he said.RBI has to tell banks to write off farm loansAsked when will the government notify the farm debt waiver, Manpreet said the expert group, headed by T Haque, has yet to give its final report. After we have the details, we will meet the state level bankers committee (SLBC) to work out a one-time settlement (OTS) for the government. Finally, it is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which has to tell banks to do it and convert the crop loans of farmers into term loan for the government, he added."
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

But weighed down by three successive years of drought and mounting debts, he found it impossible to put the money aside for the wedding.So, when a brick kiln unit offered to lease an acre of his land for three years, the farmer thought he had struck gold. When he was offered three times more than what he earned from his crops, he immediately gave his nod to the proposal.The farmer at Kodiyaganj Village in West Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh district was the first in his village to lease out fertile land to a brick kiln owner for Rs 45,000 a year.Today he regrets the day he said yes. For what he didn't know was after the unit had dug out four feet of the top soil, the land was no longer as fertile as it used to be.""The land I got back was less fertile. I tried to grow some crops but they were of poor quality and the yield was also low,"" Ghayasuddin said.With a construction boom across India, brick-making is a lucrative business in Uttar Pradesh villages, with hundreds of furnaces baking millions of bricks day and night.The story of Ghayasuddin turns the spotlight on many such hamlets in the region. Over 250 farmers in six villages Kodiyaganj, Sikanderpur, Akrabad, Sakra, Gabhana, Dadaun and Pilakhana - in Aligarh have leased out about 200 acres of land to around 100 brick kiln units in the last four years.Some farmers said they were forced to do it because the prolonged drought had pushed them to the brink of starvation.""The proposal by the brick kiln industries came when we were in desperate need of money. We were making Rs 12,000 per acre by growing crops and for the same acre we were paid Rs 45,000-60,000,"" said Imran Khan, a farmer from Sikandrabad who grew rice and wheat alternately on his field.A few farmers said they were forced to lease out their land when their surrounding fields were dug out, leaving their field at a higher level, which led to their soil being washed off to the neighbouring, quarried fields.Those who still held on found it increasingly difficult to irrigate their elevated land.Ramesh Singh, a resident of Pilakhana village, said he was against leasing out his land to brick kiln units but had to yield to them when his crops started dying because water couldn't reach his raised land.""On all three sides, there was quarried land, which made it impossible for water to reach my field. I know the degradation the quarrying will cause to my land, but I am helpless as my crops are dying either way,"" Singh said.Singh leased out four acres of land to Kamal Udyog for three years for Rs 50,000 per acre per year.The owner of the industry, Kamal Agarwal, however, stressed he was helping farmers of the area.""Without our industries, farmers would have starved. We are paying them nearly three times of what they would have got by selling their crops. Moreover, each brick kiln industry gives employment to at least 50 labourers,"" Agarwal said.The brick kiln industries operating in these six villages manufacture around 70-80 lakh bricks per month, he said.Smoke emissions from brick kilns contribute 9 per cent of the total emissions in India, studies say.""There is a huge environmental cost involved - from smoke emission and local air pollution to the loss of valuable topsoil,"" said Khurram Ahmed, a social activist.India, the second largest producer of bricks in the world after China, manufactures nearly 200 billion bricks a year, a 2015 CSE report said.About 70 per cent of these bricks are produced in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which have one of the world's most fertile alluvial plains, Punjab State Council for Science and Technology said in a 2009 report.""Brick fields are mostly situated on riverine fertile agricultural land as they need clayish, silty, loamy, clay loam or silt loam soil with good texture,"" Ahmed added.After the brick kiln industries have excavated the top soil, farmers are forced to grow either rice or millet, crops that require more water. Because of water-logging in their fields, they find it difficult to grow vegetables and other crops such as wheat and corn on their once fertile land.""Water logging in the quarried land is a common problem.farmers are forced to grow crops that require excess water. In some cases, water logging makes it impossible for them to grow any other kind of crop,"" Ahmed said.Building construction in India is estimated to grow at a rate of 6.6 per cent per year between 2005 and 2030 providing a steady demand for bricks. The brick making industry is utilising 2.5 crore tonnes of coal and other biomass fuels per year, government reports have said.Brick kiln industries consumed 25,20,000 cubic metres soil during 1995-2010, said a 2015 report in the International Journal of Innovative Research Development. The industry has been closed in many big cities of India for polluting the environment but has started mushrooming in the countryside.Although the government is encouraging the use of ecofriendly fly ash bricks, it will be a while before red bricks are replaced because of lack of awareness about the harmful effects of brick kiln units on the environment, he said.""The construction boom is feeding the brick kiln industries across the country but the cost being paid is too high. Shrinking of agriculture land is pushing us towards a dooming agrarian crisis and there is a dire need to switch to more environment-friendly options,"" Ahmed said."

Kamaljeet was one of three gangsters of Punjab who committed suicide in a village in Haryana in June after being cornered by the police. The two others were Jaspreet Singh alias Jumpy Don and Nishan Singh of Ferozepur.A screen shot of his Facebook.Simma confessed that he and one of his accomplices had shot dead Kochhar, but the police are unnecessarily targeting their friends and family members.Meanwhile, Jaitu station house officer (SHO) Sunil Sharma said it is yet to be confirmed whether Simma himself wrote the post on Facebook.He said police teams are conducting raids at all possible hideouts of the accused.Police have so far failed to identify the other accused involved in the killing.According to the police, Simma along with his accomplice came in a Swift car and fire bullets at Kochhar. The accused fled the spot immediately after the crime, leaving the victim dead on his driving seat.Meanwhile, Youth Akali Dal leader Parambans Bunty Romana has submitted a memorandum to Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nanak Singh and urged him to ensure law and order in district as residents are living under terror due to the activities of gangsters. He also blamed Congress leaders of sheltering miscreants."
5a07873b9855b76bf13cad72,Punjab’s water stress foregrounds tough policy trade-offs,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/punjabs-water-stress-foregrounds-tough-policy-trade-offs/,2017-08-03,"A reply by Water Resources minister Uma Bharti to a Lok Sabha question on groundwater depletion foregrounds tough trade-offs facing Indias policymakers.According to Bharti, an assessment of groundwater resources and usage showed that 16% of 6,584 assessment units in India are overexploited.A table which accompanies her reply provides state-wise data. Here, Punjab stands out for the magnitude of overexploitation. If 16% of assessed units in India are overexploited, the figure rises to 76% in case of Punjab. It is the most water stressed Indian state.Punjab also happens to be Indias most important state in providing food security. It is a massive contributor to the cereal-dependent public distribution system.One way of looking at it is Indias food security is heavily dependent on a state which is perhaps the worst placed in terms of water stress. Punjabs impressive agricultural production is partly an outcome of its irrigation coverage. About 98.5% of Punjabs crop area is irrigated, mainly on account of groundwater irrigation. Without this supply of water, Punjab will surely not be a large contributor to rice procurement by state agencies.It is not just quantity where Punjabs farmers score. According to Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Punjab has the highest yield in paddy among states.This is where a policy maker will face difficult trade-offs.The easy solution will be to dramatically bring down electricity subsidies which will force farmers to divert to a crop which consumes less water than paddy. While this process takes place, how is it possible to guarantee that other states will offset the loss of rice procurement in Punjab?Without a simultaneous offset in rice procurement, there will be other complications such as a revival of cereal inflation. Introducing a rational pricing policy to preserve groundwater is essential. But the sequence of steps needed to get there without collateral damage is very difficult."

(Representational photo) The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) mandate is agriculture education, research and farm extension. (Representational photo)Although autarky on Indian farms is a distant dream, as the 71st year of Independence dawns, penury-ridden farmers are still committing suicide by the thousands a consequence of decades of short-sightedness, while economists and scientists are still equating food sufficiency to farmer sustainability.The occasion merits introspection on the core issues of farmers distress. We must begin at the apex. The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) mandate is agriculture education, research and farm extension. It contributed during the most challenging years of food scarcity. Though that success came at an environmental cost we didnt understand that when we were succeeding. The Green Revolution and a few small triumphs arent enough to justify the status quo.ICAR is no more the holy cow it once was, it can be safely taken to the slaughter house. Far from being an autonomous body, ICAR has become an extension of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. It should be transformed into a truly autonomous body reporting directly to the prime minister like the Atomic Energy Commission. Its functions should be restricted to farm research, education and oversight of non-ICAR agriculture institutes. Farm extension services should be completely delegated to the state governments.ICAR has historically evolved with a strong bias in favour of crop sciences at the cost of animal husbandry. Research that focuses on agriculture productivity without an alignment to its socio-economic consequences and farmer prosperity is pass. Yields for irrigated crops like rice and wheat are comparable with the best in the world, but research on rain-fed farms, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables lags considerably. Evolving consumer preferences, changing the narrative from farm to food, environmental impact, climate resilient agriculture require a reorientation of priorities and mindsets. The capacities for market intelligence and forecasting models have not been cultivated.The deterioration in agriculture education is deplorable. Some state agriculture universities (SAU) are even conducting courses in fashion design. More appalling are the over 1,000 unregulated private agriculture colleges which have sprouted across the nation churning out degrees like street food. Many are without proper labs, infrastructure or farm land. As agriculture is a state subject ICAR/Central government jurisdiction doesnt apply to these proliferating private profiteers. They thrive because states havent enacted a regulatory framework. The Punjab government has notified a regulatory act; other states must follow.Of the three activities of ICAR, technology transfer or farm extension is shared with the states and is the biggest disappointment of all. Since India became a cereal secure nation, complacency set in and public extension collapsed. The abdication by the state public extension system has allowed the private shopkeepers to usurp the role of farm advisories to disastrous consequences for farmers, human health and the ecology.ICAR and the states exercise authority and jointly fund SAU activities. Around 700 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) funded by the ICAR are designated for capacity building and technology refinement and transfer but are neither fully staffed nor equipped.Practically, state governments barely manage to fund the SAUs. To offset the constant paucity of funds, SAUs are forced to augment their resources by seeking research grants irrespective of the states priorities. For example, a particular state may want to focus on diversification from paddy in the kharif season, while much of the coordinated research is for the Rabi season crops. This happens because centre and state objectives differ.Convergence between ICAR and state agriculture agencies has failed. If the PMO accepted the responsibility of agriculture research and education, SAU salaries would fall into the Central government basket and the KVKs could be transferred to the states. That would free up resources for states to focus exclusively on farm extension.ICAR cannot escape its share of culpability  recruitments are manipulated, inbreeding and nepotism are rampant. Salary structures based on government promotion rules of time-bound promotion do not recognise research output and talent is ignored. Most farmhands are women, but women are not even recruited in equal numbers. Inter-departmental coordination is lacking within the 71 agriculture universities and the whopping 101 institutes across India. Its time to prune the institute numbers by a third. Worse still, research is routinely stolen from ICAR institutes by private companies. Thus, IPR registrations and internal resource generation like that in the developed world universities is improbable.To reach the promised land, apart from the stroke of the axe, budget allocations for agriculture R&D must be pegged as 2 per cent of the GDP from the less than 1 per cent at present. But, most importantly, a metric to audit outcomes and establish accountability is needed to resolve the crisis. Unfortunately, when decisions are made, the theoretical knowledge of policymakers supersedes the grounded experience of the practitioner, allowing these crises to fester indefinitely.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

When neighbouring villages get inundated, residents come in boats to seek shelter in the four gurdwaras and schools of Barkola. We provide free food to the victims in the langars of the four gurdwaras of the village. As government relief comes late and in scant amount, we villagers ourselves share whatever food we have. We survive because of this cooperation, said Kartara Singh, president of Nanak Sahi gurdwara in the village.Located some 15 km south of Nagaon town, Barkola boats 10,000 residents out of which 2,000 are Sikhs, mostly Dalit Mazhabis. Tiwa and Koch tribals, Assamese Dalit communities such as Hiras and Kaibartyas and OBC Nath Jugis make up rest of the population.Prolonged isolation from Punjab has made the Sikhs closer to Assamese communities that with other Sikhs.We speak Assamese, call ourselves Assamese Sikhs and intermarry with Assamese Hindus. The then Punjab chief minister Giani Jail Singh along with Surjit Singh Barnala had visited Assam in 1975 to meet us. Learning that we cant speak Punjabi, he had requisitioned Siromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) of Amritsar and sent one Giani Bhajan Singh of Anandpur Sahib to teach us Gurumukhi script in 1979. He married a local Assamese Sikh woman, lived with us for 30 years and died recently after retirement, Kartara Singh added. However, since then the SGPC has not assisted the Assamese Sikhs in the maintenance of gurdwaras or development of the community kitchens.Narrating the history of the Assamese Sikhs, Assamese Sikh Association general secretary and principal of the lone higher secondary school in Barkola, Pratap Singh said: Ahom king Swargadeo Chandrakanta Singha requested help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh to fight Burmese invaders in Assam. Some 500 Sikh soldiers fought the Burmese in Hadirasokhi in Goalpara out of which only a dozen survived. They sailed across Brahmaputra in a boat through its tributary Kopili to Chaparmukh in Nagaon district. Of the survivors, one Subedar Ram Singh left Chaparmukh for Barkola, married a local Assamese woman and established our roots. From Barkola, few families established communities in Helem in Sonitpur district, Hathipara in Nagaon district and Lanka in Hojai district.Over the years, the Assamese Sikhs have assimilated into the Assamese identity so much so that till 1980s, they used to call the gurdwaras as naamghar or traditional Assamese temple. The village also has its share into Assamese nationalism.Three sons of Barkola, Chandan Singh, Karam Singh and Banindra Mazumdar laid down their lives during 1983 Assam agitation. All of us took out silent marches during that period. The men were all geared up to fight against illegal immigration of Bangladeshis. They were all agitated. We spent sleepless nights, Harbansh Kaur added.However, the village still feels neglected despite contributing top police officials, army officers and Assamese language literatures.We have been demanding construction of embankment along the Kopili river as permanent solution to provide relief to us from recurring floods. Work began but has remained incomplete for the past 30 years, Pratap Singh added.Facing inundation of agricultural fields every year, the village has lost its expertise in making the famous Barkola jaggery.Sugarcane cultivation has massively reduced due to recurring floods. Our jaggery was famous throughout Northeast. Now, most people are indulged only in rice and vegetable cultivation. Some 80% of Barkola residents are cultivators and the remaining 20% have government jobs, said Dakhinpat Gaon panchayat president Tutumoni Saikia Laskar.Though the Assamese Sikhs have been included in the minority board and get some benefit of government schemes, their demand for Assamese Sikh Development Council for the past 20 years has been ignored.We are too scattered and too divided politically to matter as an electorate, Pratap Singh added."

If you thought you had seen it all with bhindi fry, masala, tadka or even a South Indian vengaya theeyal, then you Sir, need to order yourself some Bendakaya Pulusu at Nook, in Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park.The cafe style restaurant offers south Indian, north Indian, pan Asian and continental food. The ambience is set in green and white palette with box lights hanging from the ceiling. You are most likely to be surrounded by techies and a family crowd at this restaurant that also has a pool table and couch set in the lobby.The Lamb Seek Kabab is minced well and is topped with fresh coriander, the Prawns Tempura falls on the crunchier side and the Chicken Tikka was well marianted with flavours of the charred grill in the soft meat pieces. In the vegetarian part of the starters menu, the croquette were equal parts crunchy on the outside and goeey delicious on the inside.Among cocktails, the whiskey infused in tea, served chill was an interesting combination, but did fall back on the blend and the alcohol punch. The Hot Toddy is warm and soothing, but missed a brandy punch.And now that you have read through the starters, lets take a minute to talk about the bhindi, shall we? The Bendakaya Pulusu is hands down the best bhindi with tamarind curry combination I have had so far. The tamarind based gravy has the typical Indian curry texture with the sourness of the tamarind and tomatoes. And the ladies finger pieces soaks in the spicy tamarind curry flavours and makes for a delicious bite with naan. Save butter garlic naan for the non vegetarian curry, Id say.The Murgh Musallam, a Mughlai style chicken curry in the restaurant is rich and creamy. The onion based gravy underplays the spice tadka in the dish and tastes buttery instead. No complaints though.The aromatic Mutton Rogan Josh has rich Kashmiri flavours with delicate lamb chunks. The Chicken Biriyani came in as a colourful ensemble of rice cooked well, but was served cold. The Dal Makhani on the other hand was another star on the dinner table.The red kidney beans and black gram cooked with plenty of butter and spices was really smooth, creamy on the palate and yes, I asked for a second serving of this delicious Punjabi dal that stuck true to its roots.The cheesecake served with a side of blueberries sauce has balanced flavours of cream and cheese and has a chocolate chunk topping that adds crunch to the dessert.Place: Nook - Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, BellandurCost for two: `2000"
5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

The great Green Revolution actually created a Grain Revolution at the expense of the greens we consumed. Except for the Northeastern states, average Indian plate is now at least half grains and at the max, a quarter greens whereas the diabetes associations recommended plate is at least half greens and only a quarter grains.Dr Aseem Malhotra, Cardiologist and author of Pioppi Diet makes a strong case in his book on how health services across the world can save trillions of dollars if doctors recommend the low-grain-high-green plate of the people of Pioppi, Italy, where the average lifespan is 89 years and many live beyond 100. Just like Kerala, Pioppi is tucked between the coast and the Mediterranean hills and the vegetation is rich in green vegetables and olives like green fruits and coconuts for Kerala.In order for India to reverse its alarming rate of growth in diabetes, we need a Greener Revolution from our young agro-entrepreneurs by significantly increasing the yield of green fruits and leafy vegetables like Swaminathan and his team did with grains. This requires breakthrough startup ideas in agriculture production, harvesting tools and food processing technologies so that greens can arrive on our plate as affordable and convenient to eat as grains.We shouldnt leave this 73 billion dollar market opportunity to medicines and to the likes of quinoa from South America or oats from Australia. If the Green Revolution began from the plains of Punjab, the ideal place to start the Greener Revolution is from the Western Ghats of Kerala, which is now known only for the struggling rubber and tea plantations, once rich with leafy vegetables and fruit like jackfruit, banana, papaya, guava, etc.(Founder, Jackfruit365.com)"
5a0edfdd9855b76bf13d496f,‘Climate change may reduce rice output in Punjab’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/climate-change-may-reduce-rice-output-in-punjab/articleshow/60065923.cms,2017-08-15,"CHANDIGARH: While the global climate change is expected to reduce production of rice in Punjab and Haryana, at the same time it is likely to increase potato output in the two states. The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

He added that pertinently, these employees had been allegedly resorting to misappropriation or pilferage by taking out from 30kg bags and filling the same in 50kg bags. ""The wheat was also being made to gain moisture/weight by spraying water on it,"" the statement added.The spokesperson said the Department of Food, Civil Supplies, and Consumer Affairs had always shown zero tolerance to any kind of pilferage or misappropriation of foodgrains at any stage. He added that the department had already taken similar action in such cases earlier also in Amritsar district, where four assistant food and supply officers (AFSOs) and 14 inspectors were placed under suspension, and disciplinary action initiated against 22 officials, including deputy director, Food and Civil Supplies, (now reverted to DFSC rank).He further said: ""Likewise, at various centres of Tarn Taran, the wheat stored in open plinths during 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13 had got damaged. Holding the officers/officials responsible regarding which orders were issued to chargesheet 18 officials/employees for the loss similarly at Samana Centre in Patiala, an inquiry was conducted by joint director-cum-CVC, where the shortage in wheat stock was reported. Consequently, orders were issued to lodge an FIR against delinquent employees, namely inspector Jaspreet Singh Gill, Harvarinder Singh, Jaswinder Kumar, Rajwinder Singh, and Rahul Kumar.""""All these inspectors have been charge-sheeted after placing their services under suspension. Continuing its crackdown on such fraudulent and unscrupulous employees, the department, in another complaint case, has also suspended and charge-sheeted an inspector and the AFSO concerned for irregularities in distribution of wheat under PDS in Barnala district,"" added the spokesperson, saying the state government was committed to bringing these cases to a logical conclusion and recovering the financial loss caused due to such misconduct by delinquent officials."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Aug. 26: What Onam is to the people of Kerala, Pongal to Tamils and Baisakhi to Punjabis, Nuakhai or Navarna is to the people of west Odisha. Nuakhai, the annual harvest festival, started with Brahman Mahasabha by serving the first crop of the harvest to goddess Samaleswari, the presiding deity of west Odisha. Then the Deheris (those designated to announce the beginning of the festival) made an announcement about the exact time to eat the Nua dhan (new crop) for lunch. Thousand of devotees thronged the temple of Maa Samaleswari in Sambalpur and other west Odisha districts to see the deity in her special attire on the occasion of Nuakhai. The first harvested crop was offered to the goddess at the stipulated time between 9.05am to 9.15am. The priests of the temple commenced the ceremony in the morning according to the prevailing tradition and ritual. Goddess Samaleswari was adorned with a new sari and ornaments. Adequate arrangement was made by the managing committee of the temple trust as a large number of people gathered at the temple to seek the blessing of the goddess. The festival was observed at many homes with the heads of the families distributing the new crop to the family members. After having the lunch together, the younger members of the family took blessings from the elders. ""With time, the relevance the festival changed as people nowadays are celebrating it in an improvised manner,"" said Ronak Pati, a resident of Sambalpur. ""It's a festival where everyone gathers at one place and eat the Nua dhan together, but things have changed now. The festival has gone beyond the boundary. It is not limited in west Odisha only. People from our area are celebrating the festival at various parts of the world,"" The farmers offered the first crop of the year to the household deity on this occasion. The head of the family worshiped the household deity and offered rice and other food items. ""The festival is a cohesive force which unites people together. It is a symbol of friendship, love and affection, which provide a foundation to lead a peaceful life,"" said a city-based writer Deepak Panda. The Koshal Co-ordinating Committee of Bargarh promotes the traditional form of the festival. Organiser of the event Sunil Purohit said that they had been trying to bring the real essence of the festival before the people. Another committee at Khajurtikra School in Bargarh, that has been observing the festival for the past 30 years, organised cultural events. ""The aim of the event is bring people together to enjoy the festival with traditional dance and music,"" said Niranjan Pattnaik, a member of the committee."
5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

A swarm of insects from the Food Corporation of India (FCI)storage depot takes over the area, making life difficult.For two months, residents of several streets in Pattabiram have been grappling with the problem of bugs. Pedestrians and motorists struggle to negotiate these roads with these insects flying into their eyes.Areas such as Bharathiyar Nagar, Deenadayalan Nagar, Kakkanji Nagar and Thiruvalluvar Nagar, located within a two-km radius of the FCI depot are the worst affected, the residents said.All-pervasive problemJ. Jayakumar, general secretary Bharathiyar Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said, If we dont close doors and windows during evenings, these insects get into our homes, fall in food, drinking water and clothes. Children are unable to study as the pests occupy every corner. Despite spraying disinfectants , it has not helped to get rid of them , he added. Residents said the problem worsened between July and September as it was the breeding season for the pests. They complained that fumigation measures were not carried properly for pest control.T. Sadagopan, president of Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumer Centre, said that nearly 15 localities in Pattabiram faced the problem every year for over a decade now. A public interest litigation was already pending in the Madras High Court on the the issue for several years now. We have already made representations on the issue to the FCI authorities. We plan to file a petition to expedite the hearing, he said.Spread over 86 acres, the FCI storage depot in Pattabiram stored nearly 1.40 lakh tonnes of rice procured from other States like Punjab and Andhra Pradesh.Officials of the FCI said that nearly 100 workers were engaged in fumigation and spraying drive to control infestation of rice weevil. We are only storing rice grains here. It is from here that fair price shops in Chennai and Tiruvallur get their stock for PDS. We are taking steps to control the insects, an official said."

In 2001, some poor and marginalised women of the village produced mudhi and marketed it though a self-help group (SHG) Mayurbhanj Mudhi Association (MMA).Around 130 women from the locality joined the association and have made puffed rice business lucrative. Their success story has inspired several others in the nearby villages. Now, around 80 to 90 quintals of mudhi are being produced every month.Some farmers even cultivate rice to meet the demand for mudhi. Price of mudhi per bag has been increased from `140 to `150, said Anup Kumar Behera, who has been volunteering to monitor the SHGs operation. He said the rural market is consuming approximately 60 per cent of the produce while the rest are exported to other towns and States.MMA secretary Kabita Behera said the cooperative has been following several strategies for strengthening its market linkage. Apart from selling it in the weekly market, the bloated rice is being exported to West Bengal, Jharkhand, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Mumbai, she added.With the support of the district administration and NGOs, they displayed the famous Baripada mudhi during State and National level exhibitions and trade festivals. Though the SHG is running with a small workshop at Sangrami Mahila Mandal, it is has no adequate space to cater to the needs of their business. Earlier, they had urged a former collector to provide a government building for smooth functioning of the association. But so far, no action has been taken in this regard."

There is opposition to the move from state farmers, and the mandi board is at the centre of it, because it manages procurement of grains and other produce through a network of 1,700 mandis.The corresponding levy is lower in states such as Rajasthan (1.6%) , Uttar Pradesh (2.4%), and Madhya Pradesh (0.2%).One of the options on the mandi boards mind is to hike the fee only for the dominant crops, wheat and paddy. We will implement the governments decision, but we will see that farmers interests are not harmed, said the boards chairman, former Congress minister Lal Singh. In the board meeting of October 11, we will decide whether to implement the hike on all crops or just wheat and paddy.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said the enhancement is unjustified because, though the fees are levied on the purchaser of the farmers produce, the burden actually falls on the farmers. He added, This will lead to increase in the costs and dissuades traders from buying from the state, he said.The funds collected as fees go to the Punjab Rural Development Board for infrastructure, including link roads, which, the government argues, is for the benefit of the farmers.However, with the cotton crop ready, farmers in south-west Punjab prefer to take it to mandis of Sri Ganganagar (Rajasthan) and Dabwali (Haryana), where the levies are lower. Next, basmati growers are worried and already demanding a rollback as the crop is set to arrive in mandis by the end of October.The Punjab Basmati Rice Millers Association has said that said big mills set up under the mega project category have been exempted from the market fee, so the business will shift to those. In 2013, the government had abolished both the fees on purchase of basmati, but it was levied again in 2015.Wheat and paddy produce are bought mostly by state agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on behalf of the Centre, while other crops are primarily procured by traders."

As per his suicide note, Kamaldeep had allegedly taken his life after being harassed and intimated by certain officials in a case of alleged misappropriation of paddy during kharif season 2016-17 by Sardar Agro Industries in Sadatpur village in Malerkotla . The CM has also ordered an inquiry against Iqbal for interfering in the registration of a criminal case against the miller on reference of the PUNSUP district manager at Tarn Taran.He has also directed the DGP to look into the circumstances leading up to the suicide. A spokesperson at the chief minister's office said the CM also gave a go ahead for registration of a criminal case against the proprietor of Sardar Agro, who had already confessed to embezzling paddy worth nearly Rs. 2.5 crore.Amarinder also directed the secretary of the Mandi Board to immediately suspend licenses of arthias (commission agents) at Kairon, Khemkaran and Sabran Mandis of Tarn Taran district for conspiring with the proprietor to embezzle paddy lifted under the release order scheme. Based on the statement of Kamaldeep and in view of his failure to monitor the movement of paddy and delivery of corresponding quantity of rice to the FCI, the chief minister ordered disciplinary action against DFSC Sangrur Manjit Singh."

He also promised revival of sick rice milling units to be taken up on priority by the state government.Reiterating his governments commitment to early redress of problems faced by the industry, Amarinder said that a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme was recently announced to provide an opportunity to all defaulter rice millers to clear their past dues. Around 1,500 of the total 3,500 defaulting and sick milling units would benefit by the scheme, he said, adding that this was one of the several measures initiated to bring the industry back on the path of progress.Responding to a demand from the rice millers, Amarinder said he would take up the issue of bardana (gunny bags) use and transportation charges with the central government next week at his meeting with Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. On the issue of millers in surplus paddy districts being given more paddy at a rate of 140% of their original entitlement, he assured that no miller would be forced to mill paddy beyond his capacity and only those willing to mill extra paddy would be considered.Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh blamed the previous SAD-BJP government for the mess in the industry, saying the Akalis and BJP had plundered the state, leaving it under a massive debt burden of 2.08 lakh crore. He promised to act as a bridge between the milling community and the government to resolve any issues of concern."

The machine allows sowing of wheat in fields that still have rice stubble. The department had organised 2,540 awareness camps till mid-September to discourage farmers from burning stubble.According to Punjab agriculture director J S Bains and joint director Manmohan Kalia , the nodal officer to check stubble burning, Rs 15 crore had been released to provide farmers with subsidised agriculture equipment. Last year, the amount was Rs 20.23 crore.The agriculture department has decided to make a mobile phone app with the assistance of Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, to encourage the use of all equipment to their full capacity, and allow easy access to farmers not owning machinery, they said.The primary agriculture co-operative societies (PACS) would provide crop-residue management machinery free of cost to 20% of small and marginal farmers. Also, the state government has set up a 'Green Challenge Fund' of Rs 5 crore for promoting alternative uses of paddy straw. This award will be given to anyone who can come up with an economically viable solution for decomposing biomass.Farm machinery banks for residue management are being set up in the state, for which Rs 1.90 crore has been released. There are 28 such banks."
5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

The market fee and RDF now has been increased to 3% each.Basmati varieties -- Pusa 1121, Pusa 1509, 1401, Sunanghi and Sharbati -- have been sown in over 4.51 lakh hectares in the state this season.Millers said nearly 20 lakh tonnes basmati was expected to reach mandis and at an average price of Rs 3,000 per quintal, the crop would fetch nearly Rs 6,000 crore.They said with the increase in fees, millers have to pay approximately Rs 120 crore more in taxes and would be forced to realise the money from the farmers.PBRMA president Bal Krishan and general secretary Aashish Kathuria said, ""Punjab government has meted out injustice with basmati millers and farmers by increasing market fee and RDF fee. In neighbouring Haryana, millers have to pay 2% each as market fee and RDF fee and in Rajasthan there is only 1.6% market fee and no RDF.

With Rs 100 price hike every day, farmers are earning Rs 65,000-Rs 70,000 per acre, said Rajesh Kamboj, a farmer from Radaur in Yamunanagar district.Raj Kumar, a farmer from Ladwa of the district, said, We have Pusa 1509 variety and the prices are good this year. This will help us pay the debts as we did not see any hike in the prices of paddy since 2013.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.As the prices of basmati varieties generally depend on the demand outside the country, it is for the first time since 2103 the prices have crossed the Rs 3,000 per quintal mark in the beginning of the procurement season. It may even rise further and the lateral variety of desi basmati (Taraori) may cross the Rs 4,000 per quintal mark, said Sohan Lal of Shri Ram Trading Company in Kurukshetra.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.Even as several high-yielding paddy varieties are sown in the region, the farmers says that Pusa 1509 is considered the best because it is the only basmati variety which takes 90 days to mature, a month less than the other long-grained varieties. In this case, the farmers get an extra month to sow other crops like mustard and winter vegetables.What caused price riseSome people claimed that the basmati prices have increased following a demand in the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the European Union.Rice exporters, however, are of the opinion that the prices have jumped after a tax exemption on paddy and rice following implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST).Talking to HT, former president and governing body member of all India Rice Exporters Association Vijay Setia said there is no additional demand this time and it is the 5 per cent tax exemption before the GST that caused the rise. New traders had invested in the rice industry when demonetisation took place and they will make profit in the next few months, he said.But the increase in prices is not stable and nobody can predict what will be price of the basmati next year. The overall acreage under Basmati has dipped by 10 per cent in Haryana, he said.Haryanas share in basmati exportAs per the All India Rice Exporters Association, Haryana and Punjab each have 40 per cent share in the total 40 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of basmati export from the country. Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts make a significant contribution to the states 16 lakh MT basmati production."

5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

Overweight and in her final days  her poor health showing in her greasy complexion  Bhatura always blurted out the truth, unlike her sly niece Poori.Nonsense! snorted Bhakri, who wasnt sure if she was from Gujarat or Maharashtra. By that token I should have gotten a GST break too.Well, we didnt make the cut because we are not long-lasting and cannot be vacuum packed. Besides, they said Khakhra is healthy because he is baked, sniffed Thepla and Dhebra, Khakhras oily cousins who were frequently mistaken for Tibetans or Nepalese because of their names.Well then, what about me? I can be vacuum packed and there is an election coming up in my state too, piped up Papad, who claimed he was from neighboring Rajasthan although his ancestors were said to be Sindhi. The clan had emigrated across the world, including to Southern India, where their cousins were called Appalams, and even to England, where they spoke in a British accent and were called Poppadoms.Well, strictly speaking, you are not a bread, declared Naan.Youre fried! yelled a steamed up Dhokla, Khakhras distant cousin.Youre fired! shouted Dhoklas sister Khandvi, rolling up her sleeve.Yeah. If you are a bread so am I, jeered Ffaffda, who had snuck into the meeting to spy on proceedings and report to Amitbhai, hoping he would be given a GST break too. Although he was a Gujarati, Ffaffda had added couple extra Fs to his name and pretended he was German to gain entry.We are simple breads, so no one cares for us, whined Chapatti, who was with her son Phulka. Everyone is buttering up to Naan because he is rich and fair-complexioned.Yeah. Tell me about it! snapped Roti, still bitter after his ouster from the throne of Breaddom. Roti believed Naan was an interloper who belonged to the Khubbuz Dynasty in the Middle-East, and had no business thriving in Bharatvarsh. There were also rumors that he had some Pita blood in him.For that matter, Roti also suspected Khakhra himself came from a Baloch ancestor named Kaak and his wife Sajji, but this was not a time to make such awkward disclosures.While all this was happening, the delegation from Southern India, led by Masala Dosa, had maintained a dignified silence. But Appam, who had been stewing quietly, could not contain herself anymore.This is zimbly unacceptabull, she said in thick Malayali accent. Why Gujju named kakra getting szbeshal dreatmend?Yes, why wonly cocra and not us? chimed Pesarattu, from Andhra, and his fat cousin Uthappam, from Tamil Nadu.Why? Why? Why? asked soft, light, and fluffly Idli, bouncing around excitedly. Idli, who wasnt sure which Southern state he was from, had a mind like a devils workshop. He believed he was a Brahmin, and therefore deserved special treatment. I am fair toofairer than Khakhra or Naan! he trilled.Well, as they explained we are not long-lasting and cant be vacuum packed. We are also from the Rice Gotra, not the favored Wheat Gotra, sighed Masala Dosa. Besides, there is no election in our states.Of course there is we too have an election coming up in 2018, snapped Kori Roti, who was from Coastal Karnataka, and was hoping that hed get the same treatment as Khakhra since he was also healthy, long-lasting, and could be vacuum-packed. Several members of the Karnataka delegation, including Neer Dosa, Jowar Roti, and Thalipeetu were also camping in Delhi to lobby over GST issues.Sweet! whispered Puran Poli and Holige, cousins from Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively, who felt they too deserved a GST break. Although they were not really healthy and were more perishable than Khakhra, they hoped Amitbhai would consider their sweet nature, particularly since Karnataka could go to the polls in 2018 and Maharashtra in 2019.From inside the oven across the kitchen table, Pizza surveyed the scene as he lip-read the conversation, (feeling like HAL in 2001 Space Odyssey). Bulked up with cheese, chicken and other toppings, he considered himself the Father of All Breads now. As far as he was concerned, desi breads and their sides were passe. Damn fools! he thought to himself as he flexed his muscles and did a few more push-ups. They can scrap over GST while I conquer Indiaits witless elites are sold on me."

On of the best part about Diwali is food. Aromas of the lip-smacking gulab jamuns, jalebee and malpuas breeze through almost every home. Each community in chennai has its traditional set of sweets and snacks which they make during this festive occasion. Most recipes are guarded like family heirlooms and passed on from one generation to next. And the unwritten rule dictates that ingredients, portions and taste have to remain the same every Diwali! Thushara Ann Mathew brings you a taste of how Chennai celebrates Diwali.BengaliNeela Ganguly Sundaram, Cooking enthusiastOne sweet that is specially made for Diwali for Bengalis is the famous Malpua  a delicacy that is made with rice flour and milk; and in snacks it is Nimki  a triangle or diamond-shaped snack made out of maida, ghee, jeera, etc. Diwali is the time to munch on sweets and snacks. We also make other delicacies such as payesh and sandesh. I make them every year. Although I do not do it as a business, I do make them for friends and others because I want people to know more about such Bengali delicacies. People give me really positive feedback. The recipes have been passed on to me by my mother and grandmother, and although the quality and taste remains the same, today we tend to add some extra ingredients to enhance the taste. The malpua that my grandmother made used to be white in colour, but since we add khoa to it these days, it comes out in a yellow shade, but the taste remains the same. These days we garnish it with almonds or pistachio, etc.MalpuaMilk: 1 litre, Plain Flour: 100 gramsSemolina: 2-3 spoons, Fennel Seeds: 2-3 spoonsGhee, Oil, Dry fruits: for ganrishBoil the milk and condense it to half the quantity, cool it for a bit. Mix the plain flour and semolina into this and blend it well into a proper consistency. Now add the powdered fennel seeds into this mixture and stir till there are no lumps. Keep aside for 10-15 minutes.Take a flat pan, mix a bit of oil and ghee in half proportion each and heat it well. Take a small-cupped ladle and take one scoop of the batter and cook both the sides until golden colour.Prepare a syrup of sugar with a bit of cardamom and saffron.Once the malpuas are made, put in the sugar syrup for a while and serve it with dry fruits garnished over it.RajasthaniVineeta Jatia, Spoonful CateringRajasthani food is supposed to be extremely rich in flavour and taste. And on a festive occasion such as Diwali, the level of richness just increases, as it is a part of the tradition that we are supposed to eat good and really rich food on this day. Traditional Rajasthani sweets and savouries that are prepared on this day include besan laddoo, gond ka laddoo, shakkar para, mathri/ suhali, etc. During the festival we mainly have three days of puja, what we call as Dhanteras, Roopchaudar and Badi Diwali. We even worship Lord Yama, Ganesha and Lakshmi, along with worshipping Ram. Some of the snacks and sweets are kept aside for the Gods as an offering on this day. Like I mentioned earlier, Rajasthani food is quite heavy and usually doesnt suit Chennais climatic conditions. But we cannot have a Diwali without these delicacies, and since most of the ingredients are easily available here, it becomes easier to make it as well.Besan ladduFlour: 2 cups gramGhee:  cupSugar:  porousCardamom powder:  tspAlmonds and pistachio for garnishRoast the gram flour in a pan by adding little ghee for about 30 minutes. To this mix, add the porous sugar. You can add few small pieces of almond into it(optional). Cool the mix for a bit and make small balls out of it. Garnish with pistachio/almonds or even kesar.Kumbakonam Tamil BrahminR Prabhuram and Kala Jagannathan, Svadishta FoodsThe main sweets and savouries that we make and sell for Diwali are rava laddu, badusha, jhangri, boondhi laddu, gulab jamun, kara sev, mixture, ribbon and omapodi. Traditionally we also prepare a special Diwali leghyam (Diwali medicine), a day before Diwali, with all the herbs  this helps in balancing the excess food that we tend to consume during such festivals and also avoids any stomach uneasiness. Although the above mentioned are the traditional sweets and savouries that are prepared for Diwali, the trend keeps changing according to demand. Today, people prefer to eat other sweets such as Mysore pak, kaju katli and other cashew and milk based varieties as well. We prepare traditional Kumbakonam Brahmin style food and stick to our authentic recipes for all the delicacies, which have been passed on from generations.Rava LadduRoasted rava (sooji):  Kg,Powdered sugar:  KgGhee:  Kg,Broken Cashews: 100 gms.Cardamon powder: 2 pinchesRoast the rava and make a fine powder. Into this, add the powdered sugar and cardamon powder. Roast Cashews until light brown and add to the powder mixture. In a pan, melt the ghee for few minutes and pour this into the powder and mix well. Make the laddus before the mixture cools.GujaratiParul Bhatt, authoring a cookbookDiwali is the most important festival for Gujaratis and our celebrations last for five days. I make traditional sweets and savouries every year which sweets include delicacies like ghughra, Magas and sweet sakkarpara, and the savouries include poha chevada or mixture,7 pad Farsi puri, methiya,chorafali etc. The five-day long festival includes  Dhanteras, Kalichaudash, Chopada Poojan, Govardhan Pooja and Bhaibeej. And each day includes a set of worship and we also make sweets like sooji halwa to give as an offering to the god. I have been cooking for several years now and distributing the same with friends and family. Most recipes have been taught by my grandmother and mother. So I am particular about the authenticity of the recipes, as that is exactly where the taste lies.MagasBesan(chickpea flour): 3 cupsMilk: 2 table spoon, Ghee:  cupSugar: 1 cup, Cardamom: 4, powderedAlmond and pistachio: 10 each (soaked, peeled and cut into long strips)Warm the milk and add two teaspoons of ghee in it. Add the chickpea flour and milk and mix well. Let it rest for 20 minutes, before sieving it well and ensuring there are no lumps. Heat some ghee in a heavy bottom broad pan, to this add the flour and keep stirring. Cook on low heat,till pink and then take the pan off the gas. Let it cool and add sugar, cardamom powder, almonds and pistachio and make small balls/laddus out of it.KannadigasPavithra Lakshmanan, PR professionalWe make traditional Kannada sweets and snacks based on demand, and that seems to be more especially during Diwali. The traditional sweets have a background story. We make Somasi (that resembles Lord Krishnans Shanka  shell) and Chakli, a savoury that resembles Chakra. So it is believed that Lord Krishna used these as the weapons to kill the demon Naragasura. We also make the Kanadigas go-to dish Obatu (sweet poli) and Hayagrivamidi. We have not deviated from the traditional recipe as it simplest wont taste the same. Also in a way it is remembering our lineage Every Diwali, my mother makes the same sweets besides the other fancy ones (like badam halwa). She has so many stories about cooking with fire wood during her childhood days. I guess that is the only thing that has changed in todays scenario.SomasiMaida: 1/2 cup, Roasted rava: 1/2 cupBaking Soda: a pinh, Ghee: 2 spoonsSugar: 1 cup, Fried gram: 1 cupGrated desicated coconut (kopparai):  cupDry fruits, Cardamom powder: to tasteMix maida and rava with a pinch of baking soda and ghee. Make a dough and keep side for two hours. Prepare the filling powdered pottukadalai and sugar. To this add the grated coconut and mix well. Add fried cashew, raisins and grated almond. Finally add some cardamom powder, mix well and keep side.Take a lemon size ball of the dough roll into thin puris, put a spoonful of the powder and fold to half to get a semi circle. Seal the edges tightly with little water, and cut the edges with a somasi cutter so that it looks like a semi circle.Heat oil in a kadai, and fry the somasi one by one, till golden brown. Arrange them in a plate and sprinkle some powdered sugar on top.PunjabiSurbhi Vohra, Food enthusiastPunjabi cuisine, like we all know is heavy on ghee and butter. And all the ingredients we use are in its purest form. For Diwali, we prepare sweets like red gajar ka halwa, rice kheer, besan ke laddu, gulab jaamun, pinni (a sweet made out of wheat, dry fruits, ghee,etc) and savouries like mathri and also food items like chole bathure and rajma chawal is a staple in most Punjabi houses, during the festive season. We also have a tradition of buying silver coins every year on Diwali and we clean it on the day of Lakshmi puja with milk and water. Apart from this, we also make a special delicacy called as charnamrith  which is made out of milk, curd, honey, sugar, rose petals,etc and we add the new silver coin into it as well. After the puja is performed, this is then served to everybody. Although I make Diwali special sweets and savouries for people, I miss the flavours of the ingredients I get back home in Punjab. Especially, while making the gajar ka halwa, we dont get the red, long carrots here, like we get back home, and that really makes a difference in the taste and flavouring of the sweet.Red gajarka halwaRed carrot: grated 1 kgMilk: 2 kg, Sugar: 1 kgCream of milk:according to tasteGhee:for garnish and fryingDry fruits: for garnishIn a pan, fry the grated carrot in little ghee. Now pour the milk into the grated carrot and mix well. Add some of the cream/malai into it. Stir well, till the milk is reduced and the mix becomes thick. Keep stirring as you add the sugar into it. Stir and put 2 spoons of ghee just for the flavouring. Garnish with dry fruits like cashews and raisin."

Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

What is adding to their woes is the state governments failure to ensure that their paddy produce is procured from their villages. The poor farmer is harassed all across the district as the designated authorities or officials that are to purchase their crop remains absent from duty.With no government official from any of the five procurement agencies there to supervise the process, private rice millers have a field day.This HT reporter travelled to two villages, Makha Chehlan and Anoopgarh, to find 500 farmers here, complaining bitterly about the state government.The designated purchase inspector for the two villages and the Bhikhi town, a person named Ravi, from the Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Limited (PAICL), has been irregular, farmers claimed.To escape fleecing, farmers travelling to urban marketThe rice miller harasses us and demands extra bags of rice from us to purchase our crop. The purchase inspector remains away from the grain markets and in his absence we are tortured in the name of measuring moisture content in our produce, said Jiwan Singh from Anoopgarh village.Many other farmers second him. Other farmers alleged that to escape the money lenders and sell their produce, they travel to grain markets in the urban areas of the district, where they get better price.This, however, entails extra expense as from these villages, the urban markets entail a to-and-fro travel of at least 50-km.For a farmer, this is like choosing between a rock and a hard place.From our field, we have to travel to the grain markets and from there we have to hire another vehicle to reach the grain market in cities. Braving accident, security and other issues, we travel to the grain market risking everything, said another farmer while loading his grain onto the tractor.Farmers claimed that one such trip with the cost of overnight stay usually costs them Rs 5,000.High moisture content in the paddy crop has also added to the worries of farmers.The permissible moisture content is around 17 units but the rice millers return our produce raising the issue of high moisture despite this being approved by the purchasing inspector of the food procurement agencies, said Amarjeet Singh from Makha Chehlan village.District president of BKU (Ugrahan) Ram Singh met the DC and raised the issue of harassment meted out to farmers. We discussed as how the purchasing inspector and private rice millers are hand-in-glove harassing and stalling the lifting of paddy from grain markets in rural areas, said Ram.When contacted, PAICL manager Balwinder Pal Singh rubbished the claim that farmers were harassed and instead commended the lifting procedure being supervised by the agency. Our purchase inspector has been supervising all the grain markets allotted to our agency and we have not allowed private millers to harass farmers."
5a149e2c9855b76bf13e62a3,Surface ozone is damaging wheat and rice crops across the country: Study,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surface-ozone-is-damaging-wheat-and-rice-crops-across-the-country-study/story-ATrw25PIoFHlYeQsqG7YDJ.html,2017-10-31,"Surface ozone, a plant-damaging pollutant could be destroying up to 15% wheat crop and up to 6% rice yield every year across India, a first-of-its kind study based on ground observations of ozone, has revealed.A multi-institute study comprising 14 scientists and led by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, under the Department of Space, has estimated that every year, surface ozone is likely to wipe out 4.014.2 million tonnes (MT) of the total 95 MT of wheat produced in India, and 0.36.7 MT of the total 105 MT rice grown.Surface ozone  also called a secondary pollutant  is generated through chemical reactions between primary pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight. The sources of these primary pollutants are power plants, vehicles, industries, and bio-mass burning.With a projected rise in man-made pollution including surface ozone, researchers said the findings are important since a decrease in crop yield in India, which is the second populous country, will have a serious impact on its food security and economic growth.Wheat and rice are important crops for India since they form a staple diet, said professor Shyam Lal, principal investigator, PRL. Photosynthesis takes place during the day. When ozone molecules, which are generated in the presence of sunlight, get into the plant cells, the plant gets affected and can get damaged.Previous studies have calculated the annual loss of wheat crop in the range of 5% to 30%, and between 2.1% and 16 % for rice yields. However, these high estimates were based on either limited observations  restricted to some states only  or regional and global chemistry transport models.Ozone is a very new phenomenon in India now, and ozone levels are rising. The findings are important, as we now know from different sources of the impact of surface ozone on vegetation and crops, in addition to health. This means that pollution is ultimately reaching food security, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, who was not involved in the study. Ozone reduction strategies have to become an important policy focus now.The present study, drawn from data on surface ozone recorded at 17 locations across India, has found that general pattern of ozone variability shows higher ozone in AprilMay, lower in August and again increasing in October November.This is because high pollution levels and strong sunlight especially between March and May results in high levels of surface ozone damaging crops. Low surface ozone levels recorded during winter months when pollution levels are high but sunlight is low will either not damage crops or the loss is less.Though there is a permissible human exposure level for surface ozone set by the Central Pollution Control Board, there are no safe levels prescribed for plants.For the study, researchers used two internationally adopted methods to assess the exposure of crops to surface ozone  average ozone levels for seven hours during the day for three-month cropping period and second, accumulated ozone levels that exceed 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) over the same period.[S2] In the present study, exposure to wheat in the north and west-central regions of India crossed the average surface ozone 40 ppbv threshold between January and March. The North Indian region includes Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, while west-central regions comprise Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Average ozone levels during the wheat crop duration of three months were highest in the west/central region at about 47 ppbv followed by north India at about 41 ppbv. The corresponding accumulated ozone levels recorded in the west was 16,300 ppbv*hr and it was about 7,200 ppbv*hr in the north. However, a major part of the wheat crop is grown in north India only.The damage to rice though lower was also pronounced in northern and western-central parts of the country. The seasonal average ozone levels in the north and west-central were 33 ppbv and 27 ppbv  and the corresponding accumulated ozone levels in both these regions were 4730 ppbv*hr and 3400 ppbv*hr.Researchers said as compared to wheat, crop loss for rice is less because surface ozone levels are lower as the main harvesting period is soon after the summer monsoon. Also average surface ozone levels are lower in the eastern and southern regions of India where large quantity of rice is grown.India has two cropping seasons  Kharif and Rabi. Sowing for rice, a kharif crop, takes place between June and July, and its harvested from September to October. Wheat is a rabi crop that is sown between November and December, and harvested from February to April.North India logged the highest annual loss of about 9 MT of wheat. For rice, the maximum loss of about 2.6 MT every year was recorded from the countrys eastern region of Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Assam, and Jharkhand.With pollution levels set to rise further including levels of surface ozone, international studies have predicted higher losses for wheat and rice for India by 2030.Ozone is a very reactive gas, and while it is very harmful for health it also has a huge impact on vegetation. Ozone will increase if emissions of gases from combustion of sources such as vehicles and industries increase. If you have to control ozone, then need to control emissions from nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, said Roychowdhury.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that wheat, 73% of which is cultivated in north India alone, should be sown as early as possible starting November so that it is grown in the period when ozone is relatively lower.Wheat and rice cultivars, which have resistance to ozone damage, need to be developed. We would like to suggest policy makers to work out plans to reduce air pollution, particularly in the northern India. This will take care not only of the losses of the crops but also health of the public, read the study.."

They (millers) say that it is due to liquidity crunch. Though some rice sellers have taken its (OTS) benefit,"" said K A P Sinha , principal secretary in the department of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs. He added that as per the clause put in the custom milling policy, ""along with the persons, rice sellers will also be treated defaulters.""Addressing the media here, Sinha said this year the state government is expecting procurement of 182 lakh tonne paddy by December 15, which is an all-time high. He said last year, a total of 168 lakh tonne paddy was procured by various agencies in the state. Till October 29, procurement agencies and millers have procured over 123 lakh tonnes paddy as compared to 121 lakh tonnes last year in the corresponding period.""We have got Rs 28,000 crore cash credit limit (CCL) sanctioned on October 5 this year, which is in time. We are ensuring payment to farmers within 24 hours,"" said Sinha.He added that this CCL is valid till the end of October and the state government has asked for more CCL to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India. Sinha said because of the good weather this season, procurement agencies have been receiving the paddy within the 17% prescribed moisture content limit.Answering a question, Sinha said that payment of provident fund to the labourers is a statutory responsibility of the arhtiyas which they cannot escape.He also informed that prices of basmati rice are fluctuating but the market is good and rice millers are purchasing it.Sinha added that the state government has flagged the issue to settle around Rs 31,000 crore debt incurred for foodgrain procurement during the previous government. ""This includes Rs 12,000 crore principal amount and over Rs 18,000 crore interest. The chief minister had taken up the issued with the Prime Minister. We have sent the reports demanded from us by the Centre,"" said Sinha.He said the government had paid Rs 16,000 crore to the farmers for paddy so far."

He decided to propagate this variety. Initially, it was on just one cent of land, but later, it was expanded to one hectare. Mr. Kumar has been conserving the Krishna Kamod, a basmati rice variety from Gujarat known for its taste, colour and aroma on one hectare for the past seven years.Last year, he harvested nearly 2,500 kg of this paddy and sold it as seeds to farmers at Rs. 200 a kg, rather than in the open market.While farmers procure the rare rice variety as seed, others buy it as a gift, or keep it in their pooja rooms and offer it to temples, Mr. Kumar said.Fights drought, pestsHe spent Rs. 85,000 as costs and earned Rs. 5 lakh. The Agriculture Department, which finds the rice attractive, chipped in with Rs. 18,000 as incentive.It seems quite suitable for Kerala and its pest and drought resistance are plus points, said M.K. Mariyumma, Agricultural Officer, Krishi Bhavan, Nenmeni. Many farmers coming under Krishi Bhavan are eager to cultivate it.The farmer has become famous for growing 15 varieties of rice. These include Mahamaya, a hybrid with an average yield of 4.3 tonnes an acre, Ramli, a traditional Punjab rice, Navara and Rakthashali, with medicinal properties, Black Jasmine, a violet medicinal Assamese type, two basmati variants from Jammu and Kashmir, besides Valichoori and Adukkan, both indigenous varieties.Mr. Kumar is looking at rented land now, to grow even more."
5a5333b09855b770e037e1fd,Demonetisation and Tughlaq Modi,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/641638/demonetisation-tughlaq-modi.html,2017-11-08,"DH News Service, Bengaluru, Nov 8 2017, 19:40 ISTGauri Lankesh, the Kannada journalist gunned down on September 5, had responded to the note ban with a special edition of her weekly magazine and this editorial. PM Modi demonetised Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8, 2016.Narendra Modi has revealed his Tughlaq face. Claiming to wage war against black money, he has gone to war against the middle class and the poor, who constitute a majority. By demonetising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes, he has mocked them as cheats and dubbed as thugs people without a morsel to eat. This special edition looks at many aspects of his demonetisation madness.Bizarre stories made the rounds on social media last week. Some claimed the new Rs 2,000 note would have a nano chip to enable the government to monitor how the money was being spent. The income tax authorities, or so the stories said, would use satellites to locate and raid those hoarding new notes. The stories claimed the notes could be tracked even if they were buried 120 metres below the earth. Zee News in Hindi and a Kannada channel zealously put out imaginary stories. One of the anchors was bouncing up and down in delight like the pontiff of the Pejawar math. The woman presenter who seconds him went to the extent of proclaiming the note featured a picture of the Mars mission to indicate how satellites would keep an eye on the currency.The stories spread like wildfire. Last week, when I boarded a train to Hubballi, all my fellow passengers were talking about the chip. Taken aback at their naivete, I said, Its all a lie. Theres no such chip in the note. Two middle-aged men, sceptical about me, said the news had appeared on TV. Not everything that appears on TV is true, I said. They countered me: they had heard such notes were already in circulation in the US. Who told you? There are no such notes anywhere in the world, I said. What is the use of demonetisation then? one of them asked. Give it some thought, I said. A young man on a top berth butted in: You know what use it is? Big industrialists have borrowed money and are not paying back their loans. The banks have no money. That's why they are out to make people deposit their money. And people are taking their old notes to the banks, afraid they will turn out worthless otherwise.You mean this wont solve the black money problem? one of the men said. It will take care of fake currency for a while. But its extent isnt big. Within months, they will start making counterfeits of the new notes. The corrupt keep their wealth in jewellery and property, not cash. Only a small amount gets demonetised. In any case, we will never get, as Modi had promised, Rs 15 lakh in each of our bank accounts, I said.Oh, we thought Modi was on to something big. Looks like he has just put his hands into our pockets, a man said, sighing.The State Bank of India has just written off loans it had advanced to 63 companies. Know how much they owed? A whopping Rs 7,016 crore. This includes the Rs 1,201 crore owed by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. It isnt difficult to guess on whose side Modi is: the affluent who borrowed for their fancies and whose loans he has waived or the millions of hard-working people standing in long bank queues to deposit money they have earned.Modi has not been able to bring black money stashed away abroad. He hasnt even been able to name the secret account holders. His election promise of Rs 15 lakh in each citizens account remains a pipe dream. Even if we put up with such scams, how can we look on as he snatches away the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class?An elderly man waiting to take out money for his daily expenses has died. And how did a BJP vice-president respond to it? Big deal. People die even in ration shop queues.When it dawned on Modi that a majority was frustrated with his insane actions, he didnt say, Please bear with me. I will fix the problem in a few days. Instead, he said, Im doing all this for the nation. People who have ruled us for 70 years are conspiring against me. No one in his party told him, But sir, when did these people, struggling to withdraw their own money, ever rule in these 70 years? How can they conspire against you?The middle class and people in the media, who had hailed demonetisation as Modis masterstroke, now see the machinations behind it. They are aware the new note holds no magic. It cant banish black money, and Modis eccentricities are causing them misery.Modi continues to say we must put up with all this in the interest of the nation, but the problem wont go away anytime soon. Common people will have to scrape and scrounge for cash at least for four months. Business has been affected badly. With no customers, fisherfolk and traders in West Bengal are in the doldrums. In Punjab, farmers have no cash to buy seeds. If they dont sow now, the prices of rice and wheat will go up soon. No money in hand, nothing to eat either is the fate of millions. All this thanks to Modi.The BJP is feeling the heat of the peoples anger. Party president Amit Shah has instructed MPs to put up flex boards praising Modis surgical strike against black money. They usually follow his instructions to the letter, but this time they arent paying him any heed. Except for an MP in Gujarat, no one has put up laudatory flex hoardings.Even people in Gujarat have turned against Modi. Assembly elections are coming up. Expecting praise, party workers holding pamphlets went towards citizens standing in a bank queue. They received blows instead!Allies such as the Akali Dal in Punjab and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are also turning their back on the BJP. Quite a few BJP leaders are openly criticising Modis actions in the presence of the media, though they are unwilling to speak on record. Even Modi is coming to know of the attrition he has generated. That is why he comes across as so fidgety on his tours.About 25 people have died across the country because of demonetisation. In Uttar Pradesh, a couple with old notes was turned away from a hospital and their daughter died as a consequence. A woman in Gujarat with old notes couldnt feed her two children; she hanged herself.In Kanpur, a young man had been trying for months to sell his property. On November 8, he finally received Rs 70 lakh in advance. When he heard of demonetisation the next morning, he suffered a heart attack and died. A woman in Telangana, who had sold her land for her husbands medical treatment and her daughters wedding, was told the cash was worthless. She committed suicide. In Udupi, a man standing in a long queue, waiting for his bank to open, died of a heart attack.Not one of these was a thug. Not one of them was an Adani, Ambani, Tata or Birla. They were honest middle-class people, farmers, homemakers, all earning their livelihood from honest toil. They ended up as victims of Modis grandiose war against black money. He is responsible for their deaths.In fact, Modi has launched no surgical strike against black money. What he has done is push helpless people to death. What better can we expect from Modis Tughlaq dispensation?[Excerpted from The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, edited by Chandan Gowda, and published by DC Books and Navayana, Delhi.Chandan Gowda says, The book brings together select political and cultural writings of the courageous activist-journalist.

That it has turned into a public health emergency in the capital, with the air quality index touching extremely hazardous levels in some parts, necessitating the closure of primary schools, has further lowered its standing. It is unconscionable for governments, through indifference and inaction, to subject citizens to such toxic air, and cause extreme suffering especially among people with respiratory ailments and impaired lung function. The smog that envelops the region is exacerbated by the burning of biomass in Punjab and Haryana, and the winter atmosphere is marked by weak ventilation. An analysis of local sources by IIT-Kanpur last year pointed to construction dust, vehicular pollution, and domestic and industrial emissions as other major factors. Clearly, the burden of such chronic problems has outweighed the benefits conferred by measures such as the ban on Deepavali crackers, and in the past, the shift to compressed natural gas for commercial vehicles and restricting car use to odd and even number plates on alternate days. A comprehensive solution demands that the governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, assisted by the Centre, address farm residue burning and construction dust.The post-monsoon  as opposed to pre-monsoon  burning of rice and wheat residue releases maximum aerosols that contribute to the volume of PM2.5, which gets embedded in the lungs. Automation of farm operations leaves root-bound crop waste after machine harvesting, running to millions of tonnes, requiring a solution of scale. Sustainable residue removal cannot be achieved by the farmers alone, and requires help from the state machinery. Here, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should be commended for his initiative to discuss the modalities of joint action with the Punjab and Haryana governments. The national capital needs a major greening effort. Unpaved surfaces raise dust levels as in all Indian cities, but civic agencies ignore the problem. There is every reason to think that even the Ministry of Environments orders issued in 2015 under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to comprehensively green Delhis road margins and open spaces were not pursued seriously. Shifting more of the citys travel to comfortable public transport can cut fine particulates in congested areas and improve the air for residents. Many such initiatives were taken up by China in its cities to reduce exposure to PM2.5 that produces morbidity from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and leads to premature death. Only a determined response to the crisis can spare Delhi of its infamous tag as one of the most polluted cities on the planet."
5a52302a9855b770e0375248,Stubble burning blamed for Delhi pollution: Why farmers carry out the exercise,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/why-do-farmers-burn-paddy-stubble/story-cN5uXCkzIr8Cs9K1R9TtVK.html,2017-11-09,"The plain farming chore of burning after-harvest paddy stalks as farmers prepared their fields in Punjab and Haryana for the wheat crop never headlined so much as in the past month.The swirling smoke from the fire is blamed for the thick haze that has shrouded New Delhi, where the conditions were exacerbated by fog, dust, vehicle exhaust fumes and no high wind to blow the toxic air away.The air quality in Chandigarh too has become very poor with the air quality index (AQI) hovering in the 301-400 range, against the acceptable limit of 100.Farmers switching to mechanical harvesters, introduced in the early 1980s, could be the genesis of the problem. The machine cuts, threshes and cleans rice from ripe paddy in a matter of hours, saving days of menial labour.Over the years, more farmers bought these machines and those who didnt have one could get a harvester on rent for a nominal Rs 1,300, or hereabouts, for an acre.The downside is that harvesters skim from the top and leave 80% of the paddy plant  six to eight inches long  on the field. Except for the Basmati variety, the straw is useless.Unlike wheat stalks that are used as animal fodder, the paddy straw has high silica content that animals cant digest. And Basmati with its low silica content is grown only in 450,000 acres.Since farmers need to sow wheat within a fortnight of harvesting paddy, they burn the straw, or paraali, to save time, labour and money.About 3 million acres are cultivated for paddy in Punjab and 20 million tonnes of stubble are generated every year, said Jasbir Singh Bains, the states director of agriculture.The spike in stubble burning is blamed on the PUSA variety of rice, which is harvested late.Authorities took drastic measures to check the smoke from the countrys food bowl such as fining farmers  up to Rs 5,000  who were found setting fields afire. Punjab government data show 2,338 farmers were fined so far and Rs 65.92 lakh collected in fines.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, instances of paddy stubble burning were less this year compared to the past.Manjeet Singh Makkar, who heads the farm machinery and power engineering department at Punjab Agricultural University, suggested three solutions.His first suggestion is the straw chopper-cum-spreader. This machine chops the stubble and mixes it in the soil either with the help of water or a rotavator, a tool that has a steel shaft and blades and can be fitted to a tractor.The second suggestion is a straw management system and a happy seeder. The first can be fitted to a combine harvester. It cuts the straw into small pieces and scatters it evenly. Next, a happy seeder mounted on a tractor can be used to sow wheat and put the cut straw over the area as mulch, which improves soil fertility. The two machines cost Rs 1.25 lakh each.The third solution is a baler, which bales the straw. These can be used in power plants or cardboard factories.Punjab agriculture director Bains said the state sought a central grant of Rs 900 crore for a crop residue management project this May. The state proposes to offer farmers 40% subsidy on balers, rakes, rotavators and happy seeders. The Centre released 48.5 crore.These machines require an investment of more than Rs 2 lakh, but small and medium farmers dont have the money. Most are reeling from debts. The cheapest machine, a cutter-shredder, costs Rs 45,000 or more. Use of farm labour is the most expensive at Rs 6,000 an acre.Given a choice between a box of matchsticks and machinery worth Rs 2 lakh, what will you choose? asked Billa Singh, a farmer in Phagwara.But Navtej Singh Bains, the director of research at Punjab Agricultural University, believes new machinery is the only way out.If every village procures one or two happy seeders, the problem will be solved. Farmers are now renting these machines for Rs 1,300 an acre. The cost is bound to fall if more farmers buy the seeders, he said."

The field fires are on in day and night in the state, causing huge pollution not only in state but New Delhi.In Punjab, Super SMS could be attached to only around 1000 Combine-harvesters against the recommended 7500 combine harvesters (which comes to nearly 13 percent of the required number) and these SMS fitted Combine could harvest paddy on 40, 000 hectares (0ne lakh acres) across the state in this season where over 24 lakh hectares area was under paddy crop and as a result only 1.6 percent of the total paddy harvesting could be done with Super SMS fitted Combine-harvesters.The Punjab government had even given Rs. 50,000 subsidy for fitting Super SMS with harvesters during this harvesting season which starts in September end and almost has ended now.Super SMS would be attached in the rear of the combine harvester and it will cut the stubble into small pieces and spread evenly in the field after which farmers can sow wheat without setting the stubble on fire. The cost of a super SMS is Rs. 1.25 to 1.50 lakhs which would be attached to already available combines. The cost of a combine is around Rs. 18 lakhs, which will go up Rs. 19 to 19.50 lakh with this fitment.Earlier in January this year, the Captain Amarinder Singh-led government had passed an order that Super SMS fitment was compulsory with all the Combine harvesters in the state, but after farmers opposition for the same in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the government withdrew the order and then got issued an advisory from PPCB to all the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of the states in July this year (around two months before harvesting) that they should ensure to get fitted SMS with all the combine-Harveters in their respective districts.Authorities said though it is just a baby step to check the menace, farmers, who were against it, have started adopting it. There are around 12,000 combine-harvesters in Punjab out of which Super SMS can be fitted only with 7500 combines as remaining are not fit for the attachment due to one or other reasons. And even if Super SMS is fitted with 7500 Combine harvesters, even that it is more than sufficient to harvest paddy and wheat in Punjab, said Joint Director cum Nodal Officer Punjab Engineer Manmohan Kalia for stubble management, adding that Super SMS can manage majority straw at the time of harvesting only and in this way, the field fires can be avoided on the large chunk of land.The attachment of Super SMS with Combines started few months back and this year around 1000 combines were covered, he said, adding that remaining will be covered before next season.Though given the figure, the area harvested through Super SMS fitted Combines is quite less but still department feels that with such small steps it has been able to change the mind set of the farmers towards the machine which was totally rejected by them in the beginning, said Director Agriculture Dr. JS Bains.Punjab has seen over 40,000 field fires till date during paddy harvesting and still the fires are going on to clear the stubble. There was total around 29.25 lakh hectares under rice cultivation in Punjab this year including over 4.50 lakh hectares under Basmati rice (Fine quality rice) and remaining under parmal rice (paddy). Basmati rice is harvested mostly manually and its stubble is used as fodder for cattle. The main problem is paddy stubble which is not much popular as fodder and around 75 percent of total 197 lakh tonnes paddy stubble is burnt in the fields only.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Over the past few days, PM2.5 levels in Delhi breached 700-800 micrograms per cubic metre  a level which is hazardous by both WHO and Indian government standards. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in these cities was highest in the world, even clocking maximum level that can be recorded on the scale, i.e. 999. In fact, the smog in Delhi and majority of North Indian cities has reached a level where doctors have suggested evacuation, CMs have ordered shutting of schools, construction has been halted, power plants have been momentarily shut, diesel-generators are banned, cloud seeding is seriously considered, among other such coping but knee-jerk reactions.The primary reason behind this Great North Indian Smog is burning of straw from rice paddy crops by farmers before they begin wheat plantation in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This year the situation worsened on the back of unfavourable weather conditions which have trapped the smog over Delhi and the rest of North India. Measures such as odd-even policy on cars, ban on burning of leaves and garbage and others mentioned above, have had only limited positive impact. As the political bickering begins over this issue, it is time for us to find long-term, low-cost and scalable solutions.It is tempting to draw parallels between Beijings and New Delhis air pollution issue. Both are capitals of the worlds biggest countries that jointly resisted the wests stringent CO2 emission cuts, exemplify shift of economic vibrancy to Asia and are among the worlds largest cities. However, there are fundamental differences between pollution in these two cities. Beijings pollution is fueled by vehicular and factory pollution whereas Indias pollution is mainly driven by stubble burning. Other small factors contributing to pollution in India include emissions from vehicles, industry and construction. Therefore, the solutions that worked in China to an extent cannot be replicated on the ground in India.Instead, India should learn from Singapores handling of its annual haze concern. The Singapore haze problem is an outcome of palm oil plantation burning in Indonesia, mainly in the Sumatra region.Another interesting similarity is how little Singapore can do on its own to prevent this annual curse. Singapore and Indonesia are both part of the ASEAN  Association of South East Nations  a regional association long hailed as the successful model for (sub)-regional cooperation based on minimum common values. Given the conflicts in South-East Asia when ASEAN was conceptualized, one common value jointly agreed upon was non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other ASEAN countries. This value has long been attributed to be the success of ASEAN; but the same ties Singapores hands in bringing Indonesia to table for taking concrete actions.Likewise, in India, the States are answerable to their local constituencies and have limited say in influencing/limiting farmer burning straw of rice fields in other states. In this regard, more solutions should be derived from Singapore than from Chinas example.First, Singapore tried to identify, shame and even penalize private firms burning forests in Indonesia. In the same vein, the Indian government in collaboration with states can identify the key sub-regions within states that are primarily responsible for such mass-scale burning. The local administration and region should be named and shamed to highlight their apathy towards their fellow countrymen. This identification can be done by hot spot mapping and tracking massive land-clearing activities.Second, the states and center need to come together to discuss this issue in detail and create binding solutions. NITI Aayog  in all its effort to foster cooperative federalism  is uniquely placed to convene all the concerned stakeholders and initiate evidence-backed discussion. One of the solutions of such a collaboration effort could be to use a challenge method to solicit scalable, cost-effective and innovative solutions to clear farms. The source of such optimism is the successful use of technology to mitigate smog issue in other parts of the world  Hong Kong, Philippines, Mexico and also in China.Third, the states and center can mandate installing screens at major public places and ask television and newspapers to display/publish the air quality index. Singapore being a city state has managed to do the same by managing the dedicated website: www.haze.gov.sg/.This is expected to yield three benefits. First, every state has a set of go-to measures in response to increase in pollution levels. Such information will prevent any catastrophic delay in their response.Second, such a display of information will continue to keep the public and civil society informed and any adverse movement in the index will lead to public pressure on the administration and legislators to get their acts together. Third, in states mainly responsible for crop burning, Delhi and other states should publish information linking how the farm activity in such states is impacting air pollution in their home states. They should also publish the AQI of cities in other developing countries which are still sub-50/100 level. This is bound to increase the empathy, accountability and fellowship in farmer community to limit their farm burning efforts.Fourth, unlike in Singapore, in India the states and central governments can explore the option of buying the crop residue from the farmers and using it as a fuel for Waste-to-Energy (incinerators) plants. These plants have massive fuel requirements and feeding such residue could create a possible win-win situation for all.Fifth, states should use softer elements of nukkad natak, graffiti art, wall paintings, messages on packaging of key agriculture inputs of seeds and fertilizers, radio and television messaging before winter cropping season begins and block-level target of crop residue procurement to limit stubble burning.The above measures will be able to create long-term and sustainable solutions to mitigate this annual smog concern. I would like to end this piece by highlighting two caveats. First, all major cities in the world, at some point of time have faced similar deteriorating air quality concerns and they largely overcame the issue with continued economic growth, technological development and policy perseverance. Second, the measures on controlling vehicular, industrial and construction driven pollution should be continued with as much determination as the overall pollution level cant be ignored. With these measures, Delhi will one day come close to Faizs vision of the future."

The Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to an average reading of 308, even as the city government extended the ban on the entry of trucks till further orders.Officials said light rain is expected on Wednesday, which might intensify the fog but could clear the smog.Delhi has been experiencing dense smog for about a week, forcing the authorities to enforce emergency measures in the National Capital Region.Here are the highlights:9.37pm: Gadkari says electric transportation could ease the situation in Delhi a bit like Nagpur which has 200 electric taxis that are going to swell to 1,000 next month.9.35pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari urges farmers to produce ethanol and biofuel from stubble instead of burning them. These can fuel vehicles including motorbikes on flex engines that will be launched shortly. A tonne of rice straw can produce 430 litres of ethanol, he says.9.33pm: 50% pollution from automobiles in Delhi will be removed after these projects as vehicles from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will not be required to enter Delhi, says Gadkari.9.30pm: Eastern Peripheral Expressway that will be completed by January and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project and other projects worth Rs 40,000 crore to decongest Delhi will contribute significantly in curbing pollution, says Gadkari.9.27pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari says he has written to environment minister Harsh Vardhan to look into Delhis pollution problem and get it studied by experts including international consultants.9.25pm: If vehicles are stopped or converted into electricity, still there is no guarantee that the pollution will stop completely. Climatic changes are also behind it and there is need of a holistic approach, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.22pm: Delhi pollution is not related to only automobile pollution. It is not such a case that the problem of pollution will be solved if odd even is introduced, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.20pm: Union minister Nitin Gadkari says the odd-even car rationing scheme or a ban on automobiles are no solutions to Delhis pollution problem.9.15pm: This year when the people are suffering badly and an accumulated fund of Rs 775 crore lies at its disposal, the Kejriwal government has not found it worth spending on improving the environment, says Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.9.12pm: The AAP government collected Rs 775 crore as environmental cess in the last three years, says Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari.9.10pm: The BJPs Delhi unit accuses the AAP government of failing to act on environment protection despite having ample resources, asks it to share details of spending of the environmental cess.9.08pm: Delhi government notification asks Delhi Traffic Police and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi to prohibit the entry of heavy and medium goods vehicles, except those carrying essential commodities, in the national capital.9.06pm: Delhi government says the ban on the entry of trucks in the national capital has been extended till further orders due to the fluctuating levels of air pollution.9.04pm: We are not relaxing anything as of now. The CPCB task force will meet tomorrow (November 15) and the day after (November 16) and suggest future course of action as drizzle is expected, says CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar.9.02pm: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakar says Delhis air quality may further improve on Wednesday as light rains are expected, which will help in flushing suspended particulates away.9.00pm: Delhi HC says stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana alone cannot be blamed for the poor air quality in the national capital.8.58pm: Delhi HC tells AAP government: Entire city is unable to breathe. Look at your concern in the areas of education and health facility. We want the same for public transport.8.56pm: All the authorities have opined that the major cause for air pollution was vehicles. So the Delhi government should make an effort on war-footing to bring in more buses. Public life has to be protected as Delhi is unable to breathe, says Delhi HC.8.54pm: Delhi HC says if the Delhi governments odd-even scheme is to benefit the people, there is a need for a better public transport facility.8.52pm: Delhi High Court says there is a grave urgency for more buses in the city and the AAP government needs to address it on a war-footing.8.50pm: The IMD has forecast that weather conditions in Delhi NCR are likely to become more favourable for dispersal of pollutants over the next 2-3 days. Hence, air quality is expected to improve further, says environment minister Harsh Vardhan.8.48pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan appreciates the discipline shown by the public. He says the improvement in the air quality was achieved largely due to efforts of various government agencies and voluntary participation by the public.8.45pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan says all government agencies need to maintain the highest level of alertness and continue their efforts to check pollution.8.42pm: Union environment ministry asks all state pollution control boards to intensify action against violators, especially in the industrial and construction sectors, to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR.8.40pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel appeals to farmers not to burn crop residue. For this, the government is providing them equipment on subsidy basis. The fertility of land is also decreasing because of the burning of crop residues as this would cause loss to farmers in the coming days, he says.8.35pm: Action taken against 369 farmers in Fatehabad, against 79 in Hisar, 54 in Jind, 138 in Kaithal, 357 in Karnal, 184 in Kurukshetra, 6 in Panchkula, 40 in Panipat and 301 in Sirsa, says minister Vipul Goel.8.30pm: Haryana minister Vipul Goel says even in Delhi, crop residues were being burnt by farmers, but the Delhi government has not taken any action.8.25pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel says action is being taken against farmers indulging in stubble burning, and at the same time, they are also being sensitised not to burn the stubble.8.22pm: In view of the National Green Tribunal orders, the Haryana government is quite serious in dealing with the issue of pollution, says minister Vipul Goel.8.20pm: In Haryana, cases have been registered against 244 farmers and fines of up to Rs 18.65 lakh have been recovered from 695 farmers, says minister Goel.8.18pm: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board acted against 1,586 farmers across the state to curb air pollution due to stubble burning, the states environment minister Vipul Goel says in Chandigarh.8.15pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel hits out at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, saying he has not taken any such steps but was doing politics in the name of smog and pollution in the capital.8.08pm: Since the winds are coming from Punjab and Haryana with good speed, the pollutant there would first settle due to rains, so the winds entering Delhi would be pure and then speed would disperse the smog here, says Charan Singh of IMD.8.06pm: Charan Singh, chief weather forecast officer at IMD, says there are fair chances of drizzling tonight (Tuesday) or early morning on Wednesday, November 15 in parts of Haryana and Punjab.8.03pm: The major reason for the emergency situation in Delhi was stubble burning. The winds coming from Punjab were carrying pollutants and then there was moisture coming from the east. Both winds collided at low height in Delhi causing smog. We do not see improvement, says Usman Naseem.8.00pm: Delhi is out of emergency but not out of danger. In the coming days by November 16 and 17, the conditions are expected to get better. Unfortunately we are happy even though the air quality is very poor. In many countries there is an emergency-like condition at this air quality which we are cherishing as improvement, says Usman Naseem, researcher at Centre for Science and Environment and member of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).7.31pm: Ban on entry of trucks in Delhi, except those carrying essential goods, extended till further orders due to pollution levels: Delhi govt official.7.25pm: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to ANI: I fail to understand why the Delhi chief minister is trying to force his hand, knowing well that any such discussion would be meaningless and futile.7.15pm: According to latest AQI data, Haryanas Vikas Sadan Gurugram is at 262, Sector16A Faridabad at 240, both fall in Very Unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.7.07pm: The latest AQI data for Delhis Punjabi Bagh is at 262, Dwarka at 244, ITO at 244,Anand Vihar at 287; all fall in Very unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.5.55pm: Delhi government requests NGT to direct neighbouring states to also implement odd-even scheme.5.52pm: Delhi government requests NGT to exempt two-wheelers and women drivers for one year or till 2,000 additional buses are engaged.5.50pm: Delhi government files fresh review petition before NGT in connection with odd-even policy: ANI4.50pm: The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi improves to an average reading of 308, according to CPCB data. However, even at this level, the air quality remains very poor.4.49pm: If electric bus system is introduced in Delhi, it will reduce pollution. Soon, bio-ethanol-based bikes are going to be launched which use fuel generated from sugarcane husk. This will not only lead to reduction in pollution levels but also help our farmers who are growing sugarcane, says Gadkari.4.48pm: Union government looking at introducing electric taxis and buses, bio-ethanol, methanol and other technologies to reduce pollution, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.4.46pm: The government is working on use of alternative and clean fuels, in place of diesel and petrol, as another way of reducing vehicular pollution, says Gadkari.4.45pm: Road transport ministry has formulated a Rs 40,000 crore scheme to ease traffic congestion in Delhi which would also bring down pollution levels as vehicles wont be stuck in traffic burning extra fuel, says Gadkari.4.42pm: Bypass roads, and upgrading of NH-24 into a 14-lane national highway will reduce vehicular pollution in Delhi by 50%, says Gadkari.4.40pm: Gadkari says once the easterly and westerly bypass roads become operational, vehicles destined for other places near Delhi wont have to enter the city. This would bring huge relief to the people of Delhi from vehicular pollution, he says.4.35pm: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari says that to tackle the rising pollution levels in Delhi, traffic not destined for the capital should be diverted to cut congestion on the city roads.3.50pm: The smog and pollutant levels will drop in Delhi because of the wind speed generated by the gathering weather system in Jammu and Kashmir, says Sonam Lotus, director of the Met department in Srinagar.3.48pm: The balancing of the weather system in the coming days in Jammu and Kashmir will definitely help in decreasing the pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining areas as the system is moving westwards from the state, says Sonam Lotus, director of the Met department in Srinagar.3.45pm: Rain and snowfall forecast in Jammu and Kashmir will help reduce the smog and pollution levels in Delhi and its adjoining areas, the regional Met office in Srinagar says.3.40pm: Aam Aadmi Party says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been following up with Punjab and Haryana CMs regarding the smog issue. Collective efforts are needed to resolve this grave issue, AAP posts on Twitter.Delhi CM has been following up with Punjab & Haryana CMs regarding the smog issue.Collective efforts are needed to resolve this grave issue. pic.twitter.com/iF5OK3pWOq  AAP (@AamAadmiParty) 14 November 20173.35pm: BJP Kisan Morcha president Virendra Singh says the party is running a campaign to encourage farmers not to burn paddy stubble as it not only caused air pollution but also reduced nutrients in the fields.1.20pm: Industries involved in essential commodities have been exempted to carry on their activity.We also direct industries whose emissions are limited in parameters be allowed to operate subject to verification, says NGT.1.10pm: NGT to Delhi govt: Dont gift infected lungs to children. They have to wear masks to school. What constitutes a health emergency according to you? Measures should be applied automatically by govt after dangerous levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 persist for more than 48 hours.12.50pm: Delhi govt withdraws its petition for modifications. NGT suggested Delhi govt take care of the logical explanations for odd-even exemptions when they approach NGT again12.40pm: NGT to Delhi government: When reports have stated that two-wheelers are more polluting than four-wheelers, why do you intend to give arbitrary exemptions? Is this a joke? What does one stand to gain from this?12.30pm: Why dont you take positive steps? Why should we exempt anybody? If they (two-wheelers) are not polluting, we will allow them: NGT tells Delhi government .12.20pm: NGT asks Delhi Govt as to why it cant run ladies only buses to solve the problem of transport during odd-even scheme.12.10pm: If you show us you sprinkled water in a proper way and pollution doesnt come down, we will withdraw that order (of sprinkling): NGT tells Delhi government12pm: Kejriwal asks Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to join the meeting with Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday..@capt_amarinder Sir, I am coming to Chandigarh on Wed to meet Haryana CM.

But a large part of the problem is crop burning.

5a534b419855b770e037eaf5,Delhi air pollution: Centre tells NTPC to mix crop residue with coal to reduce ...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-pollution-centre-tells-ntpc-to-mix-crop-residue-with-coal-to-reduce-smog/story-tG5NsZUKvVsW3KGhw5gRiM.html,2017-11-16,"India directed its largest utility NTPC Ltd to blend crop residue with coal at its power plants, in a bid to reduce stubble burning on agricultural lands which is clouding New Delhi with smog.Farmers in Haryana and Punjab use mechanized harvesters - which leave more residue than crops plucked by hand - to save money amid rising labour costs.Subsequent burning of the residue is a major source of smog at this time of year across northern India, including New Delhi, as farmers burn the stubble of the previous crop to prepare for new plantings in November.Since October, more than 40,000 fires have been recorded in Punjab, as farmers disposed of nearly 20 million tonnes of rice waste, environmental groups said.Under the government plan, state-run NTPC will buy waste from farmers and use it to make biomass pellets, and fuel at its power plants will be 10% biomass and 90% coal.This step would give the farmers a monetary return of Rs 5500 ($84.27) per tonne of crop residue and hence create a market for it, power minister RK Singh said on Thursday.The government is in talks with all state governments to make this step mandatory for all the thermal power plants in their jurisdiction, Singh said.The move could limit mass burning over a short period of time, and save Delhi from toxic air during winter.Coal plants will have some sort of pollution control as compared to nothing at the farm level, said Chandra Bhushan. deputy director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, a non-government organisation.In general, use of 10% biomass has shown reduction in sulphur oxide emissions, Bhushan said.NTPC had already issued a tender to procure biomass pellets for a power plant in the state of Uttar Pradesh in August.Stubble burning is just one of the many causes of toxic air pollution in and around New Delhi, where respiratory diseases kill 10 people per day according to government data.On Monday, a thick cloud of toxic smog 10 times the recommended limit enveloped New Delhi, as government officials struggled to tackle a public health crisis that is well into its second week.Thermal power companies alone account for 80 percent of all industrial emissions of particulate matter, sulphur and nitrous oxides in India, and their slowness in complying with new standards to curb pollution shows the difficulties India faces in cleaning up its polluted air.A combination of industrial pollution, vehicle exhaust and dust envelop the region every year as winter approaches and wind speeds drop, leading to schools getting shut down and employees calling in sick.($1 = 65.2650 Indian rupees)"

""We're now praying. Only God can save us.""The official said he had bought pollution masks for his family and installed air purifiers at his home in Delhi, now the most polluted city in the world, according to the Brookings Institute. The city is home to more than 20 million people.A spokesman of the federal environment ministry declined comment on federal and state governments bickering over funds to tackle the problem of stubble burning.Chief Ministers of Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, after exchanging barbs on Twitter for days, agreed on Wednesday on measures to control the smog - in 2018.As a thick blanket of haze settled over parts of northern India, including Delhi, over the past few days, the official response to what has become an annual phenomenon has been marked by paralysis and lack of ownership, interviews with government officials show.It's not just the crop burning - a combination of industrial smog, vehicle exhaust and dust envelop the region every year as winter approaches and wind speeds drop.It's been particularly bad this year with levels of PM-2.5, tiny particulate matter that reaches deep into the lungs, climbing to over 600 last week, according to a US Embassy measure.The upper limit for healthy air is 50, the government has said.Respiratory diseases killed about 10 people a day in the year to March 2017 in the national capital region, according to the health ministry. The World Bank estimates pollution cost the country as much as 7.7 percent of the GDP in 2013.In 2015, PM Modi launched the first national air quality index in Delhi and promised to take steps to clean the air.Authorities temporarily banned diesel-run power generators, construction, burning of garbage and plying of trucks with non-essential goods, but construction and truck movements were allowed to resume on Thursday as pollution levels dropped.In recent days, authorities also began to use fire engines to spray water over parts of the capital hoping it would help settle the dust. But the steps have largely proved ineffective.""We've tried our best to tackle the situation, but as policymakers we've failed to address the main problem of stubble burning,"" the government official said.It's not a new problem - it happens each year after mid-October when farmers start harvesting summer crops in Punjab and Haryana.With rising labour costs and a short window to plant the next crop, most farmers burn the stubble and straw in their fields to clear them for the next planting.Since October, more than 40,000 fire incidents have been recorded in Punjab, as farmers disposed of nearly 20 million tonnes of rice waste, environment groups said.But the stubble issue has become more acute in recent years because mechanised harvesters leave more of a residue than crops plucked by hand. Such harvesters are increasingly popular in the wealthy northern states, where farmer lobbies are also politically powerful.""The situation has worsened this year because of the slow wind speed,"" which means the pollutants hang in the air for longer, said D Shah, a scientist at the state-run Central Pollution Control Board of India.NITI Aayog, the federal government's economic planning think-tank, has estimated farmers would need handouts worth about Rs 3,250 crores a year to switch to alternative ways of disposing farm stubble, said an official who was involved in the preparation of the report.Another Rs 650 crore is needed to reward local bodies for adopting best practices and funding awareness campaigns, the official said.Punjab alone would require about Rs 1,950 crores annually from the state government to encourage farmers to adopt alternative ways, said Roshan Sunkaria, a senior state government official.Environmental groups say nothing is happening on the ground to ease the situation and the only hope was that the crop burning would soon end and wind speeds would pick up. ""Politicians are playing with public health by blaming each other,"" said Usman Nasim, a scientist at private think-tank Centre for Science and Environment.(Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Raju Gopalakrishnan)"
5a53500d9855b770e037ed60,Seeking ways to avoid stubble burning: These progressive Punjab farmers don't play...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/seeking-ways-to-avoid-stubble-burning-these-progressive-punjab-farmers-don-t-play-with-fire/story-yhOYIlFk6Zdfh9jySuZZZN.html,2017-11-17,"Raj Mohan Singh, 40, cuts quite a towering figure with his flowing black beard. The progressive farmer from Bishanpur Chana village near Patiala, whos bagged several awards for organic farming, has not been burning paddy stubble since the last season.Once I realised what it is doing to the air we breathe, and the soil on which we grow our crops, I stopped burning the stubble, says Raj, who owns 20 acres.He is among the handful of farmers in Patiala district who improvised the tools they owned to sow wheat without burning the paddy stubble.Enterprising farmersI watered 10 acres extensively and then hired a rotavator, which mixed the straw with soil, before sowing wheat. On the remaining 10 acres, I used a zero drill that I already owned to sow wheat, says Raj, telling you how he did not buy any of the machines that Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) officials have been espousing.Most farmers say the incidence of burning would also peter off if the government bans slow-growing varieties such as PUSA 144, and promotes fast-growing breeds.They are expensive, besides I wanted to do something that other farmers could also follow, says Raj, who claims 80% of farmers in the state own the zero drill, while 50% have the rotavator.Gurbans Singh Punia, 70, a retired excise and taxation officer, whose family grows rice on 70 acres at Bibipur village, also refrained from burning the stubble this year. Punia says giving match stick the short shrift wasnt much of a struggle on the 40 acres on which hes sown the quick-growing PR 126 and PR 1509 varieties of rice.I harvested my crop in the last week of September and had over a month to prepare for wheat sowing. Punia watered the fields for a month till the straw decomposed, and then ploughed it with a harrow. Like Raj, Punia takes pride in the fact that he didnt buy any new equipment.But he had some trouble on the 20 acres on which he had sown the late-growing PR 1121 variety of basmati. I had no time to water and wait for the straw to disintegrate. On 10 acres, I used a normal cutter and then gave it to a factory, which made straw bales out of it. On the rest, I used a mulcher.Then, Punia sourced a happy seeder (a machine that helps sow wheat in the standing rice stubble) from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials, who arranged it from the Mandauli village cooperative society.PPCB executive engineer Surinder Singh Matharu says the board receives over half-a-dozen calls from farmers every day, seeking tools to avoid stubble burning.I use my influence to source them from cooperative societies. I have also tied up with the 12-MW biomass plant at Baghaura village in Mahilpur tehsil of Hoshiarpur, which consumes 400 tonnes of paddy bales a day, says Matharu, who gets a high every time he sees a paddy field untouched by fire.A village says noThe district agriculture department, meanwhile, concentrated its resources in the Kalar Majri village in Nabha, adopted by the state to implement the National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines. This year, not a single farmer in the village burnt their fields. They provided us with happy seeders, mulchers and balers, explains Bir Dalwinder Singh, who owns 40 acres in this village.Singh says he stopped burning the stubble three years ago after learning about its harmful effects on the soil. In the last two years, he used a happy seeder provided by PAU to sow wheat. This year, he bought it.Solution from the groundPunia says the state government should equip village-level societies with implements to counter stubble burning instead of giving individual subsidies. They can give youngsters these implements at interest-free loans, and the other villagers can use their services, he said.Most farmers say the incidence of burning would also peter off if the government bans slow-growing varieties such as PUSA 144, and promotes fast-growing breeds, which ripen at the end of September and give farmers a window of over a month to prepare their fields for wheat. Agreeing with them, Devinder Sharma, an agriculture analyst, says: Thats what I call getting to the root of the problem."

PRESPL was to set up eight more plants in the next four years, but that never happened.1ST PLANT WAS SUCCESS BUT GAVE NO PROFITSLt Col Monish Ahuja (retd), PRESPL director, who is also chairman of the CII committee on biomass, says the 12-MW plant was a huge success.Besides the two chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana, even the Pakistan Punjab CM visited it to gain an insight into this farm-friendly technology.Due to the silica content in the rice straw, nobody was using 100% paddy straw, but we overcame this snag with some technical interventions, says Ahuja.But the plant, he rues, never reaped profits for the company. The electricity tariff we get is a mere Rs 6.20 per unit, we cant be financially viable unless we get Rs 8 per unit, says Ahuja.The previous Akali-BJP government also made many promises about generating power from biomass when it tied up with Viaton Energy Private Ltd to set up a 10-MW power plant at Khokar Khurd village in Mansa in 2013.Bikram Singh Majithia, the then minister for non-conventional energy, had promised to set up 29 more biomass power plants with a generation capability of 300 MW.All praise for such plants for the green energy generated by these, Tejinder Pal Singh Sidhu, who was chief executive officer of Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) till 2013, says most of the existing plants, including those near Muktsar and Lambi, are doing well.The initial plan, he says, was to set up 100 such plants to mop up the entire paddy straw. But there were some challenges. The paddy straw has high silica content, which builds up in the boilers. Thats why these plants use paddy straw with cotton residue or eucalyptus branches in the ratio of 80:20.OPERATIONAL PROBLEMSTej Pal Singh, general manager of the Viaton plant near Mansa since 2014, says there are many other operational problems. Its an unorganised sector. We have to go from farm to farm to collect the straw during the season. Then it is stored and used through the year, says Singh. The fuel value of the stored straw, he says, decreases with time. The plant also cant function when it rains.7 BIOMASS PLANTS GENERATING 62.5 MWPunjab is home to seven private biomass power plants at Muktsar, Abohar, Malout, Garhshankar, Rajpura, Nakodar and Mansa, which together generate 62.5 MW.MP Singh, joint director of Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA), says they invited bids for more such plants last year and had received an enthusiastic response for 12 projects with a capacity of 150 MW, but these are still hanging fire as the companies hadnt been able to sign power purchase agreements with the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL).BLURB Punjabs MoU with Chennai-based company to set up 400 biomass power plants to tackle paddy straw may be good news, but experts are not so excited over the initiativeNEW TECHNOLOGY TO PUNJABS RESCUE?RK Verma, chief executive officer of Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion, who inked the MoU with Neway Engineers MSW Private Limited, said they are banking on a new technology to overcome the stubble crisis. Verma said the three-year-old Chennai-based company had successfully set up a municipal solid waste management plant in Chennai, and was confident of replicating the same model in Punjab. |It is a patented waste-to-energy technology, and they will be able to convert the paddy straw into a coal-like product, which they claim is in great demand by a large number of industries, including the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), said Verma.He said the company was also confident of mobilising the capital required to set up 400 plants across the state in the next 10 months. Allaying concerns about partnering with a newbie, he said, The MoU is just the beginning of a journey, its not a commitment. We have not promised any funds. We hope the new technology will be able to help us deal with the problem of paddy straw next year.Verma also hoped that given the enormity of the issue, all the stakeholders will work efficiently and quickly to set the project in motion."

Though ISM doesnt produce extra yield, being able to cut down crop loss due to bacterial blight results in additional yields, said Dr Ramesh Sonti chief scientist, CCMB.The ISM rice has been developed by CCMB and Indian Institute of Rice Research over several years of research, while testing was conducted by National Institute of Nutrition. It found ISM to have one of lowest GI of 50.99, thus having the potential to revolutionise the organic food market as well. Foods with GI value below 55 are considered highly suitable for consumption by a diabetic patient as they release glucose in the bloodstream slowly, thereby reducing the ill effects of diabetes.Thus ISM, in addition to possessing desirable attributes like high yield, fine-grain type bacterial blight resistance, premium market price, also has the unique advantage of low GI, enhancing its market potential, said Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra, director CCMB.CCBM and IIRR picked up a donor variety of samba masuri from Punjab that was low in quality and taste and was not easy to cook but was extremely resistant. Traditional breeding method of this variety with other variety of the rice was done and with the help of advanced biotechnology tools, the ISM was developed."

""I firmly believe that it is in the interest of people of both Punjabs to make a collective efforts towards identifying technologies and business methods that mayeliminate the need to burn rice stubble and help control smog formation,"" he said. I will like to invite you for entering into a regional cooperation arrangement to tackle the issue of smog as well as environmental pollution, he wrote.Recently, Mr Kejriwal and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had confabulations to tackle the problem of smog."

Somanathan and Ridhima Gupta)By now, everyone in north-western India (and northern Pakistan) knows that one of the main reasons they are choking on smog is the burning of residue from the rice crop by farmers. Some people have also heard of the Happy Seeder, a machine whose use can do away with the need to burn residue. It fits onto a tractor and is capable of planting wheat without getting jammed by residue leftover after the rice harvest. What people dont know is that the cost of producing enough of the machines to eliminate burning entirely is very low.Eight years ago, a survey conducted by one of us (Gupta) found that there were fewer than a hundred farmers using the Happy Seeder in Punjab. Now there are 3,000, showing that adoption has been proceeding rapidly. But there is still a long way to go. A policy brief by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences estimates that 1.2 lakh Happy Seeders would be needed to cover the entire area under the rice-wheat cropping system in India. There are presently about 15 manufacturers of the machine, and if they get enough orders they can bring the price down to Rs 1 lakh rather than the current sale price of about Rs. 1.3 lakh per machine. Also needed is another machine  the Super SMS (straw management system)  that fits onto the combine harvesters for rice in order to spread residue evenly over the field, making the Happy Seeder more effective. These machines presently cost about Rs 1.2 lakh each and only half as many (60,000 machines) are needed since combine harvesters can cover a greater area. At a large scale, the production cost of each machine would be about Rs 1 lakh each, so this works out to a total cost of Rs 1,800 crore for the purchase of enough machines to cover the required area throughout India.The government can announce a procurement policy for the Super SMS attachments and Happy Seeders for the next year with a guarantee to procure 80 per cent of the requirement with warranties and after-sales service to ensure quality. It can then auction the machines to farmers and hire-purchase operators who buy machines and rent their services to farmers. This would ensure the availability of enough machines giving farmers an alternative to residue-burning, next year. The policy of fines for residue-burning can then be strictly enforced without a political backlash. This needs to be combined with a public information campaign and an intensification of extension efforts. Together, these measures would ensure that there will not be a repeat of the problem next year, and in the years to come.The difference between the purchase price and auction price of each machine will be the government subsidy. It is likely to amount to much less than the total cost of the machine if the government makes clear its intention to enforce the fines for burning, and provides enough publicity, because then there will be high demand for the machines. The government would thus need an outlay of only a few hundred crore for this programme, a tiny fraction of the agriculture ministrys budget of Rs 40,000 crore. This would prevent a recurrence of the current disaster next year. In the long run, it is necessary to move away from the power and fertiliser subsidies and selective procurement of grain  these encourage a wasteful farming system.There are other big contributors to air pollution: Once a pollution cloud forms, the air gets trapped near the ground because sunlight is blocked. The normal process of air getting warmed during the day, and rising up and carrying away pollutants with it, stops. In winter, the cold and dimming from the pollution cloud cause increased lighting and heating demand, generating more pollution from heating fires by the poor and coal burning in power plants. And there is the ever-present pollution from diesel trucks and cars. Dealing with these other sources is also important and solutions may not be as immediate.As always, prevention is better than cure. Diesel combustion produces many-times-more-polluting fine particles than petrol. Currently, petrol costs about 20 per cent more than diesel. All that is needed to prevent new diesel cars being produced is to lower the petrol tax and raise the diesel tax so that the price difference is reversed. The myth that diesel taxation falls more heavily on the poor has now been thoroughly debunked (for example, in the book Fuel Taxes and the Poor edited by Thomas Sterner)  it is the rich and middle class who own vehicles, and it is they who buy most transported goods.A new study from the University of Maryland shows that sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution declined by 75 per cent in China in the last decade while Indias SO2 pollution increased by 50 per cent. SO2 gets converted in the atmosphere to sulphate particles that form smog. China implemented SO2 pollution controls on coal power plants. Meanwhile, in India, regulations to control SO2 were issued as late as December 2015, and recently the power ministry wrote to the environment ministry to delay enforcement in some cases to as late as 2022.In many cases, there are lobbies that benefit from the status quo. Some auto companies opposed the advancement of Bharat VI standards to 2020 (previously 2024). As a result of the public outcry over air pollution last winter, the central government held firm on that issue. All governments respond to the demands made on them. Unless the public is vocal about demanding action on air pollution, progress will continue to be slow.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The issue has generated a debate whether farmers of both the states should continue to cultivate paddy to contribute to the national foodgrain buffer stock or diversify into other crops and conserve their vital natural resources like water and soil.The Union government had started a programme Bringing Green Revolution in East India (BGREI) in 2010-11 to increase the output of foodgrains, especially paddy in seven eastern states to raise their agricultural output and reduce their dependence on the Centre to feed their population. As paddy output in these provinces goes up in coming years, the Centre may not procure rice from Punjab and Haryana, which could trigger a crisis in both states, if they dont adopt alternative crops and create a marketing system for farmers to sell their produce.While this could harm the interest of Punjab and Haryana farmers in the shortterm, it also could enable them to shift to other crops and allied sector activities like horticulture, dairying and agro-forestry to name a few to augment their incomes and learn ways to market their produce efficiently.Leading farm scientists and agri-economists have been suggesting the area under paddy cultivation in the region must be reduced. Speaking about reducing the area under paddy in Punjab, former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Professor Kirpal Singh Aulakh , said, It is long overdue. I think it is a great opportunity to move to other crops as Punjab was never a paddy-growing state. It all started with the Green Revolution as paddy replaced crops like maize, groundnut and pulses. Today nearly 60% of Punjabs total geographical area is under paddy cultivation during kharif season, which is not a healthy trend. It is time to curtail rice cultivation as it is depleting groundwater of Punjab and also poses a threat to environment with the practice of stubble burning.He said to wean farmers away from water-guzzling paddy and, hence, stop the practice of stubble burning, they should be given an assurance of fair price for their other kharif crops like maize, urad (black gram) and moong (green gram). If farmers get the same return from maize or vegetables or pulses, there is no reason why they could not move away from paddy, said Prof Aulakh.Former professor of economics at PAU, Prof P S Rangi , who served as the marketing consultant in the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC), said continuous cultivation of paddy was playing havoc with the environment and natural resources of Punjab. The sooner the farmers shift from paddy to other crops the better. However, they must be provided with the infrastructure to switch to other crops or allied activities so that their returns dont drop by moving away from paddy. For instance, cold chains are the need of the hour for supporting fruits and vegetable growers as these perishable commodities. This can enable farmers to get much higher returns than conventional crops like wheat and paddy, he observed."

In Jammu and Kashmir, the night temperature at many places, including Ladakh, dipped even as the region is bracing up for possible heavy snowfall.Leh coldest in J&KAn official of the MeT Department said here that Leh continued to be the coldest place in the State as the mercury there settled at a low of minus 9.7 degrees Celsius on Saturday night. The nearby Kargil town was the second coldest place as it recorded a low of minus 9.2 degrees while Srinagar, recorded a low of minus 1.2 degree Celsius on Saturday night, a degree down from the previous night.The Meteorological Department has said a western disturbance would affect the State from Monday and warned of heavy rain and snowfall. In view of weather forecast, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has directed Divisional Administration of Kashmir to be in a state of preparedness.Ms. Mufti directed all departments to gear up in view of the weather forecast and deploy their men and machinery on the ground beforehand. She directed that there should be no delay in snow clearance operations and, as soon as it starts to accumulate, snow clearance machines should be pressed into service so that people do not face any inconvenience.Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Baseer Ahmad Khan on Saturday chaired the Divisional Disaster Management Authority meeting and reviewed the overall preparedness with the heads of various departments. Mr. Khan informed that for the first time every Deputy Commissioner has been given Rs. 52 lakh each as mitigation fund to meet any eventuality and further a sum of Rs. 58 lakh has been parked with Divisional Commissioner office beforehand. The meeting was also informed that essential commodities like LPG, petrol and diesel are stocked for almost 25 days and rice sufficient for two months.Intense cold wave conditions continued in Himachal Pradesh with heavy rain and snowfall likely in parts of the State on Monday. The mid and higher hills are expected to receive heavy rain or snowfall over next 48 hours while a wet spell with rain or snow at many places would continue till December 14, the local MeT office said.The minimum temperatures in Keylong and Kalpa was minus 2 and zero deg C respectively.

Ever since the launch of the Green Revolution in 1966, Punjab has been producing a record grain surplus year after year. Yet, over the years, it has turned into a graveyard for its farmers. There is hardly a day when reports of farmers committing suicide do not appear in Punjab newspapers.Take a look at the food procurement figures for 2017-18. Of the total wheat procurement of 308.24 lakh tonnes, Punjab had contributed 117.06 lakh tonnes, thereby providing more than 37% of the country's wheat requirement. As for rice, for which the procurement season is still in progress, Punjab had contributed 174.35 lakh tonnes till November 28. This is 67% of the total rice procurement of 258.18 lakh tonnes.In other words, Punjab continues to be the top contributor to the national food kitty. Whichever year, and regardless of the extent of climatic aberrations, Punjab has dutifully delivered food for the country.Now hold your breath. A bumper grain production year after year belies the grave tragedy that has been worsening with each passing year. According to a survey by Punjab Agricultural University, as many as 16,000 farmers and farm labourers have committed suicide in the past 17 years, between 2000 and 2017 - an average of about 900 suicides per year. Of these, 83% committed suicide distressed by a mountain of unpaid debt; and 76.1% of them owned less than two acres of land.Every third farmer in Punjab is below the poverty line. Still worse, nearly 66% of these farmers and farm labourers who took their own lives were young. Surely, like all young people, they too had dreams. What made them to abruptly end their lives?As if this is not enough, the Punjab government has gone back on its electoral promise to waive off Rs 2 lakh from each small farmer's outstanding debt. It has now clarified that if the outstanding loan of a small farmer, owning less than five acres, is even Rs 100 more than Rs 2 lakh, he will not be eligible for the loan waiver.The tragedies that have struck many families in rural Punjab symbolise the agony that the entire farming community is living in. Those who have refrained from taking the extreme step are no better. They continue to somehow survive, living under acute stress, mental agony, depression and hoping against hope. Still, the bigger question that remains unanswered is, how can the nation's food bowl turn into a farmers' graveyard? How can Punjab be in the deadly grip of an unending agrarian crisis?That such a tragic serial dance of death is being enacted in a state that is considered to be the most prosperous as far as agriculture is concerned tells us clearly that the crisis is the outcome of an inherently flawed farming model.I have heard agricultural economists and policymakers often blame low crop productivity, failure to diversify crops, and lack of irrigation. But, in a state which has 98% assured irrigation and where the per hectare yields of wheat and paddy match international levels, those cannot be the reasons for farmers' suicides. Instead, it's the opposite - high crop productivity-linked intensive farming model - that's to blame.Deeper crisisAs per Economic Survey 2016, the per hectare yield of wheat in Punjab stands at 4,500 kg/hectare which matches the wheat yields in the United States. In the case of paddy, the average yield is 6,000 kg/hectare, quite close to productivity levels in China. With such high yields and with abundant irrigation available, why should farmers be dying?To say that these farmers are lazy, drunkards or do not spend the loans for the purpose they take cannot be true. If it were so, I see no way Punjab could have topped global crop productivity; or how Punjab could feed the entire country with its grain surplus every year, and that too continuously for the past 50 years.Punjab is in a terrible crisis because of the economic and development policies that encourage intensive agriculture. To meet its food requirements, erstwhile Punjab (including Haryana, which later split) became the focal point of a highly intensive agriculture, beginning with wheat, rice and then followed by a shift towards cultivation of cotton as a cash crop.While intensive farming played havoc with soil fertility, necessitating application of more chemical fertilisers, excessive use and abuse of chemical pesticides has contaminated the food chain as well as the environment.The tragedy is that we haven't learnt any lessons. As if this is not enough, the effort now is to push Punjab deeper into the environmentally harmful web of agri-business, which requires more intensive farming, adding to more greenhouse gas emissions. It's like moving from the frying pan literally into fire.What Punjab desperately needs is to move away from the intensive cropping system. It requires a shift in the research mandate of the PAU, accompanied by policies and programmes that encourage farmers to shift without suffering any economic loss."

Elections have thus given an extended season of business season to various people. It is even more important for them as the marriage season got over on December 11, and the market is growing cold for them.Sound operator Sanjeev Gupta said that they usually get booking for this day every time. It is not the politicians or any political party that gives the booking. But the occasion is celebrated by the supporters of various leaders, he said.A group of dhol players and dancers has already reached Matour area of Kangra from Pathankot of Punjab . They say that they were in touch with many people and to manage their bookings, they have arrived in advance.

Pandit Deenanath Sharma , a Boti, resident of Ichi village in Kangra told that they have also received calls to be ready on the result day.We have arranged Brass utensils required to prepare Dham after getting phone calls. But bookings are yet to be confirmed. We will at least get our booking amount, even in case the lunch is cancelled, he said.Local politicians, of course, are not willing to talk about any preparations. They said that the arrangements and celebrations are usually done by supporters. We dont get involved into all these things as we had to sit inside the counting hall. This all is done by our supporters and it is their victory, said a contesting candidate, requesting anonymity."

Jethvas research also suggests that the increase in crop fires (about 500 per year between 2002 and 2016) could be linked to rising crop production in the region.He analysed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on Aqua satellite to track annual crop fire numbers. In his blog on the Nasa Earth Observatory website published earlier this year, Jethva also analysed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)  a measure for greenness that can indicate crop or vegetation cover.There seems to be a one-on-one relationship in NDVI measured by the MODIS sensor prior to harvest (September) and the total number of fire hotspots observed during the harvest season (October and November). This suggest that the increase in the number of fires is likely related to increasing crop production, the blog says.Jethva also refers to data from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics , department of agriculture, which says post-monsoon, rice crop production has increased at a linear rate of 0.18 million tonnes from 2002 to 2016 in Punjab. On November 5 last year, Delhi had suffered its worst smog episode in 17 years with average PM2.5 levels 14 times the 24-hour standard. In October-November last year, there were nearly 18,000 crop fires in Punjab and Haryana put together  the highest since 2002. The number of fires reduced in 2017  to a little more than 12,000  but still had a huge impact on air quality in NCR, according to experts.The impact of crop fires on air quality is accentuated by hostile meteorological conditions. During this smog episode, for example, ground wind speed was very low on most days, but wind direction was from north and northwest through Punjab and Haryana where crop stubble is being burnt over large stretches.IMD said mixing heights (also called boundary conditions)  the levels at which ground level winds mix with the higher winds and allow dispersion  has been extremely low, leading to a high concentration of pollution particles. But crop fires are also ruining soil health and depleting groundwater resources massively in these states. According to Ramanjaneyulu G V, executive director at Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , burning also leads to an immediate decline in the bacterial and fungal population in the top 2.5cm of the soil.Repeated burning permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50%, increasing farmers dependence on fertlisers and pesticides. He added that the problem of crop stubble burning started increasing since 2002. The depletion of groundwater levels made Punjab come up with a law in 2009, which makes sowing of paddy before June 15 a criminal offence. The law allows agriculture department officers to destroy the nursery or transplanted paddy. The uprooting costs are to be borne by farmers. The Act levies a penalty of Rs10,000 per hectare per month on the farmers who contravene it. It even allows field officers to disconnect power supply to a farmers field till the notified date if the farmer is found violating the law repeatedly. This left a very small window for farmers between kharif harvest and rabi sowing, forcing them to resort to burn off, Ramanjaneyulu said. He added: The prices of paddy have not increased in the last 10 years. As a result, farmers also felt spending more amount on removal of stubbles is not economically viable  so they burn off.Farmers from various farmer groups, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union, say an important factor could be increasing labour costs, which have led to more farmers taking up mechanised harvesting by using combines to harvest both paddy and wheat. Labour costs have increased drastically, its very difficult to find labour as well. So, more and more farmers have no option but to use combines to harvest crop, which leaves a stubble of about 1.5 feet. Earlier, once manually harvested, the stubble was used for fodder and manure, but you need labour to do all that. When you can generate electricity, make paper with crop stubble, why isnt it being done? asks Dharmendra Kumar of BKU.Kumar alleged that the reason farmers are being blamed now with these studies is because people in cities dont want to restrict their polluting cars. They want to live in comfort and blame the farmers for pollution.Many farmers say they want to give up paddy cultivation, but cant  because procurement prices for other crops are not fair.Solutions lie in finding uses for the stubble and assigning real economic value to it, so that burning is an economic loss to the farmer. Solutions are well known, in terms of infield use as manure to reduce fertilizer cost or generate power, or make fuel and material. But there is no clear strategy to build business cases around these solutions to scale or provide support to farmers to use this as manure, said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environments clean air campaign."

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: The central government, in consultation with states, proposes to launch a new price support scheme for farmers to prevent distress sales at prices below the minimum support price (MSP).Under the proposed market assurance scheme, states will be free to procure all crops from farmers for which MSPs are announced, except rice and wheat, which are already being procured by the centre for the public distribution system.Under the new scheme, the centre will compensate states for any losses capped at 30% of the procurement cost. It will be the states responsibility to dispose of the procured crops.The proposed scheme will ensure an assured price for the farmer, mitigating the price risks faced by farmers after harvest. Together with a prolonged spell of inadequate rains and two years of drought it has contributed towards rural distress.If successful, it will also politically benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), though it could place fiscal pressures on the Union government; in the just-concluded assembly election in Gujarat, one reason contributing to the BJPs less than usual performance was farmer angst triggered by rural distress.The system, as it exists now, under which only rice, wheat and small quantities of pulses and oilseeds are procured by the centre, leaves much to be desired, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by Mint. The new scheme proposes to strengthen the procurement mechanism to ensure that farmers do not suffer from marketing inefficiencies, as commonly reflected in the prices ruling lower than notified MSP for many commodities, it said.States will take ownership of the scheme, including which crop to procure and in what quantities, when wholesale prices drop below MSPs. State governments will be free to use the procured crops for targeted nutrition-support programmes such as mid-day meals for schoolchildren, or sell them in the open market.We have written to states to elicit their opinion on the scheme, and if they are interested we will launch the scheme, said a senior official at the agriculture ministry who declined to be named. According to this official, the letter to states was sent more than a month ago.The proposed scheme comes against the backdrop of a record harvest of cereals and pulses in 2016-17, which led to wholesale prices plunging below MSPs. The price crash has led to protests by farmer groups across the country since June, with demands for remunerative crop prices and loan waivers. While states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka have announced farm loan waivers that are at different stages of implementation, states like Madhya Pradesh have launched their own price support schemes for farmers growing pulses and oilseeds.Experts welcomed the move, but cautioned that it was at best a stopgap measure and that the eventual solution was to bring in greater competition in agricultural markets by dismantling existing cartels.While any intervention and attention to agriculture marketing is welcome, we must await full details of the scheme to make any specific comments, said Pravesh Sharma, farm expert and a visiting fellow at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. However, it can be generally observed that government does not seem to risk spending political capital to directly take on poorly functioning agriculture markets, where lack of competition, cartelization and opaque price discovery are the root causes of price distortions.Spending public money may be necessary in some instances, but the larger goal of reforming agricultural markets should not be lost sight of, he added."

Still High,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dry-still-highkallu-or-toddy-tadimahuakinnauri-195757?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-24,"Sonia SarkarBREWCREW: A Muria Gond tribal woman of central India prepares liquor from mahua (AFP)For tipplers in India, these are no happy hours. Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."

She told me there was scope for the business to really take off, and I took her word for it, and moved here, said Cho, whose restaurant, MyungGa located in South Point mall, has been serving authentic South Korean food for the last six years.Apart from delicacies, like rice cakes and dried seaweed rolls, Cho has adapted her menu to serve spicy food that may add to the appeal for Indians who arrive at her restaurant to give the food a try. The latter, she says, constitute 20% of the clientele for the outlet. The journey, however, has been far from easy, with hurdles ranging from administrative issues to continuous changing laws, the owner said.The rules and regulations governing the setting up of a restaurant themselves are so complicated and tedious, that even getting the license for my outlet took a lot of patience, Cho said.The dietary prohibitions also keep changing, which means we continuously have to adapt our menu. The beef ban, for example, limited our options a lot.Korean family Jin Ho Park and In A Lee with their sons, Joo Won and Joo Hwan in Gurgaon. (Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)We moved here seven years ago. I opened this store to pass my time. We mainly have a Korean clientele, but a lot of Indians come here.Chos restaurant, however, isnt the only option for residents of the city looking for authentic food from the Asia Pacific region. In the same building where MyungGa stands, authentic Japanese food is offered at Manami, a restaurant headed by a Japan resident Tomiyama Ryji, who has two other branches in the National Capital Region (NCR) itself, in Manesar and in New Delhi.The close proximity of the outlets serves as a metaphor as many residents of these two neighbours in the Pacific sea have, miles away from home, found themselves at each others doorsteps once again.According to the data available at the Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) in Gurgaon, there are more than 8,000 Japanese people, and 3,000 South Koreans currently living in the city. The two communities have become so prominent that they now have magazines in their languages, to help new arrivals settle in and make older residents aware of the latest developments and options in terms of luxuries, cuisine, and entertainment.Most South Korean and Japanese people, reside in the gated condominiums on the Golf Course Road, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, and the new sectors. One of the main reasons for their presence in the city is the fact that Gurgaon district houses several multinational companies native to the two countries such as Hyundai, Samsung, Honda, Mitsubishi, LG, Toyota, and Suzuki.Korean family Jin Ho Park and In A Lee with their sons, Joo Won and Joo Hwan in Gurgaon.

Prior to this, the family had been in Chennai for two years.We had never been to India before we moved here and were slightly apprehensive about certain things, especially safety. However, we have found it is a relatively easy place to live in, and people are by and large friendly, said Saengkaew, whose social circle in Gurgaon is a reflection of the extent to which the expat population has integrated with the locals.I have many Indian friends here, who have introduced me to the local culture and cuisine. I have learned how to make biryani.I have many Indian friends here, who have introduced me to the local culture and cuisine.

Over the last five years, the couple has spent a lot of their weekends exploring the country, travelling to places like Amritsar, Kolkata, Chennai, Mumbai, and Jaipur. While in the city, Saengkaews husband, meanwhile, has also been training students in Kendo, a modern Japanese martial art form, going to a school in Vasant Kunj for the purpose, along with other Japanese residents. In another gated condominium in DLF5, namely Magnolias, resides, In a Lee, who hails from South Korea and first moved to the city in 2014, with her husband, Jin-Ho Park, who works at a private company. The couple also has two sons, a 16-year-old Joo-Won and 12-year-old Joo-Hwan Park.Prior to their arrival, the family said they had to spent a fortnight eating primarily curries for their meals, in the hope of accustomizing themselves to the cuisine of the country. Settling in, however, they say, was much easier than they expected.While Jin-Ho said that Indians are easy to work with as a result of their hard work and non-egoistical natures, his wife boasts of a social circle that includes many local residents.I have a lot of friends here. I have been exposed to a lot of aspects of life here, which I may not have known otherwise. I go for dance classes and yoga classes with them, and have even learned how to make chapattis, said Lee, adding that she is also fascinated by big Indian gatherings.
