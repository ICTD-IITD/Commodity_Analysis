58f4d19360de470aa339c273,Lives touched with extraordinary passion,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160101/jsp/nation/story_61559.jsp,2016-01-01,"HAND THAT FEEDS G.C. Shekhar in Chennai Picture: Arun Shanker Just before six in the morning, one corner of Pycrofts Road in Triplicane, central Chennai, wakes to the bustle of traffic and the tea stalls. But to one man waiting on the terrace of a two-storey building, its already breakfast time for his 3,000 friends. For the past hour, C. Sekar had been placing clumps of boiled rice, washed in water, on a dozen wooden planks. He inspects his work, washes his hands and steps back into the narrow staircase. Dont worry, theyll be here any minute, the 62-year-old says. As if on cue, a flurry of green wings arrives, screeching. A few at first, then a dozen more, till there are hundreds of them, as though Chennais entire parrot population has invaded Sekars home. For the next one hour, its a wavy sea of green on the terrace, broken at the edges by the black of a few pigeons, outnumbered in their own backyard. The parrots line up on the mesh of TV cables and eye the terrace gingerly before dropping onto the planks.As one batch finishes, another flies in amid an incessant cacophony of parrot talk. The occasional bus horn or vroom of a motorbike sends them into a brief tizzy before they land back on the planks. One hour later, the last of the parrots flies out, leaving behind the handful of local pigeons. Theyll be back at five in the evening for dinner, Sekar says. I tried counting them along with a few college students, and our estimate is that we get about 3,000 parrots a day. The love affair began in December 2004, a few days after the tsunami, when Sekar spotted a few parrots on his terrace. He threw a handful of grains at them and found they were only too happy to polish them off. I realised they were unable to find food, so I kept some rice ready next evening only to see more birds arriving. Their numbers kept increasing and they began arriving in the morning as well, expecting me to feed them twice a day. Sekar, who repairs cameras and has a collection of over 4,000 vintage cameras and accessories, some as old as 200 years, uses up 60kg of boiled rice every day, which comes to Rs 600 a day. Initially, all the money came out of my own pocket but seeing my dedication, several nature lovers now contribute every month. So my personal expense is only Rs 12,000 a month. A local trader supplies the rice at wholesale rates, Sekar says. A wildlife official who visited him after hearing about the parrots has told him the birds come from a national park near the IIT, from the Theosophical Societys large gardens and from a few cemeteries. He said the parrots do not fly more than 10km for food and are happy to find a regular feeding spot on my terrace.The routine means Sekar has rarely stepped out of Chennai these last 11 years. He left on his latest outstation visit, to a relatives wedding, after laying the breakfast spread in the night and returned before evening. A few of his neighbours tried to copy Sekar by laying out the same rice breakfast but the parrots simply ignored them. I gave up after a few days as the parrots preferred Sekars food to mine, said Shyam Das, who sells automobile spares and lives two streets away. Still, Sekar has to watch his friends eat from the staircase: They are wild creatures, you see  theyd fly away as soon as they see anyone on the terrace. The pictures had to be taken with a remote camera or from another terrace, hiding behind a cloak. During the recent floods, the number of parrots nearly doubled to 5,000 as they couldnt find food elsewhere, says Sekar. Every shower washed the rice away and Sekar, wearing a raincoat, kept replenishing the planks. This went on for almost 10 hours during non-stop rain on December 1. Sekar cant think of life without the parrots. Im willing to give away my camera collection to a museum; Ill be happy to spend the rest of my life feeding the parrots. What will happen to the birds after him? They found me, Im sure theyll find another like me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MAN O SCRIPTS Muzaffar Raina in Srinagar Picture: Muzaffar Raina When hundreds of his peers from Srinagars old city were trotting across the Line of Control to receive arms training a quarter century ago, a young Manzoor Ahmad Daikoo was keeping alive a legacy often associated with the Valleys fleeing Pandits. He was collecting rare manuscripts, some over a millennium old, that were getting lost to the mayhem following theadvent of militancy. I have more than 11,000 manuscripts, more than the state archives department has and perhaps the largest individual collection in north India, Daikoo, now 50, says. He calls the collection, stacked in racks and gunny bags at his home in suburban Nishat, the Kashmir Research Institute. Sure enough, it keeps attracting scholars from across the country and abroad. Many of my manuscripts are from unknown authors and without a second copy. Many are original, unpublished scripts, Daikoo says. Ive manuscripts written on paper, birch bark and even cloth.... They can buy me a fortune but Ill never sell them.Daikoo has what his mentor Triloki Nath Ganjoo, former Sanskrit professor at Kashmir University and a Shaivism expert, avers is a rare complete manuscript of the famed Kathasaritsagar, a 10th-century collection of stories. Most of the manuscripts are in the Sharda Lipi, the ancient script for Kashmiri and Sanskrit writing, or Persian.I also have manuscripts in Kashmiri (in the calligraphic Nastaliq script), Punjabi, Hindi and English.... I have pieces written with fingernails, called khat-e-nakhoon, an ancient art, Daikoo says. He explains that these were written without ink, by using specially pruned and nurtured fingernails as styluses to make fine grooves on paper that last centuries. I have a couple of manuscripts of nail-written religious literature in Sharda, around 300 years old. They are among my most prized possessions. What inspired Daikoo? Like many others in the Valley, mostly the Pandits, he had inherited a collection of manuscripts from his forefathers. When the Pandits migrated, many left behind their valuable collections, much of which was in danger of falling into the hands of thieves. Besides, the security forces, in their hunt for subversive writing, were questioning people over every piece of literature they possessed, prompting many to destroy their manuscripts. Even my uncle dumped a bag of scrolls once in the Jhelum to save his skin and mine, Daikoo says. That motivated me to do all I could to preserve these documents. I tried to convince whoever would listen that they were precious. I started buying as many as I could. He says he has travelled to Hyderabad, Badaun and Punjab to procure parts of his collection. But most of it was from Kashmir, covering aspects of Kashmiri life ancient and modern, from history, philosophy and religion to politics, literature and medicine. Many are about Kashmiri Shaivism or Trikishastra as it is called. There are translations of the Ramayan and the Mahabharat in Persian. One book shows how much our ancestors knew about the veterinary sciences. He says he has unpublished writing by Urdu poets from the last century, such as Brij Narain Chakbast and Nand Lal Farsi. Daikoo, who translates oriental literature for a living, had inherited large tracts of land, some of which he sold  he says they would fetch crores at current prices  to buy the manuscripts. Ganjoo says Kashmirs rich tradition of writing grew partly from its cold winters when many would sit indoors and write. He said there were 30 lakh Sharda manuscripts across the world, much of it taken away by western scholars during British rule. Daikoo also has thousands of books, administrative orders and key documents of past regimes, and old photographs, coins and newspapers. He says he never received any assistance. Only once I received preservatives worth Rs 1.6 lakh from the government. Most of his collection is therefore poorly preserved, stacked in gunny bags and easy prey for termites. Preserving them scientifically costs a lot. I approached the state government but it offered no help, he says.Nor did the Centres director of manuscriptology when Ganjoo met him, he says. Only 3,500 of Daikoos manuscripts are catalogued. You need experts to do that and you have to pay them. I spent Rs 2.6 lakh on cataloguing; I couldnt afford more, he says. He is saving up to build a preservation chamber on his lawns. It will take me Rs 30 lakh to build but I shall be better able to preserve them, he signs off. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FACE OF SCARRED MEMORIES Muzaffar Raina in Chahal, Baramulla When human rights activist Khurram Parvez wants to put a face to Kashmirs disappeared youths, he thinks of a very wrinkled one. Its the face of Baramulla farmer Atta Mohammad Khan, 82, who Khurram says is the only man in the Valley ready to declare he has buried nameless dead brought by the security forces  all 235 of them. Rights groups that estimate 8,000 men went missing in custody  the state says the number is far lower  want an international probe to find out who are buried in the unmarked graves. They claim to have found 2,700 unmarked graves containing more than 2,943 bodies in three of the Valleys 10 districts alone: Bandipora, Baramulla and Kupwara. Khan was the only gravedigger who came forward to speak about these graves and thus became the face of that expose. He said that at the most he could get killed, said Khurram, coordinator of the J&K Coalition of CivilSociety. I have buried some 235 people there (the local graveyard), Khan acknowledged at his ramshackle home in Chahal village, 80km from Srinagar. He gave them a proper burial, after conducting a funeral, when the security forces came from nearby camps with bodies and asked the village to bury them  a common occurrence across the Valley during the height of militancy.Khan volunteered because none else would, fearing trouble from either the forces or the militants. That was from 2002 till 2006, before the graveyard ran out of room. Manzor Ahmad points to one of the graves. Pictures: Muzaffar Raina Now Khan is bedridden with multiple ailments and his memory is almost gone. But one thing he doesnt forget is to keep reminding his son Manzoor Ahmad to take care of the graveyard. One of those buried at the graveyard was a six-month-old girl. I remember the army saying she was killed in crossfire. Nobody has ever come looking for her, Manzoor said. If that was one of the most heartbreaking sights Khan had to see, he was spared another. When the forces brought the body of his nephew Mohammad Salim one day, Khan was not home and, for once, somebody else buried him, Manzoor said. Later, when we checked the photograph (clicked by the police), he turned out to be a cousin of mine. He was not a militant but had been missing for a year or so. Khan, despite his failing eyesight and memory, tried to remember the appearances of the bodies he had buried so he could later help families who came looking for missing loved ones. Around half a dozen of the graves now have tombstones with names inscribed on them. My father helped identify them, Manzoor said. Some of them, possibly, were militants and some were not. Manzoor said the burials affected his fathers health over the years. I would help him bury these bodies, which were badly mutilated and in many cases defaced, he said. Every burial would leave him deeply disturbed and haunted by bad dreams for days. After the rights groups came out with a report titled Buried Evidence in 2009, with Khan the sole gravedigger who testified, the forces came looking for him and asked troubling questions. We faced harassment but were not harmed, Manzoor said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TURNING A CORNER Nishit Dholabhai in New Delhi Good morning, sir, the cabbie says in English. His accent, body language and ease of manner suggest a college education. Er, how far did you study? I ask hesitantly, wondering if he might see it as unwarranted curiosity. Well, I have a degree in civil engineering, he says after a moments pause and bursts out laughing. I join him, in disbelief and surprise. Ramit Arora, 29, had sometime in 2012 decided that signing up with Ola Cabs made better sense than sticking to his Rs 10,000-a-month construction supervisors job with realtor Gaursons India Limited in Ghaziabad. Id learnt by word of mouth how much they earned, the Ghaziabad businessmans son who graduated from a private engineering college in Meerut said, changing gears as he tackled the evening traffic at Mandi House, New Delhi. So, borrowing a little from friends, he bought a car. Today, he says, he works over 12 hours a day and earns at least Rs 90,000 a month. Ramit explained he had to pay Ola a portion of the fare, which rises sharply during the peak hours  6am to 11am and 4pm till late evening (a 25km ride in Delhi between 4.30pm and 6pm on December 6 cost me Rs 478). But the key is the incentive of Rs 225 per trip that Ola pays him during the peak hours  to pre-empt attrition in a fiercely competitive taxi-hailing industry. I hardly have to wait 10 minutes between two trips, said Ramit, looking smart in his Ola uniform  white linen kurtas with shoulder straps and matching jootis. But the road to prosperity offered a few tricky turns. First, the family found his new profession demeaning. When his sister, a lawyer, got married Ramit told his family he had hired a driver for his cab  just to spare them embarrassment before the in-laws. Harder to handle has been the condescending attitude of some of the passengers, who would address him with a tu and often speak disrespectfully. One afternoon there were some extremely impolite passengers; I dropped them halfway, near another cab, with folded hands and said I didnt want the fare, Ramit said. The company told me my ratings (which Ola seeks religiously from the passengers) would drop but I said I cant compromise on self-respect. Aprameya Radhakrishna, who founded TaxiForSure with Raghunandan G. before selling the company to Ola, said the average monthly income of a cabbie attached to a taxi-aggregating company was Rs 50,000. Theres a social mobility, with even students working as part-time drivers, he told The Telegraph. But Radhakrishna warned that Ramit and his peers might be enjoying a first-mover advantage that might not last. As the taxi-hailing industry grows  estimates suggest a combined fleet of 300,000 taxis in major Indian cities  only a handful of competitors would be left standing and the fares would rise while the incentives for drivers fell, he said. Ramit, whose father runs a wholesale grocery business in Uttar Pradesh, has inspired a cousin, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering, to become an Ola driver too. Ive been driving a cab for two years but my family doesnt know. Ill tell them once I buy a second car and hire a driver  that will raise my status, said the young man, who earlier worked in the machine tools department of a well-known gear company near Delhi. He asked that his name not be revealed lest it interfere with his marriage prospects. Ramit ducked a query about his marriage plans, smiling and saying he needed to save money first. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A LONG INNINGS Piyush Srivastava in Muzaffarnagar Pictures: Naeem Ansari When a young Vijay Singh walked out to bat  stage a dharna outside the Muzaffarnagar collectors office, actually  P.V. Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister and Sourav Ganguly a mere Test hopeful. Almost 20 years from that day  February 26, 1996  the frail-looking 54-year-old is still at the crease, on the same dharna, protesting large-scale land grab in his village of Chausana, 73km away. Thats nearly two decades spent non-stop on the roadside in rain and shine, 44C summer to 5C winter, protected by a canvas tent, surviving on roti and vegetables he cooked on a brick chulha and then a kerosene stove, leaving his post only to use the nearest public toilet. Except that one time the ex-schoolmaster had to visit Chausana when his father died in 2002. And, oh, that other time in 2006 when he had to be taken to hospital after suffering a mild heart attack. A few things have changed since last year, though. A sympathetic administration has allowed him to shift to an unused veranda inside the collectorate premises, where he has set up home with three plastic curtains. And he has an LPG cylinder, provided by an admirer. Masterji, enough is enough, go home now, a fresh-faced additional district magistrate would tell him now and then. Only after you meet my demands, would be the instant reply out of the 5-foot-7, 65kg frame. The DMs dont talk to him: he has seen off 23 of them, including a few who tried to browbeat him. Nowadays he sometimes leaves the spot to speak on human rights at school functions. Masterji has become part of Muzaffarnagars lore. The hawkers give him Hindi newspapers for free every morning. His handful of fans now contribute Rs 2,500 every month, so hes stopped accepting the money that his nearly estranged family of well-to-do farmers used to send through acquaintances. Singhs wife Pushpa, whom he left to bring up three young children all by herself, and son Gopal, a 21-year-old BSc student, look after their 23-bigha land, which grows sugarcane, paddy and wheat. Daughters Kalpana, 25, and Sakshi, 23, are doing MSc and BEd, respectively. Initially, my wife would call me a godly character because I was fighting for others. But after the first four-five years she began objecting. Now they all think Im crazy, Singh rued. Gopal and Kalpana accuse their father of being uncaring and doing nothing for them. The son last visited him three years ago but his daughters sometimes call him. In Singhs conservative boondocks, his wife isnt expected to travel and meet him in public. Does he feel guilty about abandoning them? Occasionally, yes, but he believes the cause is bigger. A boys cry It wasnt Singhs plots the mafia grabbed but 4,000 bighas of the government-owned gram sabha land, leased to Chausanas landless to grow food. Since 1982, when he was 21 and had just begun teaching economics and civics at the village school, Singh had been writing these victims applications and accompanying them to the collectorate. My life changed on a February evening in 1996 when, on my way home from school, I overheard an eight-year-old begging his mother for roti. She had none to give because the familys plot had been snatched, he said. I wept through the night. While there was so much fertile land, a child was sleeping hungry. I decided to quit my job and take up this fight, but I hadnt the foggiest that it would stretch 20 years. Within days, he had pitched his tent at the dharna sthal, a designated place for protests just outside the collectorate gates  a feature in many Uttar Pradesh districts. As a rich landowner, he could have led a comfortable life but chose to fight for others. Thats why we respect him, said Devraj Panwar, the man who provides the LPG cylinders. It was here that Singh had felt chest pain one day nine years ago. I had the phone number of the then city magistrate, V.K. Singh, whom I somehow managed to call from my mobile. He came and took me to hospital, Singh said. Nowadays, when I occasionally catch a fever, I can go to any doctor in town. They all know me and never ask for fees. We know his struggle is genuine but the land mafia have political patronage, said a district official, pleading anonymity because chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is seized of the matter. Singh had undertaken a 19-day, 610km padayatra to Lucknow and met Akhilesh on April 28, 2012. Akhilesh ordered a probe, which helped free 300 of the 4,000 bighas the same year. But progress has stalled again. Appreciation has been coming, though, with the Limca Book of Records in 2011 declaring Singhs protest the longest continuous one-man agitation in the country and the India Book of Records honouring him for his non-political, non-violent satyagraha the following year. What if he achieves his end some day, will he go back home? A shadow crosses Singhs face. I dont know if I can, he says. Since most of the land-grabbers are my fellow Thakurs, I fear ostracism if I return to Chausana. Besides, my familys alienated from me. So will he spend the rest of his life on this veranda? Havent thought about that yet, he replies slowly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INSULT TO CRUSADE Basant Rawat in Rangpar Picture: Basant Rawat Ratna Ala couldnt see their faces but the mocking laughter rang in his ears. What use is information for a blind man? Get lost, son, the sarpanch said to a chorus of guffaws. That moment changed the now 39-year-old Alas life, turning a mild-mannered, disabled herdsman in Kathiawad into a Right to Information crusader feared by the mafia and corrupt officials alike. This was sometime in 2007. Ala had been listening to a radio programme on the RTI Act, enforced since October 2005, and was impressed. Why dont I do something about my problem? he thought. So he turned up at the local panchayat office in Rangpar, 40km from Rajkot, to ask why they werent repairing the rutted village road he was finding difficult to negotiate. Their rudeness deeply disturbed me. But it made me think, Ala told this newspaper. He wondered how much a man who could only read Braille do. Ala had lost his father at 15 and studied till Class X with help from a philanthropic organisation. So, when he learnt about the RTI helpline run by the Ahmedabad-based NGO Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel, the first question he asked Pangti Jog, one of its officials, was: Can a blind man file an RTI plea? Of course, why not? she assured him before teaching him how to draft an RTI application. Since then, Ala has been unstoppable. The reply to his first RTI query told him the village road had been repaired twice in the past two years. On paper, that is. Ala got a local newspaper in Rajkot, 40km away, to publish the story, and the road was repaired soon. The same year, 2007, Ala prevented 281 acres of village pastures from being illegally handed over to a clock factory by local officials. In 2010, he exposed Rangpars incorrect voter list braving threats from a political group that thrived on bogus voting. A friend told me that when he went to correct his name on the voter list, he saw many names without photographs, Ala said. His RTI plea revealed that the rolls carried the names of 35 who had left the village and 10 who had died. A grateful Rangpar fielded him as a peoples candidate in the local polls three years ago and elected him its deputy sarpanch unopposed, sending him to the office from where he had returned insulted five years earlier. He then found out that the mining mafia was scooping out moram, a soft gravel, from village grazing land at night.They had political patronage and tried all kinds of tactics, he said. Some people came to my home in my absence and warned my wife Ila that since both of us are blind, they would eliminate us and nobody would be the wiser. Like the former sarpanch, they would soon learn that abusing his blindness only helped stiffen Alas resolve. So they tried a new tack, offering to build Ala a two-storey house. My fight goes on, the 12-bigha owner said in the two-room thatched house he shares with Ila and school-going sons Ajay and Ashish, a few yards from a polished village road that stands witness to how Ala humbled the scoffers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THUMBS-UP TO LIFE Ananthakrishnan G in Kochi Sometimes, asking the wrong question can lead to a right answer. Its perhaps the best lesson little Amrita Antony of Kochi has learnt in school. An anxious query by the Class III girl, heartbroken at a younger mates brain tumour, has triggered a campaign by her school that will help save lives and was highlighted before the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Except that the Prime Minister did not know of Amrita, or teacher Abhilash T. Prathap who found the answer to her query, or the unfortunate Bhavana Lakshmi who had inspired it. Cant we give her a new brain? an anguished Amrita had demanded at the school parliament at St Marys Upper Primary School, Kochi. She had just learnt that Lakshmi, the Class I girl who had stopped coming to school last year, was severely ill even after two brain surgeries. No, what Amrita had asked for was impossible. But it provided to the young Sanskrit teacher Prathap his eureka moment. It was an innocent question from Amrita. Its impact hit us a little later, and the discussion veered to organ donations. Participants wondered what we could do to spread awareness, said headmistress Shajimol K. Thomas. It was then that Prathap suggested the map. It was this colour map of India, printed on a sheet of cloth and covered with white thumb impressions that give it a mottled look, which was sent to Modi with a request to promote organ donations. The 2,500 thumbprints signified 2,500 signatories. Four large pieces of cloth were sewn together for the map, which was displayed as our 400 pupils organised a street play on organ donation on August 11, Prathap said. The onlookers and passers-by gave their thumb impressions. Till now, the school has got 150 adults, including many of its teachers, to actually sign up with an authorised NGO, pledging their organs after their death. Of course, organs can be harvested only from beating-heart cadavers  patients who have suffered brain death while being attached to a ventilator that keeps their hearts and lungs functioning. This is a possibility when death is caused by conditions such as head injury (as in road accidents), stroke or a brain aneurysm. Still, signing up formally means that if any of the 150 are eligible to donate organs after death, their relatives cannot block it. Initially, I was surprised: why a map of India from thumb impressions? Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat broadcast on October 15, before lauding the schools efforts. When the school celebrated its newfound fame, it invited Lakshmi too. She was happy but didnt seem to understand what it was for, Thomas said. Lakshmi has been advised 30 chemotherapies but the family had to stop after three as she was growing increasingly nauseous. We funded the second surgery in July by mortgaging our house, her father R.S. Moorthy, an auto driver, said.Prathap has his own problems. Like many other teachers in government-aided schools, he and his wife, a fellow Sanskrit teacher in another school, are not paid because the government is yet to recognise their posts. The matter is in court while Prathap, father of a nine-month-old girl, works part-time as a welder and gas-stove repairer to sustain the family. All the while devising new ways of thumbing his nose at adversity, no doubt. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FOR THEM, WORLDS A SCHOOL Nalin Verma in Araria Kerala Public School is hardly a signboard youd expect to see in a north Bihar town, 10km from the Nepal border and 2,500km from the state whose name it bears. Nor would the school have existed in Araria, or drawn the Election Commissions attention during this years polls, if gun-toting Naga militants hadnt visited the home of the owners  Bindu and N.J. Shaju  in Assam a decade ago.If thats confusing, first things first. After getting a BA in English in her home district of Wayanad, Bindu had trained as a nurse and joined a hospital in Lumding, Assam, in the late 90s. It was a low-paid job in a small hospital. Id been a good student and wanted to shift to teaching which I loved, Bindu, 40, said. I applied and got a job at Don Bosco School, Lumding, in the year 2000. Her family married her off the same year to Wayanad boy Shaju who, after graduating in English, was running a grocery. He was only too glad to join his wifes school as a fellow teacher. We lived happily. Then the terrorists targeted migrants, Bindu said. Four men brandishing firearms and sickles barged into our home and set us a deadline to leave. Many of the couples relatives and friends from Kerala, working as professionals, teachers and nurses in Lumding, left because of the threat. After several fearful days, we received a call from some of our relatives and friends who were working in southeast Bihars Maoist-hit Jamui-Munger region, where missionaries from Kerala run several educational institutions, Shaju, 43, said. We caught a train to Jamui. But the wages at the private school that recruited them were very low. So they left for Lakhisarai to work at a girls school. Members of the land mafia were on the schools board and fought among themselves. The school was in perennial turmoil: our wages were kept pending for months, Shaju said. So, on to north Bihar and Araria. This time they opened their own school from a rented house. It was 2009.We were given two small rooms at a congested place. The landlord fleeced us, and we didnt attract enough students, barely 15-20, Shaju said. We began looking for another neighbourhood. Picture: Nalin Verma A violent tropical storm that struck in April 2010 and killed 90-odd in north Bihar also left an asbestos-roof house in Ararias Mahadev Chowk devastated. The owner was very generous; he rented it out to us on a nominal rent and asked us to open the school, Shaju said. We had no money; so we removed the debris ourselves and shifted here in 2010. Five years on, Kerala Public School has 320 students including 80 girls and stands as a beacon in a district whose literacy rate of 55.1 per cent trails the national average of 74.04. Of the 15 teachers, 11 are from Kerala. People here believe that teachers from Kerala are better. We too feel a connection because we believe we have something to offer to these backward areas whose new generation wants to study, Shaju said. Literacy is high in Kerala, so is the competition in the field of education. Bihar gave us the chance to follow our passion. The English-medium school, affiliated to the CBSE, draws the children of Ararias middle class and its elite  district officials, Sashastra Seema Bal officers and local businessmen. Bindu said the tuition fee was Rs 450 to Rs 500 a month. Its an extremely good school, an SSB officer averred. My kid is doing well. Shes learnt to speak English. The couples younger son Shabil, 11, lives with them but the elder Shabin, 13, studies in Thiruvananthapuram.The school caught the eye of the election authorities who paraded its students on Ararias streets ahead of the Assembly polls to urge people to vote. District officials and townspeople had perhaps told them what they told this newspaper: that Bindu and Shaju ran Ararias best school."

Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said it was evident from the fact that the state government was not helping farmers who want to move away from wheat-paddy circle in Punjab.He said farmers should be motivated to grow maize, pulses, oilseeds, fodder crops and horticultural crops by offering them viability gap fund (VGF) of Rs 5,000-8,000 a hectare, which will make it as remunerative as rice and paddy.Mann said the state and Centre had not kept a tab on the fall in basmati prices and the rates dipped from Rs 4,500 per quintal in 2014 to Rs 1,700 per quintal this season even as the production had fallen by more than 38%, which had led to heavy losses to farmers. ""The anti-farmer policies of SAD-BJP government are affecting farmers, who failing to manage their lives are taking extreme steps like committing suicides,"" he said.Talking about the kinnow growers in Punjab, AAP leader Kultar Singh Sandhwan said 42,795 hectare area was under the citrus fruit crop, but the government had failed to facilitate the farmers. He said kinnow growers were forced to sell the fruit at very low price while the market price was more than double."

Pongal, a Tamil dish made from rice and dal, is as delectable in its various cooking styles, some of which are highlighted by city residents here.IAS Sibi Chakkravarthy, MPCVET director""I've been in Bhopal since August 2014 and the most that I miss here are the beaches. Pongal is an ode to agriculture lands and we being far from ours, try to do our best to imbibe the same spirit. We purchase sugarcanes, a new pot, get 'pachai arasi' and perform the ritual of making Pongal in wee hours. Turmeric leaves are tied around the pot and it is said the direction in which the cooked Pongal oozes out of the pot symbolises prosperity.

Meeting elders to receive blessings, going out with cousins and friends, eating sugarcane besides the festival environment are things we long for. Drawing Kolam, decorating the house with mango leaves, preparing Pongal, worshipping Sun God along with our friends who are our extended relatives are some of the things we do.My secret Pongal recipe has equal amount of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee along with pieces of cardamom, raisins, clove and edible camphor.""Dr N Ganesh, Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital""My father came to Bhopal first in 1959 from Mandaikadu in Kanya Kumari district of Tamil Nadu.

We wake up at 3 am and draw Kolam outside the house to mark purity. Celebrations are at peak around 5am when the sun rises.I personally am very fond of my traditions.

Tamils hardly leave their food behind. Knowledge of Tamil food here is limited to idli and dosa. However, there is so much more to southern food. I make appam and stew very often and we are also introducing it on our hotel menu soon. My wife is basically from the north but appreciates our food a lot. We are also introducing Malabar parathas with kurma and a range of Chettinad curries on the menu as there is none one else in the city with such offerings."

The four of us were huddled in the back seat of Madhurikas shiny black Ambassador car, while her plump maid with curly hair, Phelomina, sat in front, next to the old driver Swamy. We did this often, going on long drives around Chennais winding roads, feeling the warm breeze blowing on our faces, and singing along loudly with Debbie, or Madonna! We were carefree and cozy in each others company.Sometimes we would go to the Marina beach, where we would get off, roll up our jeans, and dip our feet in the frothy cool sea waves. Then we would dig our toes into the wet sand, and write our names, always together, in one big heart-shape. Mona, Maya, Madhurika, and Me.the four of us were Best Friends. Everyone in our small city knew that we were inseparable.They are like four bodies and one soul!, people would comment, either amazed or jealous of our proximity. We spent our evenings mostly at each others homes, comfortable in the diverse cultures and families we came from.Maya, half-Tamilian and half-American, always had that foreign touch about her! She was the best athlete in school, thanks to her long strong limbs. The downside to those were that it made her clumsy and tom-boyish! Her very short golden-brown hair and rubber-band braces didnt help either! Her bungalow was designed like the ones in the popular TV series,Beverly Hills 90210! She had a high four-poster bed, and we always hid under it with a lamp on, gossiping about the other girls in school, or giggling and blushing over a cute boy! We also spent hours staring at teen-idol posters (River Phoenix and George Michael), pasted on her wardrobe! Soon we followed the intense delicious whiff coming from her large open kitchen, where freshly baked warm apple-pie, and butter sauted sausages and corn would be waiting for us.Mona, was a flirtatious wild-child. She was slightly older than the three of us and bullied us into trying our first sip of beer and talking to the boys! We were somewhat envious of her curves, (which she developed much before us), and her Punjabi fair-skin and pretty face. I think Jaganathan has a crush on me, and maybe I will kiss him someday, she said, as we listened to her awe-struck! She was feisty and rebellious, but her eyes had a sadness that she could not hide. We would squeeze into her single bed and hold her tight, whenever she felt low, though we never knew the reason. She never told us. Hmm.Madhurika, came from a conservative Brahmin background, and everything about her reflected that. Her hair was always in a neat-long-oiled plat, that reached the back of her knees. She wore thick rimmed glasses, her skirts were pleated and came up to her calves. She looked longingly at Monas hot shorts, but never dared to ask for permission to wear them. She was simply brilliant at academics, and stood first in class year after year. Her de-stressing mechanism was to solve math problems, while we would be busy relishing hot meals (heaps of soft rice with dollops of ghee,yellow parappu-dal, and fried apalam), served on banana leaves by the staff a her home all dressed in white veshtis, with grey vibudhi powder across their foreheads! Come on, lets study, she would say enthusiastically!My half-Marwari and half-Telugu genes made for quite an interesting mix! I was an all rounder, and was surprisingly good at everything I did! A sweet, soft-spoken and sensible girl is how one could describe me. But somehow I was also confused most of the times, with many questions in my head! We would discuss these, at our favourite place, in my red-and-white tiled bungalow the terrace, where we would sit on the ledge, our legs dangling dangerously, biting into my Nanis precious besan ka ladoos, that she would send from Mumbai. This is also the place where we made a promiseof being friends for eternity.forever. Then why did we break it? We did we let our friendship fade away? Wasnt it stronger than that? Where are you girls now? I have heard bits-and -pieces from others, over the years, but is it true?Maya, you went away to America, and married a Bengali there, and you both are now living in Kolkata? Do you have kids? Mona..you became a fashion designer, and eloped with a very handsome rock star to Los Angeles? Why am I not surprised? Madhurikayou are now a double Phd, and I dont know anything more about you. Also, dont you all want to know what happened with me? Well, when I moved to Mumbai, I fell head-over-heels in love with a Punjabi, whom I eventually married and now am a mother to a tween girl and lil boy!Many years have gone by twenty-two to be precise. Why have the four of us not tried to stay in touch? Are we scared that maybe we are not the same people anymore? But how much can we change? Or have we actually forgotten each other? Can we, after all the moments we have had? Maybe we are all too busy with our own lives, building new relationships and ignoring the old ones? I guess, sometimes in life we may drift apartfar far awayyet, if we can manage to find a way back, we must. True friendship, just like true love, is rare to find, and the feelings never go away. This may sound like a clich, but it is as real as it gets.I still think of youll, my Best Friends. Maybe not everyday, but I do. So, you know what.it is never too late. I am going to find you all, whichever corner of the world you might be in! Get to know you all again. We can be there for each other, just like we used to. Maybe we need that now, even more so. At least I know I do. I am so excited to do thisto connect with youll again. But somewhere deep in my heart, I am also a little nervous, because I am hoping, Do you feel the same. An eternal flame?"

The SP was accused of attempting to aid the accused through re-opening of investigations.The case related to embezzlement of paddy worth about Rs 5 crore, allegedly by the owner of Jagmohan Enterprises Rice Mill, Jagmohan Singh.

We will eventually succeed, Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister Gaurishankar Bisen told The Sunday Express, a day after Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal gave their ruling.Principal Secretary (Agriculture) Rajesh Rajora said the state and other applicants had submitted detailed documentary evidence, such as the gazetteers during the British rule, to shore up the states case. He said the appeal will be filed in the next few days.Though there are hundreds of varieties of long grain and scented rice grown all over the world, basmati is the best known due to its unique properties attributable to agro-climatic conditions prevailing in a geographical area.The assistant registrar had asked APEDA to include some districts in Madhya Pradesh that grow basmati before giving GI tag to the rice grown in parts of seven states, including Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The APEDA, which functions under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, had challenged the erroneous order on several grounds. While arguing against MPs inclusion, APEDA claimed to have legally challenged in 40 countries third party attempted registrations in the name of basmati or any deceptive variations.Saying MPs evidence was based on improper verification and illegible and unreadable documents, it was argued that the state does not fall in the Indo Gangetic Plain. In the 235 goods granted GI tag by the registry, only two have been challenged so far.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f4bd7260de4776e3694547,Tea garden hands drop return plan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160210/jsp/siliguri/story_68456.jsp,2016-02-10,"Feb. 9: Over 350 people who left the ailing Bagracote Tea Estate for other states in search of jobs have cancelled their plan to return home after the management backtracked from an assurance to pay workers their dues in phases from January 31. Bagracote in the Dooars is one of the 14 estates owned by the Duncans Industries Ltd and workers complained that there had been irregularities in distribution of rations and payment of wages in all the gardens since April last year. On January 22, the management told the state government that workers would be paid their dues in phases from January 31 and activities in the garden would be regularised from February 1. However, the Centre authorised the Tea Board on January 28 to take over seven of the 14 gardens. Following the decision, the management decided not to go ahead with the January 22 assurance in the remaining seven gardens, including Bagracote. ""So far, 372 men in Bagracote have migrated to states like Kerala, Haryana, Punjab and Tamil Nadu and are doing odd jobs at industrial establishments and construction sites to run their families. The migration had started in June and even last month, a number of workers left the garden in search of jobs,"" said Hemant Pradhan, a resident of Bagracote. According to him, these people were sending money to their families who were still staying in the garden. ""They could at least save their families from death because back in the garden, it is only rice which is available from the state government. Many of them would speak of the problems they are facing at the new workplace,"" said Pradhan. The dues in all the 14 Duncan gardens were said to be around Rs 70 crore. Several deaths have also been reported in some gardens although the suspected cause - malnutrition - has not been conclusively established. After the January 22 assurance by the management, over 350 men, most of whom were workers in Bagracote, decided to come back home from their current work sites. People like Francis Lakra who is in Chennai and Kishore Chhetri who is in Kerala, decided to buy train tickets. ""Those staying outside Bengal were happy to hear the promise. The family members told them that it was imperative that they were back in the garden and collected the dues. They had to spend extra money to get the train tickets. We had spoken to them and they were so happy to know that the impasse was finally over,"" Laurantus Kerketta, another resident of Bagracote, said. However, the ray of hope faded away within a week. ""As the central government issued a notification on January 28, mentioning the acquisition of seven tea estates of the Duncans Group, the management wrote to the state labour department on January 30, saying it was deferring its plan. The migrants were contacted by the family members and asked to cancel train tickets. They were also told to continue working at their respective places,"" said Pradhan. ""I have spoken to at least a couple of them. They are desperate to return home at the slightest opportunity but cannot afford to do so. Otherwise, their families would be struggling to live,"" he added."

The file photo shows hybrid maize being displayed at an exhibition.To give an impetus to crop diversification, the government in Punjab, Indias grain bowl, plans to replace the water-guzzling paddy (rice) with hybrid maize in two lakh hectares this kharif season (2016-17).The government will go in for hybrid maize, considered the best alternative to paddy, in 14 districts.Data from the Agriculture Department show that during 1976-77, maize was grown on 5.8 lakh hectares, and the area has now come down to 1.3 lakh hectares.Since the hybrid varieties of maize that yield 6-7 tonnes a hectare are now available, the area can be increased to 8 lakh hectares to meet the requirements of cattle feed, poultry and starch production, said an agriculture department official.The government has established a maize board to help farmers in production and marketing.Farmers face problems in marketing maize because of its higher moisture content of 25-30 per cent at the time of harvest. For storage, the moisture content should not be more than 14 per cent, the official said.To overcome this problem, the government has installed dryers in many markets at a cost of Rs. 52.85 crore. Small dryers, costing Rs. 6 lakh each, are being given to village co-operative societies and individual farmers on a 50 per cent subsidy, subject to the maximum of Rs. 2.5 lakh."

(Express Photo Prashant Ravi)With just Rs 3.86 allocated per day per child at government primary schools in Bihar, the khichdi served for the mid-day meal at Rajkiya Prathmik Vidyalaya in Ararias Gokhlapur is a watery affair.But on February 10, Kasheeda, a Class V student, made the mistake of asking for a second helping. The 12-year-old was allegedly hit, and when her father Mohammed Shagir protested, he too was allegedly kicked. Hours later, Shagir died.According to Shagirs wife Rukhsana Khatoon, her son escaped a similar fate six months ago. Chand Babu, a Class II student, wanted a little more khichdi too, and in return was allegedly thrown off the schools roof, fracturing his right leg. He dreads going to school since.Three teachers and a cook of the school now face a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and are absconding. The post-mortem report is awaited. The school is shut since the incident.Share This Article Related Article Mid-day meal: Students in Punjab 'disliking khichri', schools demand variety in menuMid-day meal: Students in Punjab 'disliking khichri', schools demand variety in menu A taste of whats cooking for mid-day meals in city schoolsPrincipals protesting,so no midday meals in 35,000 schools in stateUnpalatable truthSoon,parents to check quality of khichdi served in civic schoolsIn mid-day meals,quantity,nutrition first casualtyShagir, a daily wage earner, leaves behind five children between the ages of four and 12. The family, that doesnt own any land, lives in a thatched hut on government land. Neighbours have been giving the family food since Shagirs death.Recounting what happened on February 12, Kasheeda says, When I asked for khichdi a second time, school cook Sanjit hit me with a serving spoon with a long handle. I came back home crying and complained to abbu. My father immediately rushed to the school and told Sanjit, Sab bachchon ko sarkari khana khane ka haq hai (All children are entitled to the government mid-day meal).According to her, a school teacher named Z N Ansari, also known as Mastan, rushed out shouting and threatening him, Cheer denge (will tear you apart). Hardev Ram (the school headmaster) also joined in, saying maaro. Mastan hit my father between his legs.Shagir, who was reportedly hit on the testicles, doubled over in pain, defecated in his clothes and fainted.He was rushed to a local doctor, but didnt recover.Rukhsana says a neighbour immediately called police but no one turned up the whole day. The Narpatganj police only reached the spot at 1 am on the intervening night of February 10 and 11, and an FIR was registered on February 11 against four persons  the schoolteachers Mastan and Hardev Ram, cook Sanjit Paswan, and the husband of a schoolteacher, Sambhu Yadav, who was present at the spot at the time.Police claim they came to know of the incident only on February 10 night. Says Narpatganj police station in-charge P K Praveen, The incident is surely a fallout of the mid-day meal at school. We have recorded the victims familys statement, and statements of 40-odd villagers. Mohammed Shagir had gone to the school and had a scuffle with teachers. Post-mortem alone will establish if he died because of being hit on his testicles.Narpatganj Block Education Officer Iftekhar Ahmed says, We have been talking to villagers to reopen the school while police investigate the matter.Another school cook, Mehdooda, says she had seen Shagir at school that day, but did not see any fight. I am not aware what happened to him later, says Mehdooda.School committee chairperson Mohammed Ali Sher, who says he was out of the village on the day of the incident, claims, The school is often under pressure to offer mid-day meal to extra children.While Classes I to V at Rajkiya Prathmik Vidyalaya have around 300 students, villagers say poor parents often send siblings along too to have the mid-day meal.Bihar government primary schools get Rs 3.86 per child for buying pulses and vegetables besides 100 gm rice each. From Classes VI onwards, the rice quantity goes up to 150 gm and the subdiary amount to Rs 5.78 each. Bihar has about 70,000 government primary and secondary schools serving mid-day meal to 2.5 crore children.The scheme has been under scanner in Bihar since the 2013 Chhapra tragedy in which 23 children died after eating poisonous food.Several villagers claim the whole controversy is linked to the coming panchayat polls, and that the teachers are being framed.Rukhsana and Shagir moved to Muslim-dominated Gokhlapur and Araria, one of the poorest districts of Bihar, around 30 years ago from a distant village.Pointing to a bamboo-and-grass fence around their hut that Shagir himself built just before the incident, Rukhsana says, An influential group in the village is out to prove us wrong on the cause of my husbands death My husband was hale and hearty and died after being hit.She says the group is trying to use the fact that the case was registered a day later. We were forced not to file a case last time but this time, we want justice. We are the ones who need mid-day meal the most, Rukhsana says.Vowing to support the family, her neighbour, Mohammed Izhar Alam, however, asks, Can Kasheeda get justice at all?

In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

They would then file Shipping Bills--documents filed with customs authorities carrying details of goods to be exported, consignor and consignee--for export to Iran, they said.Instead of the consignment reaching Iranian shores, it would be diverted mid-sea to Dubai allegedly with the connivance of cargo ship operators carrying the goods.Surprisingly, payments were also made from Iran to these exporters in India. Importers and port officials would allegedly acknowledge the receipt of rice and allow payment to be made against it here, the sources said.What is worrying for intelligence agencies here is that they do not know the end-use of rice off-loaded in Dubai. They suspect use of rice as barter system to fund some illegal activity like terror financing, the sources said.The DRI has red-flagged the scam at the highest level and is in touch with authorities concerned in Dubai about the scam. Prima facie, two lakh metric tonnes of rice valued at about Rs 1,000 crore has been off-loaded in Dubai instead of Iran, they said.While India lost foreign exchange which it could have got from Dubai in case of genuine trade, Iran was also deprived of customs duty it would have been entitled to if rice was delivered at its shore, the sources said.The authorities suspect the proceeds of the scam assumed the form of black money. The DRI has informed Supreme Court- appointed Special Investigation Team on black money about the case. It has also roped in the Enforcement Directorate to look into the matter, they said.Legal export of rice from the country has risen in the past two years. India had exported 2,77,880.22 kg of Basmati rice to United Arab Emirates in 2014-15. About 4,11,776.06 kg of rice had been sent to the UAE between April and November 2015, as per the latest data of export compiled by Directorate General of Foreign Trade.A total of 9,35,567.81 kg of Basmati rice was exported to Iran in the last fiscal and 4,57,023.63 kg between April and November this financial year, they said."

In the Sion Koliwada area, the competition between Mini Punjab at the north end of the JK Bhaseen Road and Hazara Restaurant and Bar is an age old one, say old-timers.Both outlets that operate primarily post evening compete especially on who makes the better fish koliwada.

However, Punjab does not appear to be geared up to take full advantage of the governments initiatives in this regard, given the dismal progress it has made till date.The current certified area under organic farming in Punjab is a negligible 2,000 acres only and nowhere near the target of 3,000 acres set for the end of March 2016, as per data available from Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Limited (PAICL).Punjabs laidback approach in organic farming, which can bring substantially higher dividends to farmers for their crop, can be gauged from the fact that a much smaller state, Sikkim, which recently declared itself fully organic state, has more than 1.85 lakh acres of area under organic farming.With no scheme of its own till now, the Punjab government depends on Paramparagat Krishi Vighyan Yojna, which was launched by the union government last year to promote organic farming with a budget of Rs 300 crore.Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal had announced in May 2015 that an organic farming Board, solely dedicated to promote chemical free farming in state, would be setup. However, the announcement has remained only on paper and no progress has been made in this regard.Even Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana, which is one of the 20 research centers across India under network project on organic farming of Indian Agricultural and Research Center (ICAR), New Delhi, falls short of expectations in the field of organic farming. It has been a party of the network project since 2004 but has failed to bring out any substantial research since the last 12 years.PAICL officials, however, claim that since past one year, when the state officially started promoting organic farming, it has achieved a lot. We have a separate organic farming cell with 12-15 employees and 5,000 organic farmers are in touch with us. We have tied up with a German firm to get certification of organic farms for farmers. We are clustering them under Paramgararat Krishi Yojana of the center. We procured 400 tons of organic wheat 400 tons and 250 tons of rice for the first time this year and also helped farmers in marketing them, said KS Pannu, Managing Director, PAICL.Pannu also said that work on the composition of advisory board announced by CM is also under progress.CS Aulakh, a senior agronomist from PAU and author of a book, Organic Farming: Prospects and Constraints in Punjab, said that the biggest constraint is the non-availability of the organic manure for the farmers required for the procedure.It takes minimum three years for a farm to be completely organic. But we have insufficient organic manure which comes from animal and agriculture waste. Farmers would need to keep more animals if we want organic manure to provide similar amount of nutrients to the crop as it gets through chemical laden fertilizers. Another constraint is lack of response from market. Farmers do not adopt organic farming when produce is not sold. There is no organized markets for organic products, said Aulakh.Umendra Dutt, Director, Kheti Viraasat Mission and member of national task force on organic farming said Punjab stands way behind when it comes to organic farming. There has been no clear-cut policy to promote organic farming in Punjab, either from state department or PunjabAgro. PAU is still conducting research on the lines of green revolution which led to degradation of Punjabs soil and overuse of water and fertilizers. Punjab which was pioneer in every agricultural aspect stands the most backward in organic farming, he concluded.It is only due to the efforts of NGOs, individuals and farmers groups that a few Kisan Huts (shops that directly sell organic fruit and vegetables, without involving middlemen) were started in districts like Hoshiarpur, Mansa, Ludhiana without any support from the government. Farmers allege officials ask for bribes when approached for certification for their organic farms.Most organic farmers have not got certification. It is because bribes are demanded openly. This is the reason why there are no accurate number on how much area is under organic cultivation in Punjab. It is the lack of trust and communication between Punjab Agro and farmers, said Harnek Singh, a farmer.Despite the lack of state patronage, the concept of organic farming is being given a boost by self motivated individuals who are making the maximum of what is on offer. According to Joga Singh, project officer, Skill Training Center, Guru Nanak Dev Polytechnic College, who recently hosted a direct selling fair for farmers said, There is a scheme called Community Development Through Polytechnics (CDTP) offered by HRD Ministry to promote organic farmers and help them in selling their produce directly to the customers. I decided to use this scheme and host farmers. We offered them free of cost platform to sell their products and response was overwhelming. Such schemes need to be optimized well to help farmers, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Karnataka is one of the top three states in having the highest prevalence of prediabetic individuals.On other common risk factors for non-communicable diseasesbe it abdominal obesity, hypertension or dyslipidemia (lipid anomaly)  Karnataka and Punjab are among the top three states with the maximum prevalence.This clearly suggests that a large number of people from these two states are at an elevated risk of developing the disease. The survey also shows India has a huge hidden population of pre-diabetic individuals, who would turn diabetic unless immediate preventive measures are taken.Conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the study seeks to include 1,24,000 people from 28 states, the national capital region of Delhi and two Union territories, when completed.Halfway through, data collected from 57,113 individuals from 14 states and one Union territory (Chandigarh) threw up several interesting results, which was presented before the ICMR on Tuesday.ComparisonTake Karnataka for example. With 7.5% prevalence of diabetes, the southern state stands at the sixth position. But it is among the top three when it comes to prediabetes and risk factors for non-communicable diseases.Karnataka may be lower than Tamil Nadu (10.4%) in diabetes prevalence because people in north Karnataka consume coarse cereals a lot unlike Tamil Nadu where rice is the staple diet. But the huge number of pre-diabetic population is a big risk as little change in lifestyle can make them diabetic, said V Mohan of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation.If somebody becomes prosperous and buys a scooter, it means end of the walk to the bus stop, he said. Diabetes was taking off at an early age of 25-34 years among Indians particularly in urban areas, which was a big worry, said Mohan, who is the chief coordinator for the project.While there is a rural urban divide in the states, the gap is narrowing fast. The prevalence of diabetes in urban India is 12.2% as against villages where it is 5.7%. But when it comes to risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia, the difference is marginal.Rural areas are catching up with urban localities. Its a wake up call for us. Since pre-diabetes rate is so high, we need to develop new strategies for mass screening diabetes, said Soumya Swaminathan, director-general of ICMR. As reduction of non-communicable diseases is one of the priorities of the health ministry, the ICMR data would help the ministry plan different intervention strategies for various states.The prevalence of diabetes varies from 4.3% in Bihar to 13.6% in Chandigarh. Because of India's heterogeneous nature, studies done in one part of the country can not be extrapolated to another part as there is so much cultural and socio-economic differences, said Mohan. The study is likely to be completed in two years."

People being served black carrots juice as part of the organic langar hosted by farmer Jasbir Singh to celebrate Sikh Environment Day on Monday at his village Ghulal (Source: Express photo) .In a fitting tribute to the seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, who was also an ardent environmentalist, a 57-year old farmer from Ludhiana hosted an organic langar on Monday at his farm to observe Sikh Environment Day.In a langar (community kitchen), where more than 100 people attended, the menu included food and drinks prepared completely from organically grown vegetables, cereals and even the desserts were prepared using indigenous breed Sahiwal cows milk.The langar, primarily a Sikh tradition, was also attended by Deputy Shahi Imam Usman Ludhianvi from Jama Masjid, Ludhiana. The attendees were gifted neem and flowers saplings to mark the day.Speaking to The Indian Express, Jasbir Singh Ghulal, from village Ghulal near Neelon, said that it has been almost 12 years now that he shunned wheat-paddy farming and started growing organic fruits, vegetables, rice and flowers.A well-known rose flower farmer in these parts, Jasbirs farm was visited by Prince Charles during his trip to India.The primary source of my income is organic farming now. I know the farmers feel insecure when they think of leaving wheat-paddy farming as organic vegetables market is yet to gather pace. But it is the best feeling when pesticide free veggies and fruits bloom in the farm. Today, I decided to host this organic langar to show that how sumptuous dishes made from organic veggies can be, he said.The menu included dal (pulses), mix vegetables, black carrots juice and pickle, gulkand (prepared from roses) and rotis- all prepared using organically grown crops without pesticides. The dessert was kheer prepared using Sahiwal cow milk and shakkar (organic sugar).Ravneet Singh, EcoSikh South Asia project manager said, Organic food is necessary to revive the true spirit of langar, which is sharing healthy food with the humanity. The campaign aims to make all gurudwara kitchens preparing langar go organic. The target is 50,000 gurdwaras where nearly 50,00,000 people take food daily. It will enhance the demand for organic food, support organic farmers and improve human health.The Sikh Environment Day campaign was started by US based organization EcoSikh in 2010, as a tribute to Guru Har Rai, the seventh Sikh Guru, who planted trees, setup a wildlife sanctuary and a herbal medicinal facility at Kiratpur Sahib.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""Supplement your income by adopting crop diversification, subsidiary occupations and cooperative marketing,"" he said while addressing a gathering of farmers.He further called upon the farmers to go for soil testing before using fertilizers and also to use new agro-chemicals as per requirement.Dhillon also stressed upon the need to manage paddy straw by using it for compost making and mushroom cultivation. Referring to basmati, the PAU vice-chancellor appealed to the farmers not to increase area under rice cultivation and focus on marketing. While batting for kitchen gardening, he suggested growing pulses and vegetables at household level for meeting family requirements and nutritional security. He also suggested testing new crop varieties under less area.He stated that happy seeder technology had been modified and farmers should see live demonstrations. ""Keep a record of farm expenses, go for cooperative use of farm machinery and marketing and see profits,"" PAU vice-chancellor told the farmers. Later, Dhillon gave away the prizes to winning farmers and farm women of various competitions.During the mela, farmers made a long queue to purchase seeds of new and improved varieties. Some had to return empty handed as there were no pulse seeds. Ajaypal Singh from Mansa said he had specially come to purchase seeds for 'moong dal', but PAU authorities had no pulse seeds.Meanwhile, students of B.Sc six-year programming (10+1, 10+2 and four years of B.Sc course) continued their strike. They also organized a protest rally that moved across the Kisan Mela being held on university campus. The students said the university was not providing them with certificates for 10+2 class and it wants them the six-year certificate that does not make them eligible for jobs.

VedhanFarmer incomes were in focus on Saturday when National Commission on Farmers chairman M.S. Swaminathan reviewed the implementation of the recommendations that were submitted nearly 10 years ago.Prof. Swaminathan said technology could only increase yield; it takes public policy to take care of the economics of agriculture.If you want to make farming viable and retain young people, your first goal is to improve the economic viability of farming and substantially increase the net income for farmers, he said, recalling a central concern of the NCF as it went about its work during 2004-2006.His talk, delivered at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, was at an event that saw the launch of the website of the Foundation for Agrarian Studies, a Bangalore-based charitable trust.N. Ram, publisher of The Hindu , chaired the panel, which included Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha.Mr. Ram prefaced the session by saying, The NCF recommendations are perhaps the most important intervention in the thinking about Indian agriculture in several decades.In the light of Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys Budget promise to double farmers income in five years, the NCF proposal on fixing minimum support price (MSP) of a crop at the cost of production of that crop plus 50 percent came to be discussed the most.It can be done, but requires a lot of work and action, said Prof. Swaminathan on the possibility of doubling farmer incomes. On his Commissions MSP recommendation, he said, If this single step is accepted, it will make a lot of difference.Mr. Mollah was, however, sceptical of the success of the income objective. Prof. [Swaminathan] mentioned that income will be doubled. How we can we believe it? We have calculated it  for doubling farmer incomes in five years, 14 percent growth is required. With the (current) one-and-a-half percent growth, how will we do it, he asked at a presentation during which he said that it was pre-election propaganda that led to the last Budget adopting a pro-farmer tone.He also talked of how the MSP recommendations of the NCF had led to a nationwide demand by farmers for implementation of the report.He pointed out that there remained a yawning gap between what the NCF set out to achieve and the current status of agriculture in the country. [It] recommended (loans at) four per cent, but actual farmers are taking loans for between 30 and 120 per cent, he saidProf. Swaminathan said, The latest Budget takes some of our recommendations forward. For example, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare: we recommended that the name of the ministry should be changed; the Prime Minister announced this in his August 15 speech. The reason is, we should not focus on productivity alone, but the well-being of the farmer, he said.Prof. Swaminathan dwelt in detail on the pressures of land and income on agriculture. Punjab farmers, at the heartland of the Green Revolution, with an average farm size of 3.79 hectares, growing wheat and rice get an income which is less than the starting salary of a Class Four employee. That is the crisis in Indian agriculture, he added."

Chandigarh and Karnataka not only figure among the states and Union Territories with the highest prevalence of pre-diabetes but Punjab and Karnataka also have the highest prevalence of hypertension, abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia, which increase a persons vulnerability to diabetes. This is reason for serious concern. Diabetes can kill if not controlled. What compounds this diseases deadliness is that it makes a patient vulnerable to blindness, kidney problems, cardio-vascular ailments, neurological problems and amputations. Worryingly, diabetes is a silent killer. It develops slowly and insidiously. However, advances in diagnosis and treatment provide hope. Besides, the disease does not develop overnight or emerge out of the blue. There are symptoms that people can watch out for and preventive steps taken to keep diabetes at bay.Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death by disease worldwide and one person dies from diabetes-related causes every 10 seconds. Screening for it and timely medical intervention can save lives and protect patients and families from the costs it entails. Studies show that the average patient uses up around 70% of his savings for treatment of diabetes. India must take diabetes, hypertension and obesity more seriously. It has the largest number of diabetics and pre-diabetics and the average age of adult onset diabetes is falling. While the diabetes rate rose by 45% globally, it shot up by 123% in India in the 1990-2013 period.We do not have to wait for diabetes to develop to fight it. The ICMR study provides useful pointers. Several of the states whose populations are at greatest risk of developing diabetes are prosperous. It is evident that lifestyles that come with prosperity  people are eating too much junk food, are highly stressed and walking less  are making people obese and ideal candidates for diabetes and hypertension. A few corrective steps to adopt less sedentary lifestyles and more healthy diets can go a long way in preventing diabetes. Traditional food habits of people in Karnataka, which include consumption of ragi and coarse cereals, are known to be healthier than eating rice or processed foods. The latter have grown in popularity in our cities. Efforts must be made to spread public awareness of not only symptoms and complications of diabetes, obesity, etc but also of healthy food options and lifestyles that can prevent them."

59409d857be9e024e45998a9,Grain Trade: Punjab’s agricultural crisis now consumes arhtiyas,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/grain-trade-punjabs-agricultural-crisis-now-consumes-arhtiyas/,2016-03-24,"Labourers cleaning grain at an arhtiya mandi in Khanna. Gurmeet Singh Labourers cleaning grain at an arhtiya mandi in Khanna. Gurmeet SinghJaspal Setia, 54, committed suicide about four months ago. He wasnt a farmer, but an arhtiya or commission agent at Amritsars Bhagtanwala grain market. The reason for the extreme step was the Rs 2.5 crore or so that he had advanced to farmers and small rice millers (shellers), and couldnt recover.His family was in the arhat business for over six decades. But the stress from the blocked money he just couldnt take. This was more so because these funds which he had lent had been largely borrowed from banks, relatives and businessmen, who were themselves seeking high returns, said Vijay Kalra, president of the Federation of Arhtiya Association, Punjab.Setias isnt an isolated case, even though it might appear unusual in the context of the considerable sway that arhtiyas supposedly wield in Punjabs grain trade. They are the middlemen through whom the Food Corporation of India and other government agencies undertake procurement of wheat and paddy that farmers bring to the states mandis. The arhtiyas are the ones who get the grain that is unloaded into their mandi platforms cleaned and, then, organise its auction. They also arrange for bagging of the grains prior to their being loaded into the trucks of the successful bidders  the buyers are predominantly state agencies. For all these services rendered, they get a commission fee, amounting to 2.5 per cent of the purchase price.The real power of the arhtiyas, however, derives from their direct contact with farmers, to whom they lend for cropping operations as well as meeting other personal needs. Such lending is often conditional upon the farmers delivering the harvesting grain to them. The arhtiyas, thus, earns both from the interest on the advances made and commission fee on the grain mainly supplied to government agencies. Efforts by the Punjab government to procure directly from farmers and credit payments straight into their bank accounts have failed. The reason for it has been farmers own preference to go through these middlemen.But of late, the arhtiya communitys fabled power has seemingly been on the wane, as growing distress among debt-ridden farmers, following successive crop failures and crashing prices, has started affecting its business as well. Not only have many arhtiyas stopped lending to farmers, there are reports of some even resorting to taking their lives due to large irrecoverable advances made from funds borrowed from the market.Ravinder Singh Cheema, vice-chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board, estimates that 250-300 big and medium arhtiyas across the state may have committed suicide in the last 5-6 years. That includes at least half a dozen in just the past six months in Bathindas Bhagta Bhai Ka mandi and grain markets in Amritsar, Khanna, Abohar and Budhlada.We attended their last rites and even met the family members. None wanted to come out in the open and admit to their blocked monies in the market. The reasons for the suicides were hushed up. For them, its a matter of family honour and reputation, he pointed out. The families have all since shut shop, even as court cases are on to recover the outstanding amounts.According to Kalra, arhtiyas flourish only when farmers do well. When there is crop failure, the arhtiya cannot force farmers to return the money. Nor can he go to court because the entire arhat business is based on good faith. And if farmers commit suicide, their monies are gone forever, he noted.Punjab has around 26,000 mandi-licenced arhtiyas controlling the crop of over 11 lakh farmers. Each arhtiya deals with anywhere between 20 to 200 farmers, who go through them mainly for the ease of obtaining advances. Which government bank will lend to me if some emergency crops up in the middle of the night? asked Mohan Singh, a six-acre farmer from Jamsher village in Jalandhar district. He admitted to even borrowing from an arhtiya to repay a bank loan that would otherwise have led to forfeiture of his land.The arhtiyas were traditionally from mercantile communities such as Bania/Marwari and Khatri/Aroras, but the last two decades and more have also seen those from farming backgrounds enter the trade. Anestimated 40 per cent of Punjabs arhtiyas today are Jat Sikhs, who aggregate the produce of their fellow farmers.But the ongoing agricultural crisis, across crops from wheat and basmati paddy to cotton, has considerably pushed back the trade. Only three years back, Khanna mandi, one of Indias biggest grain markets, had 300-plus licenced arhtiyas. That number, according to latest available records available, is down to 240. And even out of those, only around 150 are said to be active arhtiyas.Pawan Kumar, an arhtiya at Khanna with more than two decades of experience, is among those finding the going tough now. Over Rs 5 crore of my money is blocked. With basmati prices flat, I have shellers who have outstandings with me from 2014, he complained.His sentiment is shared by a fellow arhtiya, Varinder Kumar Guddu. My sons have diversified into solvent extraction and flour mill business. Im the only one still doing arhtiya work, but there isnt going to be after me. The blocked monies in the market are only increasing, even while land values of farmers are falling, he observed.Traders reckon that the Khanna market alone has Rs 150 crore of commission agent monies being blocked, with farmers and rice shellers unable to clear their due. A similar situation prevails across other mandis from Jalandhar, Moga and Ferozepur to Amritsar and Gurdaspur.One sign of the changing times is the disengagement of the youth from the arhat trade. Cheema claimed that most arhtiyas one would find today are in the 40 to 70 years age group. The younger generation is simply not willing to adopt this traditional family business.My son has gone to Canada to study and is unlikely to return. My commission agency shop will have to shut down in the event, stated Kamaljit Singh, yet another arhtiya of Khanna, who is owed large sums by farmer and sheller clients. The same story was repeated by Prem Kumar, a Jalandhar-based arhtiya: My son has done engineering and is working with an MNC. He will never join me.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

58f50a3f7be9e018510a214b,Golden yields,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/opinion/story_77294.jsp,2016-03-31,"The recent budget talked about the government's plan to double farm incomes in the next five years. This will be done through investments in rural infrastructure, especially irrigation. About 50 per cent of land under foodgrain production in India is irrigated. This means that half of the foodgrain producing land in India faces weather uncertainties and, hence, those working on them face annual (seasonal) variations in income. These variations could be huge - from bumper harvests to complete wipe-outs if there is a flood or drought. Irrigation will at least mitigate the effects of a drought. Floods, however, can wreak havoc on both irrigated and unirrigated lands. The best interpretation of the government's promise, therefore, is one of doubling, in five years' time, the income earned by the farmer in a normal year. The Indian landmass has been historically described as highly fertile. However, if we are to compare India's land productivity with that of other countries, the picture is quite dismal. India ranks 27 in rice yield, behind Brazil and China and 19 in wheat yield, behind China and South Africa. There is, thus, a lot of scope in improving Indian yields; indeed, if India could reach Chinese yield rates, we need only half of the current land devoted to rice to produce what we are producing now. Irrigation will certainly go a long way in getting us there. However, public irrigation alone will not work. It also needs other inputs like fertilizers, seeds, labour and farm equipment. Farmers would also need better storage and marketing systems to move the produce off the farm and get the farmers sufficient value for their crops. All of these are costly and the farmers will need to have access to, and be able to afford the costs of, these complementary inputs. The recent budget does mention these though it is not clear how these would be addressed. The budget does talk of a uniform and modified Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act that states will be encouraged to pass. Such an act has been in the offing for quite some time now but, like the goods and services tax, all the states are not yet on board. If the problem was simply a technological and marketing issue, and the government over the next few years delivered on its commitment, the budget promise could materialize. Unfortunately, focusing on agriculture alone may actually reduce, rather than increase, farmer incomes. Increasing agricultural output will lead to a fall in prices. This fall in prices is often more than the increase in yield, leading to a fall in the revenue (price times quantity) and hence, income, to the farmer. This is especially true for foodgrains which suffer from what economists refer to as inelastic demand. This can be arrested somewhat by introducing minimum support prices for each type of crop. For the MSP to be effective, it has to be above the market price. The government will then procure at the MSP but release the produce to the market at a lower price. This will mean an increased subsidy bill. The MSP also has the added problem of distorting crop choice on land. This is evident in the falling water table experiences of Punjab which has become a major paddy producing area though it is, traditionally, not a paddy-producing region. Earlier, we stated that if India reaches China's yield rates, we will need only half the land that we now devote to rice in India. If the farmers on the other half of the land did not produce any rice, then the income of those continuing to produce rice, on land with China's yield rates, will indeed double. Herein lies the crux of the solution the government needs to work out to double farm incomes. We need to reduce the number of farmers, the amount of land cultivated and the number of landless labourers working in agriculture. The latest census tells us that more than 55 per cent of workers are either cultivators or agricultural labourers (sometimes both). Coupled with the observation that agriculture and allied activities (which is more than farming) contribute 17 per cent to the gross domestic product, it is not very difficult to understand why agriculturalists as a class are at the bottom of the heap in India. For those whose full-time economic activity is in agriculture, the most important asset is land. Ambedkar, writing as far back as 1918, had warned us of dire consequences if people were not taken out of agriculture. At that time, the British were held responsible for India's deindustrialization and forcing people back on to the land. Since land was the only valuable asset for a large proportion of the population, it was also the most important inheritance. Ambedkar was worried that, unless succeeding generations had other economic activities to turn to, land would continue to get sub-divided and fragmented and the farmers' lot would go from bad to worse with the passage of time. During Ambedkar's time, 71 per cent of the Indian population was in agriculture but many European countries also had more than 50 per cent of the population similarly occupied. If we are to assume that all households had the same size (number of members) and the same number of workers, then 71 per cent of the population will mean that 71 per cent of the workers were involved in agriculture around 1918. After about 100 years since Ambedkar's warning, close to 70 of which has been without the British in charge, we have reduced the dependence on agriculture to one where 57 per cent of the workers are either cultivators or agricultural labourers. So, we still have a huge pressure on land and it is getting worse by the day. This is because of two facts: (a) we have a growing population and (b) we are not adding new land to our land mass. The average holding in India in 1970-71 was 2.29 hectares; in 2010-11 it fell to 1.15 hectares. In 40 years, or in roughly two plus generations, the average farmer has half the land to cultivate. India describes its farmers as marginal (owning less than one hectare), small (between one and two hectares), semi-medium (between two and four hectares), medium (between four and 10 hectares) and large (above 10 hectares). In these 40 years, the number of marginal farmers have increased by 156 per cent, small by 84 per cent and semi-medium by 30 per cent. The numbers of medium and large farmers have fallen by 26 per cent and 65 per cent. And, the average holding in each of these categories has fallen, respectively, by 4, 1, 3, 5 and 4 per cent. In short, agriculture may not be the place where the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer. Focusing on agriculture alone to better the plight of farmers could become a lost cause. Since the amount of the productive asset owned by an individual is falling over time, the income earned by each owner is also decreasing. To arrest this decline, these owners must be given other productive assets, like education and skill and, of course, good health. This will enable them to sell off their land and move into other economic activities. Only then will those remaining in agriculture be able to earn higher incomes through higher yields. Otherwise, we will spend public money, increase yield and see our farm incomes continue to diminish. The author is Research Director, India Development Foundation"

Picture by UB PhotosTitabar/Borhola (Jorhat), April 1: Ajan pir threw his staff across the river and it became a bridge for him to cross it. Thats how pious a Muslim he was, says Rashid Ahmed, 65. I am a Muslim too, but I wont vote AIUDF. Not that I have anything against Badruddin Ajmal, but there are different kinds of Muslims, you see. Generations of our family have voted for Congress and I intend to do the same. The pir now lies buried at Sarogua chapori in Sivasagar district, 80km east of Titabar, a prophet of communal harmony in Assam. Snuggled by lush green tea estates, Ahmeds village, Borera Gaon, is an Assamese microcosm: surnames ranging from Kurmi to Ahmed to Orang, Gogoi, Barhoi and Shyam, religions from Hindu to Muslim, Christian and Buddhist and livelihoods from agriculture (the area is referred to as Assams granary) to employment in tea gardens to small businesses and weaving. The river Ahmed refers to is the Brahmaputra that takes, on a good day minus storms and the annual flood, an hour-and-a-half to cross by ferry, from Majuli  the constituency where the BJPs chief ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal is fighting the elections from  to Jorhat. Around 22km south of Jorhat lies Titabar, chief minister Tarun Gogois constituency, his personal turf, one that has made him return to the state Assembly thrice in a row. The drive takes one across Dhodar Ali, a road that Ahom king Gadadhar Singha had constructed using dhods  human sloths. It stretches a good 212km, right up to Joypur in Dibrugarh district, through Golaghat. Borera Gaon had waited all day to hear Gogoi address an election rally that local Congressmen had painstakingly put together. No buses and trucks lined up by the roadside but a steady flow of people for hours, till the field was filled by a few thousand. Former Union minister Paban Singh Ghatowar, from the tea workers community, speaks to the gathering till Gogoi arrives. Rashid Ahmed in his house in Borera Gaon. Picture by Umanand Jaiswal Titabar is a constituency of beneficiaries. It was the Congress who raised your tea plucking wages from what it was, 50 paisa a day, during the British. We brought it up to what it is now  Rs 126 a day. We want to raise it further and have gone to the court to get this done. If the BJP tells you they can raise it to Rs 300 or Rs 400 just like that, remember karo baaper dom nai (no one can bring about that kind of a quantum increase, just like that) He goes on: Tea workers now have provident fund, your womenfolk have three months of maternity leave with full pay. What has the BJP done? After they came to power in Delhi they started out by stopping your rations. That is how much they care for you. Vote for us and we will give your more. Public memory is short and Gogoi then takes his time poking holes in the BJPs promises. Did you get the Rs 15 lakh the BJP promised for each of you? They instead took away Assams special category status. Do not be swayed by misinformation. My opponent Kamakhya Tasa of the BJP will stand with tea garden owners. We have and will be with the workers. I am one of you. The economic climb in Titabar may have been slow but shows steady signs of growth. Rashid Ahmed is in the process of building concrete walls to his ramshackle tenement. A plumber by profession, Ahmed has been home for 12 years, ever since he met with an accident. The government gave him a tricycle to go around after his accident. His son now resells broiler chicken while his wife is part of an atmo xohai got, a self-help group, which is a big thing in these parts. Hers is a group of 10 women and they have taken and repaid two loans totalling Rs 2.5 lakh. The money has been used by members to weave and do various other things. We make around Rs 6,000 a month each, says Majida Begum, who is now a part of the decision-making process. We had a difficult time when the Rs 3 per kg rice scheme was stopped for three months but it has now been restored, says Ahmed, referring to the delay owing to the standoff between the Centre and the state over the formers bid to distribute both wheat and rice to the beneficiaries under the Food Security Act, which Dispur had opposed because most people in Assam do not consume wheat. The standoff resulted in the delay of distribution by over a month. Finally, it was only rice, but the standoff had just about doused the fire in Rashids hearth. Flogging the system to put out freebies (or virtually such) has, however, had its downside. Around 18km away to the south, at Borhola, septuagenarian Punam Chand Pincha is a worried man, having borne the brunt of social welfare freebies that both the BJP and the Congress so generously dole out. Borholla used to have 72,000 quintal surplus rice in 1972. Today it is down to less than 7,200 quintal. I dont see the situation improving much, Pincha, owner of one of Borhollas oldest mills, says. Apart from fragmentation of land holdings over the years, the flooding of Rs two-three per kg rice supplied by states such as Punjab under the governments welfare schemes has played a key role in the decline of rice output. Not good news for an area which prides itself as Assams granary. Born and raised in Borholla, Pincha says no effort seems to have been made to help farmers switch over to something more rewarding like organic farming, now that paddy cultivation is no longer profitable. One must be honest to deliver. Politics too must have honesty to deliver, he says. No one  neither Congress nor BJP  promises to make a change on the freebie front. His poverty notwithstanding, Rashid Ahmed though has other things on his mind. Dadri happened, as did the Babri Masjid demolition and it happened under BJP rule, he says. Its not that we have anything against anyone but we will vote Congress. A security and freebie combination can be a hard act to beat."

I was told that I may earn Rs 1,500 daily like others,"" said Arun Saini, 23, a matriculate. Jogga Singh's father Amrik Singh said four youths of their village had already gone to Lebonan, inspiring many to follow suit.Four youths had paid Rs 2.75 lakh to Rs 4 lakh each to a local agent for their journey to Lebanon.They had left for Lebanon on September 24, 2014, but landed in Jordon. ""We were told that we have visa only till Jordon and will move to Lebanon by road via Syria,"" said Saini. ""The Syrian police caught us when we were entering Syria from Jordon on January 19, 2015, and were put behind bars,"" he added.A day before their arrests, they had called up their families in India sharing how the agents were trying to send them to Lebanon from Syria.Syrian deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister Walid Al-Muallem, who was on a three-day official visit to India in January, said four Indian nationals were lodged in a prison in Damascus.""I had requested the deputy prime minister of Syria for their release during his visit to India in January this year,"" tweeted Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday, expressing gratitude to the Syrian authorities for the release of four youths.Four Haryana youths even learnt Arabic language when they were lodged in Syrian prison. ""In every room (40 feet X 14 feet size) in the jail, as many as 80 prisoners were kept. We were given one chapatti, small quantity of rice and vegetable in meals,"" says Arun Saini."
58f4eed47be9e0185109fa44,Long wait for deliverance,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160406/jsp/northeast/story_78577.jsp,2016-04-06,"Borkulas Central Gurdwara. Pictures by Sarat Sarma This is the story of 250 Assamese Sikh households in a remote village, some 15km from the district headquarters of Nagaon and 120km from Guwahati, and their aspirations. The community has been demanding a two per cent job reservation in the government for Assamese Sikhs in the state for a long time. ""But nobody takes the matter seriously because we are so few in number. We don't count for much in the elections,"" said Rajbir Singh, a leader of the Sikh Kalyan Parishad. Nearly 500 Sikh soldiers, led by captain Chetan Singh, came to Assam to fight for Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha in the 1816 Indo-Burma war at Hadirachaki. A few of them, including Chetan Singh, died in the battle, while some returned home after it ended. A few, led by subedar Ram Singh, came to Chapamukh by crossing the Kopili river and later shifted to Borkula to start a new life. Singh married two Assamese girls - first a Brahmin from Hatigarh and subsequently a Koibaitya from Kampur. Granthi Jagat Singh After 200 years, the subedar's family, accompanied by some others (who had earlier settled in other places) expanded to almost 250 households in Borkula. According to the villagers, there was a time when getting a job in police and other administrative posts was easier for the youths of the community in Assam but that ended a long time ago. ""Our people are working in higher ranks in different government departments but the new generation is facing an acute job crisis. We are considered minorities but that is not considered when we ask the government to provide for our development,"" said Jagjit Singh, an activist of Borkula's central Gurdwara. These Assamese Sikhs' links with Punjab and New Delhi were forged only after Independence. Former president Giani Zail Singh visited Borkula in 1979 and former Union agriculture minister Surjit Singh Barnala came in 1982. ""Zail Singh gave us Rs 25,000 as aid to erect a library here. Barnala established links with the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) from where Giani Bhagat Singh was sent to Borkula permanently to teach Gurmukhi,"" said Jagjit. After Bhagat Singh, the Delhi Gurdwara management committee sent one Jaspit Kaur to teach the children Gurmukhi. ""Jasprit left Borkula three months ago,"" Jagjit said. ""We even moved former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh several times demanding some support, an economic package for overall development of the region, but it did not materialise,"" he added. Borkula is basically an agriculture belt, known for its rice and sugarcane. This belt is under Sadar Assembly constituency of central Assam's Nagaon district. Like Borkula, most parts of Sadar constituency are underdeveloped. The rural area of the constituency is dominated by religious minorities, goldsmiths and Scheduled Castes. Sitting Congress MLA Durlav Chamua, the BJP's Rupak Sarma and AIUDF candidate Kartik Saha are in the fray for the polls on April 11. The Sikhs of Borkula are hoping their prayers will be heard this time."

If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued.People are dying  and you want to maintain cricket pitches, asked an over-excited TV anchor. But not as morally excited as the learned justices of the Bombay High Court who opined, as quoted in the media, that this entire thing of the utilisation of water for IPL matches needs to be thought over. The court also apparently asked the BCCI counsel whether cricket matches were more important than people or preserving water. An important question.Watch Video: Discussing The IPL Water ControversyThe first response to this question, especially by immoral thinking economists as well as those with a modicum of common sense, is to ask a related question  what alternative use is there for water, and what is its price? In the desert, water is worth a lot; and it is also worth a considerable amount in drought-prone areas. An average person consumes 150 litres of water per day or 54,000 litres per year. Assume that a sixth of the population of Maharashtra (around 20 million) has no access to any water for half a year  that is, Maharashtra needs to supply (transport) to the drought areas 540 billion litres of water. The IPL matches in Maharashtra are estimated to use six million litres of water for watering the grounds. But that is an estimate of a corrupt capitalist (and therefore, dishonest) BCCI  so let us double the stated amount. So the honourable justices, and the oh-so-moral NGO Loksatta Movement that brought the PIL against IPL, and our learned TV tripping (as in TRP) anchors believe that saving .002 per cent of water will alleviate the water misery of 20 million people. It is not for nothing that my column is called No Proof Required  moving the IPL will only provide water for 400 people for half a year.The Financial Express editorial, IPL vs Sugarcane (April 8) illustrates the utter stupidity of the position that fewer cricket matches in Maharashtra will solve the water shortage problem. If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued. In particular, look at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. Maharashtra encourages the growing of sugarcane: In 2014-15, the estimated sugar output from Maharashtra was 10 billion kgs. Each kg of sugar uses 2,000 litres of water. In other words, the total water used for sugarcane cropping in the state was 20 trillion litres. You do the math. As the FE editorial hints, the savings from not having the IPL matches are not even a minuscule fraction of the water used by the sugarcane growers in Maharashtra. By creating a moral song and dance about the IPL, the immoral elite only proves to the world that it is intellectually dead.Neither drought nor poverty is new to Maharashtra. First and foremost, the responsibility of delivering the much-needed water to all its citizens (and not just the wealthy) lies with the state administration. What was the BJP in Maharashtra, in particular Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, doing for the past two years? Of course, doing nothing except banning beef and moralising about the need to say Bharat Mata ki Jai everywhere. What could have Fadnavis done? And, given that he has not done it, what can he do now? Basic water needs of humans (150 litres a day) can easily be transported to the drought-hit areas on a daily basis and expenses paid from all the taxes collected by the state. Then what is the problem? And why hasnt this solution been offered, and used as yet?The (non) agricultural policy of the Centre has distorted the food market for decades. The Punjab economy is in a mess because of too much rice production in the state. The Maharashtra economy is in a mess because of the production of too much sugarcane. According to the counsel for the trendsetting Loksatta Movement, the BCCI and the IPL have the means and resources to shift matches out of Maharashtra but the state government does not have the means, and/or the political desire, to transport water to its poor drought-hit citizens?The IPL-versus-water controversy raises a lot of non-sequitur issues, especially the contention that morality has anything to do with it. The need of the hour is to conserve water, and herewith some people who should be honoured for suggesting (moral) rules for water conservation. The top prize goes to Moralist # 1, Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, who has recently banned the sale and consumption of all alcohol (except foreign-made liquor) in Bihar. Note how far-sighted and water-saving this policy is. No beer will be sold, so less toilet water needed for flushing beer-induced piss.Moralist # 2 award goes to the ever- thoughtful and far-sighted Pahlaj Nihalani, the man in charge of the Central Board of Film Certification of India. Sensitive to the IPL-versus-drought conflict, he recently gave a U/A rating to The Jungle Book, a remake of a childrens film. The U/A rating means that children below the age of 12 have to be accompanied by an adult. His reason for the U/A rating (and I am not making this up) was that the 3D effects were too scary for children sitting alone. Note how very subtly Nihalani is helping the water cause. Fewer children screaming means less water is needed to calm them down afterwards, and this saved water can be directed to the Maharashtra farmers via the BCCI headquarters and the Bombay High Court, both of which are located in Mumbai.Herewith are some other Nitish-Nihalani (NN, which can also stand for No and No) type sensible policies to help lessen the need for water, and help farmers and ordinary people in the drought-hit areas of Maharashtra (and elsewhere):Recommended Policy # 1: Stop asking people to say Bharat Mata ki Jai. Think about it  500 million people not saying Bharat Mata ki Jai on a daily basis will save enough water, through reduced thirst, to flood Latur.Recommended Policy # 2 (which is not only recommended but practised in Fadnavis-land): Maharashtrians were asked to have a muted Holi celebration to save water. Of course, if Holi were not a Hindu festival, Holi would have been banned.Recommended Policy # 3: Fadnavis could help the poor citizens of his state, and improve governance if he removed the ban on the slaughter of old cows (above 16 years of age). Water consumption will go down. Although, as a Supreme Court (2005) judgment noted, doing so would mean that manure production will also go down  this was the primary reason why the honourable court banned the killing of all cows.Some questions remain: Why did the honourable court not throw out the morally juvenile petition of Loksatta? And why the argument that the IPL should pay for drought relief? What sense does that make? It is as sensible as placing an environmental tax on the purchase of cricket bats because trees have been felled.

Soon, Manju confessed to the murder.Accused misled husbandThe father of the deceased had, in fact, seen the sack when the body was still packed in it, but Manju misled him by claiming that it was for the family where she worked as a help.Even when the family launched a search for the child on Monday evening, she pretended to be part of the team.She even exhorted her husband to lodge a missing complaint. The police have claimed that the confession of the accused, Manju Devi (40) helped them nail the accused. The post-mortem report is awaited.Wednesday morning arrestPolice sources claimed that they arrested Manju around 7am on Wednesday as women could not be arrested after sunset without a magisterial order."

Most would cringe at the thought of the serving devotees coming to the annual Amarnath Yatra in cold conditions for nearly 50 days. They are gearing up mentally and physically to serve over three lakh devotees who are expected to throng the Amarnath cave shrine from across the country in July and August.They work tirelessly and silently and make supreme sacrifice braving harsh conditions with the sole aim of serving pilgrims coming for Amarnath Yatra from different parts of the country.They serve Amarnath Yatris with piping hot foodranging from south Indian idli and dosa to paranthas and various mouth-watering dishes in temporary structures. They brave extreme cold conditions as temperature dips to around 5 degree celsius, sometimes even below in the morning.But they are on their feet to serve pilgrims from morning till late in the night.They have smile on their faces throughout and welcome pilgrims and urge upon them to partake food.Announcements regularly blare across the camps with thousands of temporary tents, urging pilgrims to come and eat in their langars. They also impress upon pilgrims not to waste food. They have a point as transporting food articles is a challenging job.Tents spread over some 3,000 square feet are effectively used for cooking and serving food. Neatly washed plates are given to pilgrims for eating food. It is very systematic as the plates have to be left in a particular place for volunteers to pick them, clean and keep ready for other pilgrims. The system mostly works on the lines of langars in Gurudwaras.It is because of people like Guruswamys and Mahenders that thousands of pilgrims feel comfortable and complete the arduous journey either by foot or doli or horseback and feel a sense of fulfilment.Langar is a free kitchen concept of Sikhs followed in Gurudwaras where food is served to people irrespective of caste and creed.With no hotel around in Baltal base camp, pilgrims have to rely on langars. Nearly 30 langars are set up every year. Free food is a pleasant surprise for pilgrims, who will have to shell out anywhere between Rs 30 and 50 for a bucket of hot water.Langars fill the void and pilgrims really have a choice to feast on. As most of the pilgrims stay for at least a couple of days to complete the pilgrimage, they generally visit at least half a dozen langars. With no other eatery around, they would literally indulge themselves in tickling their taste buds with a variety of food. It could range from three or four types of sweets to variety of rice and dessert in the form of kheer or badam milk. Even purified water is served to pilgrims free of charge.Guruswamy, a priest from Hyderabad, has been doing it for some years now and he finds satisfaction serving people. He is a livewire personality and always on the move. Keeping tabs on cooking in the kitchen to welcoming pilgrims with a smile and folded hands. Last year, Andhra langar as it was called shared space with Jalandhar kitchen as they had to shell out a good amount to Shri Amarnathji Yatra Board to serve the people.We buy materials from Andhra Pradesh and transport them in trucks to this place. We also bring our own cooks to ensure that devotees get authentic food,he said.Mahender from Punjab, who was also present, shared similar sentiments. They are happy that people contribute liberally for the cause and that has made their task that much easier.The same views were shared by a couple of others from Punjab who also had langars.They are unhappy that they had to rent the space to serve the people and forcing a few of them to share the space.It is nice to get such a good and tasty food for free. We have the choice of selecting the place. All of them are clean and neat, Rajesh, a government employee from Bengaluru, said.We had not expected the facilities to be so good. We were worried about how to manage food, Anupama, a senior citizen from Hyderabad, who had come as part of a package tour, observed. Several groups in different parts of the country depend on contributions in kind to set up langars (free kitchens) for pilgrims for the Amarnath Yatra.Even those coming out of Baba Amarnath Mandir after darshan will be pleasantly surprised as they are served with hot rice and dal. It is amazing that materials are carried on the backs of horses and they travel a distancea treacherous roadof 14 km one way.The logistics are mind-boggling as thousands of people are fed every day. It is even hard to imagine how the system works. Ask anyone serving in the langar and they show their hand towards the cave shrine where stalagmite linga exists and say everything happens by the grace of god.Here, one litre of bottled water is sold at Rs 50 and langars serve unlimited food without collecting a single penny.Even on the way to Amarnath from Jammu, scores of langars on the roadside are busy preparing food and serving it to pilgrims during the yatra time. At important places, three or four langars are set up offering variety of food. What makes them to do it, the standard reply is that they feel it is like serving god."

They claimed that Pusa 1509 basmati paddy should be milled and its grain should be delivered to the Union government's central pool.The state government's procurement agency Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation (Markfed) has floated tenders to sell 1.88 lakh tonnes of Pusa 1509 basmati paddy. At the prevailing market price, the state government expects to raise nearly Rs 400 crore by selling the unmilled grain. Tenders have been called for April 22 and financial bids will be opened on April 25.Rice millers have decided to move the court against tenders on Monday and alleged that government was for the welfare of farmers not to act as a trader. To support farmers, Punjab government had purchased Pusa 1509 basmati paddy at Rs 1,450 per quintal  the minimum support price (MSP) for Grade A common paddy  as the rates of the long-grained commodity had dropped drastically. Before the government had entered the market, it was being sold for as low as Rs 1,000 per quintal due to which farmers protested saying they were suffering losses.Punjab Basmati Rice Millers Association general secretary Ashish Kathuria and legal cell head Ashok Aggarwal said, ""The state government had purchased Pusa 1509 basmati paddy at the MSP of Rs 1,450 per quintal when its rates were low to support the farmers and millers. Government was meant to deliver rice to central pool after custom milling. The government should not act as a trader for calling tenders to sell grain since due to its act, the farmers and millers might have to face losses as prices may not increase in the coming season. We have prepared a petition and will file it in Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday.""Kathuria alleged acting as a nodal agency, Markfed had decided to sell Pusa 1509 basmati paddy on behalf of three state-run agencies and tried to wipe out small players from the selling process as it had fixed minimum quantity at 600 tonnes. ""The paddy though was purchased at Rs 1,450 per quintal but by adding storage, transportation, various types of taxes, paddy costs the agencies nearly Rs 2,100 per quintal.""When contacted, Markfed general manager (procurement) H S Bains said, ""The state government is not acting illegally. The Centre has de-listed paddy and has allowed the state government to sell it in the open market."" He said that last time, tenders were floated in March at Rs 2,066 per quintal but nobody turned up so no reserve price has been fixed and purchaser has been asked to quote the price. As for quota of minimum 600 tonnes, he said that the state had to sell 1.88 lakh tonnes and the target could be achieved by fixing the minimum limit."

The city's top three private hospitals witness an increase of about 20% to 30% in the number of such cases in April.""There is a sudden increase of around 20% in the number of asthma cases, cough-related illness and other respiratory diseases after Baisakhi, when stubble burning is done in Haryana and Punjab. Despite a strict ban, crops are burnt during this season,"" said Dr Himanshu Garg, a city-based pulmonologist, who also blamed waste burning in open areas for increasing air pollution.Dr Piyush Goel from Colombia Asia hospital said, ""The process of husk removal also leads to pollution. We see an increase of 25 to 30% during this time in cases of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD - a heart disease that makes it difficult to breathe), and various allergies.""Air pollution level in the city also seems to have increased. If data released by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) is to be believed, PM2.5 has increased by 20 notches in the last 15 days. While the maximum level of PM2.5 was recorded at 101.37 ug/m3 on April 1, it was recorded at 131 ug/m3 on Friday. The level of sulphur oxides has also increased from about 41ug/m3 to 56 ug/m3 in the last 15 days.As per the provisions of Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Haryana's environment department issue a notification to farmers from time to time in order to prohibit the burning of agricultural waste in the fields.According to experts, the burning of crop waste in Punjab and Haryana adds to air pollution even places like Delhi and other NCR cities.""Burning a ton of rice straw releases about 5 kg of nitrogen in the air, besides releasing other pollutants such as potassium and sulphur. Stubble burning also leads to deteriorating quality of soil,"" said Dr Bhim Singh Gahlot, a city-based agricultural scientist.The offocials of HSPCB, however, refused to buy the argument that stubble burning is a major cause of concern in the city. ""The weather is already hot and wind speed is good so stubble burning shouldn't affect pollution level in the city.,"" said an official of HSPCB, who did not wish to be named."

The said amount , he said, was the amount incurred towards costs such as transportation cost, labour cost and other costs incurred by the state government while procuring food grains for centre.He said the amount due from the Centre was the result of balance amount due to provisional cost sheet prepared by the FCI and the actual costs incurred by the state.Sandhu said that banks who advanced the CCL to Punjab were taking that pending amount by the centre as the one against the grains stocks in Punjab and hence an impression that stocks were missing.He said out of 90 lakh tonnes of rice, only 50 to 60 thousands of rice were left to be delivered to the Centre.Kairon said a joint committee constituted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and headed by Union Food Ministry Additional Secretary and also comprising Food Secretary Punjab was looking into the matter and a final report was awaited.In its draft report, Kairon said, the committee had agreed to pay Rs 4300 crore towards transportation and labour costs. But we want the money with interest since the amount is pending since 2003, the year since the issue has been hanging fire, Kairon said.Responding to a query, Kairon said he would not go into any political aspect.Out of Rs 26,187 crore, Principal Secretary Sandhu said Rs 8113 crore was the principal amount and remaining Rs 18,074 crore was the interest amount.Kairon and Sandhu said procurement was not at all a profitable proposition and the state found itself at the receiving end while procuring grains for the Centre. For example, Pungrain has no other source of revenue. From where will it pay, if it is paid [by the FCI] less than what it incurred on procurement of grains, Sandhu said.Kairon said the issue relating to CCL would be sorted out in three to four days and payments would be released.On April 18 meeting of banks, he said it was internal meeting of the banks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The state government has planned to increase the area under horticulture to nine lakh hectare by 2026 from the current 2.5 lakh hectare. In the next 10 years, the government wants to increase the ratio of land under cultivation of horticulture versus agriculture to 25:75 from the current 7:93.Addressing a national seminar on 'Development of states, with special emphasis on northern-western states', organized at Institute for Development and Communication (IDC) on Thursday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the government was setting up centres of excellence for horticulture in every district in this connection. During the workshop, experts discussed issues contributing to the agrarian crisis, such as growth of farm debt and suicides and groundwater depletion. They said the growth of major crops of rice and wheat had experienced a decline in the past decade, and this could be attributed to Punjab reaching its highest attainable productivity under the current high-yielding variety (HYV) technology.IDC chairman and former union minister of planning and power Prof YK Alagh said they cannot have anti-grain policies, but it is equally important for them to diversify to produce jowar, maize, and pulses which can be achieved through incentivization. IDC director Dr Pramod Kumar stressed there was a need to give subsidies to agriculture. ""Subsidies are given as doles, and doles are a feudal response to the crisis of capitalism, while subsidies are a state-led capitalist response to the crisis of capitalism. On the other hand, elimination of 'freebies' is a market fundamentalist response to crisis of capitalism,"" said Kumar. ""It would be worthwhile to examine sectoral needs for subsidies to promote equity and productivity,"" he added. Agriculture scientist Devender Sharma said since the 1970s, the minimum support price has increased only 19 times, whereas the increase in incomes of other sectors has been almost 150 times.Chairperson of IIM-Ahmedabad's Centre of Management in Agriculture Prof Sukhpal Singh, Ludhiana's Punjab Agriculture University vice-chancellor Prof B S Dhillon, Punjab's chief finance and economic adviser Prof B S Ghuman and Centre of Research in Rural and Industrial Development's Prof S S Sangwan also spoke on the occasion."

The grain processing machinery manufacturing companies, which includes national as well as international ones, will exhibit the latest technology which can be beneficial to farmers and grain mill traders. Bihar is an agrarian economy and as the state has a good production of paddy, wheat and maize, the grain processing machinery manufacturing companies aim to target farmers and grain mill traders, as there is no big grain processing unit. Surinder Gupta, the chairman of Business Empire, the unit which is organising the exhibition, said: ""In absence of big grain processing units in the state, the wheat and paddy produced in the state are processed in other states especially at Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Due to processing of grain in other states, the farmer as well as mill owners suffer losses."" The idea behind holding the exhibition is to showcase the latest technology in grain processing so that farmers and mill owners can introduce new techniques. The paddy, after going through various process in mills such as de-stoning, whitening, polishing, colour sorting, the rice is recovered which after packaging is sent to markets. Manish Sahay, director of Bihar Enterprises Association, said: ""The rice mills operating in district as Rohtas, Sasaram, Kaimur and Buxar have middle level rice mill processing unit. The mills are inferior to ones in Punjab and Haryana, as they hardly go for colour sorting. The technique is used to remove black colour from paddy. Sahay said the idea is that farmers and grain mill owner will know about the new technologies which can be beneficial to them, thus improving the quality of whole processed grain. The average cost of installing grain processing unit (middle level) is around Rs 30 to 40 lakh. The organisers claimed that with introduction of new technology, not only will there be improvement in qualities of processed grain but also there will be increase in production. Sahay said: ""The modern machines not only increase the output of processed grain, but also takes less time in processing than normal machines."" Similarly, the exhibition will also have wheat and maize processing machines. As the Kosi region leads in maize production, in absence of advanced grain processing unit, the farmers are left with no other alternative but to sell their produce at lower rates. The modern maize milling machine can help the farmers get various kinds of corn products, such as cornflour and others. The exhibition will be inaugurated by industries minister Jai Kumar Singh. At the exhibition, farmers and interested mill owners booking machines will also get discounts."

Afonso Pedro Canga, agriculture minister, Angola, visited PAU to strengthen linkages for development of agricultural extension, education and research in Angola.Angolan agriculture minister Eng Afonso Pedro Canga acknowledged the research contributions made by PAU at the international level and its tireless efforts towards the cause of food security for millions around the world. While applauding PAU's close connections with farmers through an organized extension programme, the minister invited officials of the university to Angola in order to see and understand agricultural challenges faced by Angola, as it is in a phase of reconstruction after being ravaged in war. He also mentioned the use of PAU maize and rice varieties for propagation in Angola to increase food production in the country.Vice-chancellor Dr B S Dhillon, while interacting with the Angolan delegation, informed about the relationship of PAU with African countries and that, especially because of similar agro ecology, the chances of collaboration are stronger. He accepted partnership proposal for Angolan students and also offered to undertake exchange programmes for faculty, students and farmers with the African country. Dr Dhillon highlighted PAU's strong programmes in seed production, plant protection and soil science and also proposed to set up PAU College of Agriculture and Engineering in Angola to help develop their agriculture sector."

Alleging that Bihar was going through ""jungle raj"", Paswan sought the resignation of chief minister Nitish Kumar and reiterated his demand for imposition of President's rule in the state.Paswan alleged that crime, including murder and rape, had become routine in Bihar to such an extent that even journalists were not safe and gave examples of recent incidents of lawlessness and crime.Paswan, who is the Union minister of consumer affairs, food and distribution, patted the Narendera Modi-led NDA government for not allowing prices of essential commodities to rise. He said rates of most items, including wheat and rice, had not registered any hike barring cereals since their production was only 170 lakh tonnes per year as compare to the consumption of 246 lakh tonnes.He also attributed lower output of cereals in India to poor rainfall. Paswan quipped that state governments were making claims of providing cheap wheat, rice and cereals to poor people, though the reality was that it was being given by the Centre."

So we are advising the farmers to curtail the area under basmati rice to less than 5 lakh hectares during the current kharif season. This would help clear the accumulated stocks, said the PAU release.In Punjab, basmati rice was planted on 8.62 lakh hectares in 2014-15.In 2015-16, the crop was cultivated on 7.60 lakh hectares.Higher sowing coupled with huge carryover stocks led to a crash in basmati rice prices in the domestic market, the PAU said.Decline in pricesLast year, farmers in Punjab and neighbouring Haryana suffered losses as the premium basmati variety was sold at a price that was even below regular paddy (rice).Basmati PUSA 1509 variety was offered in the range of Rs. 1,000-Rs. 1,200 per quintal last season, which was almost half the price that farmers got in 2014-15.Price of long-grain staple could stay weak in the coming season due to carryover stocks"
58f4cab4a3d24b0b70c19777,The ambiguities of gurudom,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-ambiguities-of-gurudom/article14391469.ece,2016-06-05,"Newspaper reports on the Jawahar Bagh killings in Mathura followed in quick succession accounts of the extravaganza hosted by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on the floodplain of the Yamuna in Delhi. Both reports reinforce convictions that our world is best described as topsy-turvy. There was a time when statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru believed that religion was dangerous because it convinced followers that hunger, filth and misery were their natural lot. Today god-men, accomplished practitioners of the art of politics, wield considerable power and political clout. But they wilfully overlook, and thereby sanction misery, hunger and filth.Consider the paradoxes of this rapidly growing phenomenon. Men of god are expected to be renouncers. New-age gurus dress in flashy apparel, travel in luxurious private planes, host celebrations attended by pomp and splendour, and endeavour to arouse shock and awe among devotees. Ministers, Supreme Court judges, high-ranking bureaucrats, police officers, corporate honchos, and media personalities genuflect at the feet of self-styled gurus. Never have religious leaders fetched such unthinking obeisance, and untrammelled power as they do today. It is not surprising that they have neither time nor inclination to do something about the ills of our society.Down the agesThis was not always so. In all religions, visionary spiritual leaders have challenged hierarchies and disparities, exploitation and discrimination of the community. From the sixth to the sixteenth century the Bhakti movement launched a powerful attack on caste-based discrimination in Hinduism. Till today the subversive poetry authored by Kabir is remembered, recited and sung. Pandit, he addressed the Brahmin, look in your heart to know. Tell me how untouchability was born  untouchability is what you made so.Right up till the turn of the twentieth century, a number of religious leaders driven by the quest for a moral order, and fired by the belief that untouchability was a later appendage to Hinduism, tried to retrieve the spiritual essence of the religion. Over the millennia, others threw up their metaphorical hands in despair, broke away and established new religions  Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Hinduism, smudged deeply by social exclusion, became the object of struggle, the target of social reform movements, and often the butt of ridicule.Do we see any of this questioning by cults today? Perhaps not. Self-styled gurus can hardly launch a critique of a system of which they are the beneficiaries. When the spiritual leader of the infamous Swadheen Bharat Subhas Sena, Jai Gurudev, died in 2012, he reportedly left property and land worth Rs.12,000 crore, a school, a petrol pump, a temple that secured him immortality, ashrams, assets, and luxury cars. Hinduism is a religion that teaches detachment; ironically, leaders of cults are passionately attached to worldly possessions, power and pelf. Their power is on public display. Certainly, Indians have bowed their foreheads before gurus, renouncers, holy men, savants and peripatetic sadhus since time immemorial. But these transactions between believers and faith leaders were private, confidential and sacrosanct. These days transactions are public affairs; conspicuously orchestrated mega-events are televised and breathlessly consumed by a global constituency.Soulless world and leadersWhy do then thousands of people flock to new-age gurus on show? Perhaps there is an answer. Within the tradition, the guru spent many years mastering philosophical knowledge because his role was that of a medium between individuals and the divine. He himself was never the divine. Yet access to the spiritual leader was restricted through elaborate rituals of exclusion of castes and often women.The prime attraction of todays guru is that he/she is accessible to all. The gates of spiritual wisdom have been thrown open, gatekeepers have been dispensed with, and religious philosophy has been democratised. Whether the leader himself is a democrat is questionable. But that does not matter for people who have been left rudderless in a world of vulgar consumerism and stark disparities. They have lost confidence in their ability to negotiate the demands of a market-driven society. In capitalist society the value of a person is judged by the value of her possessions. Individuals themselves become commodities at considerable cost to their self-esteem and assurance.Social norms breed despair, and the guru becomes the healer, the confidant, and the protective patriarch or matriarch. In a commodity-driven world, where ordinary people lurch  like a fragile raft on stormy waters  from one crisis to another, religion becomes as Marx had said, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of the soulless condition. The problem is not with religion, it is with this soulless world that many seek to negotiate with the help of a religious leader.The quest for reassurance and validation of the self through face-to-face interaction with a local deity, or saint or a god-man is not new. In Punjab, for years Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs worshipped together at roadside shrines, or at the tomb of a Sufi saint. In the town of Malerkotla, Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs offer money, jewels, and cooked sweet rice at the mazaar of Sheikh Sadr-ud-Din, the founder of Malerkotla and a Sufi saint. Thousands of people visit a fair held on the first Thursday of every month. In 1904 the author of the Malerkotla Gazetteer wrote in a puzzled mien, It is strange that these fairs are mostly attended by Hindus though Sadr-ud-Din was a Muslim saint. This is a town of Sufi tombs, temple bells hang in front of mosques, and Om is tattooed on the hands of the keeper of the shrine. Notably Malerkotla has never witnessed a communal riot, simply because joint worship created a political community. It is debatable whether modern gurus teach followers to live in harmony with other fellow beings. At best, they teach instant moksha , at worst they exploit followers.Hindutva versus god-menIronically personalised worship to a new-age guru has recreated multiple centres of belief that are characteristic of Hinduism. Historians tell us that the unified religion we call Hinduism is a colonial construct, because it were colonial administrators and missionaries who lumped various groups, philosophies, faiths, and ideologies under the umbrella term Hinduism. Neo-Hindu leaders, buffeted by criticism of practices sanctioned by Hinduism, responded to the colonial encounter by projecting a pan-Indian religion.Over time this religion provided identity and inspiration to sections of the nationalist movement. V.D. Savarkar refused to accept that Hinduism is of relatively recent provenance, and suggested that the religion goes back into ancient time. He called it Hindutva, an ideology that forms the crux of the homogenising project of the religious Right. The irony is that Hindutva can only go so far, it contributes to identity formation through differentiation, but it cannot fill empty or half-filled pockets, give jobs, assure dignity, promise security, or allay insecurities and complexes. That only an urban-based guru or a cult, which has replaced the traditional roadside shrine, can give.The contradiction is that even if gurudom feeds into the project of Hindutva, spiritual leaders exercise, for the state, dangerous autonomy. For example, Jawahar Bagh developed into an independent township within the precincts of a sovereign India. Its inhabitants established an economy, an educational system, a currency, and imparted training in violence to the children. They also created a rather wacky political and economic agenda, but one that posed a challenge to the government. That gurus influence considerably the electoral fortunes of the local candidate is the worst-kept secret in India. That is why politicians court them.We know that Hindutva is fractured along the lines of caste and class. But it is also a brittle construct because it has to compete with personalised religious cults for the loyalties of citizens. Over time, the project is bound to come a cropper, because what we call Hinduism is nothing but a time-bound coalition of cults, religious groups, personalised modes of worship and localised gods. These relentlessly subvert the homogenising ideology of Hindutva. For the rational, god-men are irrational, for the votaries of Hindutva they provide a rather major headache.Neera Chandhoke is a former Professor of Political Science, Delhi University.These days transactions are public affairs; conspicuously orchestrated mega-events are televised and breathlessly consumed bya global constituency"

A large part of the country is witnessing drought, declining ground-water levels, and shortage in reservoirs, following two consecutive sub-normal monsoons.Deficit rainfallRainfall deficiency in 2014 and 2015 stood at 12 per cent and 14 per cent of normal, respectively. In 2015 rainfall received by Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab and West Uttar Pradesh was more than 50 per cent below normal. This has taken a toll on agricultural production, according to the report.As per the third advance estimates for 2015, rice output was down two per cent, coarse cereals fell 12 per cent, pulses declined by 0.5 per cent along with sugarcane (0.5 per cent) and oilseeds, (six per cent) exacerbating rural distress. Agriculture GDP growth averaged 0.4 per cent in the last two fiscals, much below the long-term trend of 3 per cent.An above-normal monsoon this year will augment groundwater and reservoir levels and in turn increase crop production, according to the report.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reiterated its April forecast of a good south-west monsoon  at 106 per cent of the long period average (LPA). However, the report said that the sensitivity of crops to rainfall signals the need for improvement in irrigation facilities, change in cropping patterns, harnessing of rainwater, adoption of water conservation techniques and availability of stable electricity. Also, efficiency of water usage needs to improve. India currently uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, compared with half that  or 1,321 cubic metre  in China. This underlines the need to address structural issues. An important source of irrigation in India is groundwater, which accounts for as much as 60 per cent of water used for irrigation. Also, irrigation accounts for close to 90 per cent of the total groundwater consumed in the country  the proportion is 98 per cent and 94 per cent for in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.Farm outputDuring the green revolution, the report said, with excessive use of inputs to pump up farm output, farmers increasingly moved towards using groundwater compared with surface water for irrigation. This was supported by government subsidies for electricity supply and irrigation equipment. Excessive use of groundwater has led to depletion of the water table. Between 1993-94 and 2014-15, the share of wells with groundwater less than 10 metre has fallen by 6 percentage points, while that of wells with groundwater more than 60 metre has risen to 6 per cent from 4 per cent, making it increasingly difficult to access ground water.India uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, while China uses half that amount"
5922db877be9e01fd59ac0f9,1.25 lakh new tube wells may deepen Punjab’s groundwater troubles,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/1-25-lakh-new-tube-wells-may-deepen-punjabs-groundwater-troubles-2842180/,2016-06-09,"Currently, out of 141 agricultural development blocks in Punjab, 102 fall in the dark zone, where water is 200 ft or deeper. Currently, out of 141 agricultural development blocks in Punjab, 102 fall in the dark zone, where water is 200 ft or deeper.For over a decade, the Punjab government has been taking steps to save underground water reserves by introducing policies like the Contract Farming (CF) programme (2002), New Agriculture Policy for State (2013) and passing the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act (2009) to divert areas under the water guzzling rice crop towards other kharif crops. However, all efforts of diversion seem to have fallen flat and the area under rice cultivation still remains between 27-28 lakh hectares.Against this backdrop , the governments initiative to pledge nearly 1.25 lakh new tube well connections this year is likely to deal a major blow to the already depleting underground water level.Currently, out of 141 agricultural development blocks in Punjab, 102 fall in the dark zone, where water is 200 ft or deeper.The initiative raises several questions: Is the government not giving farmers a reason to choose rice cultivation by providing free irrigation facility? What is the need of increasing the number when there already exists 12.76 lakh electricity operated and 1.50 lakh diesel operated tube wells for an agricultural land area of 42 lakh hectares, of which around 11 Lakh hectares is irrigated through canal network? Why have the schemes to promote less water consuming kharif crops fallen flat? And , most importantly, why do 11 lakh farmers in Punjab need over 15 lakh tube wells?Around 10,000 new tube wells have already been sanctioned this year and connection for another 5,000 would soon be released. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has been given the task of installing the new tube wells by the end of this year.KD Chaudhri, chairman-cum-managing director of PSPCL, says that the company is trying to release the new connections as soon as possible. The release of 1.25 lakh tube well connections would cost over Rs 500 crore and the power subsidy in the state would rise to around Rs 6,000 crore, Chaudhri said. In the current year, the state government has already waived off Rs 5,484 crore as power bills of farmers.Each tube well would cost farmers about Rs 2-2.25 lakh with an average of 7.5 to 12 horsepower (HP) motors.The new connections would encourage farmers to go for more paddy cultivation which has an assured market and price, say experts in the states Department of Agriculture, adding that the diversification scheme  aiming to divert area from paddy to other crops  will receive a major setback.Already, the area under cotton in the state has gone down by over 1.5 lakh hectares compared with last years on fears of whitefly attack, and now a major portion of this cotton area may go under paddy. The figures procured from the Department of Agriculture, Punjab, reveal that while the number of electricity-operated tube wells increased from 5 lakh in early 1980s to 12.5 lakh in 2001-02, around 3.25 lakh tube wells were installed in just five years during1996-01 as the state government had announced free power to farmers in 1997. The figures also reveal that the number of diesel-operated tube wells has been more or less same since early 1990s and currently stand at around 1.5 lakh.Manmohan Kalia, an engineer with the Department of Agricultures tube well wing says that a 5 HP motor is installed for irrigating two hectares of land which costs anywhere between Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000 to farmers. However, farmers mostly go for deeper tube wells due to depleting groundwater, and for that, high-capacity motors of 7.5-12 HP are preferred which cost between Rs 1.5 to 2.5 lakh depending on the depth.Rajesh Vashishth, joint director at the Department of Agricultures hydrology division says that during paddy season, when the rainfall is in deficit, running of 14 lakh tube wells simultaneously puts huge pressure on the ground water of the state that has been witnessing an average level of 200 feet or deeper in major portions of central Punjab which includes the entire Majha, Doaba regions and some districts of Malwa region, including Patiala, Moga, Sangrur etc. (nearly 80 per cent of the state).He admits that over drilling of land is not a healthy trend.In the last 4-5 years, the average fall in groundwater level across the state has been between 1.2 and 25 metres, but in areas like Sangrur district it has been recorded at more than two metres in the past. Even in 2015, five districts (Bathinda, Tarn Taran, Nawanshahr, Sangrur and Mansa) witnessed a drop in water level post-monsoon due to deficient rainfall. Water level has gone down between 1 and 9 metres in these districts in the last 4-5 years.Experts say increasing the number of tube wells would deepen the groundwater crisis as Punjab has hardly received above-normal rain for the past one decade.The state witnessed drought in 2014 as rainfall was (-)50 per cent. Rainfall was deficient in 2012, 2009 and 2007 as well, but farmers saved their crop by running all 14 lakh tube wells, says Vashishth, adding that they had applied for these connections.One should not forget that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) of the US had warned that agriculture output in Punjab and Haryana could collapse if groundwater is extracted ruthlessly, says Amrik Singh, agriculture development officer, Pathankot, adding that even the Central Ground Water Board has been issuing warning to Punjab for many years now.Why is the government highlighting its free power subsidy of over Rs 5,000 crore? Why not promote less water consuming crops and support their marketing with the power subsidy amount, questions Avtar Singh, a farmer from Char Ke village in Jalandhar.The ground water which was available at 60 to 65 feet earlier is now found at 200 feet and every time farmers have to spend more on getting deeper the bores, says Singh. He questions as to what is stopping the government from regulating underground water usage.The government has led the farmer community in a wrong direction by its vote-bank policy, and now the return is difficult, but not impossible if serious efforts are made in a phased manner, says another farmer, Devinder Singh of Adrahman village in Jalandhar, adding that due to overdose of fertilisers and pesticides the ground water has also turned polluted over the years. Another farmer questions the logic behind having a tube well for every two hectares of land. Has our government got any explanation for all this, he quips.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58f55ebc7be9e01a17c9868b,Talk of restarting GM crop trials faces stiff opposition,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Talk-of-restarting-GM-crop-trials-faces-stiff-opposition/articleshow/52662706.cms,2016-06-09,"Nagpur: The statement by CD Mayee, a member of state government's technical committee on genetically modified (GM) crops, in a seminar in the city on Monday that the field trials be restarted has evoked sharp reaction from those against genetic engineering. The anti-GM group says the crops are not suitable for conditions in Maharashtra. Mayee is also the former director of city-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR).Last year, the state government had put on hold the restricted field trials of seven GM crops, including rice, maize, chickpea and cotton, after organizations like RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch raised objections.On Mayee's statement, Ajay Patki of the manch's core team said any attempt to introduce GM crops will be opposed tooth and nail. This can also be in the form of protests involving farmers and other means, he warned.""It is already proven that GM crops like Bt cotton need abundant availability of water, and large areas in Maharasthra are under dryland farming. Rather than GM, the country's indigenous varieties can also be promoted,"" said Patki.He said GM crops, especially Bt cotton, have increased the cost of production. Though not initially, in last 10 years or so the requirement of fertilizers has increased in the GM seeds, which has led to a major hike in the cost of cultivation. This has disbursed the economics of agriculture and often driving farmers into financial crisis leading to suicides, he said.Patki said his organization has already succeeded in stalling GM brinjals in 2009, when Jairam Ramesh was the minister for forest and environment under the UPA regime. A public hearing for GM brinjals was held at that time and the manch despite its minority was able to bring moratorium.""There is no need to introduce any manipulative technology for a commonly grown vegetable like brinjal. At that time, there was a major glut in brinjal supply in Vidarbha with rates crashing to 3 a kg."" said Patki.During the seminar, Mayee had insisted that trials should be allowed for at least drought-resistant varieties. One of the crops which was due for trial is drought-resistant rice.On this, Kishore Tiwari, who heads state government's Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), said normally rice is grown in assured rainfall regions so there is a little requirement of a drought-resistant seed for this crop. On the trials, Tiwari said he is not against research but that should come from the universities rather than corporates which eventually create a monopoly on the product.On an experimental basis, Tiwari's organization and the agriculture department in Yavatmal are distributing indigenous seeds in the 50 villages of this farmer suicide prone district. ""The traditional seeds which have evolved over a long period of time are itself drought resistant. The HMT developed by a local farmer in Bhandara can also work in low water conditions,"" said Tiwari.Vijay Jawandiya, a veteran farm activist, said the ready round (RR) up ready variety of Bt is suited for countries like the US where agriculture is mechanized. In India, weeding operation provides a major employment to rural labour. Bt cotton will stand its true test if it is successfully grown without fertilizers.He also questioned those backing Bt cotton. ""Why are straight line varieties, which are cheaper, available in the US than,"" he asked. In India, hybrid Bt which costs more is only available in the market.Mayee, on other hand, said adopting the technology comes later but at least trials should be allowed to test the pros and cons. These are limited field trials conducted in university farms. Distances from other fields are maintained as per the norms so that GM seeds do not contaminate other crops. However, if the test itself is barred, it will be a major setback to research and development. At least, drought-resistant and nitrogen-efficient crops in the batch of seven, which where genetic engineering of non-biotic nature, should be allowed for trials, he said.Maha yet to decide on field trialsOver eight months after the state's technical committee on GM crops gave its report setting aside objections raised against field trials of seven crops, the government has not reverted with an answer, CD Mayee told TOI.The committee is headed by former chairman of atomic energy commission Anil Kakodkar. The last meeting was held eight months ago and now the file is learnt to be put up before the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Tests have been held in states like Gujarat, Andhra and Punjab, but Maharashtra remains. This can be a major setback to research activities, he said.Last year, the tests were stopped after organizations like Swadeshi Jagran Manch raised objections which the committee was supposed to address. ""The government should now take a clear stand instead of delaying decision.

As Africans recede into anger and silence, Ankita Dwivedi Johri walks the faultlines for 24 hours. Photographs: Tashi TobgyalBaljit Singh has contemplated leaving Rajpur Khurd at least on two occasions. Zu Zan Hmos Osycal has considered the idea multiple times in the past one month. But this wasnt the plan the two men started out with. Rajpur Khurd is a crammed urban village in South Delhis Chhatarpur district, an address better known for its opulent farmhouses and grand weddings. In the past five years, close to a thousand men and women from African nations have made it their home. In the events of the past fortnight, the faultlines between them and the Rathi Jats in the village lie in the open.Black African men stand in the alleys of the Rajpur Khurd village in Chattarpur area of South Delhi during a power outage.

(Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)A week after Congolese national Masonda Ketada Olivier was beaten to death in neighbouring Vasant Kunj, four cases of attacks on African nationals were reported from the twin villages of Rajpur Khurd and Maidan Garhi. Following the attacks, over 15 African nations raised concerns over safety of their citizens in India. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and MEA officials had to step in to promise better security.Flanked by high walls, Rajpur Khurd faces power-cuts, water shortage and bumpy roads. The chasm between its old residents and new neighbours is the biggest hurdle of them all. There are few meeting points, and open racism and distrust.7 amLouzi, the cook from Chemas kitchen prepares a Nigerian lunch for the day at their residence in Rajpur Khurd village near Chattarpur in South Delhi.

After 10 minutes, a slightly groggy African woman steps out and hands her a big black bag full of trash. Relieved, the garbage collector dumps the bag onto her cart and moves to the next apartment.The term the girl uses is Arabic for Abyssinian, a nationality known as Ethiopian today. The term was used to describe the Africans who came to live in India in the pre-British era, arriving as merchants, fishermen and slaves. After Independence, it simply became a derogatory word, to describe anyone with a dark complexion and a thick mane of braided hair. In Rajpur Khurd, which houses a growing number of Africans, mostly Nigerian men looking for business opportunities, it is a term thrown about often.As the sun grows strong, the narrow lanes of the village, lined with general stores, repair shops and food stalls, leisurely come to life. At this early hour, there are few signs of the new residents among Rajpur Khurds 5,000-odd Jats. Its too early, wait for a few more hours, says a shopkeeper near a branch of Syndicate Bank in the village.Some time passes before Mike Enumah, a 36-year-old Nigerian garment businessman, appears. I buy clothes from markets in India and sell them in my country, says Enumah, who came to India in 2010, to do his Bachelors in Business Administration at the University of Mumbai. He moved to Rajpur Khurd in 2013 to live with his cousin.Today, as he visits the local store to get supplies for the day, Mike seems angry. Why do we suddenly have all these cameras in our faces? These images will be broadcast in my country, what will my family think? he says. I heard the news of the attacks on Africans, but I did not see them. It doesnt affect me, man, he shrugs.Michael Chema from Nigeria lives in the Rajpur Khurd village in Chattarpur and runs the Chema Kitchen while also claiming to be a businessman and a fashion store owner back home in Nigeria.

Indians own all the big companies in my country, they are treated with respect. But here , he stops mid-sentence. His landlord Ashok Rathi jumps in to finish the line. The ruckus is created by Africans who visit from Malviya Nagar and Dwarka areas. My tenants dont even drink and smoke. Here no panga, no tension, he quips.Ashok Rathi, who owns four buildings in the area, has reasons to be happy with tenants such as Mike. Rajpur Khurd is believed to have been set up by Raj Singh Rathi, a Jat farmer who came to Chhatarpur over 900 years ago. All residents of the village are considered his descendants, hence the surname Rathi on a majority of the nameplates outside houses. We were all farmers, but around 2008, the government started acquiring our land. So many of us built multi-storey houses on our plots to save our land. But no one was willing to rent and the flats remained unoccupied for over two years. That is when we opened our doors to the Africans. They paid more rent, Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 a month, says Ashok Rathi.Mike again insists things are fine. I came to India, leaving behind my wife and children, to make a living. I was told 60-70 per cent people speak in English in India. I havent picked up any Hindi, but havent had a problem. Go find those who have had a problem. Then, he objects, No pictures. Keep the camera away!NoonAfricans in India attend a get together with their local Indian house owners orgainsed by the Delhi Police in the Chattarpur area close to the Rajpur Khurd village where the incidents of alleged racial attacks took place.

(Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)Africans are not evil, man, they are simple, just like the Americans, Michael Chema proclaims to the room, which right now has his business partner Louzi and a few hungry men, flipping through English entertainment channels on television.Chema, a Nigerian, arrived in India in September 2014, after brief visits to Vietnam and Thailand. I am an international businessman Louzi cooks the best food in Rajpur. We began this kitchen service, says Chema, sitting in the living room of his three-room apartment. The house has the basics: an old couch, a few cushions, a mattress on the floor in the bedroom and an air-conditioner. All my friends come to my home because of the air-conditioner, he smiles.Its 10 minutes past noon, and the two have just woken up. Louzi heads straight to the small, cluttered kitchen, with a microwave and several large bowls. She hurriedly empties a packet of rice flour into a huge aluminium bowl, adds a little water, and then begins stirring the batter over high flame till it gets the consistency of dough. She then pulls out two large plastic boxes from the freezer. This is chicken curry and the kidney bean soup she made in the night, says Chema. But just as Louzi tries to explain the recipe, Chema interjects, You ask me the questions.The food prepared and re-heated, Chema settles down on the couch with the rice dough and chicken curry. Louzi heads back to the kitchen, to prepare food for the 20 customers who will come in the next hour. Life is very simple for me here. Language is a problem but I try to begin my sentence with bhaiyyaji (brother) That works most of the time, he laughs, dunking the dough into the curry and taking large bites. If Africans are involved in a fight, we try to go for peace always. But the ones who fight The hardships in India make African men very sad, angry  rents are high, food is expensive Maybe that is why they get into fights. But I want to live long, get married he says, talking about the recent attacks.Chika Mariamo (backin the pic) is been in Delhi for eight months and lives in the Rajpur Khurd village near Chattarpur in South Delhi.

(Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)As he works his way through the chicken curry, the other tensions begin pouring out. People stare at me all the time, but I guess that is because I have a great fashion sense. Indian men they are heartless, jealous, and the girls are shy That leads to some tension, he says, spitting out bones into a bowl.But here in Rajpur Khurd, it is all good. The Rathis protect us. They have lawyers and policemen in the family Once some men followed me from Malviya Nagar, but this old Rathi woman threatened to attack them with sticks. They fled immediately, he says, handing over the dishes to Louzi.As his friends begin trickling in for lunch, sold at Rs 200 a plate, the mood in the house gets lighter. A group of men head straight to the room with the air-conditioner, beer cans in hand. The others join their friends in the TV room. Louzi is hard at work in the kitchen. A few men light up, and a waft of sticky rubber-like smell fills the house. I am very popular, continues Chema. These are my friends, this is my iPhone, I have made a lot of money worked hard. We dont create any trouble the ones who do are the Africans from Malviya Nagar.There is a knock on the door, its his landlord. Louzi peers through the wooden door, not opening the iron gate just yet. Where is the money? You need to give Rs 6,000 for the AC, he demands.2 pmPastor Samuel Joseph is been in Delhi for a year and a half and lives in the south of Delhi towards the Chattarpur area preaching at a church there.

In 2000, on the advice of the relative, he left Sonepat with his wife and came to Rajpur Khurd. He runs a tuition centre on the ground floor of his house and has two children  a daughter, 7, and a 10-year-old son. In the past one-and-a-half years, he has made two changes to his house: put up CCTV cameras outside his balcony and a thick wooden stick at the entrance.In Africans ko chot lagne se bohot darr lagta hai (These Africans are scared of injuries). They feel if they bleed, their wounds wont heal in the Indian weather. So everytime they create a ruckus, I just threaten them with my stick and they flee, he says.The CCTV, now outside many homes in the village, is for proof, Baljit adds. They get drunk at night and relieve themselves outside my house. They have these gang wars and hurl abuses. But everytime I went to police with complaints, they asked for proof. That is why I have installed the CCTVs.Baljit also worries about the influence on his children. I am scared to even let them out in the balcony. The African women move around with alcohol. Sometimes at night we see men thrashing their wives or, I dont know, live-in partners, on the street. Even police are intimidated. They say embassy ka issue ho jayega. I have lost 20 per cent of my students because of this ruckus, he complains.Dariya Singh, a retired BSF officer, links the growing numbers of Africans in Rajpur Khurd to the other flashpoint involving the community in Delhi, the Khirki Extension episode of January 2014. It is our fault we let them invade this area. There is no unity in us. When we tell landlords to not keep them as tenants, they say You give Rs 10,000 a month, he says, adding that the Africans get drunk and drive around without helmets. All their cars have dark glasses, but police say nothing.A womens African salon in Rajpur Khurd village in Chattarpur area in South Delhi.

(Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)They drive around in fancy cars, buy clothes from malls, where do they get the money from? adds Baljit. One day they beg shopkeepers to give them some food, the next day they turn up with bundles of cash. We all know the work they do Why else does this place become a taxi stand at night? They all head to farmhouses and we know what happens there.For Zu Zan Hmos Osycal, it is such stereotyping that is responsible for the recent attacks. Pursuing his MA in Clinical Research from Punjab Technical University, Osycal claims his house was raided four days back for drugs. I understand this is not Vasant Kunj, this is a village, people are conservative but they can at least respect us. I want to have intellectual conversations with them, but no one wants that in Rajpur, he says, sitting in the small shoe and clothes shop which he runs with his wife.The 32-year-old from Liberia came to India five years back to study. He stayed in many parts of the capital before moving to Rajpur Khurd two years ago. But he is a minority in the village: an African student who lives with his wife.We hardly step out, just to Sarojini Nagar and Uttam Nagar to get clothes and shoes, and sometimes to INA market to buy some food. We dont interfere in anyones life. But then why does police come unannounced to my house? Why do villagers break into my shop and steal? I just want to finish my studies and go back, he says.His wife Mahrovia refuses to talk. I am not comfortable speaking about these issues, she says, arranging a few dresses. And dont take my picture! Samuel Joseph, a 64-year-old Nigerian and a pastor at a local African church, explains the communitys reluctance to getting noticed.Rajpur Khurd is the heart of African settlements in India, but the villagers here are very hostile to them After the recent attacks, cameras scare them, they feel any kind of pictures can be used against them, says Joseph, who sells dried fish to the local African kitchens in the village.A Nigerian man shows a bottle of a indigenous conction of lime leaves, garlic, ginger and whiskey which he claims cures all kinds of fever, pain and hypertension.

(Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)Indians here feel the Africans have no homes Some of them hold their noses when they pass by an African These things have created a big rift, and the issues cant be resolved overnight. It is true that a majority of the Africans in Rajpur Khurd have no jobs, they get into risky, illegal jobs for money, but that is true for Indians in this village too, he argues. It is the 21st century, Indians need to have good relations with foreigners.Though there is little fraternising between the Jats and Africans, there are a few exceptions. Like the 30-year-old Jamia Hamdard University student, who is helping a dhobi iron clothes. Like many in the village, she does not wish to be identified or photographed, but the dhobis assistants vouch for her. Thoda darawane dikhte hain, par baat karne par theek hain. Masti zyaada karte hain (They look intimidating, but once you talk to them, they are fine. They just fool around a lot), says one of the helpers.I often come here to help them out. We have good relations with Indians on a one-to-one basis But please dont ask me about the attacks, no one understands what we go through here, says the girl.5 pmKabeya (right) share details about the protest against locals after four African nationals were attacked.

(Source: Express photo by Cheena Kapoor)As the harsh afternoon sun wanes, more Africans faces are seen outside shops, in markets, at salons, but the boundaries are clearly marked. Chika Mariamo, 32, has stepped out to visit the salon. Only an African can style our hair, Indians dont know what to do with it, smiles Mariamo. There are few salons in the area run by African women. A Cameroon national, Mariamo has been in India for eight months. I came here to earn a living, I had heard about Delhi from my friends. I am still looking for a job, she says.Talking about the lack of English-speaking people in the village, Mariamo points to her pink tights and a fitted tank top, and adds, People here are extremely racist. Look how I am dressed now, is there a problem? I dont understand what the men say about me, but I am not a fool, their expression says it all.Mariamo is among the few African women who speaks about issues faced by the community, the others are happy to let the men do the talking. How will they talk? People here think the worst of them. We go out in the evening to meet friends, but we all know the rumours. Look at how they treat their own women. I have rarely heard any of the Indian women in the village complain about us, it is always the men, she says.Four African nationals were attacked in Rajpkhurd village of Chhatarpur, South Delhi on Thursday night.

They (Africans) have a few places where they gather in the evening. The landlords say they are students, but I have never seen a book in anyones hand. They are just middle-aged men with nothing to do, says Baljit. Ashok Rathi again tries to put up a defence. Their day begins in the evening. What is wrong with that?Mentioning the good things, he says, Once I had viral fever. One of my tenants gave me this tonic made out of whiskey and neem leaves. I was cured overnight. Most of my tenants make their own medicine. It is just like our Ayurveda.Around 6 pm, Mike Enumah and his brother, a few other African residents and some landlords, including Ashok Rathi, head to the sensitisation conference organised by the Delhi Police at a nearby resort since the attacks of May 28. The two groups get into different vehicles and sit in separate rows at the conference.While Mike claims to be assured after the meeting, his brother feels more needs to be done. Why take steps only after a tragedy? They need to do more in the village, he says, adding he does not wish to be named. He adds a request: Ignore the man from the afternoon who said he will break your camera. People here are just scared they are angry.9 pmThe attacks triggered a major diplomatic face-off between India and Africa.

Surrounded by posters of Will Smith in a small hair salon, Okezie is trimming the hair of one of his friends.Okezie came to Rajpur Khurd two years back and while he too claims to be a garment businessman, styling peoples hair helps him make some extra money. His wife and two children are back home. I want to grow my business. I have pitched several ideas to the Indians in the village but you guys dont like foreigners. Indians need exposure; there is no cultural exchange in the village, he complains.Okezies decision to come to India went beyond work though. I grew up watching Bollywood films in Nigeria; I was fascinated about the country.On his way to Rajpur Khurd from the airport, he says, he was amused to see so many cows on the streets. Now applying some gel on his clients hair, he points out, But we accept all that. We are big, we look different, speak a little aggressively, but we mean no harm. Maybe a few pictures before he downs the shutters? No, he says firmly.MidnightJason (centre), one of the victims, share details about the protest against locals after four African nationals were attacked in Rajpkhurd village of Chhatarpur, South Delhi.

Baljit and a few of the neighbours gather on one terrace, a vantage point that helps them keep an eye on them. PCR vans and policemen on bikes begin nightly rounds. Its quite hot but the men dont allow the women and children onto the terrace.Hamare gaon ko auto, taxi stand bana diya hai (They have made our village an auto, cab station), says one of Baljits friends. A group of African men, including Mike and his brother, meet up near the bank branch. There are some visitors from outside too, including just one non-African. As the group talks, their voices sometimes rising, Baljits friend says, After the attacks, they are careful, you should have seen earlier. He shows a video of what seems like a fight between two African women.On the street, the group seems aware of being watched. Some of them begin speaking in hushed tones, the others disperse everytime they see a police vehicle. There are three other spots, the villagers say, where the Africans gather every night. But the spots are vacant tonight. If only the policemen were this vigilant on other days, says Baljit.Blessy runs a store in Rajkhurd village of Chhatarpur where four African nationals were attacked.

Some African men continue to roam the streets till 3 am, some play music on their phones. The ones visiting from outside begin dispersing.It seems like a regular night, but the villagers are not convinced. Agle hafte aana, zyaada din shaant nahin rahenge (Come next week.

Despite being biggest contributors in the central pool of foodgrain, Punjabs farmers are struggling for their livelihood now.India used to import petrol and diesel from Iraq while would import Basmati rice from India. But Modi stopped importing petroleum products from Iraq and replaced it with Syria. As a result, Iraq stopped purchasing Basmati from India, thereby pushing the farmer community of Punjab into deep mess, he added.He said Modi had vowed to implement report of Swaminathan commission, which is the only solution to farmers crisis, and waive debt on them, but he forgot that. So, we will offer him the blood to remind him of the promise he had made in the election manifesto and awaken him to redress the condition of farmers who are opting to end their precious lives. We will also gherao him, he added.Detailing about the programme, Zira said they have divided all districts into seven zones and blood will be collected from two farmers of each zone. He said he would visit to Barnala, Bathinda and Mansa districts on Friday to collect the blood.At the office of Amritsar district Congress committee (rural), he collected the blood of farmer Raghbir Singh, resident of village Sairon (Amritsar district), and Ranjit Singh, resident of village Gaddiwind (Tarn Taran district)."

The followers who expressed desire to leave the camp for their native homes fearing action from the local administration, were motivated to stay back and told how they can attack the police if they ever raided Jawahar Bagh.These are some of the details that Ram Vrikshs close associate Chandan Bose, who was arrested along with his wife from Basti district Wednesday, revealed during the police interrogation.Bose and his wife were produced in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Thursday, which sent them to 14 days judicial custody. The couple had been on the run after the violence on June 2 saw 29 people, including two police officers and, reportedly, Ram Vriksh, dead.SSP Mathura, Babloo Kumar told The Indian Express that during preliminary interrogation Bose divulged crucial information about the functioning of the camp in the Jawahar Bagh. Bose, who is said to be the second-in-command in the cult outfit, told the police how the followers were assigned different duties in the camp based on the their educational and personal skills.Watch Video: Whats making newsA quack from Buxar, who was also a follower of Jai Gurudev, acted as the doctor in the camp while Bose was handling finances and ration. Those who were skilled in handling arms, used to give shooting training inside the camp while those who had studied management and law were dealing with their respective sections of fund management and legal issues, the SSP said quoting Bose.According to police, Bose told them that there were some 2,500 people living in the camp till June 2, the day when police moved in to evict the area. There used to be a head count of the members every night before they went to bed, Bose told the police.Ram Vriksh used to collect funds to run the camp from the inmates even as many of the rich followers of Jai Gurudev used to donate lakhs of rupees.Bose recalled that recently some from Deoria district donated Rs 10 lakh. But, such big donations came only once in a while. Ram Vriksh used to issue receipts against the donations too, the SSP said.Bose also told the police that those living in the camp were urged to go to their native villages during harvest season and bring back maximum donation of foodgrains. The villagers used to come back with trucks loaded with wheat, rice and sugarcane, the SSP said.The modus operadi of collecting funds was reportedly copied from the Jai Gurudev Trust in Mathura and Pithora.Bose accepted that people in the camp had laptops, mobiles and guns. He, however, could not reveal from where the arms were procured saying that he wasnt in charge of that section.The SSP said that based on Boses interrogation, they now have several leads, which will help them in carrying out the probe.Accused of inciting the violence on June 2, Bose told police that he was a native of West Bengal and had shifted to Ludhiana about 20 years ago. He ran a small garment business and claimed to have came in contact with Ram Vriksh during the latters visit to Ludhiana a few years ago, police said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5923bc047be9e01fcef05835,Redressal policy for water dispute hazy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553627/redressal-policy-water-dispute-hazy.html,2016-06-21,"Redressal policy for water dispute hazyBy Bhaskar Parichha, Jun 22, 2016, DHNS 0:28 ISTExperts feel the need for an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in India.As recent as in March, the National thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had to shut down its 2100 MW capacity power plant in West Bengal because it hadnt enough water to be used as coolant for the equipment.The level in the Farakka feeder canal which supplies water to the thermal plant had shrunk to hopeless levels. That was also the reason why electricity supply to five states was disrupted and some 40,000 families had to remain without power for days together.Drinking water was in short supply in Farakka town. Plying of boats on river Ganga had to be suspended and around 13 barges carrying coal were stuck in the mid-river because of low levels of water. This demonstrates that the Ganges is drying up faster than estimated.According to different reports, in the last decade itself, water level in 91% of countrys water reservoirs has come down. The Central Water Commissions findings are even more frightening  only 29% of water is left behind against their carrying capacity. Whats more, ground water which is the major source 85%  of water in India is depleting endlessly.Across states in India, dependence on water tankers today is greater than before. Water-related scuffles nowadays are common place. Recently, in the villages of Latur district of Maharashtra, prohibitive orders had to be clamped. Water supply to swimming pools has been cut off in Maharashtra.According to NASA, the ground water level in India is diminishing by 0.3 metre annually. Paradoxically, when there is a severe shortage of water, farmers in desiccated areas are encouraged to produce water-guzzling sugar cane. Same is the case with wheat and rice which are water-intensive.On the other side of the spectrum, water disputes are constantly on the rise. In addition to the fact that there isnt enough water for irrigation because of the myopic policies of successive governments, water is causing bad blood among people. In Punjab, after the Sutlej link canal bill was passed in the assembly, fissures have surfaced between Haryana and Punjab over division of water. In Haryana, farmers owning agricultural fields are screaming for water.Of late, state after state seem to be relying on the principle of Harmon. State governments are fostering a gut feeling that they have full control over the water that flows down from the state line.In order to trim down water disputes between states, the Inter-State Water Dispute Act was enacted in 1956. But the water dispute tribunals have consistently failed to implement the accords reached between states.In as much as the tribunal doesnt have coercive powers and its judgments are not binding on the states, the pronoun-cements are flouted and states straightforwardly refuse to abide by the agreements reach-ed. Even the Centre is toothless, as it happened in the case of Ravi-Beas river water dispute.Institutional safeguardsIn reality, the water dispute redressal mechanism in India is a lot ambiguous, hazy and muddled. Those involved in the water row, time and again, has recourse to bullying. Resolution of water dispute is a hell of a job because of the sheer number of players  the Centre, the state governments, the water dispute tribunals, the civil society and so on. Even institutional safeguards meant for development and progress is becoming ineffective.Take for example, the Cauvery river water dispute. From 1968 to 1990, there were as many as 26 minister-level talks between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; but there has been no answer to the row. Because of increasing politicisation, the Cauvery river dispute tribunals proposals have become some sort of a wild goose chase.Experts feel the increasing need of an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in the country. This Central regulatory body must know how to undertake water upkeep seriously. In the same way, we need a mechanism to share our water in the best possible way keeping in mind the social equity, need and lots of common wisdom.Industries, farmers and the common citizenry should be the partners in any talk of water distribution and conservation. We also need a couple of new laws and make stronger the present ones to maintain the ecological balance of Indias rivers. A new law to maintain minimum levels of water too is considered necessary. Politicisation of water is the last thing to be wished.All that is looked for is an attitudinal change among stakeholders. A long time solution to Indias water problem is enormously significant and the sooner we find an answer to the vexing problem of depleting water sources and the corresponding feuds the better. Water is one commodity which can never be put to buy and sell. Commercialisation of water can happen only in the depths of despair."

The association has now approached the Chennai-based assistant registrar, trademarks and geographical indication and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to take action against the ""guilty"" millers.As per Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and parts of western Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir were registered for GI tag for basmati rice in February according to geographical demarcation conducted by APEDA. The case of Rajasthan and MP is pending for consideration.""The millers of Rajasthan and MP are not authorized, but they are using GI tag of basmati rice on their bills, websites and advertisements. They are using harmonized system (HS) code of basmati while exporting rice in the international market. They try to mislead people by claiming that basmati originated in geographical areas of Rajasthan and MP whereas it relates to seven north Indian states. By doing so they indulge in false representation to the public,"" said PRMA general secretary Ashish Kathuria.He said there was difference of Rs 18-20 per kg between local grown rice and basmati.""We have procured 47 packets prepared by various millers and manufacturers from Rajasthan and MP. As per our investigations, 14 exporters from these states have purchased rice in bulk and are exporting it by putting HS commodity code which is reserved for basmati.""Punjab Basmati Millers Association president Ashok Grover said, ""Millers and farmers of Punjab and Haryana face an estimated loss of Rs 2,000 crore in 2015."" He said they had provided the list of few millers, sellers, traders and exporters who were advertising their products on various websites and had requested to appoint a team to verify the facts.The assistant registrar of trademarks and GI Chinnaraja G Naidu was not available for comments. An official in his office said, ""Violation of GI is dealt by our office and the complaint will be looked into., and if required appropriate action will be taken."""

Principal director of income tax Parneet Sachdev refused to divulge any details about this high profile case.Meanwhile, in another series of action of search and survey operations, joint director of the department Rohit Mehra led various teams and unearthed a total of Rs 38 crore black money including Rs 2.53 crore cash from three Amritsar-based businessmen, two of whom are into the textile business and third is a photo album manufacturer. The amount of seizure can go up in the coming days as the department further investigates these cases.Along with the fresh haul, the department during the last one month alone has unearthed more than Rs 40 crore worth black money out of which Rs 2.16 crore was seized in various operations in Ludhiana, including the one in which Rs 1 crore was seized by police from a SUV belonging to a UP-based businessman and Rs 53.5 lakh from a railway passenger."
58f495baa3d24b68099aef5d,Can the Aam Aadmi Party win Punjab?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Can-the-Aam-Aadmi-Party-win-Punjab/article14468549.ece,2016-07-02,"Pre-monsoon rains bring some relief in the June heat as farmers sow paddy in the fields. The fields gradually give way to the bustling, noisy Sirhindi gate in Malerkotla. The only Muslim-majority town in Punjab, which remained untouched by violence even during the dark days of Partition, convulsed in anger on the night of June 24 after torn pages of the Koran were recovered outside a cemetery. Vehicles were torched and a few people, including local policemen, were injured. Elsewhere in Punjab, pages from the Bhagwad Gita were found strewn on the street in Ludhiana in November last year; a month prior to it, the Guru Granth Sahib was mutilated in many towns of the State.Taheed Mohammad, a fruit-and-vegetable vendor in Malerkotla, lays the blame squarely on politicians for such mischievous acts intended at diverting attention from the real issues ahead of the Assembly elections in the State some months from now. Im not going to vote this time. Its a sheer waste of time and effort. They [political parties] are all the same. After grabbing power, they are least bothered about our problems, says Mr. Mohammad, in a rush to sell his wares so that he could be home in time to break his roza (fast).Many in the Malerkotla market share Mr. Mohammads cynicism, of the sameness of Akali and Congress rule. So, it is not without reason that there is guarded optimism about the new party on the block, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which made a spectacular debut in the State by grabbing four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general election. As it bids to make a winning debut in the Punjab Assembly next, the AAP is making a lot of noise here. Posters of a recent CVoter survey predicting an AAP victory are plastered all over town in Malerkotla. We want better roads, regular water supply and jobs for youth, and if AAP assures us of these, we might consider supporting it, says Mohammad Shamshad Hazi, a local barber across the street, as customers waiting in line for a snip nod in agreement.The third playerAs battle lines get drawn in Punjab between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine and the Opposition Congress for the 117 Assembly seats in early 2017, theres a third player on the horizon seeking to tap into bipolar anti-incumbency  the AAP  turning it into a three-way contest.The ruling Akali-BJP government, in power for over nine years, is battling a deep agrarian crisis, which has led to indebtedness experts peg at roughly Rs.60,000 crore, with 20 farmers committing suicide every month on average. The rampant drug menace in the State has only added to its bag of woes. With inter-sectarian fights between religious groups to boot, many are taking a dim view of the stranglehold of the Badal family  Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and Deputy-Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal  on the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (that manages all gurdwaras in the State) and State politics at large.The AAP, which is pitching itself as the alternative to the Akalis and the Congress, is preparing its cadre at the grass-roots level harping on anti-incumbency. We present an honest alternative. We will get support from all sections, specially those [aged] between 18 and 40 years which will be the deciding factor in these elections, says Sanjay Singh, in charge of Punjab affairs for AAP, adding that the party will focus on the agrarian debt, the drug mafia, the transport mafia and the sand mafia which he alleges enjoys the patronage of Akali leaders.It is easier said than done, though. Says Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute for Development and Communication, Chandigarh, The ruling party is under pressure this time on these issues but I doubt whether this will work to AAPs advantage as it is unable to address the complexities of Punjab politics. The AAP does not have a historical baggage, but neither does it have historical advantage.For starters, finding a leader with mass appeal across the State and deciding on candidates have proved to be the biggest challenges the party is grappling with. Insiders say Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, State convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur and senior leader H.S. Phoolka are the top chief ministerial contenders but as Dalit writer Desraj Kali points out, the party does not have a local mass leader who can pose a challenge to heavyweights such as Parkash Singh Badal and Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh. In fact, the CVoter survey in April that predicted a win for AAP had Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as its chief ministerial party face for Punjab!The campaign constituenciesThe AAPs campaign is primarily endeavouring to tap into the unrest and anxieties of farmers, youth, women and marginalised sections such as the Dalits. Borrowing a leaf out of its successful Delhi playbook, it is leveraging bands of volunteers in every Assembly constituency at the booth level. In Ludhiana zone alone, the party has 10,000 active volunteers on its rolls. All AAP wings  those for farmers, industry & traders, youth, women, ex-servicemen and Dalits  have team heads in place for outreach activities. Within one week of the Parivar Jodo campaign in February, we had connected with over seven lakh people, claims senior AAP leader Kanwar Sandhu.Dalits account for nearly 32 per cent of the population in Punjab, the highest percentage among States, and it is in the Doaba belt  Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Nawanshahr districts  that they are in large numbers. The district is also known as the NRI hub of Punjab due to the significant numbers migrating overseas. Hence, all parties, including the AAP, are courting the Dalit and NRI vote in this belt. Mr. Sandhu claims the party is getting huge support from this unexpected quarter [NRIs]. The Doaba belt has had support for the Bahujan Samaj Party in recent years, but could rally behind the Congress this time unless the AAP has a clear programme for Dalits, says Gurmeet Singh, a senior Jalandhar-based political commentator.The party is also focussing on women and youth by linking issues such as drug addiction to the two demographics. Drugs and liquor have ruined the lives of my husband and son. I have tried to get my son treated at de-addiction centres, but all efforts failed. Its the [drug] supply chain that has to be cut. No NGO has approached us, but an AAP volunteer of the village made a commitment to me to help out, says Baldish Kaur of Diwali village in Jalandhar. With the youth constituting more than 30 per cent of the States population, Mr. Kejriwal, the partys national convenor, will release a Youth Manifesto for the Punjab polls in Amritsar on July 3. But manifesto apart, there is a lot of work ahead if one goes by what Vineet Bajaj, a BTech final-year student of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, has to say: I dont think AAP will be able to make a huge difference in Punjab as they are not performing well in Delhi. However, people are fed up of Akali-BJP rule, while the Congress is marred by infighting. So AAP has the chance to grab a few seats.The agrarian crisis has given the AAP the opportunity to tap into farmer resentment. In Dhudike village of Moga district, consistently lower prices for the produce against rising prices of farm inputs have pushed farmers into a debt trap. We have been suffering losses year after year but the government hardly pays adequate compensation. Last year in April, my wheat crop failed due to unseasonal rains and while I was lucky that my rice variety fetched a decent return during the last kharif season, many farmers in the neighbouring villages suffered huge losses as prices of basmati rice crashed, says Nirbhay Singh, who owns 14 acres and has mortgaged three acres with Rs.20 lakh still to be repaid to local moneylenders and a bank. Mr. Singh feels that a new government at the helm may just be what it takes for his fortunes to change  a sentiment shared by fellow farmer Balwinder Singh, though he hints that he is still undecided between the AAP and Congress.The challengers challengesThe AAPs first list of candidates will be out in mid-July or July-end, followed by lists every fortnight. The campaign will go full steam in October. Our message to the voter is that you have seen them all  they are all the same. Try us this time, says Mr. Sandhu.But the message has been foreshadowed by mutiny in the AAP ranks. Two of its MPs, Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa, had their primary party membership suspended in August last year after raising their voice against what they termed as Mr. Kejriwals autocratic style of functioning.If AAP plays its cards well, it still has a chance. But if people of dubious character from other parties are enrolled, it leads to the perception that AAP is not a party with a difference... and this is exactly what is happening, says Dr. Gandhi, adding, The Punjab unit of the party is being controlled directly from Delhi like a colony.The way old dedicated volunteers are being marginalised by Delhi and Punjab leaders, many would leave as I did, says Harmeet Kaur, who has now joined the Swaraj Party, the rebel group of AAP floated in May by Manjeet Singh which is backed by the Swaraj Abhiyan of former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.The Punjab Congress unit, which fancies its chances after the long spell of Akali rule, considers the AAP to have already peaked during 2014 parliamentary elections. In 2014, the AAP got the advantage of double-disillusionment in Punjab  the nationwide disillusionment after 10 years of Congress rule at the Centre and a strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Akali-BJP combine in Punjab, says Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh.The AAP peaked then but its progressive decline started soon after. Today the party is not in a position to win even a single seat in Punjab, he claims. The Congress chief is, however, mindful of their appeal: he has scaled back his trademark style of addressing large rallies in favour of an interpersonal outreach through campaigns such as Halke Vich Captain, i.e. Captain in your constituency, for you.The ruling SAD-BJP government too claims the AAP is no threat. Arvind Kejriwals anti-Punjab stance had been exposed in the Sutlej-Yamuna canal issue. He displayed a soft corner for Haryana as he hails from that State, alleges SAD spokesperson and Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema.Whether the AAP peaks in time or not, the dismissive attitude of its opponents will turn into no-holds-barred attacks as the campaign plot thickens in the months leading up to the elections.The AAPs campaign is primarily seeking to tap into the anxieties of farmers, youth, women and marginalised sections such as the DalitsThe Punjab Congress unit, which fancies its chances, considers AAP to have already peaked during the 2014 parliamentary elections.

(Source: File) Satnam Singh Bhamara is the first Indian to be drafted in the NBA. (Source: File)Phirjinder Singh Brar remembers watching nervously as son Palpreet lined up on the basketball court at the Ludhiana Basketball Academy five years ago. The nervous father was further zapped when after two sprints and a few jumps, the then 16-year-old was called forward by Indias legendary basketball coach the Late Dr S Subramaniam and the master merely bent over and felt Palpreets calf muscles. It was a bit strange, but after that he came up to us and said that Palpreet will become a big star one day, Phirjinder recalls. Now 21, the towering 6-foot-9 Centre will travel to the John Lucas Academy in Houston, Texas to train ahead of the NBA Development-League tryouts in August. Should he make the cut, hell follow in the footsteps of his former roommate Satnam Singh Bhamara, who became the first Indian to be drafted by an NBA Team, Dallas Mavericks, and currently plays for D-League outfit Texas Legends.The opportunity of the trials came after Palpreet won an NBA-organised talent hunt. He recently underwent a 45-day physical conditioning camp in Kochi. Most of it was on fitness, Palpreet explains. His initial physical assessment rated him 5.5 out of 10, which went up to a commendable 8.6. The calves now had stronger glutes and abs to complete the package.Growing up in Doda village in the Sri Muktsar Sahib district of Punjab, Palpreet loved working the land in the familys 20 acre farm of wheat and rice fields. Since he was six, hed sow seeds, cut the grass, but pulling out unwanted weeds was his favourite. Hed do it with his bare hands, not a sickle. It gave him more strength, Phirjinder says.The middle child out of three who showed remarkable stubbornness in de-weeding, had done a runner before though. Immediately after Subramaniams assessment, Palpreet was admitted to the academy. I was learning the game, but I missed home. In two months, I left and went home. But about six months later, I returned, explains the Northern Railways Ticket Collector.Circle kabaddi was the main sport in the village, but at 6-2, Palpreet was far too tall. Meanwhile a family friend had stumbled upon a newspaper advertisement announcing trials in Ludhiana  150 km away. Just over a year after the youngster re-joined the academy, he debuted for the India juniors at the U18 FIBA Asia Championship in 2012, recording an impressive 21 points per game a record for an Indian player at the event. After that, I could tell the coaches were keeping a special eye out for my development, Palpreet recalls. There was this one time he ran away again  at Kochi but to return well fed and hearty. He used to complain about the rotis. So I told him to get permission and go to a Gurudwara for langar. But Phirjinder knew Palpreet was ready for the big leap soon after. A few weeks after the program started, he told me he was avoiding fatty foods, and sugary items. This was new for us to see in him, the elder Brar adds.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
58fed5f97be9e0420db27ebf,Eyes on July after tardy rains onset,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160704/jsp/nation/story_94704.jsp,2016-07-04,"Nagpur, July 3: A slow-off-the-mark monsoon in a year billed for good rainfall by weather scientists has hobbled crop-sowing, leaving farmers hoping for adequate and uniform rainfall in July. Data released by the Union agriculture ministry on July 1 show that farmers are yet to start planting crops in full swing across large tracts, particularly central India. Officials are blaming the slow start on a delayed southwest monsoon and deficient June rainfall, with the added factor of a cash crunch among farmers after two to three years of drought. Delayed sowing leads not just to delayed arrival of fresh crops but also to lower yields. Crop scientists don't see a problem yet because, in many parts of the country, sowing picks up pace in July and even spills onto the first week of August. But any climatic aberration in July - either low rainfall or extreme weather events - could spell disaster for a vast majority of farmers in rain-dependent regions such as Marathwada, Vidarbha and Bundelkhand. The good news so far is that the India Meteorological Department's weekly forecast on Thursday suggests the southwest monsoon is gathering steam. Officials in Maharashtra blamed the delayed onset of the rains on a change in their pattern of arrival in the state. The southwest monsoon usually strikes Konkan first and then spreads to the state's eastern parts. This time, it entered Maharashtra from the eastern Vidarbha region and spread westward. Konkan and Mumbai witnessed heavy rain over the past week, but Vidarbha, Marathwada and western Maharashtra are yet to receive enough rain to start sowing. Seeds need a certain level of soil moisture for better germination and growth. Premature sowing is fraught with the risk of failure, necessitating re-sowing and thus pushing up the cost of production and labour. Besides, in many states, farmers are cash-strapped after successive years of drought. The banks have yet to restructure the outstanding loans and issue fresh credit for the current season. Maharashtra alone has more than 25 lakh such farmers. On July 1, going by the official data, sowing was way behind schedule in the case of crops such as cotton, pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals. If one considers only the major crops, India's farmers had finished sowing on 279 lakh hectares by this time last year. This season, the figure stands at 216 lakh hectares - a deficit of nearly 23 per cent. ( See chart) ""We have finished sowing but the rain has not been satisfactory,"" Sudam Pawar, a five-acre cotton grower in Wardha district, about 60km from Nagpur, said. ""We expect good rain this week,"" he added, drawing hope from the forecast for the region. The India Meteorological Department has predicted above-average rainfall in July and August, but farmers say it is crucial that the rain is uniform in spread and pattern. The past several years, including the so-called good-monsoon years, have seen extreme rainfall events in these parts. ""It's not just the amount of rain but the number of rainy days and its spatial spread that is important to us,"" said Pawar. India grows cotton on roughly 120 lakh hectares; a third of it in Maharashtra. Friday's ministry data showed that cotton-sowing had crossed barely 30 lakh hectares in the country - half the acreage compared with the corresponding period last year - mainly because of scanty or unsatisfactory rainfall in the cotton belt. Marathwada and Vidarbha, key cotton-growing regions, have faced droughts the past two to three years and, therefore, lower yields. Pulses, whose prices are sky-rocketing across the country owing to shortages caused by successive droughts, too have lagged last year's acreage - less than 20 lakh hectares sown against 22 lakh hectares last year. In the case of oilseeds, the figures are 28.7 lakh hectares this year compared with 54 lakh hectares by this time last year - lower by 47 per cent. Sowing is likely to speed up once the monsoon gathers steam in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, officials say. Coarse cereals like jowar, bajra and millets, grown mostly in the drier regions, have been planted across 37 lakh hectares, lower than the nearly 44 lakh hectares planted in the same period last year. The area under rice, the main kharifcrop, stands close to 48 lakh hectares, marginally higher than last year, thanks to good rainfall in Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The seasonal area under rice is 393 lakh hectares. Sugarcane too has a marginally higher acreage this year but officials attribute it to good rainfall in western Uttar Pradesh, where most of the crop is planted around this time. Sugarcane acreage in water-stressed regions like Marathwada and north Karnataka, they fear, would drop this year."

58fed7dd7be9e0420db281e8,Professor who inspired 'fat tax',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160721/jsp/nation/story_97930.jsp,2016-07-21,"Muhammed Kabir Thiruvananthapuram, July 20: As Kerala's finance minister Thomas Isaac made headlines by introducing ""fat tax"" on junk food, economist Muhammed Kabir was quietly rejoicing from the shadows, happy that his fight against unhealthy food had begun to bear fruit. It was on an email suggestion from the city-based, retired economics professor that Isaac had incorporated the 14.5 per cent levy in his budget. Kabir is happy Isaac acknowledged his contribution on Facebook but upset that he has taxed the health-friendly rice bran oil, which is ""counterproductive and against the spirit of a system of fat tax"". A pragmatist, Kabir admitted there was a world of difference between practice and preaching and that it would be difficult to stop people from eating unhealthy food unless it became prohibitively expensive. Kabir, who retired as head of the department of economics of Government Women's College, told The Telegraph he had taken up the question of fat tax with Isaac only two days before the budget. ""I'm very happy he understood its importance and implemented it, even though it was a last-minute suggestion."" Two days after the budget, on July 19, Isaac wrote on his Facebook page: ""It was Muhammed Kabir, a college teacher who studied in the Centre for Development Studies, who put forth this demand (to introduce fat tax) in an email."" Isaac was a faculty member at the Centre for Development Studies, a city-based social research institute, when Kabir was a student there. So what made the economist go after pizzas and burgers? ""Concern for public health,"" says Kabir, and attributes it to his PhD guide and economist, late T.N. Krishnan. ""Krishnan's area of interest was public health and it attracted me too. We did a joint paper in 1992 titled 'Social intermediation and health changes: Lessons from Kerala'. That's how I grew interested in public health,"" he said. Kabir was also part of a Dutch-funded study on Kerala's Health Status between 2004 and 2007. The study, conducted in Kannur, Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram, showed that ""lifestyle diseases were on the rise and constituted a major chunk of morbidity rates in Kerala"". ""During my PhD days, I came across literature about how Denmark imposed fat tax and withdrew it within a year,"" Kabir said, adding that Denmark's failure should not discourage Kerala. ""Denmark was unsuccessful because people started smuggling the taxed items from neighbouring Germany and Hungary. That scenario cannot be applied to Kerala,"" he opines. The retired professor conceded there was nothing to directly link obesity to calorie intake, but added it was well known that there was definitely a link between what people chose to eat and their health. He referred to a 2011 study on school students in Kochi. Done by Alice T. Cherian, Sarah S. Cherian and Sobhana Subbiah of the department of paediatrics of city-based Lakeshore hospital, the study on 1,634 students from three schools between the ages of 6 and 15 found that 3 per cent boys and 5.3 per cent girls were obese. About 10.2 per cent boys and 12.1 per cent girls were overweight. The study said instances of obesity and excess weight were found more among the high-income group and was lowest among children of the low-income group. ""The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Upper Income Group in this study is comparable to levels of overweight and obesity in developed countries,"" it said. The study attributed the trend to ""easy access to calorie-rich foods with growing economic prosperity coupled with lack of awareness in parents about childhood obesity and nutritive diets"". ""A UN report had placed India in the list of top 10 countries with obese people,"" Kabir said, explaining how agrarian Kerala, known for its healthy food habits that have deep links with ayurveda, had changed since the Gulf boom in the mid-nineties. ""There is something called demonstration effect. It refers to the idea that people expect or want to buy or have things because they see that other people are able to have them. It happened after the Crusades when Europeans felt an affinity for things eastern,"" said Kabir. ""Same happened to Malayalis who went to Persia, which was what Gulf was popularly referred to as. But what they brought back from places like Dubai was not just the money, but also the culture. ""After 1985, Kerala's economic growth picked up after long stagnation mainly due to the Gulf income. The prosperity also influenced food habits and people moved away from traditional cuisines. ""National Sample Survey Organisation data shows... a fall in the proportion of income spent on cereals and increase in the proportion spent on non-cereals, meat, egg and packed foods. What has happened to Kerala is that this change in consumption patterns has not been in a manner beneficial to people's health."" Wouldn't it be more appropriate to tax porotta and beef than junk food to which exposure is still limited? ""Porotta and red meat are dangerous to health and must be discouraged with more taxes. Hope that happens in the next stage,"" said Kabir. Asked a similar question, Isaac wrote on his FB page: ""It is not yet time to tax porotta and beef which is consumed by common people. Unlike in the West, it is the elite sections which eat the food items that have been brought under tax net. Let the debate go on. Then we can bring more and more unhealthy foods in the net."" On his objection to taxing rice bran oil, Kabir said it was one of the healthiest of edible oils as it had little saturated fat. ""Taxing it would be opposite to the concept of fat tax."" He added: ""Isaac explained at a seminar that it was only for the purpose of adjusting MRP and was not to disincentivise the health alternative."" The minister could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. Asked if he was hopeful that higher taxes would stop people from having junk food, Kabir breaks into a smile and refers to his two-year-old granddaughter. ""She was so thin that doctors advised that she be given meat and other fat-rich foods. ""Now she knows almost every chicken and shwarma outlet on the way from our home to the city. She is so fond of it and there's no point trying to dissuade her."" If family could not be dissuaded, how could the rest of the world be persuaded? Kabir is candid: ""A noted Malayalam poet once wrote a poem on ahimsa. A Gandhian liked it very much and called on the poet to express appreciation. ""But what he saw there shocked him. The poet was biting into a juicy chicken leg. The upset visitor asked him how come he was a non-vegetarian and writing on ahimsa. To this the poet replied that the poem was his philosophy and what the visitor witnessed was his life."" Kabir continued: ""What I mean to say is it will be difficult to deter people unless junk food becomes prohibitively expensive. Tax should be imposed in such a way that demand becomes elastic. That is to say the demand should fall with rising prices. Let's wait and see if the fat tax makes demand for food items elastic. If not, we must even think of increasing it."" He said his suggestion about fat tax was based on two grounds. ""One, the incidence of life-style diseases and, two, the level of obesity in Kerala. ""As per NFHS 2005-06, Kerala is next only to Punjab in terms of obesity. About 17.8 per cent men in Kerala (against 22.2 per cent in Punjab) and 28.1 per cent women (against 29.9 per cent in Punjab) have a BMI of more than 25. The relationship between obesity and life-style diseases, including coronary heart diseases, diabetes and strokes, is known."" It was not just consumption of fat-rich food but sedentary lifestyle that added to the danger, he said. ""A part of the tax so collected may be used to build gymnasiums and other health-improving infrastructure in the rural areas,"" he suggested."

(Source: Express Archive)Despite forecast of a good monsoon, around 50 per cent districts of Punjab, which account for the highest contribution of rice crop, around 30-35 per cent (one-third of the country) to the central pool, and neighbouring Haryana are still dry in the season of the water-guzzling paddy rice growing crop.Although the states had witnessed almost normal pre-monsoon showers, which was an indication of the good monsoon this year, now insufficient rain in several districts has put an extra burden on the underground water of the state, which is growing 29-30 lakh hectares of paddy rice this year.Till July 20, around 152.2 mm monsoon rain was received by the state against the normal 162.0 mm which is -6 per cent departure from the normal rainfall. However, the main concern is that around 50 per cent districts of Punjab are facing deficit of rain despite over all good rainfall.The information procured from the Met department revealed that of 23 districts, four recorded much above normal rainfall while over 10 districts, including Faridkot, Firozpur, Fathegarh Sahib, Mohali, Patiana, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana etc have been facing the problem of rain deficit even in full monsoon season. Firozpur is witnessing -70 per cent rainfall on monsoon the district had also witnessed -93 per cent pre-monsoon rainfall. Against the 110.4 mm normal rainfall which the district should get by now, it has received only 33.6 mm, a departure of -70 per cent from the normal.Mohali and Patiala also got -62 and -50 per cent rainfall respectively.

Against the normal 142.2 mm, the district received 257.1 mm during June 1 to July 20 period. Similarly in Amritsar district saw an increase of 56 per cent more rain was seen where 268.2 mm rainfall was recorded against the normal 172.3 mm.It may be noted that with the missing of first three weeks monsoon showers results in the heavy exploitation of groundwater during paddy season in state where 102 of 141 Agricultural development blocks have already gone dry and ground water is available at around 200 feet down.Though overall monsoon is almost normal in Punjab till date but we need it all over the state, not excessive in some pockets and deficit in other portions of state, said Punjab Agriculture department director, Dr J S Bains.We are not getting rain across the statein some districts there is heavy rain while others are dry, said Amarjit Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar.The situation in neighbouring Haryana, which also grows rice on around 12-13 lakh hectares, too is not good.

5b2e2c9f9855b7245313f2aa,25 Years of Change: Why India's Farm Sector Needs a New Deal,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/25-years-of-change-why-farms-in-india-need-a-new-deal/story-9LXMbxV7BIDX54f9JvQabP.html,2016-07-26,"In chasing higher and higher GDP growth rates, India tends to gloss over two vital facts. One, farm growth cuts poverty twice as fast as industrial growth. Two, a 1% rise in agricultural output raises industrial production by 0.5% and national income by 0.7%, according to one calculation. In other words, the countrys fortunes are structurally tied to its farmers.Two-thirds of Indians rely on a farm-based income. A back-to-back drought last year led to a challenging farm duress. Rural incomes fell. Food prices soared. Farmers fretted. Yet, these effects are mild and nothing compared to a previous era.During 1965-66, a similar consecutive drought had put India on a knifes edge. Food output dropped 36% in those two years, data shows. All through the 40s, 50s and 60s, famines were common. Millions died.Many predicted another killer famine. Economists Paul and William Paddock prophesied a Malthusian horror of population rising faster than food output, declaring countries like India foredoomed.India signed off on an agreement with the US called the Public Law 480 to qualify for food aid. It was not just humiliating. With a Cold War on, food assistance was a political hazard because aid came tied with conditionalities. A taste of this came when the US stopped desperate wheat shipments for 48 hours right in the middle of the drought.Read: Policy alone cant determine Indias future, politics will play native roleTo end this dependence, India began putting together a policy framework, led by then farm minister C Subramanium. A breakthrough came when the country got hold of a fertiliser-responding high-yielding spring wheat variety from CIMMYT, an international farm research organisation. A similar variety of Indica rice came from the Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute.Nearly 18,000 tonnes of their seeds were dispatched to food-bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and western UP. Along with minimum support prices, fertilizer subsidies and irrigation cover in these pockets, an incredible green revolution took off. Within years, the results showed. India became self-sufficient in food grains.But thats about all Indias agriculture has been able to achieve. While subsidies were critical, overdependence on subsidies over investment was to be a costly mistake.The Green Revolution was actually only a wheat revolution. The technology was limited, the areas to which it was applied were limited, the crops were limited and the farmers who benefited were limited, said Uma Kapila, an economic historian who taught at Delhis Miranda House college. We all know growth requires investment. Over a period of time, we focused on subsidies at the cost of investment.Policymakers basked in the glory of the Green Revolution for too long, without realising the technology had run its course. The first signs of the Green Revolution diminishing emerged in the mid-1980s, when yields began falling. Today, India exhibits the lowest yields globally. Overall, the lowest returns from public subsidies were in agriculture, whereas investment was low.Read: Using telescope and microscope for meaningful growthThe rate of investment in agriculture in the 80s and 90s was between 8-12%. These years roughly coincide with the 6th and 10th five-year plans. With such low spending in agriculture, except for input subsidies, farm growth hobbled at 2.4% or so.In contrast, public investments, along with reforms, in other sectors were over 35%. This low-investment phase in agriculture was reversed only with the 10th and 11th five year plans (2002-07 and 2007-12).Even today, irrigated lands make up only 40% of the countrys arable land, making 60% of the net sown area vulnerable to monsoon failure.Higher farm output, the solution for more incomes with less farmhands, hinges on area and yields.The government has already tapped the easy areas, the ones most fertile and better irrigated. Area expansion has its limitations. We can no longer expand the area. The only way to go is to raise yields, says Kapila.Farm investment has now reached 20% or so of the GDP, but most of it comes from the private sector. While experts recommend more private participation, they say public investment must also go up.The consequences of a fading Green Revolution and a skewed farm policy are now showing up in politics. The violent agitations by Jats in Haryana and Gujjars for a sliver of Indias reservation pie are instances.Traditionally pastoral communities such as the Jats and Gujjars in northern states and even Patidars in western India benefited greatly from the Green Revolutions farm subsidies. The Jats participated heavily in the 1857 War of Independence, resulting in the British co-opting them with a lot of quasi-ownership of land. They thus acquired the bhumidhar (land-owning) status. Over time, this led to their dominance.Falling returns from agriculture at a time of higher economic growth could lead to more unrest. A 2014 survey by Lokniti found that nearly 40% farmers were so disillusioned that they wanted to abandon farming. Where do they go? On to the streets?Full coverage: 25 years of change"

They have revolutionized the way agriculture was done in the dust bowls by flattening ravines and irrigating land with high-power pumps.""Every time, these migrant farmers switch on pumps, the water table dips by almost 40 feet, triggering water crisis in Sheopur. Villagers too have also taken cue and have begun sowing paddy,"" said S K Mohor, deputy director agriculture of Sheopur.Last year, 93,198 tonne of paddy was cultivated in Sheopur, with Sikh farmers accounting for more than 90% of the produce. The yield is taken to Kota mandi in neighbouring Rajasthan where they get a good price.A few hundred Sikh farmers migrated from Punjab two decades ago by selling ancestral land at a premium and began tilling land in the Chambal region, said Satnam Singh, while spraying fertilizers in fields with knee-deep water on outskirts of Sheopur. ""Soon, more farmers from north India followed to reap a harvest in what was once parched terrain, he said. ""I sold 18 bigha of land in Punjab and purchased 65 bighas here,"" he said with a smile. When he arrived in Sheopur, he along with other farmers had to smoothen ragged sand mounds on large swathes of the ravines to begin cultivation. Now, more than 200 hectares of land are being cultivated.""After filling fields with knee-deep water, we drain out water and again replenish it after a few days as temperatures rise and crops get damaged. We are now waiting for monsoon as our tube wells have begun drying up,"" he said. ""Wahe Guru will help us,"" he said looking at the sky.Deputy director agriculture S K Mohor said, ""For three years, the area under paddy cultivation is decreasing. From 19,600 hectares in 2014, it has dipped to 18,585 in 2015. This year, 16,000 hectares of land has been cultivated for paddy. We are growing the 1121 Sugandha basmati variety here,"" said Amanpal Singh, another farmer from Haryana. Former district collector Shivnarayan Rupla had recommended to the government to ban paddy cultivation in Sheopur because of water crisis.""We know ground water is depleting and you can imagine how much is wasted when they drain out and refill water with 16 HP water pumps,"" said Pannalal Solanki, district collector, Sheopur. ""There is no provision to ban crops. We can only advise them. Everybody is free to cultivate food grains and pulses of their choice,"" he said."

A two-hour journey on the NH54 that passes through lush green fields will take you there: a small town chock-a-block with people.Further down, a two-km ride on a bumpy road takes you to a nondescript Punjabi village: Kothe Ghurala. When you ask the locals about Shingara Singh, they give a quizzical look. It all changes once they hear his sons name. Avtar toh humaara puttar hai (Avtar is our son), they say, and give you the exact location.Just before you enter, the concrete road runs out and a kuccha sadak takes its place. Because of heavy rain, the narrow lane has become quite slippery. The surroundings remind you of a bygone era  endless fields with cows grazing and small huts. After walking for about five minutes, carefully navigating your way through puddles, you reach the house of Indias brightest hope in judo.Its a single-storey building without a coat of paint, and the first floor is yet to be completed. Avtar has promised to get it done if he wins a medal, Shingara said. There is a hall as soon as you enter. Adorning the wall are medals the 2016 South Asian Games champion has won. Asked when he realised his son had the potential to become a world beater, Shingara said, Avtar burst onto the scene by winning the junior nationals in 2010. In two months, he won gold at the Commonwealth Junior Championship in the 81kg category. Success at the this level prompted a senior call-up in 2011 via a direct entry into the national World Cup team headed for Mongolia.****It was the start of 2015. Desperate for funds but exasperated due to lack of support, Avtar Singh had all but given up. His dream of going to Rio was fading. The then 22-year-old returned to his village, a weary man. His father Shingara, a Class 4 employee in the health department at Naushehra Majha Singhan, the local government hospital, called a family meeting.Avtar needed to improve his rankings to stand any chance of representing the country at the Olympics. The Samsun Grand Prix in Turkey was beginning on March 27. The Judo Federation of India told him that his name had been sent but they couldnt fund the trip.After working for 21 years, Shingara had nearly `4 lakh in fixed deposits: his lifes savings. He decided to withdraw the entire amount the very next day and handed it over to Avtar. He hesitated. Le le puttar (take it son), his father said. After much coaxing from his mother Sukhvinder Kaur and younger brother Jagtar, he was heading to Turkey.****Training hard at the national camp in Delhi, the official release from the International Judo Federation (IJF) finally came through on May 31. He had done it. Avtar was going to Rio in the 90kg category. The first thought that crossed his mind was to call his father. He conveyed the good news. No sound from the other side. Thinking that he got disconnected, he was about to redial. Then, his father answered. Jug jug jiyo! Wahe guru, wahe guru(have a long and prosperous life. Praise the lord).Most judokas need 20-30 events to improve their rankings. Because of financial constraints, Avtar managed only six. From a lowly 200, the six-foot-four judoka reached 79th on the cut-off day, good enough to secure one of the two continental quotas on offer. A key reason for the rapid jump was his performances during the Asian Championships in April. Avtar lost in the semis but defeated Iranian Saeed Moradi in the repechage round.****Shingara had three brothers and three sisters. They had land and cattle to look after. Soon after Avtar was born, his father decided to take up work in the hospital. The name was given by his grandfather. Rishu, as he was affectionately called, was a naughty kid. He would never stop running and jumping. We would get tired of chasing him, Sukhvinder told Express. In an effort to tire him out, he was told to help his mother tend to the rice and wheat on his family farm, and look after their cattle. As he toiled under his mothers supervision, Rishu grew in strength and height.Not that he was a bad student. His grades were good and teachers at the Tagore Memorial Senior Secondary School had no complaints regarding Avtars attendance. The extra work he did helped him gain stamina. By 13, he was six feet. Thats when we decided to send him to the local judo training centre, Shingara revealed.Growing up in a joint family was fun as he got to play with cousins. But squabbles over property led to them moving out.****Humility is a hallmark of champions is an old adage. In the case of Avtar, it suits him to the T. His best attribute is his humility. Despite winning, his attitude towards family, friends never changed. He used to come back from the national camp and play with me. We used to practice judo together. I learn at the same institute as bhaiyya. Im proud of him, Avtars 15-year-old brother Jagtar said.After news reached the village of Avtars selection, everybody went to meet him at the bus stop. People took him on their shoulders and went across the village. Soon after that, he went out to play with neighbourhood kids. He is a shy boy. He loves playing with kids, his mother explained.The house bears a forlorn look on most days as Jagtar goes for training while Shingara goes to work. Most days, Sukhvinder is alone. I love it when Avtar comes home. He loves to eat and I love cooking for him. He prefers roti and any sabzi. Earlier, he used to eat spicy food and drank a lot of lassi. That has reduced. Sometimes I quietly hand him a glass, she added.****No story on Avtar is complete without the mention of the Shahid Bhagat Singh JFI training centre. Located in the Government Model Senior Secondary school, it has a big hall that currently houses 215. Judo belongs to Gurdaspur. The town boasts of close to 30 judo clubs, and its popularity saw JFI tie up with us in 2015. Every household has some history with judo, Avtars first coach Amarjit Shastri said. Gurdaspur has supplied the most number of judokas to the Punjab Services and Punjab Police over the years.Avtar joined the centre in 2005. I always knew he could do it. He never skipped training, irrespective of the weather or health. He was one dedicated kid. Its every coachs dream to produce an Olympian. With his selection, my services as a judo coach for the last 33 years have finally borne fruit.Avtar is not the only gem emerging from the rubble. We have three more world-class judokas. All national champions  Karanjit Singh Mann, Jasleen Singh Saini and Jobandeep Singh. You will hear about them when the next Games come around, Amarjit added.But the institute itself looks in dire need of assistance. It has an old gymnasium with most of the equipment in rusted state. Bathrooms are unclean and it has no doctors. We need a total makeover. Sports medicine has to be brought in if athletes have to reach the next level. We need new equipment. Those who have started winning can afford their own kit and help juniors, but the poor kids suffer. We have a Judo Welfare Society, wherein all judokas who have become officers in the police or armed forces, help maintain the institute, Amarjit revealed. Avtar is an Assistant Sub-Inspector with Punjab Police since 2011. With Avtar going to Rio, Amarjit is hopeful of the future. People have started knowing about the connection between Gurdaspur and judo. Hopefully, some corporate will pump in money.****Both Shingara and Sukhvinder have only seen Avtar on TV or read about him in newspapers. However, they have always yearned to watch their son live, battling on the mat, with a large crowd cheering him on. It was but a distant dream till now. In order to make sure that his parents can watch him during his first Olympic bout, Milaap.Org, Indias largest crowd-funding platform, joined hands with Mother Dairy and Green Bench to raise `8 lakh to fulfil their wish. We will leave for Rio soon, Sukhvinder said.Sports is an unpredictable business. With his family in tow, Indias brightest judo exponent will be battling the odds, hoping for a miracle on the grandest stage of them all."

(Express photo) At least 32 children were admitted to the Kapurthala civil hospital on Tuesday. (Express photo)A DAY after the death of two children at Sukhjit Ashram, a government-run home for mentally retarded children in Kapurthala, there was a flurry of activity. The District Social Welfare Officer (DSSO), who held additional charge of the Ashrams superintendent, was placed under suspension while attendant Veena Rani was chargesheeted for accepting and distributing the donated food to the children.Also, Kiranpreet Kaur, the superintendent from Amritsar home for mentally challenged, was transferred to Kapurthala Ashram, which did not have any permanent superintendent for the past over two years.Two teams from Chandigarh  one comprising the director, Punjab Social Welfare Department, Gurloveleen Singh Sidhu, and the other one having the chairman of Punjab State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Sukesh Kalia, and the commission secretary, Sumer Singh Gujjar  visited the Ashram on Wednesday.While Sidhu and Kapurthala Deputy Commissioner Jaskiran Singh interacted with the media, the other team met the DC to discuss the matter.All the 30 children were stillunder treatment at the local civil hospital. The DC said they would be taken to the newly built rooms of the ashram building where whitewash was started on Wednesday.Sources said that donated food was accepted at the Ashram for two days  Saturday and Sunday  in violation of written orders of the Kapurthala DC. However, no entry was made in the register about the persons who had donated the cooked food.Hospital sources said that the children died due to suspected food poisoning and their windpipes being choked because of vomiting.The cremation of both the children was held on Wednesday. However, the body of Jyoti, 15, was not accepted by her relatives when the ashram staff contacted them.Sidhu said that as per law, the cooked food from outside cannot be accepted but the norms were flouted by DSSO Gurbarag Lal. That is why he had been placed under suspension and attendant Veena Rani was chargesheeted because she accepted the food and then distributed it to the children.He said that a magisterial inquiry was going on and if anyone else was found guilty, they would be brought to book.Asserting that further action would be taken after the inquiry report, the DC said that only fruits and raw food items like pulses, rice and milk are accepted but not cooked one at the Ashram. Only a registered organisation with prior permission can distribute the food inside, that too after being first checked by the superintendent and the attendants.Kalia said the home was in a bad shape and he would make recommendations for better administration of the home. The commission has directed the district administration to get the home cleaned, the entire building painted and also directed the authorities to put up a noticeboard mentioning in bold letters that outside food is not allowed inside the Ashram.Staff shortageCurrently, there are six staff members at the Ashram  a teacher, two attendants, a cook, one sweeper and one chowkidar. DC Jaskiran Singh said they needed at least 11 staff members  a permanent superintendent, two cooks, two full-time attendants, three chowkidars and three sweepers. He said he had written to the social welfare department over six months ago in this regard but no action was taken.Sweeper Asha Rani said the Ashram has just one cook, Kulbir Kaur, and if she goes on leave, then attendant Veena Rani used to cook food for children.Unhygienic conditionsA visit to the Ashram revealed a sorry state of affairs. There is wild vegetation inside the boundary wall of the home. Even the parks meant for these children are surrounded by high grass all around, and the rooms where they put up are in pathetic condition and stinking badly. In one room, meant for two, around six-seven children are adjusted under a fan in this scorching heat.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We have demanded to hike it to `80 per quintal, he said.The millers who convened a meeting here to discuss issues concerning survival of rice milling industry demanded to frame policies properly and implement separate rice Out Turn Ratio (OTR) for each State as per their respective output instead of a uniform OTR of 68 per cent. Eastern India, especially Odisha and West Bengal, never produce rice above 63 per cent of the paddy supplied due to climatic condition. But millers in these two States are asked to provide 68 per cent rice, Saini said.General secretary Santosh Sonthalia said instead of storing entire procured paddy will millers, the State agencies should have their own storage arrangements from where the millers can lift paddy against 100 per cent security from time to time by rotating delivery. The millers warned to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in September if the Government fails to consider their demand. More than 400 millers from different parts of the State and office bearers of State associations from Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry attended."

(Credits: Jaipal Singh) Sewage water coming from Kansal village area flows towards Chandigarh on Tuesday. (Credits: Jaipal Singh)The sewage flowing from Kansal village is causing damage to flora and fauna of Sukhna Lake reserve forest and polluting the lake as well, reveals a report prepared by the UT forest and wildlife department.The Sukhna Lake reserve forest spread over an area of 153.90 hectare (Ha) starting from Punjab and Haryana High Court ends toward Kishangarh-Saketri road near Regulator End of Sukhna Lake.Sewerage water discharged from Kansal village passes through the lake forest area and some portion of the forest adjoining Rock Garden and Smriti Upvana remain submerged in water throughout the year. This has led to drying up of several valuable tree species in the forest area. The sewage water is also damaging habitat of sambar and other scheduled animal species found in the lake reserve forest. The reports points out that it has been noticed that a herd of sambars residing near Rock Garden are suffering from skin problems caused due to sewerage water.The sewerage water also enters the Sukhna Lake, which is a habitat for various resident and migratory birds, during monsoon season. It has led to growth of weeds in the lake. The sewerage water has also led to accumulation of harmful waste materials like plastic bags inside the forest area, posing a threat to regional flora and fauna.Pleas fall on Punjab govts deaf ears: In the past, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on a number of occasions directed the Punjab government to stop the flow of sewerage water to save Sukhna Lake. The Chandigarh Administration also wrote to the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and Principal Secretary, Local Self Government, Punjab, to stop the flow of sewerage water into the lake forest area, but no concrete steps have been taken so far.Karan Singh, range forest officer, said that they had taken up the matter with the Punjab government on several occasions, but in vain. The matter is also pending with the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi.Sewage water treatment: A survey of the area to find an alternative solution to the problem to save the flora and fauna from untreated waste sewerage water was carried out by the forest department.To stop sewage water from flowing into the Sukhna Lake, the forest department has started bio-treatment of the sewage water by way of oxidation. The sewage water of Kansal is being collected in a large-sized water body and is being treated through natural bio-mechanism wherein the sewage water is passed through long channel having plants like Saccharum munja and rice straw and iron ores which lead to oxidation of the sewer water.Santosh Kumar, chief conservator of forests, said that they had not only stopped sewage water flowing into the Sukhna Lake, but were also treating the water through natural bio-mechanism.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Booming exports of basmati also resulted in higher returns for the farmers of both states as rates of Pusa Basmati 1121 variety had touched Rs 4,500 per quintal.Manpreet stated that entire basmati industry in the northern states have large exporting units who had expressed their shock over the reported move to include certain area beyond the Indo-Gangetic plains which traditionally never cultivated the aromatic crop. ""Such a step will be detrimental to the aromatic traditional basmati which is the heritage of this region cultivated with the irrigation of five rivers. Basmati of our area will lose its premium tag over other regions,"" he said. In February this year, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) allowed the GI tag on the basmati grown in certain states. Farmers and exporters and Madhya Pradesh wanted to be included in the list of states approved by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the statutory body responsible for export promotion and development of certain scheduled products.IPAB chairman Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal had stated that basmati rice cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on the foothills of the Himalayas covering areas of the rice grown in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, western Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu and Kathua, would be issued the GI tag.According to APEDA, India exported 37 lakh tonnes of basmati rice overseas in 2014-15 valued at Rs 27,597.87 crore.

In a major relief, Madras high court on August 16, 2016 ordered no action should be taken against Madhya Pradesh for using name Basmati on its rice till November 19, 2016.Earlier in February this year Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) set aside the GI registry's order of December 2013 to include MP as basmati producing state. In December 2013, GI registry had instructed Agriculture and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority (APEDA) to include MP for GI tagging.But, APEDA moved an appeal against orders of GI Registry at the IPAB.

It also explains why so many Indians lose their lives to snakebite every year.The Spectacled cobra, Russell's viper and Common krait are found in the Tricity and its hinterland. These comprise three of the 'Big Four' medically important species of India, which account for the bulk of the estimated 46,000 human deaths annually (Snakebite Mortality in India: A Nationally Representative Mortality Survey, 2011). In a fascinating exposition of the menu card preferred by these three species and its organic link to human life, legendary herpetologist Rom Whitaker writes in his blogs ('IndianSnakes.org') : ""We provide them (cobras) with an abundance of food. The cobra's main prey, rats, love us and our farmlands, garbage dumps and dirty habits!""""Venomous snakes are present in high densities in agricultural areas - this seems to be true though no one has even done even a basic snake population or breeding biology study in India (or compared field populations of snakes to forest numbers). Certainly the Irula snake hunters who provided millions of cobra, rat snake and viper skins to the skin trade concentrated their hunting in agricultural areas, not in forests"" writes Whitaker.Whitaker has been in touch with Tricity and Punjab-based snake-rescue experts to further a national research project on regional variations in snake venoms and visited Chandigarh and Nawanshahr (Punjab) in August 2014 to milk and take away samples of the venoms of vipers, cobras and kraits.Snakes are opportunistic feeders and even eat each other (cannibalism) and other snake species. But in this exposition Whitaker lists the staple diet of venomous snakes. ""We know that cobras are common in rice fields (since we provide rice, water and bunds for Lesser bandicoots to tunnel and live in, cobras naturally move in) and that they do cause quite a high percentage of bites in some areas. Rice (and other grain crops) certainly seems to be a major reason for high rodent and, therefore, snake densities,"" says Whitaker.The krait is India's most venomous land species. ""It is also a rodent eater (besides the snakes and skinks it regularly feeds on), but specialises (so the Irulas tell us) in field mice (Mus booduga), just the right size for a thin snake like the krait. And sure enough, kraits like to live in field mice burrows, a nice tight fit. Kraits are not so fond of the paddy field bunds where cobras live, they prefer larger embankments and especially the old piles of well tailings that dot our countryside. These piles of rocks, soil and debris are quickly colonised by bushes and trees and are ideal habitats for mice and snakes,"" writes Whitaker.On the other hand, Russell's vipers like cactus, agave, pandanus and other thick, thorny, nasty cover. ""They are not regular burrow dwellers, though they will get into old termite mounds and larger rodent tunnels at the hottest time of year (I found one in a fox burrow). Interestingly, these rodent and bird eaters apparently have a special favourite (according to the Irulas and a small snake scat study we did some years ago), the Indian gerbil (Tatera indica). Gerbils live in association with rice fields and other crops, usually not in the bunds but they make their distinctive entrance/exit burrows on higher ground bordering the fields such as the banks of earthern dams. Three of the 'Big Four' thus appear to have strong associations with three different rodents and thus, rice and other crop fields,""said Whitaker.Providing a logical explanation for the high number of deaths, Whitaker concludes: ""The long and the short of it is, we create ideal snake habitats, provide them with abundant prey and produce millions more baby humans each year who will grow up to tromp around these snake habitats with no shoes, knowledge of avoidance and no lights at night. No wonder we have so many snakebites!"""

President of the association Simranjeet Singh claimed it was the first time the day was being celebrated in the country, and around 35 progressive beekeepers under different heads -- including trading in breeding, from different parts of the state -- were honoured, along with some senior and experienced beekeepers.He said the event was important as they tried to apprise the gathered farmers to promote and educate others about beekeeping, as diversification was the demand of the time. ""We all know the condition of farmers now is very bad in the state, and beekeeping is a good alternative, as farmers can earn more in it, than from cultivating rice and wheat,"" he added. Kuldeep Singh -- a progressive beekeeper from Sangrur, who was honoured during the event -- said beekeeping had given them tremendous results in the past, making them stand apart from other farmers, who were in dire straits due to traditional farming. Further, he said farmers were not being asked to replace their crops completely, but to take up beekeeping as a side business, which would help them become financially stable.Meanwhile, minister for agriculture Tota Singh -- who was honoured as the chief guest on the occasion -- said the state government had decided not to charge Value Added Tax (VAT) on material used in bee farming. Tota Singh said a minimum sale price (MSP) had also been fixed for purchase of honey from farmers. State director of horticulture Gurkamal Singh said 15,000 metric tonnes of honey was produced in the state in a year, which is 20 per cent of the total honey produced in India, while the total export of honey from Punjab is 13,000 metric tonnes, which is 39 per cent of the total honey exports from the country."

(Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) Basmati farmer Krishnakumar Tomar at his field in Badi, Raisen district. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)When Krishnakumar Tomar, one of the first to grow basmati in this fertile belt, harvested his crop 14 years back, he had no idea where to sell it. With no local takers for the aromatic paddy, the 40-year-old from Badi, which falls in Raisen district, was told he could get a good price for it at Delhis Narela mandi or Kota in Rajasthan, both many hundred kilometers away.I wondered whether it was worth the trouble going all the way there, recalls Tomar. The long road journey to Narela may only have further sowed seeds of doubt over his decision to switch from growing regular high-yielding paddy.But today, basmati is my main crop, declares this science graduate, who grows Pusa Basmati-1 (PB-1), a variety bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, on his entire 35-acres farmland. He devotes more resources and attention to it than even wheat, which is cultivated during the rabi winter season and sold to government agencies at the official minimum support price (MSP).Tomar used to previously cultivate paddy varieties such as Mahamaya and Kranti, which gave yields of up to 30 quintals per acre. PB-1 yields are lower at 18-22 per acre. The difference, however, is in prices.Ten years ago, ordinary paddy sold at Rs 600 per quintal. Even today, the governments MSP is only Rs 1,470. In basmati, prices rose as high as Rs 3,900 per quintal in 2013. They have fallen since to Rs 2,000, but are still more than that of non-basmati, he points out.Tomar is among the many farmers in this area  having assured irrigation, thanks to the Barna Dam completed in the late 1970s  who have stopped planting regular paddy or soyabean in the kharif season. They have prospered by switching to a crop that is now a bone of contention between Madhya Pradesh (MP) and the northern states led by Punjab and Haryana.All the three are, incidentally, ruled by the BJP either by itself or in alliance.At the heart of the dispute is MP staking claim for inclusion of 13 of its districts  from Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri and Guna in the north to Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur in the central-south  in the Geographical Indication (GI) area officially demarcated for basmati cultivation.As of now, only seven states in the Indo-Gangetic plains on the foothills of the Himalayas  Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu & Kashmir  have been granted GI certification rights for growing basmati.The states that have been issued the GI tag  mainly millers and farmers in Punjab and Haryana  are vociferously opposed to extending the same to MP. Their contention is that the state neither has a history nor the specific agro-climatic conditions suitable for basmati cultivation.But for farmers here, basmati is what has brought them prosperity that was non-existent till a decade ago. Tomar may have, then, struggled to dispose of his crop. But that changed with the entry of millers, who sensed an opportunity to procure basmati from MP at rates lower than what it cost in the traditional northern belt.LT Foods Limited was the first mover. The company, which sells basmati rice under the well-known Daawat brand, went on to establish a state-of-the-art plant in 2006 at Mandideep, about 20 km from Bhopal. In no time, many others also moved in. They included S.S.A International and Narmada Cereals Pvt. Ltd, which have also set up milling facilities at Mandideep, technically in Raisen district.There is no dearth of buyers for basmati, unlike wheat, where we are entirely dependent on the government. Nor do we have to go to any procurement centre to sell, as the company agents come to us directly to purchase from our doorstep. And the basmati crop does not fail from less or more rains, which is not so with soyabean, notes Sunil Sharma.This 40-acre farmer, also from Badi, took to basmati after seeing Punjabi Jat Sikh farmers settled in the region growing it.The Class XI-pass Sharma owns a Mahindra Bolero SUV, while his friend and fellow-farmer Mukesh Chouhan drives a Scorpio.Many people in these parts have purchased four-wheelers and even property 100 km away in Bhopal. It is all only due to basmati. Yes, prices had shot up to Rs 4,000/quintal three years ago and are now half of that. But things are still better than 10 years ago, when we did not even have our own tractors, he points out.These farmers are equally clear that they cannot be denied the right to cultivate basmati, in the name of GI protection. We did not oppose their getting the GI, why should they oppose ours, then? Punjab is, no doubt, the leader in agriculture, but we are trying to catch up. Whats wrong in that? retorts Sharma.The primary argument of the northern millers and farmers  supported by the scientific community and bodies like APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority)  is that MP never had any tradition of basmati cultivation, a prerequisite for grant of GI. They started growing basmati only from the start of this century. All this pressure to include MP is for just helping one company, said a Delhi-based miller, while alluding to LT Foods.The company, however, denies the charge of the MP government fighting a proxy war on its behalf. We buy less than 15 per cent of the states total basmati paddy production. The rest is bought by many others, including millers and traders in North India, says Rajinder Wadhawan, Director (Operations) at LT Foods.MPs farmers are the ones who would be affected the most, in the event of the state government losing the GI battle, he adds.According to Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary (Agriculture) in the MP government, the state has submitted evidence, including documents and publications dating back to the British era, to prove that basmati was being cultivated in the relevant districts long enough to warrant a GI tag.That evidence was, however, not accepted by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, which, in an order on February 5, directed the MP government to file additional evidence. The latter has since challenged the order and the matter is currently before the Madras High Court.All this wrangling comes even as basmati exports from India have shown a decline in the last couple of years, after posting a more than ten-fold jump to over Rs 29,000 crore between 2006-07 and 2013-14.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Farmer Pavitar Pal Singh at his basmati field near Ludhiana. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Kulwinder Singhs family in Kohali, a village in Amritsar districts Chogawan block barely 20 km from the India-Pakistan border, has been growing basmati paddy right from the time of Partition. Kohali, like all other villages in Punjab, falls under the Geographical Indication (GI) area, where paddy bearing the appellation basmati can be exclusively cultivated as of now.It is our heritage. How can we allow any adulteration or dilution in that? is Singhs instant reply, when asked about adding Madhya Pradesh (MP) to the list of states eligible to be issued the GI tag for basmati cultivation.Singh grows basmati on his entire 60-acre holding. That includes 55 acres under Pusa-1121 and the balance 5 acres under Basmati-386, a traditional tall cultivar yielding only 8-10 quintals per acre, as against 18-20 quintals for the former improved variety bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi.Kohali village itself has over 10,000 acres of farmland, much of it planted to basmati during the kharif season. We do the transplanting between mid-June and mid-July and the crop is harvested from mid-October to mid-November, just before the onset of winter. The cool weather at this time, specific to the agro-climatic conditions of our area, is what contributes to basmatis unique aroma. It is a Gods Gift that nobody can take away from us, avers Singh.For farmers like him, the primary concern is basmati losing its premium tag that could lead to a beating down of prices. Last year, Singh was able to realise only Rs 2,000-2,200 per quintal for Pusa-1121 and Rs 2,500-2,600 for the Basmati-386 paddy that he sold, compared to their respective rates of Rs 3,600-4,000 and up to Rs 5,000/quintal fetched during 2013-14.Lower prices have also been a reason for the basmati area in Punjab registering a decline to 4.94 lakh hectares (lh) this time, from 7.63 lh in 2015. This has happened despite overall sowing of paddy  which includes non-basmati parmal varieties, mostly procured by state agencies  rising from 29.75 lh to 30.10 lh.Punjabs basmati-growing belt is concentrated in about two-dozen agricultural blocks  each covering 40-80 villages  of Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Pathankot. These four districts along the Indo-Pak border produce over half of the states basmati, with Hoshiarpur, which lies in the foothills of the Shivalik range, being the other major grower. Punjab is estimated to account for roughly 50 per cent of Indias annual basmati rice exports of four million tonnes.Farmers in the main basmati belt of Punjab have not significantly reduced basmati acreage, in spite of falling realisations. Amritsar district, for instance, has a total agricultural area of 1.80 lh, of which 1.35 lh was planted to basmati in 2015. That figure has only marginally come down to 1.15 lh this year.We dont know about any crop other than basmati, states Manwinder Singh, an MSc in horticulture, who grows only Pusa-1121 on his 15 acres land in Lopoke. This village, in the same Chogawan block of Amritsar and just 8 km from the border, has over 80 per cent area dedicated to basmati. It used to be 100 per cent two years ago. But this time, some farmers have planted parmal in some portions because of lower price risk and assured government procurement for such paddy, he adds.Pavitar Pal Singh Pangli, president of the Borlaug Farmers Association for South Asia, claims that undivided Punjab  which, apart from the province in todays Pakistan, also covered Haryana and Himachal Pradesh  was from where basmati originated.It is unfortunate that Punjabs monopoly over basmati  having to do with grain aroma and size traits linked to the soil and climatic characteristics specific to the foothills of the Himalayas in the Indo-Gangetic plains  is being challenged within our own country. If MP is going to get the GI tag, the time will not be far off for Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to also be issued the same, says this farmer, who grows basmati in 10 out of his 45-acre holding in Panglian village of Ludhiana district/block.Pangli warns that the ultimate beneficiary from all this would be Pakistan: The fact that the quality of grain from MP or the southern states is not of the best quality may cause reputational damage to our product in the international market. Pakistan will, then, lay claim to being the sole producer of authentic basmati.His views are also shared by scientists and basmati miller-exporters in Punjab. It is in the national interest to protect our monopoly over basmati, by ensuring that rice grown outside a clearly delineated GI area is not sold as basmati. Once the GI tag is given to more regions, you are basically opening the flood-gates, which will effectively end that monopoly, notes GS Mangat, senior rice breeder at the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.The loser here will, of course, be the Punjab farmer. A repeat of last years low prices, even with shrinkage in planted area this time, will be a real disaster, points out MS Sidhu, a senior agro-economist at PAU.According to Sumit Mahant of Mahant Overseas, an Amritsar-based exporter, Punjab and Haryana have huge stakes in both cultivation as well as processing of basmati. To extend GI tag to areas that traditionally never grew basmati would spell doom for Indias basmati exports, as we will simply lose consumers in discerning markets such as Europe, England, US or Canada. And what will happen to all the investments the industry has made here? he asks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive.The spread of basmati cultivation, beyond its traditional confines of undivided pre-Partition Punjab, Jammu, West Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, can be put down to a single phenomenon: Advances in crop breeding.The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive. They needed a short day length for flowering; the plants would simply not produce flowers until the sunshine hours fell to 12 or less.That condition was available from end-September  when the kharif paddy crop should normally commence flowering  only in the north/northwest parts of the subcontinent on either side of the Indus River. In central and southern India, the day length was 14 hours or more through October. These areas couldnt, therefore, grow or at least had no recorded history of farming basmati in contiguous stretches.This changed, though, with the release of improved basmati varieties from the late 1980s. These strains  especially Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509, bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  were not just high-yielding, but also relatively less sensitive to photoperiod or day length variations, giving more planting time flexibility. Since they could flower even when sunshine hours were long, farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh could now grow them.But as AK Singh, head of the Division of Genetics at IARI, points out, the grains from the basmati paddy cultivated in the non-traditional belts have quality issues. Basmati rices most distinctive trait  apart from long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking, and fluffiness  lies in its aroma, which, in turn, derives from a compound called 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline. The accumulation of this highly volatile compound in the grain, contributing to basmatis characteristic fragrance, is largely a function of environmental conditions.The retention of aroma, courtesy 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline, is best when the flowering and grain-filling phase coincides with a cool climate, with temperatures below 30 degree Celsius during daytime and just over 20 degrees at night. These conditions are, again, obtained during October only in the traditional basmati belt.Moreover, it isnt aroma alone. Higher temperatures during the roughly one-month period from flowering to maturity can also affect the texture and milling quality of the grain. When temperatures are high at the time of grain-filling, the packing of the starch granules in the rice tends to be loose. So, you get grains with more chalkiness (opaque areas caused by incomplete filling) and resulting in higher percentage of broken rice during milling, explains Singh.What all this means is that Pusa-1121 basmati can well be grown in MP or Maharashtra. But the aroma, appearance and milling quality of the grain produced from there cannot really match what one would get from the basmati grown in Amritsar, Karnal, Kathua, Kangra or Dehradun. The cooler climate during the critical crop maturity and grain-filling period in those parts cannot possibly be replicated elsewhere. And theres little even plant breeding science can do about it.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The migratory birds that can be found at the Sukhna Lake include Ruddy Shelducks, White-Eyed Pochards, Common Pochards, Ferruginous Pochards, Tufted Ducks, Greylag Goose, Black Redstart amongst many other.FOR A large number of Chandigarh residents, the morning is incomplete without a walk in the serene environs of Sukhna Lake. The lake is an inseparable part of life in the City Beautiful. A steady stream of visitors continues to pour in during the day to spend time at the man-made water body at the foothills of the Shivaliks. It is one of Chandigarhs principal tourist attractions and its defining feature. Winter brings its own visitors to the lake  a large number of migratory birds flock to the water body, making it their home for a few months before flying away again.But all this could soon be history. The rainfed lake is facing a crisis. The water level has been declining due to heavy silting. Deficient monsoons have added to the problem. Sewage flows into it from nearby villages. Weeds choke the lake at one corner.The problem is not new. Seven years ago, the problem was serious enough for the Punjab and Haryana High Court to take suo motu notice of it in November 2009. There have been over 50 hearings in the case by different benches of the High Court. Over the years, the urgency to do something has grown as both climate change and the rapid growth of Chandigarh, with settlements now touching the lakes borders, have added to Sukhnas problems.On the last date of hearing on August 22, the High Court ordered the Chandigarh Administration to make the lake weed removal a continuous process. It also asked the administration to issue a public notice seeking suggestions from Tricity residents for saving Sukhna.The Punjab government was asked to inform the court if the lake could be connected with water supply pipes or by boring of wells to maintain water level.CREATED IN 1958 by Le Corbusier and then chief engineer P L Verma at a cost of Rs 1 crore, the lake was constructed across Sukhna Choe by damming it along with Kansal and Nepali Choe. The dam was a 12.8 metre high rock-filled earthen structure. Such was Corbusiers attachment to the lake that the ashes of the first Chief Architect of Chandigarh and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret were immersed here in 1970 as per their wishes.But ever since its creation, silting has plagued the lake. From the erosion-prone Shivalik hills, the water that flowed into the Sukhna Choe arrived with silt and sediments.At the time of construction, the storage capacity of the lake was 10.47 million cubic metre (mcm) and water spread area varying between 1.52 sq km and 2.28 sq km. Between 1958 and 1962, the lake lost more than 20 per cent of its capacity on account of heavy silting.In 1971, the Irrigation Department of the Punjab government took up the issue. The Kansal Choe was diverted into Suketri Choe which joined the lake at its eastern end.But this very measure to increase the water in the lake contributed to more silting, with more of it flowing in down the steep slopes of the new channel.The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, conducted a detailed survey of catchment area in 1972 and stated that soil erosion, steep sloping hills and steep bare hills were the main reasons for siltation.Following this, the Chandigarh Administration launched intensive water and soil conservation measures in 2,540 hectare forest catchment of the lake which included effective closure, plantation, and the construction of more than 190 silt-detention earthen dams.By the year 1988 around 2,600 hectares of Sukhna Lake were converted into Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and another 880 hectares classified as Reserve Forest. The lake has a catchment area of 42.7 square kilometre of which 29.8 square kilometre falls in Chandigarh while the remaining 10.22 square kilometre and 2.77 square kilometre falls in jurisdiction of Haryana and Punjab, respectively.During the 6th Plan (1977-1978 to 1982-1983), the UT Forest Department implemented the Central government- sponsored scheme of soil conservation at a cost of Rs 73.41 lakh.These measures taken over a period of almost three decades reduced the siltation rate of the lake from more than 140 tonnes per year to 5 tonnes per year.Heavy siltation has also led to a fall in the number of fish in the lake. As per a study carried out by Prof M S Johal and Dr Y K Rawal in 2005, there were a total of 33 different species in the lake. However, due to the lake drying up in 2012, the number of species fell drastically. As per current data available with Dr Y K Rawal, there are only 19 species of fish left in the lake.In 1987, the lake bed almost dried up due to a deficient monsoon combined with silting. The administration then started de-silting of the lake bed through mechanised and manual means. City residents flocked to participate in Shramdan to save the citys landmark. This became an annual ritual till it was stopped in 2004.By 2002 the lake had lost almost 63 per cent of its original water-holding capacity. The water flow too decreased. By 2002 the lake had lost almost 63 per cent of its original water-holding capacity. The water flow too decreased.By 2002 the lake had lost almost 63 per cent of its original water-holding capacity. The water flow too decreased. In 2002, an average flow of 225 acre-feet water was entering the lake compared to an average flow of 7,370 acre-ft water from 1958 to 1978.Santosh Kumar, chief conservator of forests, said that with sustained measures made over the years, the administration has managed to bring down the rate of siltation. We have taken all the possible steps for saving the lake from silt and weeds. The rate of siltation was brought down with sustained measures which included extensive plantation in the catchment area. As far as water is concerned, it totally depends upon rain, said Kumar.THE CITY has been witnessing below normal rainfall for the last six years. This year, Chandigarh received about 42 per cent less than normal rain  only 286.2mm rain against the normal rainfall of 686.6mm. In 2015, 572.8mm rainfall was received which was 30.9 per cent less while in 2014, 389.2mm rain was recorded that was 53.1 per cent deficit.Low rainfall in the city plays havoc with the lake bed. Islands of silt emerge regularly, showing up the precariously low water levels. A study by the Society for Promotion and Conservation of Environment (SPACE) in 2009 on Impacts of Conservation Measures in the Catchment of Sukhna Lake on Ground Water, Soil and Geology pointed out that the Sukhna Lake catchment area was practically floating in water.As per the report, around 48 water bodies in the wildlife sanctuary linked to the silt retention dams are filled with water throughout the year. The report further states that in case of normal rainfall, around 60 hectare metre (hams) water could be released into the Sukhna Lake from these water bodies. During years of low rainfall, the quantity would be around 40 hams.There is also a large low-lying area that receives spills, leakages, seepage from the water bodies located on higher elevations in drainage lines. However, due to an impervious layer, this water is not able to flow into the Sukhna.A mechanism to release the water into the lake needs to be found. The wildlife sanctuary has enough water to save the lake from drying up.Dr S S Grewal president, Society for Promotion and Conservation of Environment. A mechanism to release the water into the lake needs to be found. The wildlife sanctuary has enough water to save the lake from drying up.Dr S S Grewal president, Society for Promotion and Conservation of Environment.President of SPACE Dr S S Grewal said that a mechanism to release the water into the lake needs to be found. The wildlife sanctuary has enough water to save the lake from drying up, he said.The SPACE team also visited more than 150 silt retention dams, measuring the water available in each, concluding that even as they caught silt, they also prevented enough water from flowing into the lake. The study says that when the lake becomes alarmingly shallow, the water stored in dams can be drained to augment the capacity of the lake.FORMER CHIEF engineer of the Punjab Irrigation Department Dr G S Dhillon says that there is a need for a permanent solution to the problem. Due to the construction of the silt retention dams, there is a reduction in the amount of water that enters the lake. At places like Sukhomajri and Kansal, people have put up obstructions and do not let the water flow to the lake. The right over water is not notified. There is a need for the Centre to intervene and issue a notification that the water should be used only for Sukhna Lake and not be used by people on the way, said Dr Dhillon.He added that there was no water management. There should be an engineer who is given this task. Shallow tubewells should be allowed in the catchment area and a channel be constructed to take the water to the lake. Dr Dhillon added that there was a need for rainwater harvesting in the northern sectors and the water could be diverted to the lake.Just depending on rains is not good enough. The dams at the wildlife sanctuary have reduced intake into the lake. Excess water from there can be drawn into the lake,  said S S Virdi Former UT chief engineer Just depending on rains is not good enough.

The forum recommended forming an independent body, Sukhna Lake Development Authority.Just depending on rains is not good enough. The dams at the wildlife sanctuary have reduced intake into the lake. Excess water from there can be drawn into the lake. There is enough sub-soil water available. Tubewells can be installed to pump water. Tertiary water can be pumped in, said Virdi.ANOTHER PROBLEM encountered at the lake is that of weeding. There are eight types of weeds that are spread over more than half of the lake. Typha, Hydrocharitaceae and Ceratophyllaceae are the most common type of weeds found in different seasons.According to assistant professor Dr Y K Rawal, from the Department of Zoology, Panjab University, who along with Professor Emeritus Prof M S Johal, conducted a study on the lake said that presence of a large number of weeds in the lake is one of the reasons for depleting water level.On Dr Rawals recommendation, the administration has put a species of fish called Ctenopharyngodon Idella commonly known as Grass Crap for weed control. Ctenopharyngodon Idella consumes a large quantity of weeds. Dr Rawal said that other measures include manual removal of weeds, which is a continuous process.Experts are of the view that rapid siltation and inflow of sewage into the lake from nearby areas are the main reasons for weeds. As per a report prepared by the UT Forest and Wildlife Department, the sewage flowing from Kansal and Saketri village is causing damage to flora and fauna of Sukhna Lake reserve forest and polluting the lake as well.To stop sewage water from flowing into the Sukhna Lake, the forest department has started bio-treatment of the sewage water by way of oxidation. The sewage water of Kansal is being collected in a large-sized water body and is being treated through natural bio-mechanism in which the sewage water is passed through long channel having plants like Saccharum munja and rice straw and iron ores which lead to oxidation of the sewer water.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Panchkula administration for taking steps to ensure that sewage from Saketri does not enter the lake.The problem of weeding and siltation was also highlighted in a study by the National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, conducted in 2013. The experts suggested that the primary objective of desilting should not be to increase the capacity or surface area of the lake. This could cause evaporation which is already high for the lake. The average decline in water level during October 1, 2011, to June 28, 2012, is 5.99 mm/day. Approximately 300 ham of water is lost due to evaporation.Mukesh Anand, UT chief engineer, told Chandigarh Newsline that the engineering wing removes weeds manually throughout the year. Steps have been take to ensure that sewage from Kishangarh and Kansal does not enter the lake, said Anand.DUE TO the intervention of the court, the Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana authorities were in 2012 pressed into action to deploy their labourers and JCB (excavation machine vehicles) so that Kansal nadi (rivulet) was cleaned to ensure natural flow of water into the lake. The court had also ordered the authorities to make every effort to ensure unhindered flow of surface run-off towards the lake guided by natural gradient from Punjab area.The High Court had on May 14, 2012, also put stay on the construction activities in the catchment areas of Sukhna Lake which is still in operation but the construction activities in the catchment area are continuing unabated under the nose of the authorities, especially at Kansal village falling in Mohali district.The court had also asked the Chandigarh Administration to consider the option of pumping in surplus water from UT into Sukhna between December 15 and January 15 when the demand is lower than in the summer. Also, the court had suggested that instead of wasting the storm water, it should also be channelised to flow into the lake. If these ideas have been considered at all, there is no evidence to suggest that the administration acted on them.GURDEEP SINGH Dhillon (70), who retired from the Punjab State Warehousing Corporation, said he had been regularly going for morning walks for the past 20 years. If I do not visit the lake every morning, something seems to be amiss. The residents of have an emotional connect with the lake. When the lake filled up with silt, hordes of people participated in Shramdan to manually remove it every year till the drive was discontinued by the administration, said Dhillon.Manjot Singh, who has been regularly going for morning walk to the lake for the past 15 years, said that he like a large number of residents have developed a emotional connect with the lake. Lake has become an integral part of our lives. It is imperative to save the lake, no matter what it takes. The residents should come forward to help the administration in saving the lake, said Manjot Singh.(with inputs from Sanjeev Verma)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

India had demanded market access for products including non-basmati rice, pharmaceuticals and several fruits & vegetables among others.Indias goods trade deficit with China has surged from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16. Beijing has been denying market access to India's non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its concerns included the likelihood of a pest called Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.China was the worlds largest rice importer in 2015-16 followed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq.Mill inspectionOfficial sources said after several requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials have finally agreed to visit India during September 19-28 to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are situated in states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.To export to countries including China, it is mandatory for Indian rice exporters to be registered with the NPPO  the Indian government body in charge for inspecting these mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO will assist its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection from September 19-28 for pest risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian commerce ministry is also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.The inspection is a very significant stage in the process, A. K. Gupta, Director (Basmati Export Development Foundation, foreign trade, World Trade Organisation-related matters & agri-export zones), APEDA, said. He expressed hope that following the inspection, China will soon issue a formal notification regarding permission for non-basmati rice exports from India.The Chinese authorities had carried out a similar inspection in 2009, following which in 2011-12, they gave their nod to basmati exports from India to China, Mr. Gupta added.Pointing out that the 19 mills are involved in processing non-basmati and basmati rice, he said, therefore, the inspection will cover both varieties.Rajen Sundaresan, Executive Director, All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA), said he was also hopeful that the Chinese authorities will shortly give green signal for non-basmati rice exports from India to China. He said a recent joint survey done by AIREA and the leading agro-chemical (including pesticides) firm UPL found that the allegations regarding the presence of Khapra beetle in processed Indian rice were wrong and vastly exaggerated.Pakistani importsPointing out that China imports non-basmati rice from Pakistan, Mr. Sundaresan said Beijings objection to Indian non-basmati export seems more political in nature than anything else.Trade sources said there are reports of rice (basmati & non-basmati) exports from India to China happening through Hong Kong and Thailand. In 2015-16, India exported 6.2 million tonnes of non-basmati rice worth Rs.15,000 crore, he said."

The market, which happens to be the hub of jewllery shops in Ludhiana and home to the 350-strong local Marathi community, is going to be the epicenter of celebrations during the 10-day festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.Though the festival that marks the mythological birthday of Lord Ganesha is celebrated across India, Marathis celebrate it with the most fervour. In Sarafan Bazaar, a clay-made idol of Lord Ganesha was brought to the pandal (stage) that has been set up for the festival on Monday amid beating of drums and joyous chants of 'Ganpati Bappa Morya'.Keeping the Marathi tradition alive, the 'Jai Maharashtra Ganesha Utsav Mandal', Sarafan Bazaar, is organizing the festivities at the market this year. ""Such is the extent of celebration at home that in Mumbai alone at least 6,000 idols of Ganesha are commissioned in Mumbai every year. People even celebrate the festival at their homes in Mumbai. As far as we are concerned, we are just trying our best to stay true to the way the festival is celebrated back in Maharashtra,"" said Shiva Shindey, the president of Jai Maharashtra Ganesh Utsav Mandal.The festivities will culminate with the immersion of the life-size Lord Ganesha idol in the Satluj river on September 16. During the next ten days, said Shindey, they would worshipping the idol. A member of the organizing committee, Popat Lal Jadav, said the idol of Ganesha would be kept on a pedestal on the stage and a priest would be chanting prayers at the same time. ""Modak, a Marathi sweet made of sweetened coconut and rice flour, is offered to the deity along with incense and flowers,"" he said.In Ludhiana, many people offer burfi to the idol. However, according to Jadav, it is a ""strange"" practice. 'For rest of the days, the idol is worshipped with Ganesh Stuti and devotional songs in the evening and morning. We have installed idols of Lord Ganesha in our houses as well,"" he said.It is believed that the Ganesha returns to his heavenly abode on the 10thd ay of the festival.

With the monsoon entering the withdrawal stage in north west India , the situation is unlikely to improve in the next fortnight, putting these states at the risk of having the third straight deficient monsoon rainfall year.Punjab and Haryana had deficient monsoon rainfall (June-1-September 30 period) in 2014 and 2015 too. In 2014, Punjab received 243.9 mm of rainfall (50% below normal) as against the normal of 491.9mm and Haryana had an even greater deficit of 56%, with the state receiving 200.1 mm rain as against the normal of 460.3 mm.Similarly, in 2015, the monsoon rainfall recorded in Punjab was 336.3 mm, which is 32% below the normal of 491.9 mm, while Haryana got 287.7 mm (a deficit of 38%) as against the normal of 460.3 mm.As per the data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Punjab has recorded 345.8 mm of rainfall from June 1 till September 16, this year as against the normal of 456.9 mm with an overall deficit of 24% while in Haryana the total rainfall in the corresponding period has been 330.1 mm (24% deficiency) as against the normal of 436.3 mm.This season, many key paddy growing districts of both states have recorded deficient or scanty rainfall, adding to the burden of farmers who have to rely more on fast depleting groundwater to maintain their crops. In Haryana, 12 out of 21 districts have recorded deficient or scanty (more than 60% below normal) rainfall till Friday. On the other hand, 10 districts of 20 in Punjab have received deficient or scanty rainfall.Weak monsoons in the last two years had resulted in putting more strain on the groundwater in both Punjab and Haryana, which are known as grain bowl states of India. With less availability of canal water, farmers in both states rely on tubewells to irrigate their crops, hoping for the normal rainfall to eventually recharge the groundwater. To make the matters worse, area under paddy, including basmati, has gone up in Punjab this year as farmers in the state's cotton belt, which is primarily irrigated by canals, switched to water-guzzling rice cultivation due to fear of whitefly attack. Estimated area under paddy in Punjab this year is 30.14 lakh hectares up from 29.75 lakh hectares in 2015. Cotton acreage dropped to a 61-year low of 2.56 lakh hectares from 4.5 lakh hectares last year."

Last year, despite the shortfall in rains the State had a record paddy output at 176 lakh tonnes..but this year its going to be even better, Jasbir Singh Bains, Director, PAD, told The Hindu.This year farmers have grown paddy in more area than last year. Besides the weather conditions have been favourable till now. This is likely to boost the crop yield this season, he said.Farmers in Punjab have sown paddy in nearly 30.10 lakh hectares against the 29.75 lakh hectares last year. The State has paddy yield close to 6,000 kg per hectare, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.Polls in sightWith the Assembly elections nearing, the State government is also gearing up to start purchase of paddy from local farmers. It had recently announced that government procurement would begin by October 1.Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal in a recent review meeting directed the officials to ensure that the lifting of paddy gets going on the first day itself.I would closely monitor the whole process personally. Daily reports regarding the progress in procurement and status update on the lifting should be sent to my office, he said in a statement."

Even as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu limped back to normalcy following friction over sharing river water, meteorological reports indicate that southwest monsoon this year may be below normal. This comes on the heels of two years of deficient rainfall, putting more pressure on groundwater resources. Water shortage poses an economic, environmental and security threat to India. Its important all levels of government understand the gravity of the situation. Things can change, but that requires an integrated approach which combines economic incentives, technology and tighter regulations.Agriculture uses about 80% of Indias water resources. A solution, therefore, must focus on changing agricultural practices. Indian agriculture is inefficient in its use of water. We use two to four times more water to produce a unit of major food crop than China or Brazil. Within India, a Punjab or a Maharashtra which are among the most water intensive producers of rice and sugar are key producer states. To get away from this suboptimal situation, governments must realise that power subsidies have had an adverse impact on irrigation patterns. States must break the groundwater-energy nexus to remove a perverse incentive to overuse groundwater.Decades of perverse incentives have led to a situation where 65% of the wells in India registered a decline when water level this year was compared with the last decades average. Action on power subsidies needs to be complemented with use of technology to carry out aquifer mapping. Efforts thus far have been haphazard and technology needs to be used more effectively. Technology and tighter regulations also need to be combined to mitigate water contamination. India may be water stressed but so is Israel, which manages its water resources far better to obviate any shortage."

The good Southwest monsoons this year is expected to boost production of most crops above last years levels. Given that food crops account for around two thirds of the agriculture output, and that kharif grain contributed around half the total annual grain output, it is a good breakthrough for the agriculture sector where growth has slumped from a high of 4.2% in 2013-14 to a negative 0.2% in 2014-15 and a meagre 1.1% in 2015-16.Improved supply of food grains will also help soften food prices which has been one of the bugbears that has rankled policy makers, especially the central bank which has had a tough time trying to hold down inflation rates. This is especially because rice output has gone up to record highs. The higher coarse grain output, primed mainly by the record output of maize, will also help bring down prices of an important product consumed by low income groups.Especially reassuring for the government is the surge in output of pulses by more than half to 8.7 million tons mainly boosted by the significant improvement in area and productivity of tur and urad dal. This would help bring down pulse prices, which has hit the roof for some time now, and help cool down food prices substantially.Among other major crops oilseeds have also registered a boom in output this year. However, sugarcane production is expected to be hit in the current year. However, the surprise is the increase in cotton output despite the fall in cropped area, mainly due to the increase in productivity. Overall the first advance estimates of crop production in the middle of fiscal year will be a major boost to consumer and investor confidence in the coming months.Given the optimism on the farm front this is the ripe time for the government to push forward with its efforts to extend important schemes like the extension of farm insurance and e-marketing to a majority of the farm households. Though the number of farmers benefiting from the national agriculture insurance scheme has gone up in recent times only about a fifth of the farmers has been covered in the last kharif crop. Numbers show that crop insurance covers at least half the farmers in only two states: Maharashtra and Rajasthan. However, in states like Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh less than a tenth of the farmers are covered by crop insurance.The other important intervention of the NDA government has been on extending ecommerce facilities to farmers. The idea is to extend electronic trading facilities in 585 regulated wholesale markets by 2018 so that farmers can trade the produce across the nation without any hurdles. Though the plan was to link up 200 markets by September this year and another 200 markets by March 2017 the government has been able to link up only about 23 wholesaled regulated markets in 8 states to the national portal.This not only points to the lackadaisical approach of the states government to freeing the farmers from the clutches of the middlemen but also the strong political links of the trader cartel which not only deprive the farmers of the gains of any increase in food prices but also cause supply bottlenecks to crash prices. Extending the reach of the farm markets should now get the top priority of the government and push it to roll out the program to meet deadlines."

The Institute of Microbial Technology (Imtech) has sequenced the megagenomic data of microbes coexisting with basmati rice. With this, scientists have opened a big window of opportunity in this tiny white speck. They say that with access to such a data, there can be huge possibilities of new research to increase rice plant output and quality Megagenomics imply large-scale genetic data and sequencing of bacteria. One bacteria has around 5,000 genes and scientists at Imtech have sequenced genomes of 100 such bacteria. Imtech is one of 37 laboratories of Council of Scientific and Industrial Re search (CSIR) in Chandigarh.""The new data can also lead to research in using lesser resources like water and land to grow rice -a staple for almost half the world's population,"" said Prabhu B Patil , lead author of the study.In India, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh , Delhi, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are major basmati cultivating states. India's export of basmati rice fetches between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore annually.""The data can be a boon for farmers if it can identify those microbes of the grain which makes the crop drought, disease and shattering (during harvesting 1015% of the grains fall off) resistant,"" said Rameshwar Singh, project director, Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Delhi.It is believed that with the chemical and artificial treatment of rice, the original or native bacteria that coexisted with the plant had been suppressed. Exploitation of this genomic data might restore the native bacterial consortium as was in millions of years ago.Plants are host to numerous microbes that co-evolved over millions of years. These natural microbes in turn aid development and protection of plants in diverse climatic conditions. ""Analysis of bioinformatics by an expert can become valuable source for further research. Imtech has shown a new direction to the world. It is a breakthrough when the world is talking about food security,"" said Girish Sahni, director general CSIR.Patil's group at Imtech has published the `The rice microbiome' in Frontiers in Microbiology. It is the first megagenome database of seed microbiome of any plant. ""We have sequenced genome of bacteria found in basmati seeds. These bacteria would be contributing to boost rice's immunity to fight against diseases and other stressful conditions like less water etc,"" said Patil.While genome data of many plants is available, the microbial megagenomic resource of only a plant weed -Arabidopsis thaliana was sequenced earlier. The data generated by Patil's group is the first megagenomic information of microbes associated with an economically important plant.Samriti, who is the first author of the megagenomic study , along with Kanika Bansal, both PhD scholars associated with Patil at Imtech, is carrying forward this work."

Indias surgical strikes on Wednesday night were surely only a tooth  barely a few kilometres across the Line of Control (LoC)  but they represent one of the most important changes in Indias military posture to Pakistan in over a decade.Contrary to those who believe that history began in May 2014, this is not the first time that India has attacked targets on the Pakistani side of the LoC. Such assaults were relatively commonplace in the AB Vajpayee years, during the latter, turbulent stage of the insurgency in Kashmir. Journalist Praveen Swami has reported a string of retaliatory Indian raids across the LoC from the 1990s through the 2000s. He gives one example of a massacre of 22 civilians at Bandala in March 1998 by irregulars backed by Indian special forces, in retaliation for an earlier massacre of Hindus. These details are contested, but it is beyond doubt that the LoC was not sacrosanct. Those who served as brigade commanders during Operation Parakram (2001-02) have also remarked, coyly, that they were not sitting idly in their posts during that standoff.Read: Armys surgical strikes inflict terrorist casualties across LoCThe novelty here is not that India struck. It is that it chose to announce its operation with great fanfare. The hastily convened Cabinet Committee on Security set the tone, and the unusual pairing of the Director General Military Operations and ministry of external affairs spokesman underlined the strategic importance of the announcement that followed. Indias previous raids were instances of tacit signaling between the frontline military forces, with little oversight from the top brass and the foreign ministry out of the loop. They sent messages to Pakistans military, without causing Pakistan to lose face in a way that would set in motion a spiral of escalation. The downside of clandestine retaliation was that the Indian public was rarely privy to these goings-on at the LoC, beyond the odd leaked snippet.Indias decision to go public has advantages and drawbacks. It allows the government to claim vindication for its tough rhetoric. The Army has, as it promised, responded at a time and place of its own choosing. Those criticising the Modi government for talking loudly but carrying a small stick have been temporarily quieted (though has their appetite been whet?). Even the Congress, reliably a force for mindless opposition to nearly everything the government does, has read the tea-leaves, with Sonia Gandhi expressing rare public solidarity with actions to protect countrys security. More broadly, a public strike creates a precedent in a way a private one does not, making it somewhat easier for this or a future government to repeat the action. India may also be probing Pakistans thresholds for action. If the consequences of this strike are limited, the next one may be deeper or wider, perhaps even across the International Border. And if it is true that an Indian drone recorded footage, the longer-term implications for armed drones are self-evident.Read: We stand with govt on actions to ensure countrys security: SoniaPublicity also carries costs. While Pakistan is, at the time of writing, denying that any raid took place, it will eventually have to contend with reality  not least if the Modi government chooses to release what it claims is video evidence. The Pakistan army will have no choice but to respond forcefully. The evacuation of Punjab border villages on Thursday suggests that India expects to face an intensification of shelling along the LoC. But we may also see encouragement of further Uri-like attacks, or even attacks in Indian cities beyond Jammu and Kashmir and on Indian interests in Afghanistan. We do not yet know whether Pakistani troops were killed  the DGMOs reference to those trying to shield terrorists suggests so  but this will also influence Rawalpindis calculus.Diplomatically, India appears to have prepared its ground well. Having successfully corralled three of its neighbours to boycott the SAARC summit in November, Pakistan was already reeling. Then early on Thursday morning, perhaps while Indian force were returning across LoC, details of a conversation between Indian National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and his American counterpart Susan Rice were released, with Rice demanding Pakistani action against terrorist groups. Whether or not the US was informed, the impeccable timing sent its own signal. China, too, has remained muted over the plight of its all-weather ally. Without this diplomatic space, Indian leaders might not have taken this risk.Read: Indias claim of surgical strikes fabrication of truth, says Pakistan armyThe mood today will be celebratory. Much of the Indian public believes that decades of strategic restraint are drawing to a close. There will be an impact on the full gamut of bilateral relations, from trade to regional cooperation. But, as Lieutenant General HS Panag reminded us on Thursday, war is a game of chess. And the fundamental dilemma remains: While India can impose a modest cost on terrorist groups and their supporters, any game-changing punishment carries with it the risk of a larger war that would damage Indias broader economic and diplomatic interests. The brutal fact is that Pakistan will not reverse seven decades of policy without a diplomatic process. If we may draw some hope, it is that the carnage of 1999-2002 was followed by the backchannel of diplomacy of 2004-07. As the stick grows, so too should the carrot.Shashank Joshi is senior research fellow, Royal United Services Institute, LondonThe views expressed are personal"

58f665fe7be9e031f13b3fe2,State lags behind national average in rice production,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/State-lags-behind-national-average-in-rice-production/articleshow/54619452.cms,2016-10-01,"BHUBANESWAR: Between 2012 and '15, Odisha won national awards for excellence in foodgrain productions. But when it comes to producing rice, it has fallen behind the national average despite the area under paddy cultivation being more than other states.Over the last decade the all-India average of rice production stands at more than 2,000 kg/hectare (kg/ha). In the same period Odisha has steadily increased its production from 1,554 kg/ha in 2005-06 to 2,361 in 2012-13. But over the past few years the number has started declining. In 2013-14 the yield was 1,821 kg/ha while in 2015-16 it had dipped to 1,491 kg/ha from 1,989 in 2014-15.Explaining the change, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said in a written reply in the assembly recently: ""Odisha faces natural calamities like drought, cyclone, flood and untimely rain almost every year. Despite all odds, there was a gradual growth in rice production every year due to a number of steps taken by the state government. Effort is on to match the national average.""The reason for the sharp decline in production in 2015-16 was attributed to drought-like situation in as many as 27 of the 30 districts, official figures revealed. Over 200 farmers allegedly committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden though the state government claimed that most of the deaths were due to other reasons.Asked about the low yield despite paddy being cultivated in two-thirds of the total cultivable land, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor of OUAT S N Pasupalak said: ""Factors like low mechanization, poor nutrient management, structure of land and low irrigation potential are responsible for low production of rice in the state.""Among all districts, Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, stands at the top in producing highest amount of rice constantly for past 10 years. Other districts like Boudh, Dhenkanal, Nabarangapur, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur and Sundargarh have been recording high production of rice for past two years.Despite drought in 2015-16, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak produced 2,571 kg/ha and 2,505 kg/ha, respectively, among the highest in the country.""For increase in productivity, Odisha has been promoting modern methods like system of rice intensification (SRI), practice of multiple crops, soil testing, supplying quality seeds and augmenting irrigation potential,"" said an officer in the agriculture department.A number of centrally-sponsored schemes like National Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India, National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana are being implemented in the state to increase the agriculture productivity.Odisha has been winning successive krishi karman awards among category-II states for record foodgrain production.According to sources in the directorate of economics and statistics, states like West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are ahead of Odisha in rice production.."

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Gurwinder Singhs home in Roranwala. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)Lush green paddy fields as far as the eye can see, the sound of water gushing from a tubewell, fields lined with tall poplars and eucalyptus. Notwithstanding the razor wire strung on a fence in the near distance, the view from the top of Gurwinder Singhs double-storey house in this village  700 metres from Zero Line, the International Boundary between India and Pakistan  could have been one of unmatched rural idyll, had it been another day or another place.But a day after the Punjab government, acting on the Union Home Ministrys advice, ordered evacuation of all villages in a 10 km radius of the border, even the prettiest sight takes ominous hues.Most of the 450 people in the village left in panic. But as the sun dawned on Friday, many returned, worried about their crop, homes, animals, and confused about whether there was a real threat from across the border.Most people left last evening after the warning. I came back this morning to feed my animals and water the fields. In ten days, my paddy will be ripen and it will be time to harvest it, but everything is up in the air now, said Gurwinder.The BSF did not open the black gate on the razor wire fence this morning to allow farmers to access their fields between the fence and Zero Line. Of the nine acres owned by Gurwinders family, six lie beyond the fence. There is no fence separating his land from that of Pakistani farmers on the other side.If we cant harvest it, it will all go waste, said Gurwinder. On his mind is a Rs 6 lakh loan from the arthiya or commission agent at the mandi, that he took three years ago to add a floor and more rooms to his house, and for his marriage. He repays by pledging the crop to the arthiya.Maybe the government will pay some compensation, he said, recalling that during the Kargil war, there was a similar evacuation, but the Army laid mines in the area and villagers could not return to the fields for over a year.On Thursday, in the midst of the evacuation, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal asked farmers not to panic, and not to harvest before the crop had ripened.But with uncertainty looming, many men in Roranwala returned in the morning, after leaving their wives and children in Amritsar with relatives.Gurwinder, his wife, one-year-old-daughter, parents and brother had left after packing a few clothes on Thursday night. They travelled by car to Chheharta in Amritsar to stay with his fathers aunt.Gurwinder was one of the few men who returned to the village with his entire family, but like other men in the village, he said he was taking no chances and returning to Chheharta in the evening.If something really happens, the enemy wont spare women and children. But maybe in five or six days, our government and Pakistan will sort things out, he said.This village is famous for Basmati 1121 and Parmal (two rice varieties). The Parmal has ripened, but we can cut it only if there is peace and calm, said Sukhdev Singh, another villager. Some people have to cut in five days, some in ten.Sukhdev said the announcement for evacuation was made from the village gurdwara at around 2 pm. The Block Development Officer called the sarpanch at noon and told him the details. The sarpanch made the announcement, Sukhdev said, recalling that though the village has seen India-Pakistan wars in the past, this was the first time there was an announcement asking people to leave.With the gates to the fields closed and no work to do, men who had returned sat in the village square next to the gurdwara. Veley baithein hain (We are sitting jobless), said one of them.Raghubir Singh, 87, said he was among the few who had not left the village. Its our village, all our possessions are here  our crops, our animals. Cant leave it all and go away. I can tell you there will be no trouble, he said.He pointed to the trade that was continuing at the Attari Integrated Check Post, 2 km from the village. Pakistani buses are coming and going. And our soldiers are also not moving to the border. These are signs to watch out for if trouble is coming, he said.On instructions from the top leadership of the ruling Akali Dal, ministers and MLAs visited border villages all morning, reassuring people that everything would be taken care of.Government is ready to address every problem, said Animal Husbandry Minister Gulzar Singh Ranike, whose constituency, Attari, is particularly affected. Compensation will be paid if the crop cannot be harvested. Centre will pay.His son Lali Ranike, who was accompanying him on the rounds, said earlier governments used to wait for the first bomb or shell to fall, and then ask to people to leave. We have taken advance measures.Assembly elections are due in Punjab early next year. A government official on evacuation duty said this was the opportunity for the Akali Dal to reconnect with people and mobilise supporters.This kind of work is not possible by officials alone. The political worker on the ground is of crucial importance, and the Akalis are going all out, he said.Ranike said that for villagers reluctant to leave, the government was organising all help. We have asked them to form committees of six or seven people. If anyone has a complaint, they should go to the committee, and the committee will inform me, the minister said.In Roranwala, the evacuation had an unexpected fallout, and it is unlikely that any minister can do anything about itGurwinders cousin had received a marriage proposal, and just the day before the evacuation, his prospective in-laws had come to see him. The two families had exchanged photographs of the prospective bride and groom.Yesterday, they called to say they were not interested, said Gurwinder. They probably decided after watching the news.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Were packed, can leave at moments notice. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)THERE IS no fear during the day. Everything is normal. The night is when its frightening, says Parwinder Kaur. Its 10 pm in this village, 1.5 km from the India-Pakistan border, on Friday, 32 hours after the evacuation orders were first announced over the village gurudwara. Its a still night, and silence has fallen over the village, not unusual because most people turn in for the night by 9 pm.In Rajaoke, where most families have left the village, leaving one person behind to look after their house and cattle, those who remain are hoping that this comforting, routine silence of the night will never be shattered.Parwinders two sons and daughters-in-law, and their children, left immediately after the evacuation orders, going to their relatives outside the 10 km evacuation zone. On Friday morning, only her sons came back to tend to the fields, and left the village again in the evening.I decided I would be the one to stay back. Someone has to feed the buffaloes and look after the house. Saving the young women and children is the first priority. I can look after myself, says Parwinder, 68.She has come to spend the night with a family, whose four oldest members and two young boys decided to stay back after seeing off seven others of the family. They have put out cots in the yard and are getting ready for the night.Attacks never happen in the day time, they always come late at night or early in the morning, says Jiaoun Singh.From the terrace of his one-storeyed house, a glow of yellow from the floodlights is both a comfort for the family that the BSF is not far away, as well as a reminder of their proximity to potential trouble.We are not worried about the big bombs, if Pakistan fires those, they will fly over Rajaoke and hit some other place. Those are meant for big cities. What we fear is the possibility of smaller shells, says Kulwant Singh, Jiaouns brother.Chamkaur Singh, one of the younger men, says he could not sleep the other night. I kept going up to the terrace to check if anything was happening, he says.It is too early to say how the tension that has gripped Punjabs border villages over the last few days will play out during the assembly elections. In Rajaoke, which is a reserved village, the sarpanch is a Dalit woman. But the real power centre is Nirmal Singh, who introduces himself as the sarpanch and describes himself as an Akali worker, and who owns the best house in the village.Nobody wants to take political advantage of this situation. Chief Minister (Parkash Singh) Badal has told Akali MLAs not to sit around in Chandigarh, to go and be of help to people. You can see, the ministers and MLAs are going everywhere. Yesterday, the SP, BDO, DSP, SHO, everyone came to check on the parts of the village that are on the other side of the defence line, he says, referring to a drain that runs through the village, and into which water is released to the brim should there be a threat from across the border.It boosts the morale of the people. They are also providing free transport to poor people who have no vehicles to ferry them back to the village in the morning, and take them to the camps at night, says Nirmal Singh.Most of the villagers who have gone to the camps are Dalit families, while the upper caste families have gone to stay with relatives.Everyone is happy that (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi has given a mooh todh jawab (befitting reply) to Pakistan. They were taking us for granted. Even the zamindars in this village are happy, despite their concerns about their fields and harvest, declared the de facto sarpanch.Nobody can tell how long the situation will continue, he says. Even when farmers fight, its takes a week for people to calm down. This is a matter between two countries, he adds.But Satnam Singh, who says he is an Akali worker, is angry with the government. There is no problem here, so tell me why are they driving people out. I have built a Rs 2 crore house, can I just leave? Maybe Badal thinks this will help in the elections, but hes forcing us to become homeless. I havent seen a single soldier. If there is such a big threat, why cant we see the Army in this village, he asks.Worried about his rice crop, Satnam says the government now has the perfect alibi to put off quick procurement.Another farmer, Karaj Singh, who, according to villagers, nurses the ambition of becoming the first AAP sarpanch of Rajaoke, says the mood of the people will become clear only after the code of conduct comes into effect. Everybody is an Akali now, many for their own reasons, he says.The Akali Dal may benefit from the Centres strong response to Pakistan, says Karaj, adding that this is the right reply.But that will be offset by the delay thats going to hit grain procurement. Last year, the procurement got delayed because of all the trouble over the desecration incidents, we had to sell our basmati at rock bottom rates of Rs 1,500 per quintal. But the traders were still selling it for Rs 3,200- Rs 4,500 per quintal. This harvest season, theres a new problem, he says.Swaran Singh, who also describes himself as an AAP worker, has a contrary theory. The government will do everything to procure the paddy on time. And they will say that despite all the troubles they did not let the farmers go hungry, he says.Back in Jiaoun Singhs yard, the conversation shifts to what people took with them. One family even took their buffaloes, laughs Kulwant. But can anyone take his land or his home? he asks.His brother retorts: We made these houses to live in them. We cant go and live with relatives indefinitely. They will get tired of us, or worse, they might expect something in return.A few houses away, Sukhwinders family is proud that none of the 13 members have left the village. Sukhwinder points to the tractor trolley in a dark corner of the yard. It is loaded with suitcases and large aluminium trunks.Sukhwinders loaded tractor has become the talking point of the village, but it is also symbolic of the atmosphere of uncertainty that has taken over the border villages since the evacuation began, and the reluctance of people to abandon their hard-built lives even in the face of possible danger.We are all packed, and we can leave at a moments notice, but we are not leaving just yet, says Sukhwinder. Not till we hear the sounds of shells falling. And when we go, we are taking only our rations and clothes, he says.He and his 85-year-old father, Ajit Singh, give a guided tour of the five rooms in the house, each with massive box beds, other furniture, television sets, a fridge. If we have to go, we will be leaving all this behind, says Ajit Singh.He declares that he will stay behind to look after the house. I can also help the soldiers when they go to the front, he says. The younger boys also declare that if war comes, they will stay on in solidarity with the soldiers.That sentiment is voiced by many of those who remain in the village, even as people express confidence that nothing will happen. Swaran Singh and Rajwant say one night at a relatives place was enough. Theres no place like home, she says. The couple also brought their two young sons back with them.People in the village would rather wait for the first signals.There are no signals yet. We have seen earlier, in 1965, 1971, 1999 and 2001, that the Army becomes very visible at the first sign of trouble. We havent seen any soldiers, its still only the BSF. Next, the Army breaks all the bridges over the drains, and then they increase the water level in the drain to about 7-8 feet. None of those things have happened, says Jiaoun, predicting that as the initial tension wears off, people will begin to return.About 1,000 acres of land owned by people in Rajaoke lies beyond the wire fence. Farmers are given access to these fields six days of the week.The day BSF reopens the gates to those fields, that will be the sign that people can come back and stay for good, says Gurmit Singh, a young farmer whose land lies close to the fence.For now, though, the young farmer says he wants to take photographs of himself with some soldiers and send them to his friends on WhatsApp, to tell them hes standing ready to help the Indian Army.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Massive stubble burning by farmers cause pollution that deteriorates air quality significantly.THE HARYANA government has asked Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) in its Department of Science and Technology to monitor stubble burning in 10 districts where the practice is widespread.HASRAC will inform Haryana State Pollution Control Board who will then initiate action against the farmer concerned.The districts to be monitored include Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa Sonipat and Yamunanagar.What what else is in the newsWith the paddy harvest on and stubble burning looming, the Central Pollution Control Board at New Delhi called a meeting on September 30 attended by representatives of Punjab and Haryana apart from other paddy growing states, to discuss how to prevent it.Member Secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, S Narayanan said, A meeting was called by Central Pollution Control Board at Delhi last week where representatives of several states were present. We have given orders to the regional officers incharge of all districts to monitor cases of stubble burning and report these. Awareness activities will also be conducted.Officials of the Board rue that there is a lack of staff in the districts that makes it difficult to monitor such cases. At some places one regional officer has the charge of more than one districts. Another hindrance is the long-drawn process of prosecuting farmers.The board does not have powers for imposing any penalty on farmers. It can only recommend cases for prosecution. During the last paddy season, a total of 46 cases were recommended for prosecution, while during the wheat season, 48 cases were recommended.Farmers adopt this practice to clear the fields quickly and make these ready for sowing the next crop. The Department of Agriculture is also involved in checking the practice.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said alternatives are being explored so that farmers are encouraged not to burn stubble. He said that the government is contemplating a proposal under which stubble can be converted into power. There are provisions for penalty and sentencing, he said.A report by HARSAC states that there is a decline of around 21 per cent in this practice in the past three years. The report states that in the year 2015, stubble burning took place in 163 thousand hectares in 2015, which was 14.4 per cent of the total rice cropped area. A year earlier in 2014, stubble burning was witnessed in 168.9 thousand hectares or 15.7 per cent of the rice cropped area. The figure was 208.3 thousand hectares or 20.3 percent of the rice cropped area in 2013. The report suggests that total rice burning area in the 10 districts reduced by 3.5 percent as compared to 2014 and 21.8 percent as compared to 2013.As per the study, while there was a decline in stubble burning in eight districts, in two districts namely Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar there was an increase.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It has acquired RH Agro 's rice mill in Sonipat, Haryana, for Rs 70 crore and has taken four other rice mills across the country on exclusive lease, which will help it launch 18 packaged rice brands by the end of this month.At present, Patanjali sells three variants of packaged rice  silver, gold and diamond. It meets its procurement needs by buying finished rice and packaging it at its Haridwar facility. The new mills will not only give the FMCG company the capability of producing 3.2 lakh tonnes of finished rice a year from paddy but will also allow it to produce region-specific rice variants that it plans to sell locally and export as well.""The acquisition will give us technical know-how in rice processing,"" said Acharya Balkrishna, MD of Patanjali Ayurved. ""We have partnered with thousands of rice farmers in many regions of the country to produce traditional variants.""Other than the mill in Sonipat, which will process basmati, Patanjali has leased two mills in Madhya Pradesh to process the pusa variety. Another mill in Telangana will produce the lightweight aromatic sona masuri to cater to markets in the south, while a mill in Fazilka, Punjab will process rice grains that are grown in the north. Around 150 varieties of rice are currently grown in the country, industry estimates showed.Patanjali, known for its best-selling products such as cow's ghee and ayurvedic toothpaste Dant Kanti, has drawn up an ambitious strategy to disrupt India's packaged rice market, which is currently dominated by brands such as India Gate, Kohinoor, Best Basmati and Daawat. Research firm Euromonitor has valued the market at Rs 22,000 crore and said it will grow at a CAGR of 11% till 2020.""The rice brands will be made available in 50 SKUs (stock keeping unit) of various sizes,"" said Balkrishna. Prices will range between Rs 67 for one kilo of Sona Masoori Steam and Rs 2,100 for 25kg of Lashkari (kolam), the company said. Senior executives at Patanjali said its new rice variants will have a shelf life of two years, which is double that of brands available in the market. ""Some of our variants will also take less time to cook than competing brands,"" they said."

Also, during the year 2015, the board had filed 46 cases against the violators in the special environment courts at Kurukshetra and Faridabad , out of which 24 cases have already been decided against the violators.The board has already engaged the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) to monitor the seasonal rice stubble burning in areas where the crop is grown. It has now decided get the incidences of burning of wheat stubble monitored through HARSAC for the year 2017 in 10 major wheat growing districts of the state.It has sought the daily report from HARSAC in the form of satellite imageries and other remote evidences on the activities captured in the state for effective monitoring and enforcement purposes. Central Pollution Control Board has also been requested to share the satellite imaginary reports/data obtained from ISRO on a daily basis for effective monitoring, comparison with other states and implementation of enforcement measures.In a recent meeting headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on this issue, it was decided to launch a pilot project for paddy straw based biomass power project. A spokesman of the board said that the government or panchayat land would be explored for setting up of the project and storage of biomass. It was also decided that agriculture department would formulate a scheme for reaper, raiker and bailer on the best terms like in Punjab , to provide financial assistance to entrepreneurs for purchase of the same or to be purchased by its own agencies."

Despite enjoying a full five-year term in office, despite overseeing a major and defining shift in economic policy, despite effecting innovations in foreign policy such as the Look East strategy, Narasimha Rao had thus far not got his due from scholars and commentators on Indian politics. There were two reasons for this. One was his conspicuous failure to prevent the destruction of the Babri Masjid and the communal riots that followed, a failure that in the eyes of many nullified his other achievements.Read: PM Modi pays tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur ShastriA second and perhaps more important reason for the neglect of Rao was that he had fallen foul of Sonia Gandhi. After she became Congress president in 1998, Mrs Gandhi systematically erased Rao from the memory of the party and its members. To be sure, this was part of a wider effort to define the Congress as the property of a single family. While the achievements (real and imagined) of Nehru, Indira and Rajiv were magnified and broadcast, those of other Congress leaders were underplayed. In this rebranding the reputations of many remarkable Congressmen (and Congresswomen) suffered, but Raos perhaps most of all.The attention now belatedly paid to Rao is welcome. But the time has also come to revisit the legacy of a prime minister even more considerable than Rao, likewise a lifelong Congressman, who too has been largely erased from his partys history by the family that has come to dominate it.This is Lal Bahadur Shastri. Not long after Shastri became prime minister, he stopped in Karachi, then the capital of Pakistan, while on his way home from Cairo. He was met at the airport by President Ayub Khan, who, noticing his tiny frame and 26-inch chest, wondered how such a little man could rule such a large nation. It is said that this sight of Shastri in the flesh convinced Ayub (himself an Army General) that the time was ripe for a fresh incursion into Kashmir. He was convinced that the new leader of India would not be able to effectively defend his country when war came.Read: 1965 war: We got air superiority over Pak in three daysAyub was mistaken. For, with his outstanding defence minister, YB Chavan, Shastri had already overseen the long overdue modernisation of our armed forces. In August 1965 Pakistan sent infiltrators into Kashmir, following this in early September with a major armed offensive. The Indian Army fought bravely, but the pressure on them was intense. In an inspired move, the prime minister ordered a fresh front to be opened in the Punjab, which immediately put the Pakistanis back on the defensive. Under Shastris leadership, the armed forces acquitted themselves extremely well in the war of 1965, thus erasing memories of their ignominious defeat at the hands of China three years previously.The slogan most associated with Shastri was jai jawan, jai kisan. For Nehrus successor keenly understood the link between self-sufficiency in food and self-reliance in politics. It was Shastri who, along with another remarkable cabinet minister, C Subramaniam, laid the foundations of the Green Revolution, although it was Indira Gandhi who came to claim the credit, since the gains from the new strains of wheat and rice took a decade to fructify, by which time Shastri, sadly, was dead.There are many reasons to remember Shastri now, when the agrarian sector is urgently in need of renewal, and when tensions with our always difficult neighbour are once more on the rise. Shastri was a self-effacing man, who wished to be remembered by his actions rather than his words. But when he did speak, he chose his words very wisely, never more so than in a speech he delivered at Delhis Ram Lila Maidan in late September 1965, shortly after a cease-fire had been brokered by the United Nations.The BBC had described the conflict that had just ended as a war between Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. In his speech in the Ram Lila Maidan, Shastri refuted this pernicious allegation. The meeting was chaired by a veteran nationalist who happened to be a Muslim by birth. The speaker before Shastri was a Anglo-Indian lawyer who had been a prominent member of the Constituent Assembly. When it came to his turn to speak, the prime minister drew the crowds attention to the company he was then proudly keeping. So Shastri said: Mir Mushtaq who is presiding over this meeting is a Muslim. Mr Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics . This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims itself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose [and] worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.Read: City Cong pays tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, ShastriThe attention recently paid to PV Narasimha Rao was because this year marks the 25th anniversary of the liberalisation of the Indian economy. However, the speech of Shastri I have just quoted is not just timely, but also timeless. It inevitably comes to mind when there are troubles with Pakistan. Yet it remains compellingly relevant in times of peace too. If India is to survive and thrive, religion must never be a factor in the political life of the Republic.Ramachandra Guhas most recent book is Gandhi Before IndiaTwitter: @Ram_GuhaThe views expressed are personal"

Every year, in November and February , burning of agricultural res idue in these states causes severe air pollution in Delhi.According to Climate Foundation India's proposal for the Urban Labs Innovation Challenge, nearly 60 mega tonnes of rice straw is burnt openly annually . Haryana and Punjab comprise 48% of total emissions due to rice straw burning across India. ""During the months rice straw is burned, PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) levels commonly exceed 400 parts per million,"" it said.The team at Climate Foundation India proposes to make biochar out of the agricultural residue instead. Inspired by scientist James Lovelock's Gaia theory, which explained how the soil can act as an effective sink for greenhouse gases, Brian's team developed a ""charvester""-an equipment that harvests grain and cuts the straw at the same time.""It can also collect the straw and put it through pyrolysis to make biochar,"" says Herzen, adding that ""the biochar that is rich in carbon can then be buried into the soil where it will remain for thousands of years.This will also improve the soil quality immensely .""His team in Delhi is in talks with the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) in Karnal for this project. It has also visited villages in Haryana to understand whether farmers will accept the biochar technology . ""CSSRI has already helped address soil salinity in about 2 million acres of land in UP , Haryana and Punjab. An important part of the restoration process was ensuring carbon is put back into the soil. Charvesters are going to do just that.""The organisation had used a similar technology to produce biochar with bi omass waste in Bangalore a few years ago. Says Hitesh Arora, who is based in Delhi, ""We know that biochar can be effectively made from paddy and wheat straw. Our team has already met farmers in Haryana who have expressed interest. Now we will have to demonstrate it and see how the technology can be made affordable for them.""Haryana and Punjab have already prohibited agricultural residue burning under the Air Act. In order to ensure effective enforcement of the law, the Environment Pollution Control Authority has directed state governments to start imposing penalty and prosecution for all incidents of stubble burning through district level special teams, to launch awareness campaigns before the paddy harvesting period, and asked state remote sensing agencies to stay vigilant.Bringing about change, part-IVThe University of Chicago Urban Labs and the Delhi government have announced the finalists of the Urban Labs Innovation Challenge--a competition to find innovative solutions for the Capital's air pollution and energy crisis. The seven finalists are competing to win up to Rs 2 crore to work with University of Chicago and the Delhi government to pilot their ideas in the Capital. The winner or winners will be announced on October 21.The competition was announced in December last year. These seven were selected from among 250 ideas from different parts of the country that were pitched in this competition.

Winter after winter satellites provide scary heat maps of the scale of the problem. Breathing troubles spike across NCR. Children are especially badly hit. But as the persistent cough of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal shows, all that smog is like kryptonite to adult lungs too.So that instead of going out and about you feel like hibernating in your bedroom with air purifiers. Sadly their superpowers are dodgy as well.When a foul grey covered the capital last winter a ten minute walk in traffic would cover your face with an icky film, making your lungs feel tortured and your throat scratchy as if you had chain-smoked a whole pack of cigarettes.

Look, this can be a big opportunity to teach pradhan mantriji how cooperative federalism is done. Get the neighbouring governments to show some love for clean air. Persuade kisan bhais to sell that rice straw to paper mills. Help herald a brave new world of modern agriculture and happy winters. Even the lungs of poll-bound Punjab will thank you."

In desserts there was sabudana pudding with rich creamy bliss of sabudana mixed with berries. Sabudana crispies served with tamarind sauce were also liked by many.Eateries were busy experimenting with the fasting menu like mini thalis for the health freaks.""It is not just quantity but also quality,"" said Vikas Sharma , who fasted during Navratri.

Long gaps between meals could lead to acidity and one may end up ruining their metabolism. Eating small meals like these baked items is healthy as the base is of the same flour chestnut and buckwheat flour. Sabudana, rajgira , buckwheat and saamak rice are rich in carbohydrates and proteins so they can also be taken on a regular basis. Also, as the season is changing one must avoid foods that generate a lot of heat in the body. That is why onion and garlic are avoided during fast. One can opt for cool foods like curd topped with fruits. Even eating salads can help curb cravings.""City-based nutritionist Dr Simrat Kathuria said , ""Liquid intake is also advised like milk, coconut water, lemon water, buttermilk and fresh juices that can help detox.""She added, ""Balancing everyday eating patterns with controlled eating, which is done during fast, must be practiced on regular basis.

Last year, as per the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) 30.78 lakh tonnes of Basmati was procured in the state, which was sown at 7.63 lakh hectares area of land.Owing to a poor rate fixed for the basmati crop last two years, the farmers this year has decided to curtail the area to a significant level. The decision means that there will be around 35 per cent less production of the basmati crop in Punjab.Farmers have demanded that government must fix a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for basmati on the lines of paddy crops as it will save significant underground water and bring more foreign exchange to the country.Though there is a possibility that less production may hit the export this yea, however exporters said that last years stocks are available which will be carried forward. There should be some fixed system and for every Rs 100 crores purchase of basmati Rs 10 crore must be kept for the welfare of farmers to provide them farm implements free of cost through a lottery system as it will encourage them to grow more basmati, said Vijay Setia, former president and current governing body member of All India Export Association Area.Last year, as per the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) 30.78 lakh tonnes of Basmati was procured in the state, which was sown at 7.63 lakh hectares area of land. But with the area being curtailed to 4.96 lakh hectares this year, the production will automatically reduce by 35 per cent.Around 19-20 lakh tonnes basmati production is expected in the state this year.It may be noted that Punjab is among the five states which falls under the traditional Geographical Indication (GI) area for export of basmati rice along with Haryana, some part of UP, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

59048b397be9e04154df84b2,How goats can clean Delhi’s dirty air,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/how-goats-can-clean-delhis-dirty-air/,2016-10-16,"Delhis air pollution season is starting with the burning of rice stubble by farmers on lakhs of acres after the kharif harvest. Its politically impossible to stop a traditional practice like burning through legal bans: farmers think they have a right to burn, whatever the ecological consequences The solution lies in finding profitable ways to use the rice stubble. Of these, the most intriguing is the conversion of stubble into goat fodder.Burning stubble destroys a useful raw material, pollutes the air, causes respiratory diseases and worsens greenhouse gas emissions. Traditionally, rice was harvested manually. But todays farm labour shortage means combine harvesters now cut most of the kharif crop in the north-west. Manual cutting leaves only a couple of inches of stubble, but combine harvesters leave 12-15 inches.Once, farmers allowed shepherds to graze sheep on the stubble. But today farmers are in a rush to clear the fields and plant a rabi crop within a fortnight of the kharif harvest. Cutting and transporting stubble can cost Rs 1,200 per tonne, and few buyers will pay so much. Hence most farmers simply burn the stubble.Multiple approaches are needed to discourage burning. Zero-till farming, for instance, sows wheat seeds without removing the stubble. A promising new machine is the tractor-mounted Happy Seeder that simultaneously cuts rice stubble and sows wheat seeds, depositing the cut stubble on top as a mulch. This eliminates burning, but carries additional costs. Hence farmers, who are risk-averse, mostly stick to burning. To catalyse change, a promotional tax break for Happy Seeder machines can be given for, say, five years. This will help spread awareness of the new technology and popularize its use. Some studies suggest that with some new tweaks, it may also increase yields.Punjab has a pilot project using straw as fuel for power generation. But that loses money right now. It pays farmers less for straw than other users such as the packaging and paper industries. Neither demand nor the price of straw suffices today to discourage burning.The best use of stubble is as animal feed. Over 100 million tonnes of stubble is burned today. Converting that into milk and meat will add more value than using it as fuel. Problem: rice straw has high silica content, reducing its digestibility. Hence only 30% of rice straw is used today as fodder, against 70% of wheat straw. Both rice and wheat straw have a high lignin content that also hampers digestion.Humans cannot digest straw at all, but ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) have four-stage stomachs that digest up to half of it. Goats have the toughest stomachs and best digestion rates. They are famous for aggressively eating almost anything. So, goat feed is potentially the best use of rice straw.Traditionally, goats were grazed in village pastures and forests. Shrinking grazing space has reduced the goat population. Forest grazing must be stopped, as it thwarts regeneration. The future lies in stall feeding: animals are kept in stalls and fed a mixture of straw, oilcakes and cereals. Treatment with urea, alkalis or molasses can improve the digestibility (and hence calorific value) of straw.Stall feeding is obviously more costly than free grazing. But it has advantages too. The energy animals spend in grazing uses up to one-third of their calorie intake. This is avoided by stall feeding, so stall-fed animals produce significantly more milk and meat than those that graze.Operation Flood has hugely increased milk production and the cattle population. But nothing similar has been done for goats, although goat meat is the most prized, and goat milk has buyers. Cows produce only one calf, whereas goats produce three to six kids, which mature much faster than calves. A goat costs one-tenth as much as a buffalo and so is affordable even by poor villagers, apart from being hardier and less disease-prone.India needs a goat revolution to match Operation Flood. This requires much R&D and incentives for stall feeding. These can be combined with short-run moves, of which the simplest will be a tax break or subsidy, funded by green levies, for fodder processors that upgrade the nutritional value of straw by adding urea or molasses. This can immediately make stubble harvesting more profitable, checking burning and reducing the brown haze that chokes Delhi and the north-west. This can supplement other anti-pollution measures to reduce road dust, construction dust and vehicle emissions."

Although the state accounts for only 1.5 percent of Indias geographical area, over the past two decades it has contributed 35 percent of the nations rice production and 60 cent of its wheat.LOW RAINFALLAccording to Sunil Jain, regional director of the Central Ground Water Board for northwest India, groundwater started dropping in 1985 in Punjab, and has sunk to alarming levels in recent years.Thirty years ago farmers in most parts of the state could draw water at a depth of 10 metres (32 ft), but by 2015 this was 20 metres, while farmers in some central parts of the state are unable to find water even at 30 metres or deeper, he said.There has been a substantial rise in groundwater utilisation, which has mainly happened because of the fact that Punjab gets less rainfall. Since paddy (rice) requires a lot of water, the farmers resort to heavy usage of groundwater for irrigating the paddy fields, he said.Jain added that Punjab gets less than 700mm of rainfall annually. This compares to a national average of 1,083mm, according to the World Bank.Amit Kar, an economist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, attributed the groundwater shortage to government policies such as free electricity for irrigation, credit facilities and subsidies for digging wells and buying pumping equipment, as well as heavily subsidised diesel fuel for pumps.The PAU report said annual demand for irrigation in Punjab is 4.76 million hectare metres (mhm) against a total annual supply of 3.48 mhm from canal and groundwater resources.The deficit is met by overexploitation of deeper groundwater by farmers using nearly 1.4 million tube wells, which exacerbates the loss of more accessible groundwater.According to the PAU report, 3.5 million of Punjabs 9.1 million workers make a living from agriculture or associated activities.Jain said the statistics suggest Punjabs agricultural success may not be sustainable.Punjabs exports of rice and wheat to other regions literally mean the export of its groundwater to those regions, he said.Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer of the government's National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), predicted the present rate of withdrawal will lead to complete exhaustion of groundwater within a decade in the region.Kant said India, already water-stressed, is rapidly moving towards becoming water-scarce.TIME TO SWITCH?Switching to new crops is one way to ease the problem in Punjab, said PAU's Aggarwal. Rice requires about four times as much water as maize, pulses or oilseeds, for instance.Vinod Kumar Singh, a scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, said Punjab must make the shift at any cost.The government has to make some policy decisions like assuring the farmers it will procure their produce other than paddy (rice) and wheat. Only then will they be convinced to switch over to these crops, he said.Under Indias state-sponsored Public Distribution System, the national government buys staple foods like rice, wheat and sugar from farmers and sells them to citizens at fair or cheaper prices. Commodities worth $2.25 billion, including rice and wheat, are sold annually to about 160 million families.Jasbir Singh Bains, Punjab's director of agriculture, said that system makes farmers reluctant to cultivate other crops.We have started making efforts to popularise the cultivation of pulses, maize, vegetables and oilseeds, Bains said. For example, we have appealed to the central government to increase the procurement of pulses and are urging the farmers to grow vegetables, which also have a good market.Farmers like Shamsher Singh, in NokdarJalandhar, said they would switch to less thirsty crops with government help.We are ready for this, but the government should give the guarantee that it will procure our products like it is doing in the case of wheat and rice, he said."

Other issues that the party is banking on to bolster its presence in the state , which is going to the polls next year along with UP and Punjab, are easy availability of LPG cylinders and cheap rice.State party in-charge, Union minister Prakash Javadekar asserted that these issues, coupled with the anti-incumbency sentiment against the 15-year-old Okram Ibobi Singh government will become game changer. The state will face the same fate like that of Assam where Tarun Gogoi was voted out of power after a continuous stint of 15 years.""Cooking gas cylinders were earlier difficult to get (for the common man). It took days for delivery and had to be acquired from black market. Now it is easily available, within two days. People are also happy with the central government due to availability of rice at Rs 3 a kg as against Rs 5.60 earlier through the public distribution system. It will be a game-changer,"" he said.Cheaper rice is available for tribals, who are in large numbers in the state.""We are sure to win because of BJP's rising credibility as people have benefited from the Modi government's programmes. PM Narendra Modi's popularity has only risen. Able leaders from different walks of lives are joining the party,"" he said.The central government has focused on the northeastern region as a priority and people appreciate it, he said and also cited programmes like Mudra and Jan Dhan scheme which have benefitted them."
58ff38267be9e0420db2e986,7 Pak soldiers shot on Jammu border: BSF,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/nation/story_114979.jsp,2016-10-22,"New Delhi, Oct. 21: In a flare-up in the continuing series of ceasefire violations on the frontier in Jammu and Kashmir, India's border guard claimed this evening that it had killed seven Pakistani counterparts and a militant using small arms and mortars after one of its own was critically wounded by a sniper. India's Border Security Force took the unusual step of issuing a ""Press Note"" this evening to claim the kills of Pakistani Rangers and the militant in the Hira Nagar sector of Jammu. India recognises the frontier here as the International Boundary but Pakistan disputes it as a ""working boundary"". This is a stretch of about 20 kilometres just south of the Line of Control that runs northwards from Sangam near Akhnoor. Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations spokesperson General Asim Bajwa denied the killings. ""Indians resorted to unprovoked fire/shelling on working bdry in Shakargarh sec toda. Pak Rangers befittingly responded. No loss on Pak side-1 (sic),"" he tweeted. The BSF statement said one of its troopers, Constable Gurnam Singh, was injured by a bullet. ""His condition is critical,"" it added. The constable is in a hospital in Jammu. BSF sources claimed they had intercepted radio chatter on the Pakistani side in which the Pakistan Rangers' Chak Saman post had reported that five of their men had been killed. They said the intense firing this morning after 9.30 followed the foiling of ""an audacious infiltration bid in the area of village Bobiyan of Hira Nagar sector in Jammu"" last evening. The BSF described its response as an ""aggressive offensive"". The BSF said it ""is on high alert all along the International Boundary and ready to foil any infiltration attempt"". The high alert was sounded in the wake of the September 18 killings of 19 Indian Army soldiers in Uri near the Line of Control and the September 29 ""surgical strikes"" the Indian Army claimed. The firing in Jammu is a sign of the cascading impact of that violence. But the BSF, which is under the Union home ministry, is not under the command of the army in the Jammu frontier though they maintain a close liaison. In times of hostilities in the past, the BSF has been placed under the command of the army. The Jammu frontier, which includes Sambha and Hiranagar sectors, saw intense shelling by both Pakistan and India on border outposts and villages in 2014. Villagers in India were evacuated then, as now. The entire frontier is not fenced because rivers run through the border from India to Pakistan. The region is mostly flat with tall elephant grass and rice paddies. IB alert The Intelligence Bureau has issued an alert saying six Lashkar terrorists, camping in Sukha Chak village in Pakistan, could cross over either through the Ujh river near Miniyari in Hiranagar sector or through Dinanagar sector in Punjab's Gurdaspur district."

Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra) Farmers in Punjab and Haryana say the bulk of burning happens in the first week of November. Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)On one side of National Highway 1, a heap of dry leaves is up in flames. A few kilometres ahead, farmers in fields are burning the refuse left behind after threshing the paddy crop. The air is thick with smoke along parts of the highway in Haryana.Delhis annual pollution crisis has started  and it will only get worse. The large-scale burning of agricultural remains  the stalks left in the ground after the crop is harvested  is expected to begin in earnest in the first week of November. Farmers say the bulk of burning happens in the first two weeks of November, as the entire paddy crop has not been harvested yet. This is bad news for the air quality in Delhi.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne only needs to visit some villages in Sonepat and Panipat near National Highway 1 to realise the extent of the problem posed by burning of agricultural stubble. And to understand why farmers do it.When we used manual labour for harvesting, the stubble was easier to deal with. We would just till the farm again and the stubble would be mixed into soil. Now that we have started using machines to harvest, 8 -10 inches of stalks are left behind and these are difficult to deal with. Getting manual labourers  mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh  is expensive, time consuming and difficult, so everyone does it by machine, said Kherati Lal, 65, a farmer in Haryanas Panchi Gujra village near Murthal.The easiest thing in such a situation, he says, is to set fire to his farms to clear the stubble. Except, this is banned by the government.We would put 2 litres of kerosene and set fire to the whole thing. End of story. Now we have to bring in machines to turn the soil and cut and bury the stubble. We have to water this and run a tractor over it thrice to make sure it decays properly. The government has started keeping a strict check on fires now, so we burn only the stalks that come out along with the rice crop. Its a small quantity, he said.But even small quantities being burnt on each farm make for an air pollution disaster.As per officials at the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), 60,000 acres of land in Punjab is under cultivation of paddy. In Haryana, paddy is cultivated on around 30,000 acres. This produces 32 million tonnes of paddy straw.According to the first source apportionment study of Delhis air pollution by IIT Kanpur, about 30 per cent of pollution in Delhi is because of biomass burning, which includes agricultural, leaf and garbage burning.Several studies since have confirmed this. A recent study by scientists at the National Environment Engineering Research Institute said that 60 per cent of Delhis particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is contributed by neighbouring states. Of this 60 per cent, half is contributed by Punjab and Haryana.Despite efforts to curb such fires, farms in Haryana and Punjab have been going up in flames for the last two weeks, according to NASAs fire mapper. The map also shows that Punjab is seeing more fires, especially near Amritsar, as compared to Haryana.The effect on air quality is already visible. According to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, the air quality has dipped since September 25  something that can partly be attributed to a dip in wind speed and partly to the beginning of the harvest season.An analysis of the air quality on the National Air Quality Index shows that this October is, on average, more polluted than the last. Between October 6 and October 20, at R K Puram station, the average air quality was poor during both years. But this year, the value was 261 as opposed to 257 last year, the data shows.Meanwhile, with the Supreme Court, the Delhi High Court and the National Green Tribunal banning all such agricultural fires, state governments have started feeling the heat.The Haryana government has already issued almost 700 challans and collected lakhs in fines for farm fires this year. The progress in Punjab has been slower, with some officials suggesting this could have something to do with the upcoming assembly elections.But leader of Opposition in Haryana assembly and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala has criticised the decision of the BJP government in Haryana to impose a fine on farmers, and demanded that they be reimbursed.Removal of stubble from fields is expensive. A farmer cannot afford to pay Rs 10,000 per acre from his pocket for this. In several countries, machines are available using which stubble can be cut, tied up and sent to factories for use. The Haryana government has three such machines lying defunct, he claimed.Ram Niwas Gautam, 60, a resident of Manana Village near Panipat, said, I have a 4-acre farm. A farmer cant afford to buy a machine to get rid of the waste and hiring manual labour is out of question as they are rarely available and charge a lot of money. Labour contractors charge aroundRs 20,000; where do we get that kind of money? Only the big farmers can afford it.According to experts, the governments need a mix of prosecution and incentives to deal with the problem. In Punjab, for example, farmers are selling the straw to waste-to-energy plants for power generation, and a small amount is being sold to mushroom farms to use as substrate.Farmers should be paid Rs 1,000 per acre under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana so they can shun the practice of burning paddy straw.

Brown Plant Hopper nymphs feeding on a paddy plant.Hot and dry weather raises the chances of whitefly attacks, as Punjabs farmers discovered for cotton last year. This year, it is humid and warm conditions, particularly in September, that has put paid to their hopes of a bumper paddy harvest. The villain: an innocuous-looking insect called the brown plant hopper (BPH).Read | After whitefly, brown plant hopper turns nemesis for Punjabs farmersUnlike most other pests, this one typically strikes very late, when the paddy crop is already 80-90 days old and in the final grain-filling stage. The female moths lay eggs from early-September that hatch within 10 days. The larvae emerging from them are the real baddies. These immature nymphs settle at the lower stem or culm of the paddy plant, from where they start sucking the sap. Since this sap rich in carbohydrates is transported through the phloem tissues to the grains that are still forming, it being sucked also impacts filling.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe resultant grains tend to be ill-filled, light-weight and chaffy. While it may appear that the farmer has harvested 20-21 quintals of basmati paddy per acre, actual yields would be only 15-16 quintals. The farmer will also get a lower price because there would be a higher percentage of broken rice produced during milling, explains A K Singh, head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) division of genetics.The entire lifecycle of the BPH insect  from the laying of eggs to the larvae becoming adult moths  is just 25-30 days, of which the most dangerous nymphal stage lasts 15-20 days. This time, the maximum nymphal population was noticed from September 25 at the grain-filling stage (when the milky starch material turns first into soft and then hard dough) about a week or 10 days before harvest. The sultry and cloudy weather was clearly favourable to the buildup, notes Singh.According to Sarjiwan Singh Manhas, research & development head of Syngenta South Asia, BPH infestation is often difficult to detect since the pest attacks the lower portions of the paddy stems. We tell farmers to go for prophylactic insecticide spraying. It should be done when they notice even a few hoppers in neighbouring fields in the early stages of the crop. The usual practice, instead, is to spray when the build-up has already happened and the plant would have grown to some three feet height, at which the required quantum of the chemical may not reach the bottom parts where the insect is present, he points out.The Switzerland-based (now Chinese-owned) Syngentas product Chess  the active ingredient molecule is pymetrozine  is seen as the most effective against BPH today. In our 200 demonstration plots and two learning centres attended by 10,000 farmers in Punjab and Haryana, we have shown that you can control the pest through timely and the right kind of spraying. The paddy grown in these sites did not suffer yield loss even this year when infestation levels were so high, claims Manhas.Pritam Singh Hanjra, a progressive farmer from Urlana Khurd village in Haryanas Panipat district, does not dispute the effectiveness of Chess, but is concerned about the price. It costs Rs 6,000 per kg and you need to spray 120 grams per acre. That works out to Rs 720, excluding the cost of spraying itself which is another Rs 200 per litre. Also, I dont know how long it will be effective. Earlier, we were using Applaud (buprofezin molecule of Dow Chemical), Actara (Syngentas thiamethoxam) and Confidor (Bayers imidacloprid), but the pest has developed resistance against all of these, he says.Moreover, it isnt just BPH. Paddy farmers are also spraying against other pests such as stem borer and neck blast. The most effective chemicals to control them now are Coragen (chlorantraniliprole) and Galileo (picoxystrobin) respectively, both belonging to DuPont. These again cost between Rs 700 to Rs 800 per acre each. As farmers, we have no choice but do everything to protect our crop, complains Hanjra.An alternative approach to spraying, which the IARI is presently working at, is to breed for resistance through introduction of genes sourced from both traditional landrace cultivars as well as wild relatives of paddy.The countrys premier publicly-funded farm research institute has transferred the Pi9 gene obtained from Oryza minuta (a wild relative of normal cultivated rice, which is Oryza sativa) to its popular Pusa Basmati-1 variety, in order to make the latter moderately resistant to neck blast and highly resistant to leaf blast fungus. Likewise, two genes  Xa21 from Oryza longistaminata (another wild relative) and xa13 from BJ1 (a traditional landrace)  have been incorporated into Pusa Basmati-1 to confer resistance to the deadly bacterial blight pathogen.For BPH control, too, IARI is looking at transferring the Bph 17 gene sourced from Rathu Heenati (a traditional Sri Lankan red rice cultivar) and the Bph 18 gene from Oryza australiensis (a wild relative) into its improved Pusa-1121 and Pusa Basmati-6 varieties.In all these cases, the transfer of the target genes from the resistant donor lines has been achieved through molecular breeding based on marker-assisted selection. We did this first in basmati varieties, because there is a huge export market for this rice and farmers cannot risk too much application of pesticides. Through molecular breeding, we are ensuring that only the particular genes of interest get introduced without compromising on the unique basmati grain traits, informs A K Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo) Another farmer sitting in front of his unloaded paddy at Jalandhars grain mandi. (Express photo)For Punjabs farmers, fortune always seems to smile on the other side. Last year, it was the whitefly sucking pest that ravaged their cotton crop. This time round, its the brown plant hopper (BPH) that has caused significant yield and price realisation losses for paddy grown in large swathes of the state. And there couldnt have been a worse time for the BPH (kala tela, in local parlance) to strike  barely a week or ten days before a bumper crop was ready for harvesting.Read: A surgical strike that farmers in Indias granary were least prepared forIn 2015, an estimated 1.36 lakh hectares (lh) out of the total 4.36 lh area sown to cotton in Punjab had suffered whitefly infestation. It led to farmers planting a mere 2.56 lh under the fibre crop this year. And ironically, the ones who did plant are celebrating today, as not only have there been no whitefly pest attacks, but even realisations are pretty good. Farmers have sold kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) of various Bt hybrids at Rs 4,800-5,300 per quintal this season, compared to last years Rs 3,900-4,700 rate range.Watch What Else Is Making NewsBaldev Singh, a farmer from Panniwala Mahla village of Abohar tehsil in Fazilka district, regrets having drastically slashed his cotton area from 32 acres to 3 acres this year. I did it after my crop in 8 acres was totally destroyed by whitefly. How on earth would I have known that there will be no pest attacks or prices are going to be better this time? he points out. Harpreet Singh from Lakhmirwala in Mansa districts Budhlada tehsil, on the other hand, is elated. He did not reduce his 15 acres area planted to cotton. His yields have also been 8 quintals/acre, as against last years average of 5 quintals.State officials have been quick to take credit for no whitefly devastation this year. We maintained close and constant vigil through 500 scouts and 50 field supervisors, who were appointed for the first time. Thanks to their regular alerts, we could save the crop in all the eight cotton-growing districts (Ferozepur, Fazilka, Faridkot, Muktsar, Moga, Barnala, Bathinda and Mansa) through timely pesticide sprays. This was even after whitefly incidence was detected initially in about 12,000 acres in Khuian Sarwar and Abohar blocks of Fazilka, informs Jasbir Singh Bains, director of agriculture, Punjab government.No such close and constant vigil from the entire official machinery was, however, observed for in paddy. Farmers in Punjab expanded the area under paddy this year to 30.10 lh, from 29.75 lh in 2015. The increase came entirely from parmal (non-basmati) varieties; basmati paddy acreage actually witnessed shrinkage from 7.63 lh to 4.96 lh.But despite this switch to a crop supposedly less prone to pest attacks or price risks, large paddy-growing areas in the state have reported BPH infestation. The farmers have these cases have either suffered lower yields or resorted to premature harvesting in order to limit crop damage. Devinder Singh of Khabe Dogran village in Tarn Taran district was able to harvest only 23-24 quintals of paddy per acre, as against his normal average of 30-32 quintals. Moreover, the kala tela attack forced him to go for early harvesting and sell his grain at Rs 1,350 per quintal, below the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,510 per quintal. The arhtiyas (commission agents) in the mandi told me that the MSP is only for paddy with maximum moisture content of 17 per cent, whereas my grain had more than that limit, he complains.Amarjit Singh, who has been the sarpanch of Chandke village in Gurdaspurs Batala teshil for the last 30 years, alleges that state procurement agencies have colluded with arhtiyas and rice millers/shellers to use high moisture content as a pretext to loot farmers this time. I was paid between Rs 1,430 and Rs 1,450 per quintal. They imposed a cut of Rs 60-80 against the MSP in the name of moisture content, adds this farmer whose extended family owns 100 acres, of which he alone cultivates 40 acres.In many parts of Punjab, farmers are said to be delivering paddy with moisture content going up to 22 per cent. Every one percentage point increase beyond the permitted 17 per cent moisture limit attracts a value cut of Rs 20/quintal. Not more than 15 per cent farmers have received the full MSP of Rs 1,510 per quintal this year. 85 per cent would have had to face a minimum cut of Rs 20/quintal. The government should have granted a one-time moisture limit relaxation of 21 per cent, keeping in view the totally unanticipated BPH attack at the fag end of the season, states Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, chairman, Punjab Mandi Board Most farmers The Indian Express spoke to agreed that procurement operations this time have been smooth overall. The government is aware that Assembly elections are due early next year and has ensured prompt lifting of our paddy in mandis. But they should have also kept strict vigil on the arhtiyas, sheller owners and government inspectors, who have taken advantage of kala tela to imposed arbitrary value cuts and deny farmers the MSP, asserts Himmat Singh of Kishangarh village in Jalandhar, who sold his 250 quintals of paddy at Rs 1,300/quintal when I should have got at least Rs 1,400.Jagmohan Singh Dakaunda, general secretary of a Bhartiya Kisan Union faction he himself heads, believes that the Punjab government should have taken up the issue of moisture relaxation with the Centre. Farmers are not at fault here. The high moisture content is only a result of their being forced to harvest a bit early. Haryana farmers, too, have experienced the same problem from kala tela this time, but the government there has made sure that their entire crop is purchased with a value cut not exceeding Rs 10-20/quintal, he claims.According to Gurdev Singh Deol, former head of the Punjab Agricultural Universitys department of entomology and now a consultant with the Tata Trust, high humidity levels during grain-filling stage are the most conducive to BPH pest infestation. They attack the stem of the paddy plants and suck the juice from it, which affects grain formation as well. A good spell of rains during September about 2-3 weeks before harvesting is helpful in clearing the pest. This time, we have unfortunately had high humidity, but very little rains in September, he notes.While kala tela has been a frequent visitor in the past decade, Bains admits that its incidence this year has been the highest since 2011-12. When farmers began to notice the sudden build-up, they panicked and prematurely harvested their crop even with high moisture content. In fact, both mandi arrivals of paddy as well as procurement by government agencies have so far been higher relative to last years corresponding levels. It is a different matter, though, that bulk of this grain would have fetched farmers less than the official MSP. To what extent they would attach the blame for that on the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance remains to be seen.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This year, even the North Indian community in Kerala has decided to steer clear of bursting crackers, plastic decorations and over-consumption of power, going in for a green Diwali ! Check out how.Mumbaikar Rekha Mahindra and her friends in Wayanad have taken a unanimous decision to avoid non-biodegradable accessories and use only recycled products to spice up their Diwali celebrations this year.""In the past, the rangoli was made with rice and pulses and was used to feed birds. So this year, we have bucked the trend of using artificial colours and returned to the old ways. It is also a good way of sharing food with small birds and ants during the festival,"" says Rekha, adding that she will be using natural flowers from her garden to give her rangoli a finishing touch.To decorate the house, they are using recycled materials instead of plastic accessories. ""Instead of candles and electric lights, we made diyas out of orange peels, coconut shells and wheat dough. And we are gifting indoor plants and kitchen herbs with cards made of recycled paper tied to them,"" Rekha explains.The group are also giving plastic gift wrappers and disposable plates a miss. ""The festival meal will be served in plantain leaves and the drinks in steel tumblers,"" she says.As the festival of lights usually sees a spike in electricity consumption, many in the State will be using natural diyas instead of electric lights. And those who have busy schedules are going for LED lights, which consume less power.Gujarati Rajani Sheth, who is settled in Kochi, says, ""I cannot imagine a Diwali without lights. For safety and ease, I was using electric lights all these years. But this year I will turn off the lights and light up diyas that are bio-degradable. Diwalis from now will also serve as 'save your electricity day' for my family.""Those who took pride in bursting the maximum number of vibrant crackers seem to have finally realised that all that expenditure is unnecessary. Bollywood actor Karan Khandelwal, who was born and brought up in Kozhikode, confesses that he and his friends have often wasted a lot of money over crackers.""This year we plan to donate all the money that we usually spend on crackers to orphanages and old-age homes. We were burning our hard-earned cash in the name of the festival, to satisfy our pride. Why not use it for charity and light up the lives of the marginalised?"" asks Karan.Many in the state have taken patriotism to another level by shunning Chinese products. ""In the previous years, I used to buy Chinese crackers that are more colourful but this year I am going solely for 'Made in India' products. I am a patriotic person and won't encourage the use of crackers from China whose policies are anti-Indian,"" says Kochi-based IT employee Karthik S, a Delhi native.Homemaker Sanjana Bhoi from Chhattisgarh, residing in Kochi, says that Diwali is the festival of lights and not of noise and pollution.Supporting her view, Bunty Singh, a Punjabi entrepreneur in Kochi, says, ""Bursting crackers is part of our tradition and we cannot skip it. However we are going for a noiseless one considering the animals in the neighbourhood. We will be using crackers like ground spinners and fountains that do not produce any sound,"" he says.Animal lover Monica Kothari says, ""Animals are sensitive and can hear noises four to seven times louder than humans. The noise of crackers is traumatic for dogs, cats and even birds. We are all for a cracker-free Diwali.""Many families of the Marwadi community in Kerala have decided to quit crackers to stay away from pollution. ""The pollution levels increase during Diwali celebrations with levels of harmful gases such as SO2 shooting up. This leads to a lot of respiratory ailments such as asthma. So, this year we have all decided to avoid crackers of all kinds,"" says Anju Rajesh Kajeriwal.A lot of people give their healthy diet a miss during Diwali. However, a few have decided to say no to the sugar loaded sweet boxes. ""Instead of milk cakes, peda and barfi, we are preparing sweets at home using millets, brown rice, rice flakes and dry fruits. Some of the sweets we make are healthier alternatives like fruit sandesh and carrot-beetroot halwa. Going a step ahead, we are replacing sugar with jaggery,"" says Priyanka Rajani, a Gujarati settled in Kannur."
58ff133a7be9e0413616236c,Fuelling air pollution through crop burning,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579215/fuelling-air-pollution-through-crop.html,2016-11-03,"Geeta Anand, November 04, 2016, International New York Times 23:14 ISTFarmers in Haryana, Punjab continue to burn leftover straw to make room for the winter wheat cropDesperate to reduce the pollution that has made New Delhis air quality among the worst in the world, the city has banned private cars for two-week periods and campaigned to reduce its ubiquitous fireworks during holiday celebrations.But one thing India has not seriously tried could make the most difference: curtailing the fires set to rice fields by hundreds of thousands of farmers in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana, where much of the nations wheat and rice is grown.Although environmental court  the National Green Tribunal - told the government last year to stop farmers from burning the straw left over from their rice harvests, Nasa satellite images in recent weeks have shown virtually no abatement. Farmers are continuing to burn most of the leftover straw  an estimated 32 million tonnes  to make room to plant their winter wheat crop.While fireworks associated with the Diwali holidays were blamed for a particularly bad smog problem in recent days, smoke from the crop fires blowing across the northern plains into New Delhi accounts for about one-quarter of the most dangerous air pollution in the winter months. In the growing metropolis of nearly 20 million people, pollution soared well above hazardous levels in the past week.Farmers 100 miles north in Punjab were well aware that they were contaminating the capitals air, they said in interviews, and were willing to consider other ways to dispose of the excess straw, but could not afford the options offered by the government. We are smart, and we have adopted new technology in the past, said Jaswant Singh, 53, as he watched a fire sweep across a 20-acre field near his village, Maulviwala, about 140 miles northwest of New Delhi.He planned to set his own 7 1/2-acre rice paddy ablaze in a couple of days, he said, because we cant afford to pay for the new technology ourselves. The air was thick with smoke that evening as I drove the two hours back to Punjabs capital, Chandigarh, after spending several hours with Singh and other farmers. The smoke made it hard to see, slowing traffic to a crawl, and breathing was difficult. My lungs hurt with each breath, even though I have never had respiratory problems.The smoke rising from the fires visible on farms on either side of the road would most likely reach Delhi in another week, depending on the winds strength and direction. Farmers began burning their fields two weeks ago, and levels of the smallest particles, called PM 2.5 and believed to pose the greatest health risk, were already soaring.On Monday night, levels of these particles in one Delhi neighbourhood reached 688 micrograms per cubic metre, more than 10 times the healthy limit set by the Union government, the Delhi Pollution Control Committees website said. In every neighbourhood where air quality data was available, particle levels were at least four times the limit, putting most areas in the hazardous range by Indian standards, which are more lenient than those set by the World Health Organisation.Asked how they could keep burning their crop remnants knowing they were causing health problems in New Delhi, Singh and other farmers said they were deeply concerned, especially because their families also suffered from the ill effects of the smoke. But still, they said, they could not afford to dispose of the material any other way.In theory, as is often the case in India, it should be relatively easy to stop the burning. The government is promoting a seeder that can be mounted on a tractor and used to plant wheat without the need to dispose of the straw left after the rice harvest.But Singh and others I spoke to said they could not afford the $1,900 cost of the most widely available brand, Happy Seeder. That is as much as some farmers earn from their entire rice harvest, they said. And they are reluctant to incur more debt, having already taken out loans for their daughters marriages and past equipment purchases.To encourage farmers to use the seeders, the government is offering to pay half the cost. Yet it has money for only a tiny fraction of the farmers, said Bhure Lal, chairman of the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, which was set up by the Supreme Court of India in 1998. Another alternative to crop burning, Lal and the farmers said, would be to create a market for the excess straw. So far, seven power plants that generate electricity from straw have been built in Punjab, and six more are on the drawing board.Lacking in willBut together, all 13 would consume only 1.5 million of the 20 million tonnes of straw produced in Punjab every year, or less than 10%, said Polash Mukerjee, a researcher at the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi research and advocacy group, who also assists Lals environmental authority. That is not enough to create a market for the straw, so it would still cost farmers far more to gather it and bring it to the plant than to burn it in their fields.If the government paid me for my straw, Id stop burning it today, said Shabaz Singh, 32, who grows 25 acres of rice and wheat in Maulviwala. The burning of crops was outlawed some time ago. But, like many laws in India, it is widely ignored.Certainly, none of the farmers feared being hit with fines that are supposed to range from $38 to $225. If the government wants to stop it, it can stop it, said Harjinder Singh, a father of two school-age children from Duttal village, who was the only farmer I met on my visit who said he did not intend to burn his crop. But the government lacks the will to do so.Singh and his brother, Narinder Singh, 38, were riding on a tractor pulling the Happy Seeder device when I stopped by their 12-acre farm last week. They used a government subsidy to cover half of the cost of the device, and paid about $950 themselves. It has worked well for them in the three years since they bought it, the brothers said. Not only did they avoid burning their straw, they said, but their yields of both wheat and rice went up, suggesting that leaving the straw on the ground instead of burning it was improving the fertility of the soil.Mukerjee said he believed many more farmers would adopt the Happy Seeder machines if the government made subsidies more widely available. But so far, neither the Central nor the state governments have committed the money, he and Lal said.The Punjab government told Lals environmental authority that providing all Punjab farmers with Happy Seeder machines would cost about $1.5 billion. In real terms, the government hasnt created any alternatives for the farmers, Mukerjee said."

So, he set the entire field on fire. He was also joined by the field owner, Mahinder Singh (name changed) as both wanted to clear the straw as soon as possible to prepare the field to sow wheat. Wheat sowing, which has already begun in the state, will continue till November 15.Singh owns 10 acres of land on which he sows wheat, paddy and potato every year. We have harvested paddy a couple of days back and now we are left with less than two weeks to complete wheat sowing for which fields are to be prepared and there is no alternative available with us to remove the stubble. To clear the field for sowing the next crop, we have to burn the straw, he insisted.Government is imposing fine on us but not giving any solution on how to manage the straw. We do not want to spoil the environment as we too live in the same polluted environment, which we create by burning straw, but have no option, said another farmer.Ploughing the stubble costs us around Rs 1,500 per acre which is not viable and the government should support us in clearing the field as the machinery required for stubble management is beyond the reach of more than 70-75 per cent farmers of Punjab, said another farmer, adding that machinery required to manage straw is costly and without government support, it is not possible for majority farmers to use it.Despite the ban on straw burning in the state, one could see a large number of burnt fields and fires every 100-200 metres in Kapur village. It was the same at over two dozen villages in Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts that The Indian Express visited on Thursday.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, which measures stubble burning through satellite images, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintained that it has increased this year.According to agriculture department sources, out of over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which Punjab produces annually, nearly half has already been burnt. Around 70-75 per cent (nearly 15 million) of the 20 million straw is burnt to clear land for the next crop.This year, 30.10 lakh hectares are under rice cultivation against 29.75 lakh hectares last year. Now, the burning fields of Punjab have resulted in a dense smog cover over Delhi, for the past couple of days. Incidentally, the National Green Tribunal has summoned Punjab for creating environment pollution not only in the state but up to Delhi thereby resulting in serious health issues in the national capital.PPCB has formed several teams along with officials in every district of the state this year to take action against those burning straw and even booked over 500 farmers. They are being fined Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 for setting on fire two acres, five acres and over five acres, respectively. In Jalandhar alone, around 90 farmers fields have been raided by these teams.Our officials have already raided over 500 farmer units, said PPCB Chairman Manpreet Singh Chatwal.Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, Director of Punjab Agriculture department, said paddy is sown over a huge area in Punjab for which we have to make a large number of machines available to every farmer in the state. Though big farmers can afford to purchase machines on their own, that cannot be expected of the small and marginal farmers. So, the Centre has to help farmers purchase the machines at nominal rates. In Punjab, not more than 10 per cent paddy stubble can be manged with the available machinery. We are also changing the mindset of farmers through Kisan Mela so that they can adopt the new technology, said Bains. Though awareness is increasing, we still have a long way to go, he added.Second generation ethanol production plant in SangrurIndian Oil Corporation, in association with the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab government, is also going to set up an ethanole plant by using surplus crop residue and other biomass as feedstock. Sangrur district has already been identified as one of the potential locations where surplus biomass is available. And this plant will reduce carbon emission produced by traditional burning of crop residue by farmers, informed Chatwal, adding that a 50-acre plot has already been identified to set up this plant, which will help to manage the straw as well as provide additional income to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(AP Photo/Saurabh Das) In this Friday, Nov. 4, 2016 photo, Bijender Singh walks through smoke caused by setting his field on fire to prepare it for its next yield at Chandhat, in the state of Haryana, south of New Delhi, India. Even as the Indian capital hit a new low on air pollution, many of the problems that turn Delhis air so toxic continue unabated, like farmers in bordering regions continuing to burn crop waste. (AP Photo/Saurabh Das)Even for a city considered one of the worlds most polluted, the Indian capital hit a new low this past week.Air so dirty you can taste and smell it; a gray haze that makes a gentle stroll a serious health hazard.According to one advocacy group, government data shows that the smog that enveloped New Delhi was the worst in the last 17 years. The concentration of PM2.5, tiny particulate pollution that can clog lungs, averaged close to 700 micrograms per cubic meter. Thats 12 times the government norm and a whopping 70 times the WHO standards.The Delhi winter, once a glorious time of clear _ crisp days that meant holidays and weekends spent picnicking in its many public parks _ is now a time of annual health woes.As millions struggle with hacking coughs and burning eyes, many schools across the city have either shut down or ended all outdoor activities. Doctors have asked people to stay indoors during the worst days.Yet many of the problems that turn Delhis air so toxic continue unabated. People still set off massive amounts of festival fireworks, piles of garbage burn all night and dust from the construction projects that dot the city is unchecked.And at the start of every winter, farmers in the states bordering the city begin burning straw from their rice paddy crop to clear the fields for planting wheat.Sources of pollution in Delhi and outside of Delhi have exponentially increased in the last couple of days, said Polash Mukerjee, a research associate with the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based research and lobbying organization.He said that wind direction is blowing toward Delhi from all directions, especially from Punjab and Haryana, where there are large incidences of crop fires that we are detecting even today.Over the last two years, the government has tried a slew of measures to control air pollution, including stricter emission norms for cars and a tax on diesel-fueled trucks that enter the city.New Delhi also has attempted to limit the number of cars during the winter months, when air quality is at its worst. Twice the city imposed a two-week period in which cars were allowed on the roads only on even or odd days, depending on the vehicles license plate number.Last month, the city launched a smartphone application called Change the Air, inviting residents to send photos and complaints about sources of pollution, from the burning of leaves and garbage in public parks to construction crews working without dust control measures.But despite announcing new measures, the city has struggled with enforcing them on a regular basis.One of the biggest struggles is crop burning in neighboring areas, where despite attempting to impose cash fines on farmers enforcement has been hard. For the farmers, its cheaper to burn rice paddy straw than hire people to carry it away.Pollution is also caused by diesel cars, factories and many other sources. Farmers only do this for one month of the year, Bijendar Singh, a farmer in neighboring Haryana state, said as he watched his paddy straw burn.It is a compulsion for farmers to do this. Because of this compulsion, we spread air pollution. As much as it harms the people sitting in Delhi, it harms us and our children even more, he said.Mukerjee, the research associate, said that the government hasnt worked out a strategy to help farmers dispose of their crop waste.Paddy straw that lies in your field today, as a farmer, it is absolutely worthless to me. I dont earn anything out of it. Why should I spend money collecting it? Mukherjee said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo)As politicians engage in the blame game over hazardous air pollution in Delhi, millions struggle with hacking coughs and burning eyes. With Delhi continues to be covered in a grey haze, latest predictions show that the situation in the next few days is going to be better, but only slightly.According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), government data shows that the smog that enveloped the city midweek was the worst in the last 17 years. The concentration of PM 2.5, tiny particulate pollution that can clog lungs, averaged close to 500 micrograms per cubic meter.In comparison to Delhi, Mumbai fares much better. With moderate air quality and particulate matter averaged close to 140 micrograms per cubic meter. The best air quality, according to statistics put out by SAFAR, was discovered in Pune. Particulate matter in the city was found out be below 100 micrograms per cubic meter.Even as doctors have asked people in Delhi to stay indoors during the worst days, many of the problems that turn Delhis air so toxic continue unabated. People still set off massive amounts of festival fireworks, piles of garbage burn all night and dust from the construction projects that dot the city is unchecked. And at the start of every winter, farmers in the states bordering the city begin burning straw from their rice paddy crop to clear the fields for planting wheat.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asked Centre to intervene to mitigate the alarming levels of smog. He said that vehicle restriction measures like odd-even will not be able to bring down smog as initial studies suggest that the large scale influx of pollutant-laden smoke from Punjab and Haryana has aggravated the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
58f0fa31a3d24b3489ce64dd,Linking food and nutrition security,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Linking-food-and-nutrition-security/article16217399.ece,2016-11-08,"The euphoria around the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, seems to have dwindled. As per the statements by Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Act was to be fully implemented across India by July 2016. As of now, only five States have fully executed it as per the provisions of the Central Act and the progress in other States has been tardy. The front runners are Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Act has been partially implemented in Bihar, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. Preliminary surveys undertaken in some of these States have revealed positive outcomes in terms of administrative reforms, significant increase in the number of households having ration cards, and improvement in the distribution and consumption of food through fair price shops. A few of them had already initiated reforming the distribution system much before the Act was presented in Parliament. The Act, if fully implemented, is likely to benefit 720 million people through availability of 5 kg per capita per month of subsidised foodgrains (rice, wheat and coarse cereals) at a much lower rate than that in the open market. This would ensure food security and enhance nutritional status.The Odisha studyThe two concepts are interlinked, but nutrition security has a much wider connotation than food security. It encompasses a biological approach, that is, adequate and safe intake of protein, energy, vitamin and minerals along with proper health and social environment. The nutritional aspect of the quantity of grain to be distributed to each person under the Public Distribution System (PDS) is somewhat less researched, though the Act has aimed at attaining this goal. Poor quality of food lacking essential micronutrients and no diet diversity, and unhygienic conditions of storage may come in the way. There are other promising features under the Act, such as free daily meals for children and maternity benefits, including cash for pregnant women, which can combat rampant undernutrition (calorie deficiency) and malnutrition (protein deficiency) across the country. These steps may perhaps complement the existing nutritional programmes such as mid-day meals and Integrated Child Development Services.We present results from a study in rural Odisha on the contribution of PDS towards households intake of foodgrains and the quantum of calorie and protein levels. A primary survey of 385 households was carried out during 2014-15 in three extremely poor districts viz. Koraput and Bolangir in the so-called KBK (most backward) region and Nayagarh in the non-KBK region. While KBK districts follow a universal PDS, non-KBK districts have a targeted one.There is high prevalence of undernutrition and malnutrition in the selected districts. The estimates, adjusted on the basis of age, sex and work as recommended by the nutrient requirements and dietary allowances of Indians drawn up by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition in 2010 reveal the undernourished population to be 50 per cent and the malnourished to be 43 per cent on an average for all the districts together. Calorie and protein deficiency is relatively higher (see graphic), nearly 68 per cent among the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households, known to be the poorest of poor. It is much higher in Koraput district at 72 per cent, way above the State average of 60 per cent.Rice is the key staple food in the surveyed areas and acts as a major source of energy intake. The monthly per capita consumption of rice is estimated to be 11.6 kg, of which 33.7 per cent is sourced from the PDS by all beneficiaries. Since AAY households have higher quota and accessibility under the PDS, the contribution is much more at 73.9 per cent. Cereals (wheat and rice) make up 70 per cent of the calorie intake and 66 per cent of the protein intake, though the magnitude varies across districts. More importantly, the contribution of PDS to energy intake among AAY households is double (60 per cent) that of other beneficiaries.Better accessibility to food and hence energy intake of poor people, especially those under AAY, has been made possible due to concerted efforts initiated by the government. Major reforms initiated from 2004-05 that are worth mentioning include abolition of private procurement and storage system, and a greater role for public agencies in controlling diversion of foodgrain from the godown to the millers; proper recording of procurement, storage and distribution of grains across the departments; and distribution of food through self-help groups and gram panchayats and its regular monitoring at the block and ward levels. While revealing their satisfaction with the PDS, the beneficiaries refuted the idea of having a cash transfer system in place of the existing in-kind transfers, primarily due to fear of price hike and inadequate infrastructure i.e. roads, banks, and long distance of market from the village. In fact, the beneficiaries proposed an increase in the coverage of commodities to pulses, onion and potato under the PDS in their respective areas.Replicating Odisha elsewhereThe efforts of the State government in ensuring food security should be replicated in States that are yet to fully implement the Act and reform their respective distribution systems. Many studies have emphasised on dietary diversification to ensure appropriate nutritional intake for large segments of the poor population. This may be an important step to be taken up in States where a revamped PDS is making ground, such as in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. Provision has been made under the NFSA to provide one additional coarse cereal viz. millet along with wheat and rice, which can further enhance the nutritional security of the poor households. Though wheat and rice contribute significantly to energy intake, the time has come to increase our focus on coarse cereals and pulses to improvise adequate intake of protein. Serious deliberations are required to make this possible through the PDS, which is going to cater to a sizeable population in the near future. As elicited above, the AAY households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them.As a prerequisite, it is imperative to hasten implementation of the NFSA across the country. States should be in a mission mode as availability of foodgrains may not be a problem this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has projected a record production of 270 million tonnes owing to good monsoon and an increase in acreage of foodgrains from 101 million hectares to 105 million hectares. The States must gear up to work on adequate logistics for digitisation of ration cards, computerisation of offtake and delivery of foodgrains, and effective monitoring of fair price shops, possibly through involvement of communities or other feasible ways. This will bring in greater transparency in the system and would go a long way towards raising the nutritional status of Indians.SeemaBathla is Professor and Bal Krishan Negi a Research Scholar at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana households have a greater access to PDS but the problem of undernourishment is more serious among them"
5909e87a7be9e033b96e959d,The arhar solution to pollution,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-pollution-arhar-pulses-demand-supply-gap-burning-of-paddy-4364802/,2016-11-09,"(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The inferno of environmental pollution that the nations capital and its surroundings have been witnessing has many causes, including weather conditions (thermal inversion) that facilitate the settling of particulate matter and other pollution, dust on the streets generated in part from construction activity, and vehicle-related emissions. Particularly critical is the burning of paddy after the kharif harvest which happens every year.Multiple causes will require a broad-based response but one of the permanent solutions to the pollution problem must address paddy burning. This is where pulses come in. In the Subramanian Committee report on pulses that was submitted last month to the ministers of finance, agriculture and consumer affairs, the possibilities created by a new variety of arhar (pigeon pea) developed by K.V. Prabhu and his colleagues at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) were discussed.This variety (Pusa Arhar16) has the potential to be grown in the paddy-growing regions of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and eventually in all of India. Its yield (about 2000 kg/hectare) will be significantly greater than those of the existing varieties and because its size will be uniform, it will be amenable to mechanical harvesting, an attractive feature for farmers in northern India who currently use this technology for paddy.Most important, arhar straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content, which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case of arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the left-over straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast. All this is difficult with left-over paddy stalks that cannot be easily salvaged or ploughed back (it is very firm). Farmers, therefore, choose the easiest option of simply burning it.But replacing paddy with pulses (in over half million hectares or more eventually) will have other social benefits. Our calculations suggest that pulses will use less fertiliser, less water, and fewer emissions, and in addition will replenish the soil with nitrogen unlike paddy which depletes the soil (see table). Together, pulses production would provide social benefits that we estimated at Rs 13,240 per hectare. On this basis, we had suggested an MSP for pulses over the medium term of close to Rs 9,000 per quintal so that it could become competitive with paddy. This would also preserve the incomes of farmers.But, of course, we had understated the social benefits of growing pulses. In the report, we had highlighted that there would be additional benefits: Specifically, the reduced environmental pollution because less paddy would be burnt. But we were unable to quantify these benefits for lack of data. This needs to be rectified immediately to make public and transparent the consequences of current policies.The broader policy lessons outlined in the pulses report have acquired new salience in the light of the pollution problem. These lessons bear emphasis.First, the future of sustainable agriculture must be based on encouraging agricultural science and research especially where Indias scientists have done the hard and creative work. Agricultural research institutions must be free from political interference, must be accorded autonomy, and must reward proven talent.Second, making the fruits of science commercially viable will require price incentives to be re-evaluated. In the case of pulses and paddy, a complicating factor that determines the relative incentives is risk. Because of guaranteed MSPs in paddy, it is less risky to grow than pulses. The Subramanian Committee estimated that pulses production was about six times riskier than paddy production. To compensate this, the required MSP for pulses would have to be about Rs1100 per ton greater than otherwise.Third, pricing in India must increasingly take account of externalities, positive and negative. In the case of agriculture, that means adapting the current methodology of setting MSPs used by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) that focuses exclusively on private costs and benefits. This tends to encourage socially wasteful production and specialisation such as excessive paddy production in north India with all the attendant consequences to which we are grim witnesses. As argued by Professor Ramesh Chand of Niti Aayog and recommended by the Subramanian Committee report, MSP setting must incorporate social costs and benefits.The burning of rice stalks affords an opportunity to implement a major shift in policy that can reduce pollution while also promoting indigenous research and science, incentivising pulses production, and rationalising pricing more broadly. Converting crises into opportunities is the hallmark of good public policy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A farmer in Punjab.Photo: AFPDelhi has registered its worst air quality in recent times. This has prompted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to call it a gas chamber. Pollution in different parts of the capital has touched hazardous levels with potentially serious health effects on the rich and poor alike, especially on children, the elderly and physically vulnerable people. Leaving aside the politics, the Central and Delhi governments should take urgent measures to prevent air pollution in order to stem the current impact as well as the future cost of healthcare.It is often pointed out that paddy stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab is a major reason for affecting air quality in Delhi during the onset of winter. Stubble burning is a common practice followed by farmers in these States to prepare the field for sowing of wheat in November as there is little time left between the harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat. Since this practice is followed every year despite some efforts by the State governments to prevent it, the problem of air quality getting affected in Delhi during October-November will recur. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and address the fundamental problems that force the farmers to burn the paddy straw on the field and not utilise it for any productive purpose. It may appear that paddy straw has no economic value for farmers in these States.The rice-wheat rotationHistorically, rice was not a major crop grown in Punjab and Haryana. In Punjab, rice accounted for only 7.6 per cent of the total cropped area during 1970-1973, which increased to a whopping 36 per cent during 2011-13. Similarly, in Haryana, paddy area increased from 5.6 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period. Extensive development of irrigation, assured price (minimum support price) and secured market (government procurement) have induced farmers to grow paddy and expand the area of cultivation considerably over time. Consequently, farmers in this traditionally wheat-growing belt started cultivating rice and wheat in rotation year after year. Various studies have shown that the rice-wheat rotation has put land and other resources under severe strain, resulting in depletion of soil nutrients, decline in water table, build-up of pests and diseases, and micronutrient deficiency. The State governments initiatives to push crop diversification as a strategy to overcome these problems have not convinced farmers to break the rice-wheat rotation. Crop diversification with vegetables and fruits hit a roadblock due to marketing problems.Being agriculturally progressive States, almost all farmers in Punjab and Haryana grow high-yield varieties of rice and wheat. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average rice yield was as high was four tonnes per hectare in Punjab and 3.2 tonnes in Haryana. These States have also experienced a high level of mechanisation of agricultural operations including harvesting. In fact, combine harvesters have been extensively used for harvesting of paddy and wheat due to non-availability of labour at the time of harvesting and increase in labour cost. A rough estimate based on the grain to straw ratio showed that Punjab with an average rice production of 11.1 million tonnes during 2011-13 generated about 16.6 million tonnes of paddy straw. Similarly, in Haryana, the average rice output was 1.3 lakh tonnes and it produced about 1.9 lakh tonnes of straw.Use of machines for harvesting has serious implications for crop residue management at the farm level. The combine harvester cuts the crop well above the ground, leaving behind substantial amount of stubble on the field. The machine leaves the residues in such a state that it is difficult to collect them manually. However, the farmers found ways to collect the wheat residue (bhusa) as it is a highly valuable animal feed and is even traded across districts. Given its economic use, the farmers run a chaff combine (reaper) after combine harvesting to collect straws, cut stubbles and make into chaff for feeding to animals directly or mixed with green fodder. So the burning of wheat residue is not necessary for the farmers because of the availability of technology and its higher economic value as dry fodder. Rice straw, however, is not used as fodder as it is found to be non-palatable to animals due to its high silica content. Because of its little economic value as animal feed and other general uses, farmers are prompted to burn it on the field instead of incurring a high cost on collecting it. In fact, field studies show that even though farmers are aware that the burning of straw is harmful to health, they do not have alternatives for utilising them effectively. Therefore, blaming only the farmers may not solve the problem of air pollution and there is a need to find sustainable technological solutions that can help farmers and simultaneously allow everyone to breathe clean air.Looking through the hazeBiomass provides safe and reliable energy. The available paddy straw can be effectively used for power generation, which will go a long way towards overcoming the problem of disposal of crop residues and power deficit in the region. According to data from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Punjab and Haryana have not made much progress in creating biomass-based power generation plants as compared to States such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Thus, there is great potential for making investments in paddy straw-based power plants which can help avoid stubble burning to a large extent and also create employment opportunities.Incorporation of crop residues in the soil can improve soil moisture and help activate the growth of soil microorganisms for better plant growth. However, suitable machinery for collection, chopping and in situ incorporation of straw is required. Further, initiatives can also be made to convert the removed residues into enriched organic manure through composting.Presently, a limited quantity of paddy straw is used for cardboard making and in packing industries and paper mills. However, new opportunities for industrial use  such as extraction of yeast protein  can be explored through scientific research.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality. Use of such dual-purpose rice varieties will help to maintain food security, farm income and improve environmental sustainability.Elumalai Kannan is Associate Professor at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality"

Only Delhi, naturally for the city most affected, has reacted with some degree of urgency.A severe pollution level, as defined by NGT, meant a PM2.5 level of 251 microgram/cubic metre and PM10 level of 431 microgram/cubic metre (the standard safe levels for these categories are 60 and 100, respectively). When these levels reached 300 and 500 respectively, an 'environmental emergency' was in the offing. In such conditions, NGT said on November 10, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan were to consider measures such as curbing crop stubble burning, raining water from the air to sink polluting particles, suspending construction and demolition activities and ordering cessation of carbon producing activities like brick making and thermal energy generationWith crop burning a major factor, NGT had ordered states to provide alternatives to the incineration of the post-harvest rice plant stalks. The two states most liable for this, Punjab and Haryana, reported some action. In both the states, the governments have provided funds to equip farmers with happy seeders, or devices that can be used to plant wheat without the need for the field to be cleared of the paddy stubble. In Punjab, the government distributed 280 happy seeders, while Haryana has promised farmers a 50% subsidy for the purchase of these implements.In accordance with the previous NGT directions, the agriculture department in Punjab has prepared plans to provide farmers with straw management equipment costing Rs 1,602 crore and has approached the centre for funds. Haryana has similarly decided to install straw balers in each block there next year.To stop the burning of field residue, Haryana booked 1,600 farmers for violating the ban and recovered Rs 16 lakh from them as fine in the past 20 days. Delhi too has clamped down on the open burning of leaves and waste, with violators coughing up Rs 63.7 lakh as fines till last week. In addition, the municipal corporations have pulled up other offenders, among them 476 in South Delhi alone.The government in Rajasthan ordered the temporary closure of stone crushing units and brick kilns, while remaining alert to the burning of agriculture residue, garbage and dry leaves. Sanitation workers have been directed to clean the streets only at night, and all construction activities are to be carried out with proper dust management systems in place.Delhi has temporarily closed the Badarpur thermal power plant and stalled construction and demolition activities for 10 days. A committee, which included the chief secretary and environment secretary, will discuss the issue of water spraying with the centre. An official said, ""Since Pawan Hans helicopters do not have the desired capacity, we approached the centre about harnessing Indian Air Force choppers. But the union environment and forests ministry told us it could not help us. Meanwhile, PWD is spraying water along major roads through hose pipes.""Like Rajasthan, Haryana too has stopped stone crushers and suspended brick kiln work for a few days. S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board , said the state was amenable to water sprinkling too. ""In urgent circumstances, we may follow this measure,"" Narayanan said.Directed to start vacuum cleaning of roads in Delhi, PWD had expected tenders for mechanical sweepers to be decided by November 10, but no one put in a bid, mainly due to the uncertainty caused by the demonetisation of high-value currency notes. The tendering process has been extended for some time. The transport department has deregistered 1.91 lakh diesel vehicles, deemed to over 15 years old and polluting, and officials said the list of such vehicles were sent to the traffic police last Friday, with instructions to impound them immediately.Members of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board , which met on November 15, admit that compliance of NGT orders would be tough given the state's geographical area. A senior official said that coordinating with the various government departments concerned would take time. However, the state is indeed thinking of means to reduce carbon pollution, including contemplating asking industries to use high-end boilers and process heaters.The UP government is willing to comply with the National Green Tribunal's orders to control air pollution, senior government officials in Lucknow said. SC Yadav, member, UP Pollution Control Board , said that the state sub-committee on the matter would discuss the draft plan, methodology and procedure that UP would follow to control air pollution on November 24.A meeting of the central monitoring committee has been summoned in New Delhi on November 17, where the states will further discuss NGT's directives."

If his gambit comes through, she would be the first person of Indian origin to be a cabinet principal. It will continue the more recent tradition of women in that position. Three of the last five people to head the state department were women (Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton).Nikki Haley, 44, was scheduled to meet the president-elect at Trump Towers late Thursday, his transition team confirmed after reports that she was in the running for the top job at Foggy Bottom. Although Haley is among several people Trump is meeting during the day, the rest of the line-up, foreign policy patriarch Henry Kissinger, retired General Jack Keane, and Admiral Mike Rogers among them, appear more like an advisory council being tapped for ideas. In a side lacking in bench strength, Haley appears to be the interviewee.While several other more prominent names have been making the rounds for the Secretary of State post - Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton among them - choosing Haley may be the first sign that Trump will not necessarily appease the slavering mobs of white conservative insurgents who fueled his march to the White House . Picking a female of foreign-origin -- although she was born in Bamberg, South Carolina -- for the key post will send a strong and reassuring message to the rest of the world that his administration is not going to be overrun by racists and xenophobes.For that to happen, Trump will have to navigate a Haley nomination past the white insurrection that made anyone of foreign-origin subject to a suspicious inquisition during the campaign, the treatment of Huma Abedin being an extreme example.Haley though is in a different league - and from a different political dispensation - having won the governorship of a southern state when she was only 38, and winning a second term four years later. In already breaking barriers, she also became the first female governor of South Carolina, besides being its first non-Caucasian and first Asian-American governor.Haley was briefly in the running to be on Trump's vice-presidential ticket after she disdained him during the primaries where she backed Marco Rubio. After criticizing Trump's stand on several issues, and calling him an ''angry man,'' for his vituperative campaign, she backed him with some reservation once he clinched the nomination.Republican strategists who favored her on a veep ticket called her an ''optimistic, sunshine consevative in the Reagan tradition,'' who would help counter the impression of the GOP as a party of grouchy, old, white, rich men. A similar argument can be made for her Foggy Bottom nomination, although arch conservatives and white supremacists in the party will cast aspersions on her ethnic and religious origins, something Haley has not cared to hide.Although she identifies herself as a Christian now, she has not disowned the Sikh religion she was born into and attends gurdwara services even now. She and her husband Michael Haley were married in both Sikh and Methodist ceremonies.Haley visited India as South Carolina governor in November 2014 to promote the state's business interests, and expectedly spend time in her ancestral Punjab, visiting the Golden Temple."

Archive photo The court suggested that the government issue an advisory regarding high air pollution levels and its dangers. Archive photoTWO DAYS before the Delhi Half Marathon, the High Court on Friday suggested that the Delhi government issue an advisory regarding the high air pollution levels and its dangers to the public.You should warn everyone that pollution levels are high. Anyone with respiratory or cardiac problems may collapse because of exhaustion. You should not be running in this (marathon), said a bench of Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Justice Jayant Nath. The bench added, If someone can run in Delhi, they can run anywhere.The observation came after the court noted that on November 17, the Air Quality Index had shown that PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels were approximately four times more than the prescribed safe standard.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe court also directed the Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan governments to phase out diesel-run taxis and introduce CNG taxis in the NCR. The All India Taxi Permits granted by these states for taxis to ply inter-state should be streamlined, said the bench. It was informed that of the 1.9 lakh taxis in Delhi, 80,000 run on diesel, while 35,000 inter-state permit cabs violate the 2001 Supreme Court order  which states that all commercial vehicles in Delhi must run on CNG.Why cant Punjab, Haryana and UP stop giving permits to diesel-run cabs? Their polluting vehicles are also coming to Delhi, observed the bench. The bench added that ban on diesel taxis could be extended to inter-state buses as well.What are you going to do to prevent the burning of paddy straw, and what is your plan of action for All India Permit taxis to move towards CNG? asked the court.Refusing to accept the argument that CNG pumps are not available in the other states, the bench has asked for a clear-cut plan with timelines for introducing CNG stations and phasing out diesel-run taxis from the four NCR states within three weeks.On the issue of crop stubble burning in Punjab, the bench once again pulled up the state government for not taking steps to stop the practice. Punjab alone generates 17 million tonnes of rice paddy straw every year, of which only a small percentage is used by cardboard and paper factories. More than 13 million tonnes is being burned. Do we know how much pollution that causes? asked the bench. The court has also asked the Central Pollution Control Board to conduct a study on the amount of pollutants released from the burning of crop residue and submit a report.With the recent spike in pollution due to lighting of firecrackers on Diwali, the court suggested that the government could consider giving fewer firecracker licences and designate certain areas for fireworks display.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(source: AP) On the inaugural day of the CII Agrotech  a biennial event  experts also elaborated on the options available with farmers apart from stubble burning. (source: AP)Management of paddy stubble was among the much discussed topics on Sunday, the first day of CII Agrotech 2016. Experts from across the country and beyond emphasised that farmers should not be burning paddy stubble as it causes serious problems. On the inaugural day of the CII Agrotech  a biennial event  experts also elaborated on the options available with farmers apart from stubble burning. The theme of Sundays session was Challenges and Solutions for Comprehensive Straw Management.Dr Harminder Singh Sidhu, Senior Research Engineer, Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA), Ludhiana, said, The rice residue management can never be done in isolation. It has to be done in consonance with the principles of conservation management. The key criterion has to be no additional cost on the farmer.Head of Department for Agriculture and Bio-Energy, Federal Association of German Training Centres for Agricultural Engineering, Nienburg, Germany, Ulrich Lossie, said, The size of the stubble left after cutting must not be more than 10 cm and machines applied must be used properly for this to happen. Germany is using Strip Till, where animal excreta is used to manage the residue. As a rule, we need a chain of methods to manage straw and farmers education also plays a vital role.B S Dhillon, Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University, said, Earlier, people used to make ropes from the stubble but now 75 per cent of the stubble is burnt which is leading to serious problems. He added that a method titled, In-Situ on surface degradation, which involves spray application of a specific bacteria was under research.A number of farmers could be seen making queries at various stalls put up at Parade Ground in Sector 17 where various agriculture-related companies have displayed their products and technologies. A few of the companies had also put up stalls educating farmers on how to produce power from paddy stubble. One such company had already set up a first such plant in Punjabs Fazilka district where power is being produced by burning paddy stubble.We received more than 150 queries on Day One. Farmers are approaching us to inquire about how they can sell the stubble to us so that they do not have to burn it, said SP Yadav, representative of one of the companies taking part in Agrotech.Yadav told Indian Express that they were buying stubble from the farmers at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg and generating power. Stating that the residue of stubble is also being used as an organic fertiliser, he said they would soon set up similar plants in Haryana and other parts of Punjab.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58e4d358a3d24b281b102aac,China agrees to import rice from 17 mills in India,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/China-agrees-to-import-rice-from-17-mills-in-India/article16684600.ece,2016-11-23,"In a major breakthrough that New Delhi had been waiting for, China has agreed to import rice, non-basmati and basmati varieties, from 17 registered mills in India, following efforts to ensure market access for Indian products in that country.India had repeatedly sought market access for items including non-basmati rice, pharmaceuticals and many fruits and vegetables among others, citing the countrys widening goods trade deficit with China. Indias goods trade deficit with China has ballooned from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16.Beetle fearChina is the worlds largest rice importer. However, Beijing had so far not granted market access to Indias non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its apprehensions included the possibility of the Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) pest getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.Official sources said after numerous requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials visited India in September to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. To export to nations including China, it is mandatory that Indian rice exporters are registered with NPPO, the Indian government agency for inspecting the mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO assisted its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection for pest-risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian Commerce Ministry was also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.They said the Indian embassy in Beijing informed the Commerce Ministry that Chinese authorities, last week, cleared 17 of these 19 mills for rice exports to China. The Commerce Ministry has forwarded the list to APEDA and asked it to inform rice exporters to soon find customers in China."
58f503027be9e018510a18b7,An astute and diplomatic chooser,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161202/jsp/opinion/story_122409.jsp,2016-12-02,"Robert Gates, the former American secretary of defence, with the author CHOICES: INSIDE THE MAKING OF INDIA'S FOREIGN POLICY By Shivshankar Menon, Penguin, Rs 599 In his story of ""the making of India's foreign policy"", Shivshankar Menon presents a ""practioner's view, not a theorist's"". He focuses on five specific diplomatic issues from India's recent history with which he was directly involved as a government official. Being a player in the apex echelon of State machinery, Menon needs to weigh seriously each and every word. 'Choice' is the crux of governance, and foreign policy decisions of every government revolve around multiple 'choices' wherefrom to choose. The border dispute with China took an enormously tortuous course that to this day remains unresolved, initiatives and experiments with several choices notwithstanding. For both China and India, there is still 'a prisoner of the past' scenario pertaining to territorial adjustment in which leaders of both sides may be flexible only at the peril of losing their power and position owing to domestic compulsions. After all, it was apparent that there were serious differences between China and India about the line of actual control in several areas. Nevertheless, it was the practical prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, whose Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Sino-Indian LAC reduced the tension that had persisted since the 1962 war. The agreement also led the two competing Asian nations to renounce the use of force in their settlement of the issue. Why did China agree to Rao's proposal of 'peace and tranquility'? Menon's take is that three pressing issues made Beijing's response to India positive: the Tiananmen Square massacre of its own people in 1989, the demise in 1991 of the mighty Soviet Union and the possibility of the United States of America targeting China to go the way of the USSR. The 1993 agreement seems to have succeeded in creating ""one of the most peaceful"" borders in India, the occasional pinpricks from the People's Liberation Army and the recent advent of an ""assertive Chinese policy"" notwithstanding. Trade, technology and tourism have taken precedence. Border conflicts can wait! China aside, the US was India's ""natural ally"" felt Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. His successor, Manmohan Singh, enacted the unprecedented Indo-US civil nuclear deal in 2005, giving shape to his predecessor's words and ending the 30-year US-led international nuclear and technology sanctions on New Delhi. There were hurdles galore, both internal and external, as politics reigned supreme. There emerged sharply divided opinion in Singh's team even on the eve of the announcement of the accords in his suite at Blair House, the official guest house of the US president. However, Manmohan Singh, with his ""steely resolve"", pulled it through. India did it. ""While unspoken by both partners"", Menon explains, ""China's rise was a factor that had created contiguous interests for both India and the United States."" At the end, though, a foreign policy issue had shaken the government of India in Parliament, as the domestic politics of a no-confidence motion had to be overcome. Opponents may still suggest that this apparent 'issue' is not an isolated one, but a question of the overall self-interest of the State and the future of the country. This dilemma is narrated in the book: ""On September 25, 2008, President Bush hosted a small private dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh"" (incidentally September 26 was Singh's birthday) ""in the White House for about ten persons, when the 123 Agreement was awaiting approval by the U.S. Senate. Secretary of State [Condoleeza] Rice leaned over and asked Singh when India would be ordering reactors from Westinghouse. Bush cut her off immediately and said that this was not about reactor sales but about much bigger things. Singh did not have to reply."" The importance of this anecdote stands stark when seen in the light of Menon's assessment of US policy towards India: ""to expect the U.S. government to behave differently would be unreasonable, in my estimation, as it has to follow its own calculus of U.S. interests rather than satisfy Indian desires."" True. No doubt. But then the same logic applies to India's calculus too, and in retrospect it is clear that ""The Civil Nuclear Initiative removed the detritus of the past from the bilateral relationship, opening the way for the transfer of dual-use technology and enhanced cooperation on defense."" In the South Asian context, the brutal confession that ""India-Pakistan relations are one of the few major failures of Indian foreign policy"" could, however, lead to divided opinion. Why? Because in the words of the author himself: ""Pakistan has consistently used terrorists and infiltrators against India since 1947... sent 'tribal raiders' to try to take Kashmir in 1947, infiltrators into Jammu and Kashmir in 1965, soldiers posing as mujahideen into Kargil in 1999 to occupy the heights, Khalistani terrorists into the Indian Punjab in 1980s, and the LeT and others into Jammu and Kashmir right through this period."" As if the 20th century were not enough, the ultimate happening was the 26/11 Mumbai attack and ""the incompetence that India's police and security agencies displayed in the glare of the world's television lights for full three days"". A 10-man Pakistan-based terror group massacred scores of innocent people. How can India tackle the cross-border menace from Pakistan, notwithstanding that it does not pose an ""existential threat""? Through ""dialogue"". Why? Because ""an Indian policymaker must deal with several Pakistans-with civil society, the Pakistani business community, civilian politicians, the army and the ISI, and the religious right (which extends from political parties to jihadi tanzeems)."" Not all of them share similar attitudes towards India! Menon's view is sure to be controversial. Nevertheless, a central problem emanates from failure of the United Nation's proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism to define a terrorist. On the southern front, these candid confessional words too are unlikely to be well received in certain quarters: ""It is hard to see the Indian intervention in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s as anything but an inexorable tragedy. India had very few choices, and no good ones, in 1987."" But Menon's detractors should ask themselves a few questions: how did India get from the ""non-interference"" of Panchsheel to intervention in Sri Lanka? Had India changed? If so, why? Did it help, or harm, national interest? At the end, the sheer force of the Sri Lankan State eliminated a terror outfit, though not the ideas it espoused. Regarding Menon's fifth and final foreign policy issue, the ""no first use"" doctrine regarding nuclear weapons, it appears, he writes, ""fundamentally realistic and sober"" based on a security calculus that is unique to India. India's decisions certainly can be both ""strategically bold"" and ""tactically cautious"". As many of the issues discussed in Choices have not been resolved, surely the last word is yet to be written. Nevertheless, the insight and analysis displayed by Menon are superb. Whether one agrees with the contents of his book matters little. It is a must for friends and foes alike."

58e538837be9e05a951f5da9,Here's why your roti is acting pricey,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161210/jsp/jharkhand/story_123873.jsp,2016-12-10,"Prices of staple food like wheat flour and rice have gone up in Jamshedpur. Picture by Animesh Sengupta Jamshedpur, Dec. 9: Noticed or unnoticed, the demon of demonetisation is now creeping into your kitchen. Prices of staple food, which are normally stable, have climbed in the steel city over the past week with dreams of a cashless economy miles away from wholesome reality. The retail rate of rice has marginally increased by 3 to 5 per cent, but that of wheat products such as atta (flour), maida (refined and bleached flour) and suji (semolina) have leaped by 10 per cent. If a 5kg packet of branded wheat flour was available at Rs 155 even last month, the same is being sold at no less than Rs 170. Refined wheat flour, bought at Rs 27 a kilo a week ago, is now available for Rs 30. Similarly, semolina flaunts a price tag of Rs 32 a kg instead of the earlier Rs 30. As if in consolation, the price of rice has gone up by Re 1 to Rs 1.50 per kg, depending on quality and brand. Govind Agrawal, a Bistupur grocer, conceded that he was charging his customers more. ""Our stocks come from wholesalers in Jugsalai. They have jacked up food grain prices, leaving us no choice but to shift the burden on customers partially,"" he said. Another grocer in Bistupur, on the condition of anonymity, said the impact of demonetisation on the wholesale market could not be ruled out. ""As wholesale traders are buying rice, wheat and wheat products at higher prices, we retailers have to follow suit,"" he added. Customer Marshal Tigga said he had barely seen such a sharp rise in flour rates in his life. ""If there is a Rs 3 per kilo increase in maida price, a family of four that needs at least 5kg a month has to fork out Rs 15 extra. It disturbs your monthly kitchen budget. More so when the grocer won't tell you why he is charging more for staple food when there is no agricultural setback,"" said the Sonari resident. Tigga added that he could see no other reason behind the hike in prices except for demonetisation, which inevitably means that the rates wouldn't come down in the near future. Nirmal Sharma, a resident of Sakchi and an employee of a private insurance company, stressed that the increased food prices were definitely the result of demonetisation. ""Apart from rice and wheat, the price of pasteurised milk (Sudha Dairy) has gone up by Rs 2 per litre, prompting the roadside chaiwala to demand an extra buck for every cup of tea. Members of the working class, many of whom eat lunch at small eateries, are also paying more for the humble chapatti,"" Sharma rued. Suresh Sonthalia, president of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry, admitted the problem. ""As (wholesale) traders are buying wheat at a higher price from suppliers in Bihar and Punjab, the cost of the flour and other wheat products has gone up considerably. But, we have to probe if the hike in prices is directly linked to demonetisation,"" he said."

The arbitrator has suggested a recovery of nearly Rs 15 crore.The suggestion has come four days after police raided Ghubaya College of Engineering and Technology. Before the raid, there was talk that Ghubaya might leave the SAD and join the Congress . However, the MP had rubbished the speculations as a rumour spread by his rivals.In 2012, Punsup had issued 1.74 lakh sacks of paddy weighing 61,000 quintals for custom milling. Though 2,959.40 quintals of rice was delivered to the Food Corporation of India in the account of Punsup, the remaining 56,639.75 quintals of rice were not delivered.Punsup's Ferozepur district manager, Manprit Singh , said if police did not act against the mill, they would take the legal route to recover the amount of missing paddy from the mill. Refuting the charges, Ghubaya said his wife has nothing to do with the embezzlement of the stocks, as she had withdrawn her share well before the detection of shortage. He claimed that all relevant documents had been submitted to Punsup."

Petitioners said that the Punjab education development board has appointed one NGO  Gram Vikas Educational Society, Ferozepur, headed by rice mill owner Devinderpal Dhawan  as a private partner for running administration of the Adarsh school under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode.The petition said that Dhawan and the rice mill owned by him were facing two FIRs and at least 26 cases for bounced cheques under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1885. The FIRs include one filed by Punjab Markfed also under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC for misappropriation of paddy worth Rs 3.21 crore. The other FIR is by a businessman of Tarn Taran for cheating.The 26 cases for cheque bounce include the one filed by state agency Pungrain for the dishonouring of its cheque for Rs 1 crore. All the cases for dishonour of cheques were pending in various courts at Tarn Taran.According to the petitioners, under the guidelines issued by the board, the private partner is responsible for running administration of Adarsh Schol. Such private partner is reimbursed 70% of the operative expenses incurred by it for running the administration of the Adarsh School, which includes salaries of staff as well.The petitioners have contended that deployment of such NGO, of which Dhawan is the chairperson, as a private partner of the Adarsh School, is therefore, totally against interest of the school as well as education of children. Petitioners have sought directions for removal Dhawan from the assignment given as private partner of the school.After hearing the petition, Justice Rameshwar Malik issued a notice to the state government, Punjab education development board, the NGO, and its chairperson Dhawan seeking their replies by March 28. Justice Malik also ordered to stay the operation of the order vide which the board had directed the NGO to take over the charge of the school from its principal."

BPL cardholders will be given coupons, which they may redeem at provision stores for foodgrain.The objective of the new exercise is to give the beneficiary the freedom of choice while buying foodgrain, curb pilferage and also give impetus to locally grown foodgrain, claimed Khader.The coupons may be collected from franchise centres. For a five-member family card, the cardholder will have the option of purchasing rations worth anywhere between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000. However, the coupon facility will be optional as the existing system of supplying subsidised foodgrain through ration shops will continue.Now, 5 kg of rice is issued to an individual beneficiary. One kg of rice costs Rs 27. A family also gets 1 kg of sugar (at Rs 20 a kg). In the open market, the prices are much higher.Undoing Anna Bhagya?Khader said the department requires 25 lakh metric tonne of rice to disburse under the Anna Bhagya scheme. However, only 10% of rice is procured from the state farmers, while the rest is imported from other states like Punjab and Haryana. Not only are there lots of complaints about the quality of rice, beneficiaries are also demanding that other grains like jowar be provided. It has been decided to issue coupons instead of giving cash to prevent misuse, he added.Once the purchase is made, the store owner will verify it with the department, after which money will be transferred through the beneficiarys bank account to the bank account of the store owner.Online facilityAn online facility for obtaining Above Poverty Line ration cards will also be launched next month. An online applicant who furnishes Aadhaar details will get an APL card within 15 days through Speed Post. A variety of problems associated with issue of ration cards over the last 15 years is sought to be resolved through this method.The online APL card may be printed and used for purchase of foodgrain. The printout, however, will not serve as ID proof. Only the actual card, which will be sent through speed post, may be used as proof of identity.DH News Service"

We were expecting some help from the government. However, instead of coming up with a solution, the CM chose to pass the buck on Centre and talked about high moisture content. Even if there is no moisture, our produces cannot be procured unless we get revenue rent receipt,"" said Yashwant Singh, a farmer. The Centre has fixed minimum 17% moisture content in paddy.Blaming the Centre for fixing moisture content, the CM said the state government was exploring the possibility of introducing dryer system at procurement centres to bring down moisture content in paddy to the required level.As part of his 'Nishchay Yatra', the CM visited Muradabad Primary Agriculture Credit Society (PACS) on the outskirts of Sasaram on Thursday and inspected overnight commissioned dryer at the rice mill run by the PACS. He said the state government would promote dryer system to avoid delay in paddy procurement at minimum support price.""A proposal in this regard has been sent to the Centre. The state government has no role in fixing the minimum level of moisture,"" the CM said, adding that as a pilot project, some rice mills equipped with dryer system would be attached with the PACS.Farmers and rice millers, however, termed the proposal ""impractical"". Rice millers of Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and other states, who have been camping here for last one month, said the process of bringing down the moisture level through dryer system is very expensive and time taking."

Rethinavelu has said that the Department of Science and Industrial Research, Government of India, has recognised the TNFMY as a scientific and industrial research organisation.Speaking to The Hindu on Sunday, he said the recognition would enable the TNFMY, a special purpose vehicle established under PPP model, to undertake research works for identifying several innovative and nutritious value-added products.The TNFMY, was set up at Sikkandarchavadi over a 30-acre site at an investment of Rs. 40 crore, with the support of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.Mr. Rethinavelu said the recognition would go a long way in helping not only agro producers, but also those engaged in food processing, traders and exporters. The all-under-one-roof facility had a scientifically built warehouse, cold storage unit, individual marketing-cum-storage depots in the southern districts.The research and development lab, he said, would help in analysing the quality of products manufactured or dealt with by food processors and traders. Recently, a research in causes for variation in milling breakage in Basmati rice grown in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was undertaken here. The inference arrived at was to carry out standardised parboiling techniques, which would reduce breakage of rice. Today, many rice mills, which processed Basmati rice, had converted the suggestion into action, he added.Mr. Rethinavelu said the TNFMY had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology, Thanjavur, for carrying out research works. Students and research scholars working in the field of food processing and other allied areas might use the research and development facility.Currently, they were studying the non-chemical jaggery on a commercial level adoption to position it in the global market. Yet another area of research was paddy analysis  physical quality analysis, cooking analysis and sensory evaluation  to bridge the gap between the farmers and millers. This would enable the farmers to get a remunerative price for their crop, he said."

It is lunchtime at langar hall at Baal Leela Gurdwara in Patna City and over 500 people are being served meal in one go. Another 2,000 people are being served meal at the tent city at Kangan Ghat, just one-km north of Baal Leela.The food is being served by over 3,000 sewadaars (devotees serving free meals), who have come from Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra and other states for Prakashotsava It takes 30-45 minutes to serve the delicious meal, including ghee rotis, rice, daal, sarson ka saag, two vegetable dishes (including paneer), kadhi and kheer to one set of people.Langars, the grand Sikh feast for anyone and everyone coming for Prakashotsava has started round the clock at Baal Leela and Kangan Ghat. Organisers have claimed that so far around 30,000 people are being served the mouth-watering free meals everyday, but the figures are expected to reach around five lakh once langars at all locations are held in full swing from January 1.It would be in fact a record of sorts as the number of people served free meals at the langar at Amritsar's Sri Harmandir Sahib, better known as the Golden Temple , is around 1 lakh daily. While the langar at Baal Leela serves food round the year, the one at Kangan Ghat has been made operational from December 23. Besides, langars are expected to commence at five more locations in the state capital this week.The preparation for the grand feast is equally striking. Large vats are used to prepare 40kg rice and 20kg of sabzi in one go. Long rods are used to stir bubbling vats of dal. Rotis are also prepared almost continuously and it is not served on the plate but the devotee has to raise his hand on which it is served. Hundreds of women can be seen on one side of the langar hall cutting vegetables.Most of the sewadaars are small scale workers, like masons and tillers among others, who are working voluntarily in a bid to seek blessing from Guru Gobind Singh.Satnam Singh, a sewadaar from Anandpur Saheb in Punjab's Rupnagar district said snacks and teas are being served at the langars from 3am to 9am. ""We arrived here around 10 days ago on trucks in three groups of 500 people. It took three days for us to reach here from Amritsar,' said Satnam.Hundreds of youngsters like Satnam serve the free meals to people at the langar with high level of enthusiasm. One has to put a headgear or any piece of cloth on his or her head and the utensils are handed to them at the entrance. People sit next to each other on the ground and the energetic youngsters ladle the food items into each plate without any sort of discrimination, including that based on religion, caste, creed, gender or age. Many of these people are in fact poor and downtrodden, who come here for food.""Serving food in langar is all about service. All are warmly welcome here and given equal amount of food. We worship God by feeding people,"" said Ajit Singh, a mason from Amritsar.Drinking water is served in a bowl instead of glass and people wash their hands on the plate while sitting as volunteers pour water through kettle. As the meal ends, one is offered tea or coffee, obviously in Punjabi-style big glasses.As one lot of people leave the langar hall, the used utensils are washed by another group of youngsters, while several other volunteers mop the floor to ensure spotless langar for the next lot of people."
58d79ba5a3d24b75f276d437,Farm Loan Waiver: Why It's Just a Poll Sop,http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/farm-loan-waivers-why-its-just-a-poll-sop/story-zwfE3pAe1eqdwTzOBBS4EL.html,2016-12-28,"In the wake of the demonetisation impact on the economy, especially the farmers, a Congress delegation recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding a farm loan waiver.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said since the government waived loans worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore to corporates, it should do the same for farmers.However, most banks are against the loan waiver, claiming that it will encourage farmers not to repay their loans.So far, the Centre has waived farm loans twice: in 1990 and 2008. Under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme of 2008, the government waived entire loans to marginal and small farmers (those with landholding of up to 2 hectares) and offered one-time relief of 25% to other farmers.The government disbursed Rs 52,516.86 crore up to 2011-12 under the scheme, according to International Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).Farmers plightBut farmers are struggling. They are facing decreasing landholdings, high input costs, falling water table, and deteriorating soil quality. As agriculture growth has slowed, farmers income has also fallen, making it difficult for them to pay for the increasingly costly inputs. This then forces them to take loans.With many small farmers still not eligible for bank credit, they borrow money from non-institutional sources, which charge exorbitant interest rates. And it only takes one or two failed crops for them to fall into a debt trap.Prof. Swaminathan highlighted the farmers plight this year, saying, Punjab farmers, at the heartland of the Green Revolution, with an average farm size of 3.79 hectares, growing wheat and rice get an income which is less than the starting salary of a Class Four employee.  That is the crisis in Indian agriculture.Farmers in arid lands face an even more bleak situation as they depend entirely on rains and are not insured against the vagaries of the weather.Considering the many risks involved in farming and little government support, many debt-ridden farmers are driven to suicide. A UN report said one farmer committed suicide every 32 minutes between 1997 and 2005.2008 loan waiver impactOne would expect that two loan waivers would have relieved the plight of the farmers. But they didnt. According to a paper published by the Indian Statistical Institute in 2013, there was deterioration in the repayment of loans after the loan waiver of 2008.It said all three groups  small and marginal farmers, bigger farmers, and farmers who had not defaulted on their loans took longer to repay their loans after the loan waiver.Moreover, the paper says the loan officers will reduce lending after the waiver as compared to before as the punishment for making a bad loan is more than the reward for lending wisely. Since the probability of default is higher for farmers who had done so earlier, loan officers reject their applications. These are mostly small and marginal farmers. In the end, the debt relief results in fewer farmers getting access to credit, which is the exact opposite of what the government had intended to achieve.Other criticismsA 2015 ICRIER paper says the massive write-off of loans in 2008 took its toll on the banks, increasing the non-performing assets of commercial banks threefold between 2009-10 and 2012-13. Moreover, the scheme was criticised for excluding farmers  mostly in arid lands  who owned more than 2 hectares. Those who borrowed from money lenders also didnt benefit from the scheme.Way forwardThe ICRIER paper says generalised loan waivers should be avoided as these impair the agricultural credit channels. It says targeted loan waivers with case-by-case examination may just do the trick. It said the results would be better if waivers were a part of a comprehensive package, including public investment and other incentives."
58e540d77be9e05a951f689a,'Not against govt but system',http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161231/jsp/odisha/story_127757.jsp,2016-12-31,"You are demanding pension for farmers. Why are your reasons for making such a demand? We want social security allowance for farmers and it should be given from the age of 20. One has the fundamental right to livelihood and the government has to protect it. This has been enshrined in the Constitution itself. The person, who is taking the responsibility to fill the stomach of the nation, cannot be left in a lurch. Even a peon, after his retirement, gets decent amount as pension. While soldiers, doctors, officers and government employees at various levels get pension, why not the farmers? They dedicate their entire life for the development of the nation as well to feed the country. Don't they deserve pension? Your demand for prestige to farmers appears a vague slogan. No one can demand prestige for himself or herself. It is earned... Yes, I do agree with that. But with the passage of time, many things have changed. Here, the masters are subjected to humiliation and the government employees, considered public servants, are ruling the roost. They survive on the taxpayers' money, but because of the power and authority they enjoy, the farmers have to come and bend before them. These things have to be changed. You are talking about remunerative prices... Yes, we are aware of it. As we are raising the demand, the state has taken up the issue and the farmers are being benefited. Our motto is that it's not the government that should fix the price of the farmers' produce. Let the farmers fix the price for their produce themselves deciding the profit margin. We are a market-driven society. Is it possible here? Yes. The government should intervene so that farmers get the minimum justified price for their produce. When the private sector takes maximum retail price for their products, why can the farmers not be given the just price for their products? There are many kinds of farmers - rich, small and marginal farmers. Who are you fighting for? Our fight is for those who till the land. We are not for landlords. But in Odisha, there are few landlords. The state government is going to introduce land rights for sharecroppers. Do you support that? An attempt is being made to create a division in the society by driving a wedge between the sharecroppers and marginal landowners. We all should be aware of it. Our demand is that you first allocate 25 per cent of the state's budget for farmers and then we will decide how the land will be divided among the sharecroppers and the landowners. First give us our share, then we will decide what to do on this issue. You are evading the issue... No. We are with all those who cultivate the land. While the per capita income of the farmers at the national level is pegged at Rs 6,426, that of Odisha farmers hovers around Rs 4,976. The state government, despite budgetary constraints, is going ahead with its Re 1-a-kg rice scheme. What is your opinion on it? The Re 1-a-kg rice scheme is kind of relief measure that should continue for a brief period but not forever. It's like throwing a loaf of bread before a dog... But the Re 1-a-kg rice scheme has successfully checked starvation deaths in Odisha. For the past few years, no case of starvation death has been reported in the state... I agree. But one should not think it's the only solution to bring a lasting change in the life of farmers. We must focus on how to improve the livelihood of farmers by bringing sustainable development and giving a boost to their sagging economy. Your agitation for the farmers' cause seems to have a political tone. It gives out the message that you are against the Naveen Patnaik government. We are not against any government. We are against the system, against the concept of development. We are raising some issues and want that they be addressed. We have to involve all kinds of people to make the movement a success. Let me make it clear that I am not joining electoral politics. I am openly saying that no government - neither the J.B. Patnaik government nor Naveen Patnaik government - has laid emphasis on development of agriculture. You seem to be also against industrialisation. How can the state grow otherwise? We should focus on small-scale industries and the development of agriculture. We should not focus only on setting up big industries by exhausting all our natural resources such as iron ore and bauxite. Just tell me, how Punjab has emerged as one of the economically advanced states in the county? It has been possible because they have given thrust on the development of agriculture.  Akshay, 50, a believer in Gandhian philosophy, spent many years at the Vinoba Bhave's Ashram in Wardha and did a diploma in Gandhian studies He had worked in Punjab when the insurgency was at its peak. Later, he moved to violence-ridden Assam and worked towards establishing peace through non-violence A graduate in commerce, Akshay was moved by the plight of the common people in Odisha after the super cyclone that had struck the state in 1999 and started working to bring relief to them Later, he started taking up farmers issue. He came to limelight in 2013 when he along with his supporters jumped before the Naveen's carcade to highlight the farmer's issues WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN IF NOT A SOCIAL ACTIVIST? Since my childhood, I had the dream of doing something unique - to do something for the society. Vinoba Bhave has inspired me. Perhaps, I am on the right path and have reached where I wanted to be."
