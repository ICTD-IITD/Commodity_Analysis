The parade includes several colourful flower-covered floats, and one of these will be the Sikh American float, being featured for the fourth consecutive year.The theme of the Sikh American float, langar, will evoke the Sikh teachings of Sewa (selfless service). Elaborating on this, one of the many community members involved in the project and responsible for the floats entry for the fourth year, Bhajneet Singh said: Growing up in California, it was always a dream to see a Sikh float in the Tournament of Roses Parade. The theme of Langar really speaks of the values of Sikhism and the work that we are doing to help our communities every day here in California and across the world.Indeed, the Southern California Sikh communitys actions stress on the importance of langar as they feed thousands of people across Los Angeles every month. Singh explains, From the Khalsa Food Pantry every Friday evening to the monthly barbeques and visits to Skid Row , we are constantly trying to bring langar to those most in need. We are excited as millions of Americans will learn more about this important aspect of Sikhism during the Rose Parade. The dishes include, chole, paneer, rice and gulab jamun as sweet dish.""Taking inspiration from the worlds largest free kitchen, the float wall feature brick walls, a marbled dome roof and scalloped arches to replicate those found at the Golden Temple, Amritsar.In addition to the langar theme, the float will house 90,959 flowers. There will also be 500 pounds of vegetables on the float to represent the meals found in a Langar Hall. Singh adds, Our Punjabi traditions are always an important part of the float design and will be showcased in the food, colors and riders that join the float. The float will visually transport spectators back to Punjab , the Sikh Coalition said.The Sikh design concept and initial implementation started months ago, but it is the work of hundreds of volunteers in the week leading up to January 1 that bring the float to life.Harbinder Kaur, one of the volunteer says, We are happy to take part in the parade and be a part of this celebratory occasion. It doesnt matter what colour you are, what religion you are, everybody here is with big smile and its all about love which is exciting to see.Singh explains the importance of having a Sikh American float in the Rose Parade, Sikhs have been an integral part of the American fabric for generations, but we still have a lot of work to do to educate the American public about who we are. We know this is a great way to raise awareness and reach millions of Americans. It brings the local Sikh community together and opens doors to interacting with other Rose Parade organisations that build lifelong partnerships."

Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

Multan is an arid region; we dont traditionally have a lot of vegetables. So our special Lohri food is a spicy mix of seven vegetables  a rare treat, says Mahesh Nagpal, 75, secretary of the Samiti. We also feast on sugarcane juice.A large bonfire is lit and celebrants walk around it thrice, chanting and making offerings of gulal to their deity, Narsimha, a part-man-part-lion incarnation of the Hindu deity Vishnu.There is one Multani priest in Mumbai, who knows each of the families of the 1,000 Multanis in the city.The culture lives on through the priest and the elderly.

For many decades, Punjabs contribution to Indias production of wheat and rice has been substantial. Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people, Amarinder said.Amarinder said of the states almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. Its our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs, the CM said.With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing high-quantity rice and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into Mohali and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.He said: Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the states youth.

The issues will be taken up at the next meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told media persons after the GST Council meeting here.'Vibhuti' (sacred ash), parts and accessories for manufacture of hearing aids and de-oiled rice bran have been exempted from GST while all types of old and used motor vehicles other than medium and large cars and SUVs will now attract 12 per cent instead of 28 per cent GST. Old medium and large cars and SUVs will attract 18 per cent instead of 28 per cent.The rate on sugar-boiled confectionery, drinking water packed in 20 litre bottles, fertiliser-grade phosphoric acid, bio-diesel and drip irrigation system have been reduced from 18 to 12 per cent.Tamarind kernel powder, mehendi paste in cones and domestic LPG supplied by private distributors will attract a reduced duty of five per cent instead of 18 per cent.The exemptions from GST will, among other things, now apply to supply of services for providing information under RTI Act, legal services provided to government, local authority, governmental authority and government entity, transportation of goods from India to outside by air and sea, services relating to admission or conduct of examinations provided to all educational institutions, entrance fees for entrance examination and for transportation of students up to higher secondary schools.GST has been reduced from 18 to 12 per cent on construction of Metro and monorail projects, while on tailoring services it has been brought down from 18 per cent to five per cent.

Infosys is the service provider of GSTN.GSTR 3B return filing will continue and all buyers and sellers will continue to load their invoices.Initially there will be 3B return and the supplier invoice would be adequate. The Council felt that once the GoM, IT Committee and Nandan Nilekani discuss the matter and formalise it, then it will be circulated among the ministers and approval will be taken during the next GST Council meeting.The next GST Council meeting will be held via video conferencing soon.The Council also reaffirmed that from January 15 e-way Bill system has started operating on a trial basis. ""From February 1 inter-state e-way bill will be necessary. Fifteen states have said that from February 1, intra-state, they will also start e-way bill.""The Finance Minister said the Council also reviewed GST collections. ""So far we have been relying on unilateral declaration of traders itself. It is necessary to bring in some anti-evasion measures.""He also said that the Composition Scheme was seriously discussed. ""Collection was a matter of concern. Seventeen lakh dealers who have registered themselves at 1 per cent have only deposited Rs 307 crore in the first quarter. The scheme has not been enthusiastically responded. Most of the people have registered themselves below Rs 20 lakh.

He was 92. The founding chairman of Punjab State Farmers Commission, it was under Kalkats leadership as the director of agriculture, Punjab, and later as the agriculture commissioner of India, that the country witnessed Green Revolution and India became self-sufficient in food grain production. He was also the former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (Ludhiana) from 1998-2001.Known for his contribution during the Green Revolution era which led to a boom in the production of wheat and rice in the country, with Punjab leading the chart, not many know that Kalkats plans for the farmers of the state went beyond that. Infact, he was the one who even ushered a soybean revolution and also introduced banana cultivation for Punjab.Speaking to The Indian Express, Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon, vice-chancellor PAU said, We know him for wheat and rice, but he always thought out of the box. He was not a normal wheat and rice scientist. He was way beyond that. He introduced soybean cultivation in Punjab, though it wasnt commercially successful. Then he took soybean varieties from Punjab to Madhya Pradesh where they were immensely successful commercially as well. Despite sitting on political posts, he was never diplomatic, but always spoke his heart for benefit of farmers even if it was politically incorrect. He was never afraid of failures. He experimented and tried to venture in something new even if it failed.Banana cultivation in Punjab was also Kalkats brainchild and one among his many efforts to help the farmers in Punjab earn better. Due to many reasons like climate and less awareness, bananas in Punjab could not succeed but his idea behind it was to make farmers earn better. Once we were in dire need of funds to send PAU scientists to the US for training, he helped us in getting them from the government, said Dr Manjit Singh Kang, former vice chancellor, PAU to The Indian Express.It was under Kalkat that the Punjab State Farmers Commission took shape and he became the first chairman of the body in 2005 during the Congress rule.Later, in 2007, when SAD-BJP government led by Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister was in power, he offered to resign, but Badal did not accept his resignation. Badal saab did not let him resign. He asked him to continue. He was even ready to resign in the second tenure of SAD-BJP regime, but again he wasnt allowed to do so. He was always a bridge between government and farmers, the one who did not hesitate in speaking against the government for their benefit, said a senior PAU official.In 2017, Kalkat resigned after Congress government led by Captain Amarinder Singh was sworn in. This time he wasnt keeping well and expressed that he wants to get relieved from the responsibility, he added.Born in Hoshiarpurs Sahora village, Kalkat undertook various assignments at the international level, working as senior agriculturist with the World Bank. Posted at Washington DC, he worked for countries like Nigeria and Ghana. He introduced shallow tubewells and handpumps for them to make irrigation and drinking water accessible. He also worked for World Bank in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Nepal.He did his schooling from Montgomery district (Sahiwal) now in Pakistan and graduation in agriculture from Punjab Agriculture College, Lyallpur, in 1947. After his Masters in Agriculture in 1956 from the Punjab University, Solan, he joined the Ohio State University, USA, in January 1957 and completed his Ph.D in Agricultural Zoology Entomology in 1958.Dr SS Johl, Padma Bhushan and renowned food economist told The Indian Express, Today, I have lost a very good friend and adviser in my life. He was one such person who lived his life for betterment of farmers. It was his forte to put across his point politely even if it was against the government. He was not allowed to resign as Punjab Farmers Commission chairman by former CM Badal even as he offered to do so.It was under his chairmanship that the commission got studies conducted on serious issues such as rural suicides, flow of credit and indebtedness of farmers; rural education and fall in water table in central Punjab.The National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) chairman his communication to Kalkat in 2015, during Golden Jubilee celebrations of Green Revolution stated, The deliberations recalled your contributions that turned the country from food shortage to self-sufficiency. I would like to once again thank you for the leadership provided by you during the Green Revolution in the country and guidance over the years.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The countrys biggest producer of rice has been requested by several states  hit by a production shortage  to provide them with this staple, making this the first time ever that Bengal will provide rice at the states request.At least one of these states is BJP-ruled Jharkhand, while two other states are Left-ruled Kerala and AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu. Sources said one more BJP-ruled north Indian state is also in the queue.Bengal produces over 2.5 crore tonnes of paddy, which translates to 1.6 crore tonnes of rice. This is the countrys highest, said state finance secretary H K Dwivedi. He confirmed that that the three states had formally requested Bengal with an offer to buy its surplus rice. On an average, 23 lakh to 30 lakh tonnes of rice are procured by the government per fiscal. This fiscal, so far, 52 lakh tonnes of rice have been procured, which in itself is a great achievement, he added.TOI had reported on January 28 that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had written to Bengal about supplying rice to some states.Pradeep Mazumdar, the agriculture adviser to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, told TOI that this was the first time that the states had asked Bengal to supply rice. Dwivedi and Mazumdar were attending the State Credit Seminar 2018-19, organised by Nabard. This is a good beginning, said Mazumder. In the last two years, too, we were keen on supplying rice to other states so that we could keep prices at a level. But the Centre and FCI were not very keen on it, he added.According to Mazumdar, other states are now buying rice from Bengal and this vindicates Banerjees agricultural policy. He pointed out that the Centre and rice-deficit states mainly procure rice from Punjab, Haryana and Telangana. There was some unorganized rice export to Bangladesh and other countries after rice came under Open General Licence (OGL) in 2012. Now, there are no export restrictions, he added.Mazumdar said Bengal has requested RBI and Nabard to fix the agri credit target at Rs 70,000 crore for the next fiscal. We want Rs 1,00,000 credit per farmer. Considering 70 lakh registered farmers, it should be Rs 70,000 crore, he added. The credit projection for agriculture in 2018-19 is Rs 63,196 crore, whereas it was Rs 53,000 crore in 2017-18. However, so far, only Rs 34,000 crore could be achieved.Dwivedi also pointed out that though the macro-economic scenario in agriculture in the country as a whole was dismal, Bengal stood out. He said the states warehousing capacity had gone up from 62,000 tonnes to 6.2 lakh tonnes. More than 3.5 lakh tonnes of warehousing capacity will be added this year, he added."
5aead7159855b73f522c3e30,India's Farmers Need a New Deal beyond Cliched MSP Politics,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-farmers-need-a-new-deal-beyond-cliched-msp-politics/story-fpGg1pb90g1IKOkWBTUN3O.html,2018-02-15,"Finance minister Arun Jaitleys grand budget announcement of Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) providing assured 50% return to farmers may not actually mean a 50% return. The government admitted on February 9 that it had the so-called A2+FL (a measure of variable costs) and not C2 (which also includes fixed costs) costs in mind while calculating return mark-ups vis--vis MSPs. An earlier HT story had pointed this on February 7.Now that the buzz around budget seems to have settled, a deeper question can be asked. How much of a role can MSPs, and promises of increasing them, play in addressing the growing viability crisis of agriculture in todays age? Beginning with some stylised facts may help.Less than one-fourth of Indias total cereal production is procured at MSP. The share of procurement is slightly higher, a little less than one-third, for wheat and rice (Chart 1). Of late horticultural production has surpassed food grain production in India. There is no MSP coverage for fruits and vegetables.Even the limited procurement which happens is extremely skewed. More than half of total rice and wheat procurement is done from the traditional green revolution states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (Chart 2).A National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report for 2012-13 shows that less than half of all farmers were even aware about MSPs. The figures vary across crops. Only a fraction of those who are aware about MSPs actually sell their crops to procurement agencies. Such sale is able to dispose off only a fraction of their total production (See Chart 3).These statistics provide a context to the twin challenges of putting into place a holistic and remunerative MSP policy. If MSPs have to be really remunerative, they need a significant hike compared to present levels. An even bigger problem is the skewed crop-wise and state-wise coverage under the procurement net. If this has to be increased significantly, it would require a massive scaling up of governments procurement operations. This is not just a question of money. Storage of procured food grains is a big problem even at current procurement levels.The only effective way to dispose procured grains is through public distribution system (PDS). This avenue would come under squeeze as cash transfers replace distribution of food in the PDS.Both the present and past government has been pushing for abolition of in-kind food security programmes. Politicians, who wax eloquent about the benefits of doing away with in-kind PDS hardly talk about the effect it would have on procurement operations. Wider MSP coverage and cash transfers in food security programmes cannot go hand in hand in India.The problem does not end here. It is a fact that more and more Indians are getting out of abject poverty. They are also becoming more and more mobile in search of jobs. The middle classes do not need the PDS to buy food grains and other essentials anymore. Scarcity of such things is not something post-reform India would even relate to. Growth in agricultural production is the biggest reason for this.Both these developments reduce the possibilities of a healthy growth in number of people using the old arrangement of ration shops to access subsidised grains. This means even without cash transfers, the ability of MSP- type policies to support farm incomes will shrink in days to come.All this is not to say MSP-based PDS is not needed anymore. Starvation deaths have been reported because people could not get their ration due to Aadhaar-related problems. The absolute number of very poor people is still very high. MSP-based procurement is an important anchor of agricultural prices in India. It also protects countrys food security. Many farmers could switch from food crops to commercial crops if there were no procurement.What all this does suggest is the fact that agricultural policy making has got itself into a cul-de-sac. The tested method of incentivising agricultural production  MSP-based procurement  is reaching its limits. Uncertainty in farm incomes is only increasing with growing weight of perishables in total agricultural production. Challenges such as climate change related adverse effects on farm production would be here much sooner. Farmers are feeling the pinch of all this, but they have no agency. Farmer politicians do not hold much clout in Indias game of thrones.Those who do not earn their living from farming are not bothered for the moment. Indias urban middle class probably never had it so good when it comes to consumption of food products. A large variety of food items are being delivered to their doorsteps at discounted rates. The more farmers incomes are squeezed, the cheaper they get these things. Although much smaller in number than farmers, this class exercises a disproportionate sway in opinion building.The political class has by and large chickened out from handling this fundamental political economy divide. Its happy to placate one class at a time. Lower inflation for large part of the term, followed by a tactical MSP hike towards the end.The consequences can be disastrous in the not-too-distant future. A deep rooted crisis in farming can end the supply glut largely taken for granted. Signs of growing social unrest are already visible. Any new deal to farmers would require resolution of this contradiction rather than fraudulent promises of MSP hikes."

The I-T department has also attached four immovable properties of Rotomac group in Kanpur and Ahmedabad.The ED also scrutinised papers of some of the shell companies associated with Modi and those of Mehul Choksi of Gitanjali Gems.Choksi is a co-accused in the Punjab National Banks Rs 11,400 crore swindle along with Modi and was partner in three firms linked to the caseDiamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds. The other accused in the case are Modis wife Ami and brother Nishal.On Wednesday, ED teams raided four locations at Opera House, Peddar Road, Goregaon (East) and Powai in Mumbai besides searches in other cities. So far ED has seized diamonds and gold jewellery from Nirav Modi stores worth over Rs 5,700 crore.The income tax department had conducted searches on 13 companies of the Mehul Choksis Gitanjali group on Tuesday at 20 locations in five cities. The searches included some of the shell companies associated with Choksi.Many of the shell companies searched had huge financial transactions with Choksis Gitanjali Gems Ltd and Gili India Ltd though they had insignificant businesses. The I-T department has attached 29 high-value properties of Modi and eight of Choksi and attached their bank accounts too.In another case, the ED on Wednesday provisionally attached assets worth Rs 100 crore of REI Agro Ltd in connection with another bank fraud case worth about Rs 3,800. The second case relates to diversion of funds sanctioned by a consortium of banks by the accused to many of his shell companies. The case dates back to 2015 when the CBI had first registered an FIR against REI Agro.The ED probe revealed that REI Agro Ltd and its directors, Sandip Jhunjhunwala and others, had diverted the funds sanctioned as working capital loan by 14 banks under consortium led by the UCO Bank. The accused adopted different modus operandi, including trading in bogus bills and investing the money in shell companies, a senior officer said.Jhunjhunwala is accused of arranging false purchase and sales invoices of rice and paddy through brokers in Delhi for availing maximum working capital limits from the consortium of banks and later diverted the funds for capital expenditure."

Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and officers of the departments of agriculture and finance who met Kumar sought Niti Aayogs intervention for a package to the states peasantry.When we raised the issue of farming crisis, the Aayog members told us we could look beyond the wheat-paddy cycle of food security. The message is clear: state must not depend on Centre alone, and can take steps it deems necessary on its own, said an agriculture department officer who was in the meeting but not authorised to speak to the media, adding, Farmers are ready for the challenge.Rajiv Kumar later said, We discussed high-priority areas for Punjab in the agriculture sector. Farmers here need to cut down on input cost and grow high-value crops. We are working on an action plan for the state. I have asked for discussions from the state.Manpreet was more upfront at the press briefing: In the name of national food security, Punjab should not be victimised. Our farmers are in crisis; the soil and aquifers are exhausted.This shift of focus is an indirect way to telling Punjab that we dont need your grain. To to fill the gap, eastern states are coming up in a big way.  Sardara Singh Johl, farm economistPunjab has for five decades been contributing majorly to the national food bowl. While the figure once stood at 60% of the countrys rice (paddy) and nearly 80% of the wheat, in the 2016-17 season the state contributed 29% of the rice and 38% of the wheat.This, when Punjab is 2.4% of the countrys area, and has just 0.7% of the countrys farmers. The farmers are in a debt crisis, though. As per figures quoted by different agencies, including the state government, total debt on the states peasantry is Rs 90,000 crore, while overall debt on the nations farmers is estimated at Rs 11 lakh crore.Punjabs farmers are dependent on the minimum support price (MSP) offered by the Centre on wheat and paddy. But the farmers and the state government have been seeking MSP as per the Swaminathan formula: 50% profit over input cost, including family labour cost and lands potential revenue. For now, land potential is not taken into account while calculating input cost, even though the Centre says it will follow the 50% formula.Centre should procure directlyThe visiting team of Niti Aayog was also told that Punjabs government loses Rs 1,800 crore every year in procurement of wheat and paddy. We offered that they (Centre) should take charge of procurement, and it be done by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), said Manpreet.Six state-owned procurement agencies procure wheat and paddy on behalf of the Centre using cash credit limit sanctioned by the Union ministry of finance through Reserve Bank of India. These agencies pass on the foodgrains to the FCI for distribution to other states too.The state government in 2016 owned up Rs 31,000 crore as term loan for 20 years  this figure was actually the difference between CCL funds received and the grains procured. Every month, the state repays Rs 270 crore thus.Speaking on other issues discussed, Manpreet said Niti Aayog was asked to take up flood-control measures on the border with Pakistan. The members, according to the FM, were also urged to frame policies keeping needs of Punjab in view .The issues, as per a government release, included funds for Stage 2 of Shahpur Kandi Dam project and lining of the Sirhind canal and Rajasthan feeder. Also, the state sought increase in Centres contribution to 90%, from the current 60%, to the border area development fund.Hidden message?Asked about the issue, farm economist Sardara Singh Johl said, This shift of focus is an indirect way to telling Punjab that we dont need your grain. To to fill the gap, eastern states are coming up in a big way.He lamented, Despite alerts to successive governments in Punjab not to depend on MSP of wheat and paddy, and to grow other crops, the situation has been allowed to reach this level."

Earlier, all people had to do was visit the ration shop and buy rice for Rs 1 per kg. But with the government now transferring the subsidy into their bank accounts, the process became tedious. A person now has visit the bank to check if the subsidy amount has been transferred to their accounts.

Then they had to withdraw the amount to buy rice at Rs 32 per kg.The RTF study, which surveyed 244 beneficiary families in 13 randomly selected villages in Nagri, has found that many of them have not been able to avail the subsidised grain because of tedious process and the costs involved in withdrawing the amount deposited in their bank accounts.The study found that on an average each family has 3.4 bank accounts and 95% of them have not been informed about the account linked to the food subsidy scheme. As a result, people have had to shuttle between various banks, covering an average distance of 4.3km.Further, for the last four months, the families have got ration only for two months and had to spend 15 hours completing formalities to collect it. Over 97% of the respondents said they want the government to abandon the scheme and revert to the earlier system of food distribution.Among those facing the project's brunt is Daniel Tirkey of Singhpur village, who has got a notice saying his ration card will be cancelled if he does not procure the ration allotted to him.

5b177fa89855b75db2e79d76,Foodgrain production may touch record 277 mn tonnes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foodgrain-production-may-touch-record-277-mn-tonnes/articleshow/63104177.cms,2018-02-28,"New Delhi: India's overall foodgrain production may touch a record of 277.49 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) with output of pulses and rice reporting a new high. The agriculture ministry released its latest estimates on Tuesday, just when the government has been exploring various options of procuring more and more foodgrains from farmers in the year of plenty.Option of extending the government's guarantee to banks and lending agencies to ensure that state agencies do not face fund crunch for procurement is likely to come up before the Union Cabinet for approval on Wednesday.The move will help states go for procurement of pulses, oilseeds and cotton under the Price Support Scheme ( PSS ) through central nodal agencies and the other crops by state agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) without worrying about paucity of funds.The basic objectives of PSS are to provide remunerative prices to the growers with a view to encourage higher investment and production and safeguard interests of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices.Though the year is expected to report decline in production of wheat and oilseeds as compared to previous year (2016-17), the latest estimates gave a new hope amid reports of good sowing of winter crops ( Rabi ), except wheat, in December-January.The fall in wheat production can be attributed to farmers' decision to shift to pulses with the hope of better MSP. Farmers in Rajasthan, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh shifted to pulses during the Rabi season.The agriculture ministry, while releasing the second advance estimates of foodgrain production, attributed the record output in 2017-18 to ""near normal rainfall during 2017 monsoon and various policy initiatives taken by the government"".The ministry said that the assessment of production of different crops was ""based on the feedback received from states"". It claimed that the assessment was also ""validated with information available from other sources"".The ministry releases four advance estimates, before the final one which gives exact details of foodgrain output. The second estimates, released after completion of the Rabi sowing operations across the country, show that the production of wheat is likely to drop by 1.42% to estimated 97.11 MT. It is lower by 1.40 MT as compared to record wheat production of 98.51 MT achieved during 2016-17."

""Don't call me because it will make the ringer go off, they'll hear it and I'll get caught,"" it cautioned in another. And finally, ""Please tell the agent to send the money to Libya.""The voice in the messages was that of Babar Shabir, a 19-year-old Pakistani. His relatives fear he is dead, among roughly 90 people who drowned this month when a boat smuggling migrants from Libya to Italy capsized. A majority, including a newborn, appear to have been from Pakistan.The 16 bodies that have been found arrived in Pakistan earlier this month. Seven of the confirmed dead were, like Shabir, from tiny Gujrat, in northern Punjab province, which has been rocked by the disaster.Though Libya has become a notorious transit hub for illegal migration to Europe - some 1,80,000 migrants used that route to cross to Italy in 2016 alone - Pakistanis have in the past rarely been among them. But desperate Pakistanis will now go far in search of better lives.Shabir left his hometown, near Pakistan's border with India, with his 24-year-old cousin, Mazhar Hussain, in December. Their families say the pair collected around $13,000, a fortune for even the well-to-do, to pay a local smuggler who guaranteed safe passage to Europe. When news of the capsizing trickled back to Gujrat, the young men's families tried frantically, but unsuccessfully, to reach them.Azhar Hussain says he knew his brother Mazhar was dead when he saw a photo of his body posted on Facebook, circulated by Pakistanis in Libya to help confirm victims' identities. Azhar covered his face with his shawl as Shabir's older brother looked at the picture of Mazhar Hussain's greyish body, covered in sand. With Shabir's death not certain, the men remained glued to their phones, scouring gruesome photos for his face.Local labourers in this largely agrarian area have streamed overseas in sizable numbers since the 1970s. For years, legal migration was such a force that little towns here were given nicknames like Little Norway and Little Britain, for where their people had gone.Homes here hint at the mass migration. Tidy mud-brick village houses, surrounded by wheat and rice fields, have been increasingly replaced by mansions with gaudy ironwork and colourful tiles, built with money from overseas relatives. In 2014, almost 30% of local households reportedly received foreign remittances.The houses serve in a sense as billboards for smugglers, proof of money to be made abroad. Ansar Burney, a Pakistani civil rights activist who works to end people smuggling, said the message was persuasive. ""If I'm living in these rural towns, I'd be convinced I should go, too,"" he said.For Shabir, the appeal was hypnotic. ""We begged him not to go,"" his mother, Hamida Bibi, said between desperate prayers for her son. ""But he had made up his mind long ago.""His cousin, Mazhar Hussain, the oldest son in his family, also was drawn by the lure of fantastic wealth and hoped to send money home. ""Now, we're left with nothing,"" his brother Azhar said. ""We sold what land we had to collect money for his ticket to Europe. My parents are old, and I can't find steady work. It's like we lost everything when we lost him.""Legal migration from Pakistan peaked in 2015 when just under 1 million Pakistanis left to work overseas. It has since dropped almost by half, Burney said, with migrants seeking visas squeezed by concerns about terrorism in Europe and economic belt-tightening in the Persian Gulf.""The Saudis took an initiative to reduce all overseas labour, Pakistanis included,"" said Jabbar Chaudry of Pakistan's Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, adding, ""The educated and semi-educated youth no longer have legal windows of opportunity.""An increasing number of Pakistanis, 14,000, applied for asylum in 2016 in Italy alone, most asserting persecution or fear of violence. Others fleeing in recent years included almost 7,000 ethnic Hazaras who gained asylum in Australia in 2013.With legal options for migrant workers shrinking, the Libyan route to Europe has become popular. According to the International Organization for Migration, in January about 240 Pakistanis crossed into Italy from Libya, making them the third largest nationality represented. By comparison, only nine were reported in January 2017.The cousins reached Libya by air and, according to their families, had legitimate visas. ""They took a flight from Lahore to Dubai, then Kuwait to Turkey, then they reached Libya,"" Azhar Hussain said. ""They would call us from a different airport every day for a few days.""Path of horrorsIn Libya, they joined the tens of thousands trying to reach Europe, and fell into the hands of smugglers demanding more money. Some of the men's last messages relayed the horror of being captive and beaten while others around them were tortured.Pressed for money, their families begged the smuggler in Gujrat to help and eventually came up with $1,000 more to secure the men's journey onward.This new path through Libya should get more scrutiny, said Mohsin Waheed Butt, an officer with the Pakistani Federal Intelligence Agency. ""Immigration officers, they need to inquire why people are going to Libya,"" he said. ""What kind of a person is going to Libya right now? It's obvious these guys are going for only one thing.""But Burney, the rights advocate, believes the government is on some level complicit, saying: ""These smugglers are flush with cash. They're getting Libyan visas in the dozens, and they've bought off the immigration officers sitting at the airport, too.""The director general of the Federal Intelligence Agency, Bashir Memon, confirmed that all the Pakistanis whose bodies were recovered after the capsizing had gone to Libya legally. He said law enforcement agencies ""try their best"" to counter ""a whole mafia of smuggling"" in the region.A short drive from where the cousins lived, Muhammad Khan held court recently in his ancestral house. Villagers came to offer condolences after learning his nephew died in the capsizing with his wife and children, the younger less than 2 months old.The nephew, Ismail Khan, moved his family to Libya two years ago, hoping to find work as a labourer. His uncle said he had not known the younger Khan wanted to go to Europe until after the family had died.The uncle said he emigrated to Britain legally 30 years ago, and had been back in Gujrat on vacation when he learned about the deaths. ""My family lives in Manchester now, and we have a good life,"" he said.Khan said he left Pakistan for the same reason his nephew Ismail did. ""When you live here, you lose hope,"" he said. ""You don't see hope for years on end. So, when someone presents you with an opportunity, a small window of hope, you'll risk it all."""

How is being finance minister in the SAD-BJP coalition different from being one in the Congress government The difference between the Akali finance minister and the Congress finance minister is that the style of functioning of Capt Amarinder Singh is very different from Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Capt Singh likes to delegate his work, he trusts you completely and expects results. In Mr Badals case, he never delegated and he didnt expect results. He would take finance departments meetings personally and not invite the finance minister. In the present dispensation, I am expected to tie up everything, sew up everything and give a final presentation either to the CM or the cabinet. In that sense, its quite different.I think the last 10 years had been very reckless in so far as populism is concerned, in terms of good governance or administration. A lot of money was recklessly thrown on projects not in the larger interest of Punjab. For example, for the last 10 years they kept telling us that they had foodstock to cover all the losses. But one day before the counting of votes on March 10, 2017, the Punjab government signed an agreement with the Centre accepting all the losses and converting that account into a term loan. In one stroke of pen, we were saddled with $4.5 billion or Rs 31,000 crore. Similarly, electricity boards losses of about Rs 17,000 crore were converted to UDAY bonds. So about Rs 51,000 crore was loaded in within a few weeks.In the last financial year of the SAD government, they made memorials worth Rs 2,000 crore. But for the first time, there was a strike in the Panjab University for 20 days. Students were beaten up. PU was just asking for Rs 20 crore of additional government support. We have not paid the Sainik School at Kapurthala, which for continuous 17 years got the Presidents medal for sending most cadets to the NDA. The annual grant to the school was Rs 1 crore, which is peanuts. Baba Farid Health Sciences University vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur wanted Rs 50 crore to make it a world class university.Once they have been built, what do you do? Either you complete them or leave them. They are all half-constructed. So well have to complete them. But, why were these decisions taken?All revenue of Mandi Board accounts to the tune of about Rs 5,000 crore, PIDB about Rs 2,000 crore a year have been escrowed with the banks for five years. Before they left, they made sure that they emptied out everything and no sources of revenue were left for the next government. Its, as they call it in military, a scorched earth policy where the retreating forces destroy everything. But in this process, the Congress government has learnt a lesson, that howsoever reckless you are, you will be reduced to 15 seats, if you are not careful, if good governance is not there, and if corruption is there. The basic concern is rozi-roti and, what in Urdu they say, izzat ki roti.We were acutely aware of what was happening in Punjab. Whatever the Congress government has promised is basically with the view to kick-start the economy. Now in this cross-subsidisation of giving free power to farmers, the whole subsidy burden was loaded on to the industry of Punjab. They were getting power at Rs 7.60 a unit. If I can take you 50 years back: Why did Punjab progress? Punjab progressed because it had the Bhakra Dam. Because Punjab had access to cheap power, Punjab industrialised and developed.Industry was leaving Punjab in droves because of the power situation. So how do we retain them? We have to create a level-playing field. So when you talk about populism, I would respectfully disagree with you. It was not populism. It involves a subsidy of about Rs 1,500 crore. But I see benefits or multiplier effects if we can retain our industry. Because you dont just retain industry, you also retain jobs and taxes. So, this was a must.No, this is not the only way. There are two other things that need to be done. Farmers have to be weaned away from agriculture. If agriculture forms 20% of Punjabs GDP and 75% people are engaged in agriculture, that means 75% people are trying to earn Rs 20. They are not going to be rich or well-off. The idea is to give skill sets and job opportunities to farmers children so that they can get away and start doing other jobs. Second step is to give better crop prices and promote alternative crops. It has to be multi-pronged approach and debt has to be taken care of. Unless you do all three simultaneously, you will not have the desired effect.We have to remodel our economy from a foodgrainproducing economy into a more industrialised or a service-oriented one. That model has to be put in place in the next four years. If we dont do that, I foresee our resources will be severely affected in the post-GST situation when compensation stops after four years.The Green Revolution must move eastwards. Punjab should be relieved of this duty of growing foodgrains for the country. We have done this duty for 60 years, but in this process we have poisoned our soil, depleted our aquifers and water sources. Let Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, which form the natural food bowl of India, do that duty.We are saying instead of rice, we will be very interested in growing maize. As long as we get the MSP or a little bit of hand-holding, Punjab could become Denmark of India. Why should there not be MSP on milk, fruits, or vegetables? If you study the food policy of India, it is rooted in the 1960s and Green Revolution was the main thrust at the time.If you look at an average Indian, he is malnourished. So now, the Union government should change the food policy to nutrition policy. An average man should have the access to fruit, milk and vegetables, and Punjab could step in as the producer of milk, fruits and vegetables. And, this is how we can remodel and maize could be one of the options.Of course, maize would give as much income or cash as rice would. There would be no problem of stubble burning as well. It will take care of all that.I think that is the political line. The Punjab government is basically trying to assess the electricity requirement. At present, any transmission losses or any inefficiencies of the electricity board are actually all being billed to free power. This is only a pilot project. We are trying to tell farmers that every tubewell costs us, say Rs 48,000 per year. We have 1.4 million pumps. So we are saying, you take this Rs 48,000 which we anyway have to give. In case, you can save power of say Rs 18,000 out of Rs 48,000 that we pay you, then Rs 18,000 is yours. There is another angle to it. We want to save water as well. If farmers accept it, we are going to go further and if not, let it remain a pilot project.We had flagged this issue with the Union finance and agriculture ministers. Maybe the CM will again meet Union minister (Ram Vilas) Paswan and we again will say, Either you take over the entire procurement operation, or reimburse us our actuals  whichever is convenient for you. Pre-GST, we have been charging some cess from the FCI, but it has been subsumed now.Food procurement exercise is inherently a lossmaking exercise to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore per year for Punjab. The Punjab government has to pay Rs 3,200 crore every year to the Centre for next 20 years. Over that, Rs 1,800 crore is the annual loss for procurement of grains. Why should we suffer a burden of Rs 5,000 crore every year? Why should we be burdened with this huge amount when we are undertaking the procurement exercise for the Centre, we are poisoning our soil and exhausting our ground water?I think we are actually selling water not the foodgrains. Every kilogram of rice takes 5,000 litres of water and every kilogram of wheat takes 3,000 litres. To get a cash credit limit, we have to first deposit that loss with the Central government before they give us the limit. We had paid Rs 1,100 crore before the wheat season.I quite agree with this. We have not been able to increase our revenue share and industry in our economy. We are dependent on the Centre. That is why I said, we need to remodel our economy.There are two huge areas I see for Punjab. One is our excise policy. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have opted for corporation model. We are not trying to go for retail mode, but trying to have wholesale part of it so that we can track every bottle that comes to the state either from our own distilleries or from outside. There is a technology to help curb sale of illegal or nontaxed liquor. My own feeling is that distillers, wholesalers and retailers are the same people. This is the area where Punjab should increase revenue by 25% every year. This year, my target is to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and next year it could go up to Rs 2,000 crore.Second area where our revenue can be increased is mining. My feeling is if we can identify additional mines and if we can install technology to check illegal mining, this is an industry worth Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. We are now generating around Rs 150-200 crore from mining compared to around Rs 45 lakh during the Akali regime. Although we had auctioned around Rs 400 crores of sand mines, some people backed out and there was some controversy.Punjab should also be looking at non-tax revenue as it has the lowest non-tax revenue collection in India. The rates have not been revised for 20-30 years. We would ask all departments to review their non-tax revenue.We have flagged this issue with the RBI and even the Union finance minister that there has been some unethical lending to the farmers by commercial banks. This must be checked because in order to achieve their targets they indulge in such things where they know that this money can never be recovered. It is beyond our purview to bring these banks to kneel. We have made a big hue and cry. The reason why we started farm debt waiver first with cooperative banks was that we did not have data from commercial banks.We have already rolled out some of the bigger promises. There were two types of promises. Ones which did not entail any financial liability like electricity subsidy to industry, or farm debt waiver. So we have already rolled out all these. For smartphones we are in talks with many companies. There are some procedural and tax issues with those firms because it is a service and soon those would be resolved. I dont think smartphones will not be handed out as promised.Sometimes tokenism is also important. Mahatama Gandhi was not short of kurtas. He was a barrister from London. But he never wore kurtas because he realized that 70% of people in India at that time never wore a shirt. I think leaders should be role models. Even tokenism of doing away with red beacons on vehicles was a decision in the same direction.It is not only about PDS. They have not allowed use of ethanol made of foodgrains. They have banned it for rice and maize.At this moment, if I look at the total under the MSP regime what the farmers are being paid is about Rs 55,000 crore and the subsidy bill of power, which is the biggest subsidy, is around Rs 6,000 crore. It would add up to around 15% of the total compensation which is being paid to farmers. At this moment I feel that farmers are not able to take that 15%. That would be a huge blow.We will have to carry on with it till such time when we can have farms up and running. It is not possible at the moment. Basically, you have to prioritise, what needs to be done. In Punjab, human resource needs to be upgraded in a massive way.Manpreet Badal is not a first-time finance minister, he was the finance minister in the Akali government as well. Despite that he has not been able to generate resources and has been taking the shelter of empty coffers left by the SAD-BJP government. If he cannot implement the promises made in the election manifesto and cannot improve the financial condition of the state, it is better for him to give up the post. It is for the first time that the salaries of employees are being delayed. How will there be development in the state? At the same time, he has been making unrealistic promises of making Punjab revenue surplus in next four years.The Punjab finance minister has always been begging for financial support from the Union government when the state government has not even been able to distribute funds released by the Centre for various welfare schemes. One of the best examples is the post-matric scholarship for the Scheduled Caste students where around Rs 115 crore sent by the Centre has not been released by the state. Finance department sher-oshayari se nahi chalta. Jab Raja hi mast ho jayega to wazir se kya umeed ki ja sakti hai? Salaries are not being paid on time to employees, pensions are not being distributed for months, and farm debt waiver has not been properly implemented. What to talk about distribution of smartphones to youth as promised in the election manifesto?It seems to be a totally confused government. The Congress govt totally miscalculated Rs 15,000 crore revenue in its first budget. The finance dept doesnt seem to be in the loop of the decisions being taken by other departments. I had asked them during the last budget session where they would generate Rs 10,000 crore revenue from when they do not have any concrete roadmap. The state cannot borrow more than 3% of the GSDP. The Congress government has not been able to even implement announcements made in the last years budget. They have not even cleared the DA and arrears to employees till date and salaries are being delayed every month."

We have taken out all the organic matter from the soil, its down to 0.4% when it should be above 3%. Our nitrogen use efficiency has also gone down. Salinisation is affecting southern Punjab. Our farmers are using free electricity to pump more water than required. I spoke to Parkash Singh Badal when he was chief minister, about the need to stop free power (to farm tubewells), but he said he couldnt roll it back. Somebody has to bite the bullet and stop free electricity. Punjab farmers can afford to pay their electricity bills. In the long term, climate change will also affect Punjab adversely. The Himalayas are heating up at double the rate of the rest of India. When the glaciers start retreating, we will start losing our water resources.Why is farming no longer profitable?Our productivity is stagnating due to the improper use of water and fertilisers, while the cost of production is going up every year. Punjabs farmers are in a bind. The crop production here is comparable with other countries, but, nationally, our productivity is much lower. Even Bangladesh has better rice productivity than us.In a rather blunt message to the state, Niti Ayog has said it does not need Punjabs foodgrains for national food security, and that farmers should be encouraged to sell their crops in the open market. What are your views?This means the productivity of grains in eastern India and Madhya Pradesh is going up. The production of wheat in MP, for instance, is quite high. The demand for foodgrains is bound to fall after people reach a certain level of prosperity. People will then demand more vegetables, milk, and meat. We should start thinking of alternative crops right now, even though the switch may take several years. And we have to start reducing the area under wheat and paddy (rice).The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill.Can farmers be convinced to switch to other crops without an accompanying minimum support price?The solution is to grow alternative crops. If you can provide MSP for other crops, it will be good. Wheat can be replaced with mustard. We import oil worth billions. Mustard is one crop that can reduce our imports.You led international research that revolutionised the rice productivity the world over. But, ironically,rice is seen today as a villain of the piece in Punjab. Why?Yes, I have heard rice being blamed for all kinds of problems, including cancer, which is an exaggeration. But rice has caused the depletion of aquifers. We must reduce the area under rice from 3 million acres to 1.5 million acres in the next few years. North China faced the same problem, and the government finally put an end to rice production there. Soybean can be a good alternative to rice. Its an oil and protein crop, which is very productive and can yield an average of 4 tonnes an acre. I have been urging Punjab Agricultural University to breed a soybean variety that can be grown successfully in Punjab. Hybrid maize is also a good alternative as it is great feed for poultry and animals.There is an indication that the central government may completely do away with MSP. What do you think about that?If that happens, farmers will no longer be that determined to grow wheat and rice. Scrapping MSP may do some good.Why has much-talked about diversification failed to take off in Punjab?We have been hearing about diversification for several years but nothing has changed on the ground. Farmers continue to grow wheat and rice because of the MSP and high profitability. Punjabs agriculture owes its profitability to rice, and the state government gave free electricity; why would a farmer not grow rice!Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farm income by 2022. Is that possible?No, I dont think that will happen, because there are too many people dependent on agriculture and the farm sizes are too small to be profitable. The only way you can double farm income is by moving a lot of people from farms. China did that by moving farmers with 1-acre landholding to construction industry and other fields. Major investments in livestock industry can make a difference but unfortunately we cant export meat.What do you think of farm suicides?I understand these are due to farm indebtedness, and that itself is due to two reasons. One, every farmers wants to buy a tractor even if his landholding doesnt justify it. I wonder why banks give loans to such small farmers knowing that they dont need a tractor and wouldnt be able to repay the loan. Also, there is the problem of unproductive loans due to the practice of ostentatious marriages, et al.Capt Amarinder Singhs Congress government came to power on the promise of farm debt waiver. Is that a solution?They are doing this to get more votes. But where are they going to get the money for paying off this debt? I think it is not a solution but a political promise.The Centre wants Punjab to club all the subsidies and pay them directly to the bank account of individual farmer. Will that work?I dont know about other subsidies but, if this can stop free power, it will be a very important step. The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill. Its an unnecessary burden. No economist will agree to this. Where will be funds for any development if the government spends so much on free power? There should be meters on motors (tubewells).Coming to tech generation, public investment in agriculture research was 0.8% at the end of the 12th Plan, but it was slashed to 0.4% in 2016-2017. Whats your take?How can you double farm income without investing in research on new varieties? Then there is the national policy on not using GMO (genetically modified organism) crops even though these can improve farm productivity. But someone in the government cant make up his mind. Very senior professors in the US have written to both former PM Manmohan Singh and the present PM Modi, but to no avail. GM mustard is excellent, but the government of India has not approved it even though it imports GM canola oil from Canada.Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will.What do you think of the role of Punjab Agricultural University in the present scenario?PAU was one of the top universities of India with very good research; but it has declined. That is very unfortunate. Two-three years ago, the V-C did not even have funds to pay the salary or pension of his employees.The share of agriculture in rural employment stands at 64%. Most farmers would like to quit given a choice. Why do Punjab youngsters want to go abroad instead of tilling the fields?Our farms are so small that our youngsters dont want to work on them. Also, there is no industry left in Punjab. Be it Jalandhar, Batala or Goraya, industry has died because the government paid no attention to it. There is a problem of quality of governance.What would be your advice to the Punjab government?I think the Punjab government has to pay proper attention to PAU and ensure better research for diversification. If you cant stop free electricity at once, do it step by step. It is very important for the future of Punjabs agriculture. The state government is doing a great disservice to Punjab farmers by giving them free power. I hope Capt Amarinder will do away with it. The government must also improve the state of schools in villages. It is pitiable. Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will. There are two big examples of what one good leader can do. Former chief minister Partap Singh Kairon introduced murabbabandi (land consolidation), while Lachhman Singh Gill built a network of link roads. We need another Kairon or Gill to improve the state of our agriculture and schools.Why did you not join PAU as a vice-chancellor even though successive state governments approached you?I didnt think I would be able to work with the politicians here. I dont think I could work under the conditions here. Also, I enjoyed my research so much that there was no reason for me to change my course."

After recording his statement, police along with Sukhdevs elder son Jatinder went to Neelon to trace Vipin, who also worked as an autorickshaw driver. Near the bus stand, Jatinder spotted Vipin standing near his autorickshaw (PB1310CL-2606).During interrogation, Vipin admitted to have axed the family. He said Sukhdev and his family had been visiting him for the past one year. One day, Sukhdev told him that he had sold sold his land. Thinking that he must have kept the money at home, Vipin went to his house on March 1 and asked him to make boiled rice and throw its water in Neelon canal for good luck, Shukla added.The sorcerer then gave them sedative-laced water. He asked them to go to separate rooms, lay on the mats and close their eyes for prayers. When they slipped into unconsciousness, he first slaughtered Sukhdev and then Gurmeet. On hearing his parents shrieks, Harjot woke up. But Vipin told him that the noises were part of a ritual. He then slaughtered him as well after tying his hands, said Ludhiana range deputy inspector general Gursharan Singh Sandhu.Vipin ransacked the house, but found no money. Even as he left the axe on a bed, he made off with two mobile phones and as many ATM cards. One of the mobile phones and an ATM card, besides the sedatives, have been recovered from his house, the cop added.Inspector general of police said both Sukhdev and Vipin had met at a dera. Sukhdev had told Vipin a fortnight ago that he had 15 kilograms of poppy husk at home which would fetch him a pretty penny.Police said Sukhdev frequented the dera was desperate for good times for his family as his younger son couldnt go to Germany for work and wanted good job for his elder son apart from good luck for his family so he hired the services of Tantrik. They added that the familys earning was just around Rs.9000 of which they would Rs.2500 as rent.Sukhdev had left job some months ago: SSP Khanna Navjot Singh Mahal said that Sukhdev was doing job of Chowkidar at a factory in Dhandari Kalan area of Ludhiana but had quit the job some months ago."
5aeac2df9855b73f522c2fab,The 80:20 Gold Import Controversy,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/pnb-fraud-the-80-20-gold-import-controversy/story-IU4esuxKilmqqowbm0DNQP.html,2018-03-09,"The 80:20 bullion rule has been in the news in recent days, and formed one part of the Union governments efforts to deflect criticism from its handling of the fraud at the Punjab National Bank (PNB) and turn up the heat on the opposition United Progressive Alliance (UPA).On 21 May 2014, five days after the UPA government was defeated at the polls and five days before the new National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took over, the UPA took a decision allowing so-called star trading houses (STHs), premier trading houses (PTHs), and units located in special export zones (SEZs) to import gold and sell up to 80% of the imports in the local market.Until then, the rule had been that such firms could only import gold under the condition that all of it would be exported (after converting it to jewellery). The change resulted in a spike in gold imports. In the six months between June 1 and November 30, 2014, gold imports rose to 553 tonnes. Of these imports, almost 60% was accounted for by 13 PTHs and STHs.Traders hoarded the metal, benefiting from lower import prices. The May 21, 2014 notification of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) making the change overturned an August 14, 2013 notification by RBI that disallowed STHs, PTHs, and units in SEZs from importing gold to sell in the domestic market. The only entities allowed to do so were banks and a few other agencies (and these were further required to ensure that 20% of their imports were re-exported). The objective of the August notification was to restrict import of gold for use in the domestic market, and, thereby, contain Indias swelling current account deficit.The Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association cried foul at the change in policy which, it alleged in a July 26, 2014 letter to the RBI, helped only large private trading houses and conglomerates, many of which had no history of gold imports, and were not interested in promoting the jewellery business. (They) do not have a mechanism to ensure the end use of gold sold, the letter said  as 20% would have to be re-exported  and they are engaged in circular/fictitious export.The NDA subsequently (towards the end of 2014) scrapped the August, 2014 change.The 13 trading houses that increased their imports during the period for which the scheme was active are: Rajesh Exports, MD Overseas, Kundan Rice Mills, Kanak Exports, Edelweiss Commodities, Zaveri & Co, Riddhi Siddhi Bullions, Khandwala Enterprise, Jindal Dyechem, Gopal Jewels, Reliance Industries, Gitanjali Gems, and Su-Raj Diamonds."
5b16f9eb9855b72ada089038,The food we don’t like to eat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-food-we-dont-like-to-eat/article23037619.ece,2018-03-11,"While other people collect pottery or autographed bats, I collectpeoples food phobias. Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."
5b2e59c69855b72640115a1d,Spicing up sweet chocolate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/664106/spicing-up-sweet-chocolate.html,2018-03-11,"The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Limited (Campco), which is well known for bailing arecanut and cocoa farmers out of distress during the price fall many years ago, is embarking on an extensive diversification-cum-expansion drive.The multi-state cooperative society between Karnataka and Kerala is all set to shake up the cashewnut and coconut markets, as part of its expansion programme.Campco was started in 1973 by its founder president Varanasi Subraya Bhat, when there was a sudden marketing crisis in arecanut.Foray into chocolatesCampco set up a chocolate factory for creating market for cocoa, when farmers were in distress in the early 1980s, with help from the Karnataka government and the Centre. The then President of India Giani Zail Singh inaugurated the facility on September 1, 1986.In fact, Campco's chocolate factory at Puttur is South India's only such facility, and the country's second in the cooperative sector. The other chocolate factory belonging to Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited) is in Gujarat.Right from 10 products (chocolate varieties) in 1986, to 23 varieties (including one drinking chocolate) today, Campco has come a long way. In fact, until 1997, all the chocolates available under the Nestle brand were supplied by Campco. Though Nestle opened its firm in 1997 in Goa, Campco continues to supply chocolates (approximately 5,000 tonnes per annum) to the MNC even to this day, says Campco Managing Director MSuresh Bhandary.New flavoursThough the products of Campco were highly affordable with a unique taste, they were not available at malls and high-end stores until two months ago. However, the recent launch of six varieties of premium chocolate (without vegetable fat) are available in many parts of India, including Karnataka, Kerala, Hyderabad, Ghaziabad, Jaipur, Punjab and Kolkata.The newly launched premium chocolates are:Moments - dark chocolate with ginger; Dietier - sugar-free dark chocolate; Milk Marvel - soft and silky milk chocolate; Milk n Milk - with chocolate with rice crispies; Fun Tan - dark chocolate with hint of mint; and Fun Tan - dark chocolate which is slightly bitter.Though each bar costs Rs 100, the gift box (with six pieces) is available for Rs 500, which are available at airports as well as malls, among other places.Besides retail sales, Campco also supplies bulk chocolates to industries, weighing up to 1 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg slabs. ""The industrial supply accounts for about 6,000 tonnes per annum,"" says Bhandary, adding that even Amul buys chocolate butter from Campco.A lesser known fact about Campco is that it supplies chocolates to the Indian Navy at the latter's Mumbai, as well as Visakhapatnam bases. ""They have purchased 23 tonnes of chocolate in the last four months,"" he says.Plans are also on the anvil to market Campco chocolates to the Armed Forces (including the Air Force and Army) and the Indian Railways, and the same is under process, says Bhandary.Currently, the capacity utilisation of the factory is more than 70%. The Campco chocolate factory at Puttur, about 60 kms from Mangaluru in Dakshina Kannada district, has the capacity to produce 23,000 tonnes per annum.Campco's share in retail chocolate market is 7% and it plans to increase the same to 12-15% in the next three years. Mondelez (earlier Cadbury) holds a majority 70% share, followed by Nestle with an estimated 15-16% share, according to Bhandary.Campco stands in the second position as far as industrial chocolates are concerned, with a production of 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes per annum.Out of 20,000 tonnes of cocoa requirement in India, up to 13,000 tonnes is procured from farmers, while the remaining 7,000 tonnes is imported from Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana, among other countries. Out of 13,000 tonnes, about 3,600 tonnes is handled by Campco, while the remaining quantity by other handlers, Bhandary informs.He says that Campco is carrying out extensive R&D to develop more varieties of chocolate with natural ingredients.Capacity expansionEarlier this year, Campco commissioned a new amenity building at its chocolate factory in Puttur that conforms to the international food safety standards and zoning of processing area as per FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) standards, Campco President S R Satishchandra says.Built at a cost of Rs 13 crore, the building is spread over 42,000 sq feet.It has also laid the foundation stone for a master godown for arecanut, pepper and rubber at Kavu in Puttur taluk of the district. To be built at a cost of Rs 19 crore, the godown will have a built-up area of 1 lakh sq feet, and will be completed in 24 months, Satishchandra adds.It is worth mentioning here that 40% of Campco's 1,07,000 members cultivate cocoa along with arecanut in Karnataka as well as Kerala. At the same time, scientists from the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) fromVittal as well as Kasargod educate the growers on cultivation and pruning, besides providing technical guidance.The cooperative had purchased 53,720 metric tonnes of arecanut valued at Rs 1,308 crore, including 23,946 metric tonnes of red variety, valued at Rs 624 crore, and 29,774 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 684 crore, and sold 53,806 MT, valued at Rs 1,362 crore, including 24,890 MTof red variety, valued at Rs 656 crore, and 28,915 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 705 crore.Foray into new areasHitherto, Campco, with a record turnover of Rs 1,600 crore in the financial year 2017, and with a net profit of Rs 26.22 crore, was procuring directly from farmers and selling arecanut, cocoa, pepper and rubber in the states of Karnataka and Kerala.This year the cooperative is all set to enter the FMCG segment by foraying into marketing of coconut oil and cashew nuts that have good demand in the market.""Campco, during its last general body meeting, had proposed amendments to its bylaw, to market cashew, coconut products and FMCG segment, and it would be soon approved from the Central registrar,"" Bhandary says, and added that once it gets approval from the authorities concerned, it would foray into marketing of coconut oil and cashew products.""Plans are on the anvil to develop the brand, and a processing unit may be started within 12 to 15 months,""he hopes.As far as pepper is concerned, half kg packs of pepper under 'Kaala Sona' brand are already produced at Campco's Baikampady unit since the last six months.DH News Service"

Jointly addressing the newspersons here on Friday, AAP-backed Rajya Sabha member Sushil Gupta and Haryana unit head Navin Jaihind said this while elaborating on the partys plans for March 25 rally in Hisar and thereafter the general and assembly elections next year.We have the Delhi model of education and public health to offer when it comes to governance. Now students from reputed schools have started taking admission in the government schools in Delhi due to raised standards of education. Similarly, you can see that the national government too has picked up our model of mohalla clinics, said Gupta.However, Gupta avoided queries related to reactions of AAP leaders in Punjab in the wake of apology tendered by Kejriwal to Akali leader Bikram Majithia for linking him to drug trade in Punjab. Responding to same question, Jaihind said, Kejriwal has to concentrate on governance in the state. Secondly, there is nothing wrong in tendering an apology.Haryana unit of AAP on Friday said the party workers would hand over a chargesheet highlighting the corruption and wrongdoings of Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government to its convener Arvind Kejriwal during his Hisar rally on March 25.They said party workers were finalizing the contents of chargesheet which would include corruption at all levels across the state.Referring to the Hisar rally, Gupta said it would be a landmark event and bigger than those organized by the Congress, BJP and INLD held in Hodal, Jind and New Delhi, respectively.Unlike petrol rally and other rallies organized by CBI ( Congress BJP and INLD), our workers will reach there on their own. We cannot offer petrol, money and other things, hence we are distributing yellow rice as an invite. So far as the party is concerned, AAP has emerged as the only alternative in the state, said Jaihind. Gupta also said that AAP was the only option for the people now."
5b1475a69855b7624638008f,Farming in Tamil Nadu ready for a turnaround,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farming-in-tamil-nadu-ready-for-a-turnaround/article23345688.ece,2018-03-25,"Nearly six years ago, R. Muthukumar, who studied at the National Institute of Fashion Technology, Chennai, returned to his village, Karungalikuppam, about 20 km from Tiruvannamalai town, after working in a couple of metro cities, including Bengaluru.Now a farmer owning around 4.8 acres of dry land, Mr. Muthukumar, who is in his mid-30s, has seen changes happening in the way agriculture is practised in his village and surrounding areas. For instance, the level at which groundwater can be spotted is going deeper and deeper, an outcome largely due to the policy of free power supply for farmers, he says. In the beginning, I could get water at about 10 m. Now, we have to go down at least 23 m, he says.But that is not the only change Mr. Muthukumar has observed. At one point of time, I did not have anyone here to discuss the system of rice intensification (SRI), a method of cultivation involving less use of water, seeds and input. My people did not relish the idea as they were used to flood irrigation. But they no longer remain so, he says, adding that he has found many progressive farmers in nearby villages experimenting with innovative methods.Karungalikuppam is not a solitary example. Enjampalli, a tiny village near Modakurichi in Erode district, is no less different. Other than paddy, maize and cotton are being grown increasingly. Drip irrigation is gaining greater currency these days.Subtle shifts have started happening in the farm sector in Tamil Nadu and the farmers, by and large, are alive to the trends and emerging constraints, and are ready to adapt. While innovative policy interventions can be thought of to support them and fix smaller problems without causing too much disruption, the elephant in the room that needs immediate attention is the dismal groundwater situation.Open to ideasI can see more educated youngsters coming into this sector and taking up farming with the help of modern technology, says R. Subramanian, a 54-year-old farmer with an experience of over 30 years, dispelling the notion that present-day agriculture is full of senior citizens.As late as about 10 years ago, farmers of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts, despite being in dry areas, were not receptive to drip irrigation even when the State government had decided to implement a scheme, recounts E. Vadivel, former Dean of the Horticulture Department in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). Now, the same method is used even for water-intensive crops such as sugarcane.For years, N. Doraisamy, a soldier-turned-farmer, kept as wasteland an area of about three acres in Ananthapuram Mathura, Padavedu block, Tiruvannamalai district. Thanks to a government subsidy scheme for micro-irrigation, coupled with assistance from the Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the land is fully covered with drip irrigation now.I am raising mango, sapota plum and gooseberry. I hope to get Rs. 1.5 lakh, says Mr. Doraisamy, adding that but for the new facility, he would have raised such crops only during September-January and earned a few thousands of rupees. The work in Padavedu is one of a number of projects being carried out by the SST, a 22-year-old body engaged in a host of initiatives concerning rural communities and urban slums in five States.Dry lands in 25 districts have now become the target of the State Agriculture Department for a Rs. 803 crore programme of sustainable agriculture. Though it is too early to assess the impact of the scheme which was launched a year ago, the department claims that the area of cultivation for millets went up by 22% and for pulses, 18%.Significantly, this initiative enables farmers buy farm implements such as tractors and rotovators, which, in turn, can be given on rent to other farmers at cheaper rates. A government subsidy covers 80% of the cost of the machines. In Karungalikuppam of Tiruvannamalai district, a group of young farmers, instead of taking loans to meet the remaining cost of the implements, pooled their savings to acquire them.Crop diversificationCrop diversification is also catching on. During kuruvai [short-term cultivation season], even in the Cauvery delta, do you think we are all raising paddy? It is cotton, quips P. R. Pandian, a Mannargudi-based leader of agriculturists. The coverage of cotton in the delta during 2016-17 was 17 lakh acres. This year, the plan is to extend it to 21 lakh acres, notes K. Ramasamy, TNAU Vice-Chancellor.Rainfed areas, also known as dry lands, too do not appear to be lagging. In the southern districts, the belt between Srivilliputhur and Tirunelveli, where paddy was ordinarily raised during the Samba cultivation season (September-January), of late has seen maize being grown. A report by the Department of Land Resources in the Union Rural Development Ministry a few years ago commended the State, stating that the adoption of new oilseed crops, especially soyabean and sunflower in Tamil Nadu, is [a] testimony to the potential for rapid changes in rainfed areas.Meanwhile, the State is in the midst of another experiment  collective farming  which is in its early days. The concept, not altogether new to Tamil Nadu, is the new mantra of the State government. Its idea is to organise marginal and small farmers, who constitute 92% of the whole community of agriculturists, into groups and, eventually, bigger organisations or even companies. This year, Rs. 100 crore was set apart for the scheme.On productivity too, the States performance is better than the national average and that of other States. According to the findings of a 2017 study of the PRS Legislative Research on agriculture, Tamil Nadu (3,191 kg per hectare) comes next only to Punjab (3,838 kg/ha) at the all-India level in terms of yield for rice for 2014-15, even though its record is not that impressive with regard to yield for food grains [which includes pulses and millets too] as a whole.Chronic problemsWhile these are the positives, chronic problems plague agriculture, including labour shortage, dependence on private lenders, absence of fair and remunerative prices for produce, and hurdles in marketing. However, the foremost is the lack of efficiency in water use. In times of crisis, farmers behave in an exemplary manner. But, once the situation improves, it is all back to business as usual. Such an attitude cannot continue for long, feels Dr. Vadivel.The way groundwater resources are being depleted in the State has disturbed M.P. Vasimalai, an alumnus of theIndian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. In his native village of Ezhumalai near Usilampatti in Madurai district, we are not able to raise one crop today whereas we once did three crops a year. It is because of indiscriminate use of groundwater, thanks to energised pumpsets. There are about 20.6 lakh such pumpsets all over the State.His anecdotal account is supported by a number of studies by both official and independent bodies, all pointing to the situation that is, in his words, leading to a catastrophe. Mr. Vasimalai, the founder-executive director of the DHAN Foundation, says desertification is happening across the State, and, despite the creation of farm ponds, percolation ponds and other water harvesting structures under schemes including the latest one on dry land farming, more steps are needed.Flood irrigation should be banned in areas where water is being pumped. Only drip irrigation should be allowed. Then, you can reduce water consumption by least 25%, Dr. Ramasamy says, expressing concern over the increasing occurrence of salinity intrusion in groundwater.Groundwater lawThere is no sight of the government coming out with a law again to regulate groundwater extraction, even though over four years have lapsed since the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa chose to repeal the 2003 Act, the creation of her previous regime. The assurance given to the public at the time of withdrawal was that soon there would be a comprehensive and workable law. One of the principal objections to the old law was the lack of clarity on the definition of marginal and small farmers.The farmer from Enjampalli in Erode is not averse to fixing tariff for farm connections, a subject regarded in political circles as a hot potato. A reasonable rate for the power supply can be levied, suggests Mr. Subramanian, adding that this will also pave the way for efficient use of groundwater.Deepa Kumar, who is running a network of young farmers to promote organic farming near Denhanikotta of Krishnagiri district, has a radical idea. Even for agriculture, you can take electricity connection under commercial tariff and still make your farming profitable, as there is enormous scope for using water judiciously through natural or organic farming, says the farmer in her late 30s, adding that members of her network have given up their jobs in the IT sector to pursue farming.Contrary to the position of the officials in Chennai, the governments latest scheme on dry land agriculture does cover farmers who have taken electricity connections for pump sets, as noticed by this reporter in Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai and Krishnagiri districts.Tweaking policyThe government is promoting collective farming to counter the effects of fragmentation of land holdings. Mr. Pandian says that while he is not against it per se, the farmers, after getting organised into FPGs or FPOs, should not be left at the mercy of the corporate sector for price negotiations on commercial transactions.They cannot match the power and resources of large corporate groups. So, the government should perform its role as an effective regulator, he says.Another aspect that the government should keep in mind is that procedures for setting up value addition facilities, such as processing mills for pulses, should be made simple. In Radhapuram near Thandirampattu of Tiruvannamalai district, it took two years for farmers to get approvals from various departments to set up one such mill and, after three months of commissioning the facility, they are still struggling for a three-phase power supply.There are also larger issues that affect the farmers. A substantial section of farmers is not ready to take to alternative crops, notwithstanding various measures to attract their attention. Left to any farmer, paddy is still the first choice. During 2016-17, cotton was raised in a big way but prices crashed, and the farmer had no system of minimum support price for support.There is a general complaint in Villupuram and Krishnagiri about unilateral actions of secretaries of Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies (PACCS) in disbursing of crop loans.This is one of the reasons for farmers approaching private lenders. A senior official at the office of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies acknowledges the prevalence of the problem and says that as of now, there is no provision to get erring secretaries of PACCS transferred. The government is working on this issue.Road aheadWith all the problems and issues plaguing the sector, the young Muthkumars and Deepa Kumars are yet confident of making a difference through cohesive networks, deployment of latest technologies and the acquisition of knowledge. After all, it is their firm belief that without modernisation of agriculture, food security cannot be guaranteed in a sustained way.We are not able to raise one crop today whereas we once did three crops a yearM.P.

(Express photo by Gurmeet Singh) Khanna grain market. (Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)As wheat procurement process is likely to start from the first week of April, Punjab government has made a few amendments in its newly-framed policy in wake of a boycott by the truck unions of the state, protesting less prices they are being offered this time as compared to last year.As per the amendment, rice sheller and commission agents (Ahrtiya) associations of respective districts can also participate in the tender process for transporting grains from mandis to godowns, in case the tenders are not allotted in three consecutive times.It needs to be mentioned that out of 134 clusters of mandis in Malwa and Doaba, tenders for not more than 14-15 have been allotted to truckers. The rest did not participate in the tender process. This year a capping of 120 per cent has been kept on basic rates, which was not there last year, due to which truckers feel that they will be under heavy losses.However, in order to let the procurement work start in mandis from coming April, Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of respective districts have approached the rice shellers and ahrtiyas to participate in the tender process.Ghanshyam Thori, DC, Sangrur, confirmed that as the truck unions have gone on strike and not participated in the tender process, they have asked people from outside to take part. We have received positive response from rice shellers as well as ahrtiyas. They have over 1,000 large trucks, which can keep the work going. At the same time, we are hopeful that truckers will also fall in line soon, said the Thori.The government has given another relaxation of giving a CAs certificate, showing working capital of any firm, for participating in the tender process. Earlier, the transporters needed to show a banks working capital certificate, which most of them had denied.The transporters have also been asked to give a manual list of truck numbers to the district administration office instead of uploading them on an e-vahan software. The above relaxations have been done to attract the truckers as they were not ready to give their last years working capital certificate and upload the exact number of truck numbers on the vahan software.Happy Sandhu, president of Punjabs truck union, said only a few have applied in the tender process in Malwa and Doaba. We have not got any call from state government for talks and we are being threatened to face police cases if we stop others. However, time will tell how we are going to respond to this threat, he said.Sandhu added that the DCs have planned to enroll even the trolley owners for lifting, which they will not let happen.For all the latest Ludhiana News, download Indian Express App"

A narrative of north versus south, them versus us, Centre versus states with splices of rationality riveted with rhetoric has come to occupy centre stage.Context crafts the contours of dissent, discord and discourse. The immediate provocation is the change in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, set up to design devolution of funds to states. Population is and has been a determinant of allocation. Hitherto, Finance Commissions used the 1971 data. The 15th FC will use 2011 data. States with lower population assert that they will be shortchanged.On Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan used Facebook and Twitter, no less, to state: Presently, Kerala receives only a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee of tax it contributes to the Union, Tamil Nadus benefit is a mere 40 and Karnataka gets only 47 paisa. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh receives `1.79 for every rupee they contribute. The new move will further aggravate this disparity.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, tagging the CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Puducherry, tweeted: This will further affect the interests of the south: we need to resist. DMK leader M K Stalin charged the Centre with unilateralism and wrote to 10 CMs, including those of the south, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, already in a face-off with the Centre, called out, There is nothing called Centres or States money. It is the taxpayers money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre, but they are diverting the money to the development of the north.Assertions aside, the actuality is that states with smaller populations and lower rates of growth in population could be affected. It is also true that use of data from 1971, when India had 54 crore people, in 2018, when the population is 131 crore, is irrational. Besides, population is only one of the factorsothers, including progress in moving towards a replacement rate of population growth, will deliver compensatory dividends.Political narratives are rarely linear. The southern states have delivered better outcomes and the anger is about the incentive structures and the lack of disincentives. The articulation and the underlying angst is less about who is getting more and more about how states that do less get more.In 1960, the government of India identified the 100 most backward districts. Over 80 of them were from the Hindi heartlandBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Four decades later, a study on the 100 worst districts by this author found that laggards continued to lag. After much was said and done, little had changed. In 2001, a study by N J Kurian found that not a single district from Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh figured among the top 100 districts of India.It is true that the Constitution obliges governments to deliver a minimum level of public goods and services. Ergo population matters. But so does governance. Poor governance is best illustrated by the level of vacancies in the fields of education, health care and security. The largest numbers of teacher vacancies are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The largest number of vacant posts for police personnel is in Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar, the hospital bed to population ratio is one bed per 8,681 persons. Bihar has 40,043 registered allopathic doctors for over 10 crore persons, Uttar Pradesh has 65,343 for over 20 crore people.Governance requires interventions, and some of the most transformative interventions have been in the south. It is, therefore, shocking to find Control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures among the terms of reference of the 15th FC. Fact is what is populist today most often than not becomes policy sooner or later.When M G Ramachandran introduced midday meals in Tamil Nadu in 1982, it was considered populist. It became policy in 1995. The 1983 two-rupee rice scheme of N T Rama Rao led to the National Food Security Act. The 1960s EGS was born south of the Vindhyas in Maharashtra, and became MGNREGS. Amma canteens are now sprouting in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as are fair price medicine shops.The schism is not necessarily geographicit is about performers and non-performe0rs. On October 29, 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the 14th Finance Commission and urged a paradigm shift in the approach. He argued that the Centre share 50 per cent of the divisible pool and that fiscal discipline, revenue collection and contribution to national growth be factored in for allocation. The argument is just as valid in 2018.Article 1 of the Constitution states, India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. This is us. That said, there is no mistaking the discontent bordering on alienation born out of a real and perceived sense of discrimination coloured by social, cultural, religious, political and economic interests. Perception is a high-octane volatile cocktail of facts, fancies, finger-pointing and frailties. Embedded therein are questions that demand dialogue, debate and a dtente of thoughts. To argue that much of it is political is to state the obvious. There is no politics without economics. shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

In short distance category (within eight kilometres), labour and cartage contracts have been finalised for 165 of the 314 clusters.With truck unions boycotting the tendering process, the response from rice millers and other splinter groups has provided much-needed relief to state authorities. They had allowed rice millers to participate in the tendering process for transportation of wheat from grain markets to storage godowns.Special helpline, security for biddersThe government, which has refused to give in to the truck operators agitating against its decision to cap the rates, has deployed 1,000 police personnel to provide security to bidders and set up a special 181 toll free helpline, said the officer requesting anonymity. The state top brass had on Friday considered the possibility invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to ensure smooth procurement and transportation of wheat in the state in case the truck operators do not fall in line or create trouble.Punjab Truck Operators Union president Happy Sandhu, who first held a meeting of working committee of all unions and then met the state officials in Patiala, said there was no headway as the government refused to increase the rate and the truck operators were not willing to carry foodgrains at the rate being offered.We suggested Rs 2,200 a day plus diesel from the department for carrying nine tonnes of wheat for a distance of nine kms as against Rs 1,650 being offered. But, they said the centre does not give that much, he said.Unions meet on April 3The union has asked all its district chiefs to meet the operaters in their respective areas to take their view and will hold another meeting at Sahnewal on April 3 to decide its future strategy. The state transporters have been charging high rates for carrying foodgrains in the past 8 to 10 years, bleeding the state exchequer. However, the fund-crunched government decided this time to align the rates with the reimbursement it gets from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for transporation of wheat and paddy procured in the state."

But foodgrain purchase remained slow at 17-18 lakh tonne every month, at least 2 lakh tone less than the past years.The state procurement agencies are having a tough time as a stalemate has prevailed between truckers and the Punjab government over the cap imposed on wheat transportation rates. To deal with this situation, senior Punjab government officials are contemplating to impose Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) on truckers for smooth transportation of wheat.The state has a total closed storage capacity of 153 lakh tonnes, of which FCI has 103 lakh tonne capacity while five state procurement agencies have the rest of the storage.Right now, warehouses in Punjab have 26 lakh tonne wheat of the previous season and 90 lakh tonne rice. FCI is waiting for handing over of 14 lakh tonne rice by the state rice mills. It is going to be a tough season for us as wheat is usually not stored in open plinths. We have closed storage area available for only 35 lakh tonnes, said a senior FCI officer.We have come up with a storage policy and have called for expressions of interest (EoIs) to arrange cover and plinths space for wheat storage, said Anandita Mitra, director food and civil supplies, Punjab.She said the government will manage to store the wheat if the arrival remains somewhere between 118-120 lakh tonnes but they may face difficulty if procurement reaches 130 lakh tonne mark as predicted by the state agriculture department.We are hoping that pace of foodgrain lifting by the Centre picks up to make the situation easy, said Mitra."

As far as the names of staffers who failed to check the embezzlement, are concerned, it is sure that there were supervisory lapses that paved the way for the embezzlement. In the investigation, it would be checked whether they were involved in the wrongdoings.The director said they would know the exact loss of the paddy on Thursday when the physical inquiry will conclude.A team of food department, led by additional director rice Amarjit Singh, was in Amritsar to investigate the shortfall. Singh said there are a large number of godowns owned by Veeru Mal, which were checked and it was found that 400 truckloads of paddy was missing.The said rice mills have also obtained a cash credit limit of Rs 200 crore from Punjab National Bank (PNB). It came to the notice of the bank officials and the food department after they found that the mills dont have the required stocks.PNB general manager PS Chauhan confirmed that the owner, who is now absconding, has taken Rs 200 crore cash credit limit and said, We are moving against the miller legally and will take possession of the property which has foodgrains and machinery as collateral.The bank officials on Monday also asked the Amritsar police and local administration to take control of the rice mills as their owner couldnt be found at the known addresses.Our directions were clear that a miller cant pledge the foodgrain stocks, but in this case he went against regulations. So, we are moving for an action against him, said a food department official, on condition of anonymity."

Now, the government has gone a step further by deciding to allot transportation work directly to arhtiyas on nomination basis in such clusters, said an officer privy to the development.Principal Secretary, food and supplies, KAP Sinha has written to Mandi Board for fixation of transportation charges per quintal per kilometre payable to arhtiyas during the Rabi season 2018-19.The Mandi Board fixes the rates of cleaning, weighing, stitching and loading of foodgrains for arhtiyas. This is the first-time ever commission agents are being involved in foodgrain transportation. The state has about 20,000 arhtiyas.The government move came barely hours after the Punjab Truck Operators Union, which held a meeting of its district chiefs and members of workingcommittee at Sahnewal, decided not to participate in the tendering process for wheat transportation. The boycott will continue. After the Patiala meeting, we checked with all truck operators. About 75% of them refused to work at rates being offered by the government for transportation of wheat and paddy procured in the state, said union president Happy Sandhu, putting the number of truck operators associated with his organisation at 93,000.Despite the boycott call, the state government has gone ahead with finalisation of bids. Of 402 clusters, technical bids for 205 have been finalised and financial bids will be opened on Wednesday, said the officer. In nine districts, bids for all clusters have been more or less finalised. These include Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Mansa, Pathankot, Muktsar Fazilka, Kapurthala and Ropar. In the remaining 197 clusters, only 121 bids have been received. And, it is in such clusters where there are no bids that the government intends to award the transportation work to arhtiyas.Truck operators and the state government have been at loggerheads from the time the latter decided to cap the foodgrain transportation rates.The operators were charging much higher rates than those at which reimbursement was being made by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to the state government. The FCI reimburses the government at a fixed schedule of rates (SOR) with a premium, but there was a huge disparity in rates across districts for the same distance.While the FCI paid the state about 350 crore for transportation last year, the fund-starved government had to take a hit of about Rs 175 crore, said the officer requesting anonymity.The food and supplies department decided to cap the premium at 120% over and above SOR this time. However, truck operators rejected the cap, saying they would not be able to meet their operational costs at these rates."

The inventory report is being finalized, he said.After the case of siphoning of around 1.3 lakh paddy bags came to light, chief minister Amarinder Singh had not only suspended the Amritsar district food and civil supplies controller A P Singh but also marked a vigilance probe into the alleged Rs 200 crore scam that hit the Punjab National Bank branch in Jandiala Guru.Counsel for PNB , Ravi Mahajan, said that the bank had suffered a loss of around Rs 190 crore. The bank had 16 acres of land and several other properties of Jain as collateral but that would be insufficient to cover the amount of losses incurred to bank.Mahajan said that people living in the vicinity of mill saw the Jain family fleeing in two cars on April 1. Sources said that the Jain family could have absconded to Canada as some of Gulshans family members had already taken permanent residency of Canada. Even if they had gone abroad we will seek their repatriation, said the counsel.According to reports 8.78 lakh bags of paddy was sent to mill for shelling, which delivered only 3.6 lakh bags.

Former minister and Kapurthala MLA Rana Gurjit Singh and Markfed chairman AS Samra were also present at the meeting.While truckers have now agreed to participate in the tender process, there are very few clusters left for bidding. The department has finalised the bids for 341 (about 82%) of the total 413 clusters in the state. They can bid for only 73 leftover clusters  20 of these are in the truck unions stronghold of Sangrur. The tenders for most of these will be opened in next three days. They are also hoping to participate in tenders in case the department cancels the contracts for any cluster due to default.While truck operators were adamant, rice millers and others saw an opportunity and successfully bid for transportation contracts in many clusters. The state authorities had allowed rice millers and arhtiyas (commission agents) to participate in bids in their attempt to tame the truck operators.Anindita Mitra said their talks with trucker operatives were constructive. The provisions in transportation policy were explained. They understood the situation and agreed to work with the department for smooth transportation of wheat procured in the state, she said.The department officials had held talks with truck operators on March 31 also, but they had decided to continue their boycott at that time. The state government and truck operators were at loggerheads from the time the latter decided to cap the foodgrain transportation rates.Transporters had formed cartels and were charging excessively high rates for the past several years even as the state was being reimbursed only a part of it by the centre. The end result was the state government was paying a substantial amount of money from its exchequer. Now, we will be able to save about 175 crore, said a department official.As the FCI reimburses the government at a fixed schedule of rates (SOR) and allows some premium, it decided to cap the premium at 120% over and above SOR this time. The truck unions responded by boycotting the tender process, saying they would not be able to meet their operational costs at these rates. However, the department went ahead with tenders and finalised most of them, forcing truck unions to fall in line."

(AFP)Chandigarh: An unusual spell of rain on Monday morning has cast a cloud on the wheat crop yet to be harvested in Punjab, forcing the agriculture department to sent teams across the state to assess the damage.The rains have come at a time Punjab has been grappling with a storage crisis.The state has a total storage capacity of approximately 153 lakh tonnes. But it can accommodate only 37 lakh tonnes of fresh stocks that are expected to be around 130 lakh tonnes.Of the total storage, 103-lakh-tonne capacity is with the Food Corporation of India, while the rest is with five state-run procurement agencies.From last year's harvest, 26 lakh tonnes of wheat and 90 lakh tonnes of rice are still lying in the warehouses.Although officially the procurement of the current stock of wheat started from April 1, sources said the bulk starts arriving by the second week of April - just when the rains have hit.The Punjab government has invited expressions of interest to arrange for cover and plinth space for wheat storage. It is also expecting the FCI to pick up the stocks lying in the warehouses by the time the fresh crop starts arriving.""If things work out as we have planned, we will manage to store between 110 and 120 lakh tonnes but anything over that would be a problem for us,"" said Anindita Mitra, director of the department of food supplies.According to the meteorological department, western disturbances caused the unseasonal rainfall in Punjab as well as Haryana.Amritsar, Pathankot, Anandpur Sahib, Nangal, Faridkot, Talwandi Sabo, Adampur, Sangrur, Kapurthala, Muktsar and Kharar in Punjab received the rainfall.""An upper air cyclonic circulation over North Pakistan caused this rainfall. There is another similar cloud formation over Haryana adjoining western Uttar Pradesh which could bring more rainfall to the area over the next few days,"" said a senior official in the Meteorological department in Chandigarh.While the drop in the temperature brought smiles in the urban areas, the farmers and the agriculture department have reasons to complain.""The damage would not be restricted to the standing crops but also the yield that is yet to be taken to the grain silos as there would be an increase in the moisture level in the crops. How the weather remains for the next couple of days will be extremely crucial,"" said Arvinder Singh, chief agriculture officer, Patiala.The Met department has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall on Tuesday.Sources in the agriculture department said they were expecting damage to 10 per cent of the wheat crop, if the inclement weather continued.""The standing crops have been flattened in most of the areas because of the strong winds that were raging since Sunday night. The minimum damage to the standing crop would be around 10 per cent. We are awaiting reports from the field,"" said Naresh Gulati, a senior officer in the agriculture department."

In Ahmedabad, community members visit temples or Gurudwara and prepare halwa at home. The traditional langar feast is also offered at Gurudwara, which is accompanied by community gatherings, said Vivek Dhiman, a resident of Bopal.Assamese, too, celebrated Rongali Bihu, greeting the new year with feasts and festivities. Manoj Borah, resident of Prahladnagar, said, Bihu is the harvest festival and the one on Sunday is Rongali Bihu, which is marked as the New Year. We adorn ourselves in new clothes, offer prayers and also prepare traditional delicacies including pitha, Jalpan (sticky/ flattened rice with curd and jaggery), and a variety of vegetables, among others. What I miss the most is the sense of belonging as here everyone celebrates alone and there is hardly any community gathering.Vishu is observed on the first day of Medam month after the solar cycle of the luni-solar Hindu calendar and the celebrations are often done locally yet with elaborate preparations. A thaali is prepared and the day begins by looking at the thaali and offering prayers. The day is spent meeting and greeting loved ones, said K M Ramachandran, of Ahmedabad Kerala Samajam.The Bengali community has organized a gathering to bring in local cultural flavours from Bengal. Weve organized a cultural programme where dance performances on Rabindra Sangeet will be organized by members. That apart, a community dinner with traditional Bengali delicacies including Radha Vallabhi, Baigan Bhaja, Roshogulla, among others will be there, said K S Adhikari of Bengal Cultural Association.Food and traditional delicacies are an integral part of any New Year celebration. Weve been staying in Gujarat for years, and while there are hardly any traditional rituals we follow, mother usually offers prayers her way and prepares some lip-smacking traditional dishes such as Pachadi (a dip) and Payasam (rice pudding), which we look forward to and relish with delight.

Soon, the transport department will notify guidelines for grant of permit to tractor-trailers and their registration. The new transportation rates for lifting of food grains had yielded annual savings of Rs 150 crore, claimed the government spokesperson, alleging that the previous government caused losses of Rs 1,250 crore on this account.There is no legal bar on the use of tractor-trailers as goods transport vehicles, but as per the 1992 notification of the Union transport ministry, tractor-trolley owners have to register their transport if they intend to use transport commercially.Punjab transport department has decided to authorise regional transport authorities in sub-divisions and SDO (civil)-cum-SDM in rest of the sub-divisions to grant permit to tractor-trailers for the limited purpose of carrying food grains from a mandi yard or purchase centre to a delivery point not farther than 25 km. Beyond this, a maximum of 12 km can be on a state highway or national highway, mentioned on the permit. The grain delivery point would be a godown, a plinth, a warehouse, a silo, a rice mill or railway siding.The government has also considered that since tractor-trolleys have been lying idle after the harvest, its decision to allow their use for transporting of food grains will not only help support the procurement process but also generate additional income for the owner. The department has also decided that trolleys need not be called to the office for registration and registration certificates and permits may be issued on the spot in camp mode. The transport department notification will also lay down specifications for obtaining fitness certificates to enable such use of the tractor-trailers."
5b24c6fc9855b722ac49aebd,From Plate to Plough: Freeing the farm,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/agriculture-sector-indian-farmers-narendra-modi-farming-exports-5138673/,2018-04-16,"It is not just price competitiveness that restricts our exports; the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies. It is not just price competitiveness that restricts our exports; the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies.The Agriculture Minister, Radha Mohan Singh, recently tweeted about the governments resolve to increase the value of the countrys agricultural exports to $100 billion by 2022-23. The Dalwai Committee Report on doubling farmers incomes also talked of a similar target. It said, the aim should be to raise agricultural exports by a minimum of three times by 2022-23, to reach the target of $100 billion. Interestingly, the draft Agricultural Export Policy, that has been put in the public domain by the Minister of Commerce, has a much more modest target  $60 billion by 2022-23.When two Union ministries talk of vastly different goals for agri-exports, one wonders which ministry should one believe. One also wonders which ministry is actually responsible for attaining the concerned target. The different targets also reflect a disconnect within the government and show inter-ministerial coordination in poor light. In any case, it is worth noting that when the UPA held office, Indias agri-exports grew five times: From $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion by 2013-14. This was an unprecedented achievement in independent Indias history. Not only this, Indias net agri-export surplus (exports minus imports) increased from $3.7 billion in 2004-05 to about $27 billion in 2013-14; that was a more than a seven-fold increase. However, in 2014-16, Indias agri-exports fell to $32 billion. They rose marginally to $33 billion in 2016-17 (see graph). The net trade surplus fell to $9.5 billion in 2015-16 and further to $7.8 billion in 2016-17. The April-February data for 2017-18 shows agri-exports at $34 billion; this is likely to go up to about $38 billion once we have figures for the entire financial year.Thus, the real challenge for the Narendra Modi government is to first engineer recovery of agri-trade to the 2013-14 levels. Besides, the target of $60 billion by 2022-23 is less than a 50 per cent increase over a nine-year period  from 2013-14 to 2022-23. The target of $100 billion is surely bolder.In a global economy that is highly price- and quality-sensitive, what should be the strategy to double or triple Indian agri-exports by 2022-23? The draft Agri-Exports Policy rightly identifies two steps: Identify commodities in which India holds a global comparative advantage and develop clusters in states to create value chains for these commodities. Research conducted at ICRIER can be of help if the government decides to take the first step enunciated in the draft policy. Eleven commodities  marine products, rice, meat, spices, cotton, fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar, coffee, groundnut, oilmeals and cashews  comprised more than 80 per cent of the countrys agri-export basket in 2016-17. Our study of 10 years data pertaining to 70 per cent of Indias agricultural output (20 commodities), shows that most crops were globally price-competitive in most years. However, since 2013-14, many of these commodities lost out on competitiveness, due to a fall in global prices. But it is not just price competitiveness that restricts our exports; the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies. The inherent consumer bias in these policies makes the trading environment unstable and unpredictable. Any rise in domestic prices almost immediately leads to the imposition of market restrictions. Exports are restricted through the use of minimum export prices and bans while the Essential Commodities Act is used to regulate private participation. This harms Indias image of a reliable supplier of agri-products and ensures that the country does not get the best price for its exports. This consumer bias in policy must be redressed and a balance should be struck between meeting the needs of food-insecure consumers and income-insecure farmers.The first change that is required pertains to mindsets. Instead of suppressing market prices for farmers to support consumers, the government should protect them through targeted unconditional income transfers. Restricting markets and compensating farmers through higher MSPs based on the new formula (cost A2+FL+50 per cent) will be an inflationary and unsustainable solution to the woes of the countrys agriculturists. It is likely to hit agri-exports adversely, especially rice and cotton. The exports will become uncompetitive.Second, policymakers should support agri-exports while ensuring environmental sustainability. While marine products, meat, oilmeals, groundnuts, cotton, spices, fruits and vegetables do not pose environmental problems, exports of rice must be properly assessed. Cultivating one kg of rice in Punjab or Haryana needs about 5,000 litres of irrigation water. This is drawn from underground and has led to a drastic fall in the groundwater table by 70 to 110 cms/year. Exporting large quantities of common rice from this region is akin to exporting billions of cubic meters of water. The best way to correct this would be to gradually phase-out power and irrigation subsidies, and replace them with a direct income support to farmers, while letting the prices of power and water reflect its true value.Third, the government must develop efficient global value chains and liberalise land lease markets across all states. It should encourage contract farming on a medium- to long-term basis. Exporters and processors must be encouraged to buy directly from farmer-producer organisations (FPOs), bypassing the inefficient APMCs. Major investments are needed at the back-end to create infrastructure for global and domestic value chains, ranging from produce aggregation to its sorting and grading, packaging, storing and linking the hinterlands to ports for export markets. The private sector can be an effective player in creating such value chains, but it needs to be enabled by institutional reforms. These investments could have a multiplier effect on the rural economy.Most of these reforms come under the jurisdiction of state governments. With the BJP holding office in more than 20 states, this is Modis moment to reform agri-markets in one go. If the government can usher in these changes, agri-exports will rise and so will farmers incomes. But whether they touch the $60 billion mark or the $100 billion target by 2022-23 will depend on how wide-ranging the reforms are and how efficient their implementation is. The governments record so far has been not very promising.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

However, the process they have developed, will help farmers earn profits from this waste product, which when burnt in the farms of Punjab and Haryana brings down the air quality of the region.Prof. Singh explained that a solvent system developed by Kriya Labs for the process is completely biodegradable, non-volatile, made of natural products and completely safe to use. The start-up hopes to find manufacturers who will use this technology to provide a safe alternative to crop burning.Kriya Labs director Pracheer Dutta, who completed his BTech from IIT-Delhi, said their solution to the problem of stubble burning will not only ensure a pollution-free Delhi but create rural employment by creating wealth from waste and contribute to sustainable development by starting a bio-economy.The project will be on display at the 14th Open House being organised by IIT-Delhi on Saturday, along with several other innovations that the students of the institute have come up with over the past year.Other productsSome of these products include an intelligent artificial leg, refreshable Braille display to enable digital access, waterless bathing solutions and a naso-filter that cuts out air pollution.The institute said over 1,000 school students from Classes X and XII will visit the campus, apart from college students and people from the industry. Besides new technology, labs at the institute will be thrown open to the public and lectures on various topics will be given by top faculty members.It is our objective to create a nurturing eco-system for students to inspire them to work on innovative solutions for our socio-economic challenges, said IIT-Delhi director V.

Besides, the field staff of the agency fears being heckled.The FCI has demanded security for its field staff in at least seven of the 21 purchase centres in Bathinda district. The FCI has a storage capacity of 11.7 lakh tonnes and nearly 13 lakh tonnes rice is already stored in its godowns in both Bathinda and Mansa districts. Slow pace of movement of rice to other states through the railway network is increasing problems of the FCI. In some of the purchase centres, the FCI has decided to make purchases only if the rakes are provided by the railways to transport wheat directly out of Punjab without keeping the grains in its godowns, which were filled beyond capacity.Sources said that it was after six years that the FCI was facing space shortage as against the normal movement of 1,000 rakes of rice in a month, only 200-250 rakes were moving out of Punjab for the last three months. One rake of 42 wagons in a goods train carries 2,600 tonnes of rice and in a rake of 58 wagons 3,500 tonnes of rice are transported. The FCI wants protection for its purchase staff at purchase centres of Chathewala, Lelewala, Natheha, Teona Pujaria, Fallad and Kalalwala in Maur and Rama Mandi areas of Bathinda. The FCI has a target to procure 1.80 lakh tonnes of wheat in Bathinda and Mansa distrcts.The FCIs procurement manager in Bathinda, Chakkerpani Siddarth, told TOI, Due to space constraints the agency is forced not to make purchases. We have taken up the matter with our higher authorities and the railways to provide special rakes so that we could make purchases and send wheat grains directly out of Punjab through trains. He admitted that failure to make purchases was leading to anger among farmers and due to that their field staff was afraid of going to the grain markets and were demanding protection. He said that some farmers had held some FCI purchase officials captive at Chathewala a couple of days ago, which had scared the agency staff.Bathinda ADC Sakshi Sawheny confirmed that the FCI was facing storage space shortage . We have taken up the matter for special trains to transport the grains. The FCI staff has not gone to the grain markets so far. I held meeting with them on Wednesday as we want them to start procurement at the earliest. The administration is ready to provide the logistics and protection if needed.

(Express Archive) Madhya Pradesh farmers contend Pusa Basmati-1 is superior when grown in their region as opposed to being cultivated in states such as Punjab, Haryana. (Express Archive)Even as the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry has rejected the claim of Madhya Pradesh to be included as a traditional basmati-growing area, rice millers in the state are challenging the order. Central to their argument is that the quality of rice, from an improved variety, Pusa Basmati-1, is superior when cultivated in MP, as opposed to Haryana, Punjab or West Uttar Pradesh (UP).MP accounts for 50 per cent of Indias area under Pusa Basmati-1 and 70 per cent of the export of this rice variety to the western world (US and Europe). That itself is proof of the quality of basmati being grown by farmers in MP. Since GI certification is meant primarily to protect the quality of a product, it is unfair to deny recognition to MP as a basmati-growing state, says Ashwani Arora, managing director & CEO of LT Foods Ltd.The MP government had demanded that 13 of its districts  Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna, Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur  be given the GI tag for basmati paddy, along with the areas of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Western UP in the Indo-Gangetic plain below the foothills of the Himalayas. The GI Registry under the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, however, rejected MPs contention in its order dated March 15.According to Arora, whose Rs 3,500-crore sales company sells basmati rice under the Daawat brand, the soil and environmental conditions in MP are best suited for growing the high-yielding Pusa Basmati-1 variety. The traditional tall basmati cultivars are suited for saline and alkaline soils of pH 7-9 found in states such as Haryana. But Pusa Basmati-1 is ideal for the neutral to acidic soils of MP with 6-8 pH.Also, the shallow to deep black soil in MP is better for moisture retention. And with the main growing areas (Raisen, Vidisha and Hoshangabad) getting twice the rainfall of Haryana and Punjab, the crop gets enough water without a flood-like situation. That, in turn, also makes it less prone to pest and disease attack, says a company official.The common pests in basmati include the brown and white plant hopper (sap-sucking insects that attack between mid-September and mid-October), while diseases are mainly the leaf and neck blast fungus that infest the nodes of the plants main stem (from where the grain-bearing earheads or panicles emerge).The stagnant water and high humidity during late-August is particularly conducive to the blast in Haryana. Farmers, therefore, are forced to spray fungicides like Tricyclazole and also insecticides such as Buprofezin and Picoxystrobin against plant hoppers. All this leads to pesticide residue issues, whereas you dont get these conditions in MPs well-drained soils, the official states.The other advantage that MP has is the less sharp drop in temperatures during the October-November period at the time of flowering and grain-filling. While traditional basmati paddy or even other high-yielding varieties such as Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 can tolerate these, Pusa Basmati-1 cannot. The latter when grown in MP, hence, yields better quality paddy with more grain length and less chalkiness due to more complete filling. That is precisely why Pusa Basmati-1 rice from MP has good consumer acceptance in the western world, adds the official.But whether this argument will cut ice with regard to GI certification remains to be seen. The GI Registry, in its order, held that MP did not satisfy the fundamental requirement of popular perception as a traditional basmati-growing area for being granted the coveted tag. Basmatis GI character was derived from its supposed uniqueness as a rice grown in a specific region. MP did not fall in this specific geography, namely the Indo-Gangetic plain situated below the foothills of the Himalayas.However, the fact that about 2 lakh hectares area is today under basmati cultivation in MP (of which 1.5-1.6 lakh hectares comprises Pusa Basmati-1), and the one million tonnes of paddy from this is worth Rs 2,600 crore, makes the GI issue fraught with complexity. What will these farmers do if they are denied the right to grow basmati? Can you force them to cultivate soyabean, which yields only one tonne per hectare (against 5 tonnes from Pusa Basmati-1) and fetches a marginally higher price (Rs 30,000/tonne versus Rs 26,000/tonne)? a rice miller in Mandideep near Bhopal asks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We are expecting farmers to sow paddy [basmati and non-basmati rice varieties] over 28.5 lakh hectares this season. Last year, the area under paddy was 30.4 lakh hectares, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director, Punjab Agriculture Department.The State government issued the order on Tuesday asking farmers to start paddy transplantation from June 20 instead of June 15 last year. The decision has been taken in order to preserve water and check the fast depleting groundwater table in the State.Mr. Bains said that keeping in mind the latest order, the department would focus on advising farmers to sow short-duration varieties of paddy.We are suggesting farmers to opt for varieties such as PR-126 that matures in 93 days after transplantation and consumes less water, making it suitable for water-scarce conditions, said Mr. Bains, adding that there are other recommended varieties that the farmers could sow this season.Water woesPunjab is witnessing 2.5 feet depletion in groundwater table annually.The government notification, issued under the provision of Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act, 2009, also states that this year the preparing of paddy nursery would start from May 20 instead of May 15 last year."

Instead, he says more drastic measures are needed. The former principal plant breeder at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, has recommended broadcast sowing of pre-germinated rice seed without puddling and eliminating raising seedlings in the nursery.Direct sowing needs 30% less water and saves lot of labour costs. Many countries have switched to direct sowing of rice. I feel direct sowing is a winwin technology, particularly under declining water resources, Khush, who was awarded the 1996 World Food Prize, told TOI in an email exchange.Even the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, has devoted a page in its Package of Practices for Kharif Crops to unpuddled DSR, mentioning suitable soil types, required field preparations, suitable varieties, sowing time, seed treatment, seed rate and method of sowing, weed control, irrigation and fertilizer application.The varsity has mentioned that short duration paddy variety PR115 is most suitable for direct seeded rice and the ideal sowing time is June 1-15 inPunjab.On the other hand, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairperson Kahan Singh Pannu said farmers were wary of opting for the DSR method of cultivating paddy as the efforts to produce this technique in the state had not yielded the desired results in the past.Area under DSR paddy cultivation had once touched nearly 1 lakh hectares in Punjab. However, the farmers didnt adopt this method in a big way as they found the crop had more weeds and even the yield was not stable. Due to this uncertainty, Punjab farmers stopped following the DSR method of paddy cultivation, said Pannu, an MSc in agriculture (entomology) from PAU, Ludhiana."

Accused  mill owner Gulshan Jain, sons Nitin and Sudhir and daughters-in-law Nitu and Sophiya  have gone into hiding.A Rs 33.6 crore alleged paddy scam has pitted the state government and Punjab National Bank (PNB) against each other, each, in its bid to recover losses, staking claim in the left out stock and recoveries from the buildings and assets mortgaged by Veerumal Mulkhraj Jain Rice Mill to the bank. Accused  mill owner Gulshan Jain, sons Nitin and Sudhir and daughters-in-law Nitu and Sophiya  have gone into hiding.While the PNB approached Amritsar court seeking directions that the left out paddy should not be disposed of without taking it on board; Punjab Vigilance department took over the probe into the case from Amritsar (rural) police Tuesday.On April 2, food and civil supplies department noticed that 1,200 truckloads of government paddy worth Rs 33.6 crore was missing. The rice mill, now stands locked, was to shell the paddy to convert into rice, which was to be eventually supplied to Food Corporation of India.On April 5, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had ordered a Vigilance probe into the case. Same day, Amritsar (rural) police registered a case of cheating against Jain, his two sons and their wives.The left out paddy worth nearly Rs 15 crore was subsequently recovered.Satyawan Ohlan, PNBs circle head in Amritsar, said the missing paddy could be the private purchases of the miller, or varieties of paddy 1509 and 1121 that government did not procure or the one belonging to previous seasons and in those scenarios cannot be termed as government paddy.Food and Civil Supplies Director Anindita Mitra, however, said the stock of the mill was zero at the start of Kharif season procurement. So there is no question either that there was any government paddy of previous season, she said .The PNB has marked an internal probe also. Zonal Manager P S Chauhan said the bank had initiated proceedings to recover the money. The PNB also approached Punjab police for registration of a case, alleging fraud/embezzlement of Rs 202 crore.Two mortgaged buildings are worth Rs 40 crore. Two plants have latest machinery and if one sets up such units today, it will require an investment of about Rs 100 crore. Another Rs 10 crore could be realised from the left out stock. The actual amount, which could be realised, may be between Rs 125 crore and Rs 140 crore, Ohlan said.Mitra, however, said since government paddy was siphoned off, only the state government was entitled to realise the losses after auction of the mortgaged property.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

In October, night temperatures fall drastically and it would lead to fall in yield, said Nek Singh, a paddy grower of Khokh village near Patiala.Who would compensate for the reduction in yield, he asked.On the other hand, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Kahan Singh Pannu, who recommended to the government the postponement of paddy transplantation, said farmers fear was unfounded.Instead, we will save 24 lakh million litres of water, which farmers would have otherwise pumped out through 14 lakh tubewells in five days, he said.As per the figures of the Commission For Agriculture Costs And Prices, central body for fixation of minimum support prices, a kg of rice guzzles 3,367 litres of water. From 1,000 kg of paddy 666 kg of rice is shelled.Punjab government has asked growers to postpone transplantation by five days from June 15 to 20.Pannu said, The underground water crisis was deepening, as every year the water level is falling by 70 cm and farmers are well aware of it. He added, Any new decision of the government takes time to be implemented.However, Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of Bharatiya Kisan Union, said the paddy variety PUSA 44 grown by majority of farmers in state takes 130 days to ripen. If transplanted on June 20, the harvest will be delayed till late October when the climate for the crop is not appropriate. The farmers worry that the yield would fall drastically.Punjab Agricultural University vice-chancellor (V-C) BS Dhillon said the university has developed two short-duration, less water-consuming varieties. One of them is PR 126 which has four-week shorter growing span than PUSA 44. The other is PR 121 that has two-week shorter span than the commonly grown variety.Dhillon asked farmers to shift to new varieties as peak yield period of PUSA 44 variety was over. PUSA is a crop of 130 days.I think V-C saab need to be told that commission agents and state procurement agencies dont accept PR varieties, said Rajewal.Transplantation to be pushed to July 1The ultimate goal of the agricultural experts and the farm bodies is to push paddy transplantation to July 1, with the idea to conserve water. We are working on that, and will ultimately implement it, said Dhillon.Earlier in 2008, paddy transplantation was fixed on June 10 and at that time also Pannu as secretary, farmers commission, was behind the move. In 2014, as secretary (agriculture), he pushed for delaying sowing from June 10 to 15."

The unsold produce soon turned into heaps of rotten slush.Singh says he sold 40 quintals for Rs 2,306 to a local trader, meaning he got Rs 57.65 a quintal. It was the worst year as long as I can remember, he says.The potato crisis of 2017 had to do with a knee-jerk farm trade policy that tends to clamp down on exports at the slightest hint of rising consumer prices. In June 2014, to rein in potato prices, the government imposed a minimum export price on potatoes, put the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act and also allowed duty-free imports. This choked off exports and caused domestic prices to crash amid a potato glut of 48 million tonnes.To avoid such disasters, India is now looking to setup a national agriculture trade policy, similar to the countrys three-year foreign trade policies. The farm exports policy will be geared towards promoting exports rather than them being used as a tool to control domestic prices, a person familiar with the development said.Last month, the commerce ministry unveiled a draft national agriculture export policy in step with the governments target of doubling farmers incomes. It has sought to boost agricultural exports from $30 billion currently to nearly $60 billion by 2022.Consultations among stakeholders, including the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), began this month. Key proposals include ensuring processed agricultural products and all organic produce will be free of export restrictions in future. The agriculture and food ministries will also identify food items which will be permanently free from export controls.The government may form a trade perspective over a 5-10 year period and undertake a mid-term review of agriculture trade policy... the official said.The agriculture ministry, along with APEDA, has identified 50 farm export clusters, the official said. The Centre will soon hold consultations with states to standardise taxes in local markets for export-oriented produce, he said. For instance, local market taxes vary widely for basmati rice, a key export commodity. It is 4% in Punjab and Haryana and 1.6% in Rajasthan. For pulses, the fees are 1% in Maharashtra and 2.5% in UP.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. Farm economist Ashok Gulati says knee-jerk export restrictions on food items to prevent domestic inflation have deprived farmers of higher prices in the global market. A paper by Gulati, Infosys chair professor and Shweta Saini, who works with policy think tank ICRIER, analysed 10-year data to show that Indias agri trade policy had a pro-consumer bias. The governments Doubling Farmers Income also says Indias exports policy does not promote agricultural trade but is mainly used to control prices in the domestic market. According to the new draft policy, a three-year ban on non-basmati rice exports during 2008-11 amid a rice glut led to a notional loss of $5.6 billion."

As per the data compiled by the India Meteorological Department IMD ), in the given period, Punjab has had 35 deficient monsoon (more than 20% to 59% below the normal precipitation in the June-September period) rainfall years while Haryana witnessed 36 deficient monsoon rainfall years.The situation is grimmer if the data of the last 10 years (2008-2017) is taken into account as both states recorded deficient monsoon rainfall for six years or more. In the past 10 years, Punjab had deficient monsoon rainfall six times in 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. During the same period, monsoon failed seven times (2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) in neighbouring Haryana.Despite poor monsoon rainfall, area under water-guzzling paddy has not reduced in both Punjab and Haryana, known as the grain bowl states of India, which are biggest contributors of food grain to the national buffer stock. In 2017, Punjab had an estimated 29.42 lakh hectares area under paddy including basmati while in Haryana the estimated acreage under rice cultivation was 14.22 lakh hectares.Area under other kharif crops like cotton oilseed and pulses has gone down in both states with more farmers opting to grow paddy due to assured marketing as the grain is purchased by the government agencies at the minimum support price (MSP).Weaker monsoons have resulted in putting more strain on the groundwater in both Punjab and Haryana. With less availability of canal water, farmers in both states rely on tubewells to irrigate their crops, hoping for the normal rainfall to eventually recharge the groundwater. With truant monsoons, groundwater recharge has not been to the optimal levels, leading to lowering of water table in both states.In 2017, Punjab received 384.9mm rainfall, which is 22% below the normal precipitation of 491.9mm while Haryana recorded a deficit of 26% at 341.9mm against the normal of 459.8mm. On the other hand, the average rainfall in the country was recorded at 841.3mm, 5% below the normal of 887.3mm. According to IMD, deficit up to 20% of t h e normal monsoon rainfall (June to September) is taken as normal precipitation.In the given scenario, there have been appeals from leading farm scientists to reduce the area under paddy cultivation in both states, especially Punjab, to prevent further depletion of precious groundwater. Leading geneticist and rice breeder Gurdev Singh Khush, who retired as the head of the division of plant breeding genetics and biochemistry at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, has advised crop diversification to reduce the area under paddy. This issue has been talked about for last 30 years but nobody has proposed an alternative crop. I have suggested soybean as possibility but nobody has paid any attention, Khush stated in an email exchange with TOI."

(Express photo by Harmeet Sodhi)A bullet-proof Ambassador given to him by the state government is the latest symbol of power and police protection that Pawan Kumar Gupta, the national president of the Shiv Sena (Hindustan), moves around with a pilot gypsy and a dozen-odd police personnel. Gupta heads one of the Shiv Sena groups in Punjab which now number more than two dozen with new additions taking place every year.The radical Hindu groups of the state are back in news after the clashes with Dalit groups in Phagwara in April in which one youth died and caused tension throughout Punjab. Four persons from Hindu organisations and one from a Dalit organisation have been arrested by the police till now.Visitors to Guptas house at the outskirts of the city are stopped by his gun-toting security guards with a polite question, Koi asla taan nahi hai ji (Are you carrying any firearms).I am the senior most among Shiv Sena leaders in the state having been associated with Balasaheb Thackerays Shiv Sena in Mumbai from 1989 to 2003. Before that I was influenced by Pawan Sharma of Hindu Suraksha Samiti and Jagdish Tangri of Hindu Shiv Sena who had taken on Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale when militancy in Punjab was at its peak, says Gupta.Sitting with two trishuls stacked behind him and sporting a broad tilak, the 48-year-old admits that he was in his teens when he joined the movement. When he is not fighting for the rights of the Hindus in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, Gupta looks after his business interests as a sleeping partner of a rice sheller.Age factor is a common thread which binds many of these radical group leaders together. Another Patiala-based head of a similar group, Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Suraksha Samiti, Panchanand Giri is also in his late 40s. Apart from the declared aim of protecting Hindu interests, his organisation also runs a langar and gaushala next to the well known Kali Temple in Patiala. We also run the Hindu Takht which is like the Akal Takht of the Sikhs, says Rajesh Kehar, senior vice president of the Samiti, impassively. Panchanand Giri enjoys Y Plus security status and entry to his HQ also entails passing through a security check.The radical leaders admit that what began as a voice of the religious minority in the state against Sikh militant groups in the 1980s has today morphed into an affair where breakaway groups are being formed to seek more importance, and more police security to flaunt. As per our estimate there are 27 Shiv Senas in Punjab, says Kehar with a smile. No one wants to become a worker but everybody wants to become a pradhan, he adds. They all do it for getting security, he says as a matter of fact.Sanjeev Ghanauli, president of Shiv Sena (Punjab) agrees that an obsession for getting security and using it to further alleged illegal activities with impunity as a main cause of mushrooming of Shiv Senas. Today, if you want to demand security, then all you have to do is abuse Bhindranwale on the Facebook and WhatsApp and then go about throwing your weight around. This gives a bad name to us. We feel ashamed, he says. Sharma, who runs a chemist shop in Ghanauli village, near Ropar, is 47 years old and says he joined the movement in 1989 in Shiv Sena (Bal Thackeray). His father was killed by Babbar Khalsa militants in 1992 and since then he has had security personnel allotted to him. At present he has two government vehicles and 15 cops attached with him.Shiv Sena (Lalkar) is the latest group which is raising in the state, informs Ghanauli. The others are Shiv Sena (Hind), six groups of Shiv Sena (Amritsar), four to five groups of Siv Sena (Ludhiana), another five to six groups of Shiv Sena (Bal Thackeray), Shiv Sena (Samajwadi), Shiv Sena Phagwara, Hindu Shiv Sena, Shiv Sena Akhand Bharat, Shiv Sena Maha Sangram and so on. Some groups are alleged to be the brainchild of intelligence agencies. They play in the hands of the government and are created to instill differences amongst Hindu groups, says Pawan Gupta.Apart from threats from Khalistani groups, these radical leaders say they also face threats from Lashkar-e-Toiba and Kashmir militants. All have led marches to Kashmir, mostly disallowed from proceeding further after Kathua, and some claim to have unfurled the national flag at Lal Chowk in Srinagar. Unlike the othes who are just using the name Shiv Sena I have a Kashmir unit in Srinagar headed by a Kashmiri, Abdul Khalid. I have also led a delegation to Kishtwar when riots took place there, says Pawan Gupta. The Hindu Suraksha Samiti chief, Panchanand Giri, at one time faced trial over charges of burning the Holy Quran in Punjab and also for threatening to kill the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi.On Phagwara, Hindu Suraksha Samiti claims that their state president, Deepak Bhardwaj, arrested for the clashes, is innocent. He had no role nor was his weapon used in the firing. He will come clean in the inquiry, says Kehar. Pawan Gupta says his was the only organisation which condemned the Phagwara violence. No other Shiv Sena came out with a statement. They do not have the IQ to speak on such issues, he adds smugly.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Already, 55 air-conditioned buses in Nagpur are running on bioethanol, he said.Mr. Gadkari was speaking at the launch of Telugu news daily Vijaya Kranthi here on Saturday.He said in states like Punjab and Haryana, the rice straw is burnt after the harvest. Instead, it could be used to produce ethanol. If the Centres decision gets a cabinet nod, Telangana would be one of the States to benefit, with at least 100 bioethanol factories set to be established.Bioethanol usage would save the country Rs. 8 lakh crore worth crude oil imports, the Minister said.The government is also promoting bamboo growing through agro-forestry to cut down import of wood, paper pulp and newsprint, which cost the country a total of Rs. 1 lakh crore, he said.River linkingMr. Gadkari felt that political differences should not turn into enmity and wanted all political parties to strive towards the countrys socio-economic transformation.He also mentioned the Central governments project to link Indravati river with Godavari sub-basin, which would be linked to Nagarjuna Sagar and Penna at Somasila up to Cauvery. The move would prevent 800 TMC ft water from going into the sea, he said, urging States not to bicker over 15 TMC ft or 20 TMC ft of water.He advised media to be independent and impartial, urging it to inform the common man about scientific innovation and research.Also speaking on the occasion, Telangana Jana Samithi president M. Kodandaram said a newspaper that has the ability to question the governments policies is much needed in the present conditions.CensorshipWe are seeing a situation where advertisements are used to impose censorship on newspapers. Messages are sent to newspaper offices about what to publish and what not to, he alleged.Achieving separate Telangana State was only one step towards development and there needs to be an intellectual churning to fix the development agenda.If Vijaya Kranthi is successful, it could be the forum for opinions across the spectrum, Mr. Kodandaram hoped.BJP State president K.

Dating back to the 17th century, it has vibrant illustrations by Iranian painters on Hindu culture, even Krishna. It was bought from one Prithipal Singh of Amritsar in 1956.Sharing a fascinating fact, Kumar says during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, whose passion for the arts led to various scriptures being translated into Persian and illustrated, snakeskin was added to the paper as it was thought to be a great preservative.National Archives of India funds processes to digitise manuscripts, depending on the need. Every year we get Rs 10 Lakh for this purpose. It can also sanction Rs 1crore for a separate archival building, which we had applied for in 2015, as the PU library is the richest in north India in terms of manuscripts, Kumar adds.Regular visitors to the archival sections of the library include students from the humanities departments, some researching the manuscripts. Other visitors include researchers from the UK, USA, Canada and even the Arab countries who come to look at the manuscripts.The library also has Jauhar-al-Tarkeeh a book on prosody (pattern and rhythm of poetry) and syntax of Persian, and ancient writings on Vedanta among nearly 400 manuscripts donated by former vice chancellor Dewan Anand Kumar. It also has around 20,000 rare books which include Mutiny records, education reports from the colonial era and a complete digitised collection of Ruchi Ram Sahni, freedom fighter and educationist.A catalogue with details of all its books in three languages is also maintained by the library.Treating and preserving manuscriptsFor preservation and treatment, the manuscripts and the rare books go through four steps. The first step is fumigation or heat treatment in which books are exposed to temperatures of 58 degree Celsius for 24 hours to destroy book lice and worms. The process is carried out at the Government Museum and Art Gallery, Sector 10. The second step is to de-acidify the books to remove spots. The third step is laminating the pages as per archival terms which increases the life of the book up to 100 years. The fourth and last step is digitisation."

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

The department has now asked the park owner to come to their office and explain the lack of proper entry into the park and fire-fighting equipment.Giving details, fire officer Yashpal Rai said he had asked the park owner, Randeep Singh , to come to his office and explain why there was no adequate fire-fighting system in place at the park. He added that there was no proper entry for fire tenders to get inside the park, which is necessary for such a system. The NOC (if any) for the park was not given during my tenure, so we will have to check whether they have it. It is important for such parks to have an NOC from the fire department, said the fire officer. He added that their team faced a problem in dousing the flames, as there was no proper entry into the park, and they had to park their vehicles in the neighbouring godown.The fire officer said before the fire incident, students of a school in Rara Sahib had visited the park, and were lucky to return before fire engulfed the park. He added that six members of the team were engaged in the fire-fighting operation, and they had brought four fire tenders  two from Khanna, and one each from Samrala and Gobindgarh  for the operation.Fire department officials said their main worry was that thousands of tonnes of rice polish was stored in a godown near the site of fire. Rice polish is an inflammable substance, and if that had caught fire, it would created havoc. They added that about 60-70% of the park infrastructure was destroyed in the fire, the cause of which is being ascertained.The fire officer said no one was trapped inside the park at the time of the incident, and the chowkidar fled from the spot. He added that there was fire in a field nearby, which spread to the park."
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The researchers, Max Friedrich from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and Delhi-based freelancer Bonolata Sen, will carry out the study to know why farmers burn stubble and the scientificallyviable alternatives and how behavioural change interventions could be adopted in containing the trend.The study will be started in the first week of July. The researchers held talks with farmers, agriculture scientists and other stakeholders on Thursday in Bathinda Every year when stubble is burnt in the fields after paddy harvest in November, complaints of air quality turning very poor in Delhi start pouring in. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already asked the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to contain stubble burning by imposing fines on farmers and make alternative arrangements to manage crop residue.The study proposes to understand behaviours related to crop residue burning in Punjab. Why some farmers burn crop residue and why others do not? The study will be designed using the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-regulation (RANAS) approach. Combining leading theories of health behavioural psychology, the RANAS approach postulates that behaviour is primarily driven by peoples mindsets and perceptions, Bonolata told TOI.The design of this research study will be outlined soon after listening to the views of varied sections of society and what do they think about stubble burning, the challenges to address it and the research plan to gather scientific evidence of preferred practices and beliefs related to the issue, said KVM executive director Umendra Dutt."

However, if the low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal intensifies into a depression, it can push the monsoon current towards Bihar. However, no change has been witnessed in the low-pressure area since Sunday, which means it is stagnant, said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, department of environmental science, Central University of South Bihar and secretary of Indian Meteorological Society, Bihar.Meanwhile, the IMDs Patna office has predicted widespread pre-monsoon rainfall in several districts of state on Tuesday and Wednesday and scattered rainfall from Thursday onwards.Weathermen have attributed the prevailing weather conditions to an east-west trough that runs from Punjab to the centre of a low-pressure area over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.The late arrival of monsoon adversely affects rice crops. Although with scientific advancements, enough awareness has been created on how to save the rice seeds from damage. IMD, weather and agricultural scientists from Bihar have also planned to conduct an awareness programme by the end of June to create awareness about sustainable ways of farming when the onset of monsoon is late. It includes information on certain rice seeds that sustain and grow in less amount of water, Sarthi said."

VincentFarmers feed their cows in Bhopal at the end of their 10-day strike on Sunday. (PTI)New Delhi: The 10-day farmers' strike in northern and western India ended on Sunday without any clear gains for the agitators or a significant impact on prices.During the "" gaon bandh"" agitation, the farmers had boycotted wholesale markets and tried to sell their produce directly. They were demanding a minimum support rice that would leave them with a 50 per cent profit and the waiver of farm loans.The Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and the Aam Kisan Union, which claim to represent 172 farmers' organisations across 10 states, had called the agitation to coincide with the first anniversary (June 6) of police firing killing six farmers in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.Whatever effect the strike had on prices was seen mainly in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab - where the strike was called off on June 6 under pressure from milk producers.Mahasangh president Shiv Kumar ""Kakkaji"" Sharma insisted the strike was a success. Sharma, a former leader of the RSS-backed Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, wields clout in western Madhya Pradesh.""(We satisfied) our benchmark for success in that no untoward incident took place and that the forms of protest remained Gandhian despite threats from the police,"" he told The Telegraph.""We had learnt the lessons of last year, and instead of assembling in cities we carried out the bandh in the villages with the farmers setting up their own kiosks to sell their produce.""He added: ""In Punjab, where many farmers own large numbers of cattle, it was impossible for them to store milk. It would have been shameful if any of them were forced to commit suicide because of the strike. So, it was called off there.""He went on: ""The next time we shall organise separate agitations for milk, vegetable and fruit producers and for shorter durations. The plans for these will be finalised in Delhi on June 14.""The strike saw many farmers dump their produce on the roads, and prices rise by up to 30 per cent in places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. But the prices stabilised by June 5.Balbir Singh Rajewal, who heads one of the factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in Ludhiana, said: ""The bandh worked for two days. After that some elements tried to make it violent and we were forced to call it off. Farmers directly selling milk to consumers turned the middlemen against us, and there was aggression of a kind I had never seen before.""He added: ""In Faridkot, some boys started looting cars. They told us they hadn't come to just sit and participate in a strike for nothing. In Sangrur some farmers attacked a dairy. We aren't politicians - we can't sacrifice the lives of our boys for personal glory. Calling it off was the sensible thing.""The Left, which led the largest peasant agitations in recent memory in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, stayed away from the strike.""We are part of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee - of more than 180 organisations - which has been leading the peasants' movement for a year now. We came to know from newspapers that some organisations had called a bandh,"" Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the CPM-backed All India Kisan Sabha, said."

(Express photo by Deepak Daware) Congress chief Rahul Gandhi at Nanded village in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha. (Express photo by Deepak Daware)Congress president Raul Gandhi, on Wednesday, sought to revive the rich versus the poor narrative accusing the Narendra Modi government of helping the rich run away with crores of rupees and leaving the poor in a lurch.Addressing a village chaupal at Nanded village in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha, Gandhi directly accused Prime Minister Modi of giving away Rs 35,000 crore to diamond trader Neerav Modi, which he said was equal to the amount spent by the UPA led by the Congress to provide employment to crores of people.Rahul was addressing a sizeable crowd of people gathered for the meeting held on the occasion of his visit to the family of Dalit rice innovator late Dadaji Khobragade, who died on June 3 after a prolonged illness at the age of 79. Dadaji, studied only up to the fourth standard, was awarded for developing eight varieties of rice, the most famous and popular among them, the HMT. A winner of National Innovation Foundation award of the central institution and Krushi Bhushan Puraskar of the Maharashtra government, Dadaji had died in penury. The HMT variety, however, was allegedly appropriated by the State-run Punjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth in 1998, when it released it under its own name PKV HMT, claiming that it had purified and stabilised it.Modiji had given away Rs 2.5 lakh crore to 15 top rich people in the country. We gave Rs 70,000 crore to countrys farmers by loan waiver in 2008. Against these Rs 2.5 lakh crore, how many jobs were created by this government, Gandhi asked, in reply to a question on unemployment by Sagar Khobragade. Would we only end up frying pakoras as this government advised? Khobragade asked. Yes, at least till 2019, Gandhi quipped.Dwelling on unemployment, he says, If they would have given Rs 5 crore to Dadaji, who had won 108 awards for his great work, he would have created jobs for 5,000 people. He added: There are many such talented people around. If they are provided with funds, they would be able to create several companies, creating huge employment. Rahul was addressing a sizeable crowd of people gathered for the meeting held on the occasion of his visit to the family of Dalit rice innovator late Dadaji Khobragade. (Express photo by Deepak Daware) Rahul was addressing a sizeable crowd of people gathered for the meeting held on the occasion of his visit to the family of Dalit rice innovator late Dadaji Khobragade. (Express photo by Deepak Daware)Gandhi followed it up by promising to set up one processing unit in each district of the country. It will facilitate direct sale of farmers produce and these units will provide jobs to local youths too, he said replying to question as to what he will do if Congress comes to power.Saying that the PM calls Neerav Modi and Mehul Chauksey his bhai, Gandhi told farmers to ask the PM as to how many jobs his pet industrialists have created. I am not saying dont help the industrialists. But help the poor too, he clarified.He then went on to bring the rising fuel prices issue to push his rich vs poor line saying, money is being pulled out of poor peoples pockets and its being paid to the rich.I will not assure you that I will put Rs 15 lakh in your pockets, but we will definitely put money into farmers pockets, he added.Referring to Gandhis loan waiver promise, a lady, Avisha Rokde, asked why not give good price so that question of loan waiver doesnt arise at all, Gandhi said, If farmers are in distress, waiver is the immediate step that needs to be taken. It gives relief to farmers. And if one person can be given Rs 35,000 crore, why cant farmers be given a loan waiver?Other measures that he promised to take included creating infrastructure to facilitate seamless journey of farm produce from farm to plate, good roads, cold storage and banks.He gave the Chinese model as an example, where industries are present in immediate neighborhood of farmers. Our computation is with China, he said.Spelling out his governments priorities on coming to power as providing jobs, solving farmers problems, providing education to children and health to the aged, he accused the PM of continually diverting attention from real issues. As against that during the days of green revolution, the whole country was focused on becoming food secure, he said, adding, The PM, instead of showing a right path to the country and make country feel assured, keeps belting out one lie after the other. He then went on to bring the rising fuel prices issue to push his rich vs poor line saying, money is being pulled out of poor peoples pockets and its being paid to the rich. (Express photo by Deepak Daware) He then went on to bring the rising fuel prices issue to push his rich vs poor line saying, money is being pulled out of poor peoples pockets and its being paid to the rich. (Express photo by Deepak Daware)Gandhi then punctuated his promises with caution: The government can do many things but not everything. We will try our best to do many things. Gandhi declared that he will continue to meet people like Dadaji over the next few months.Gandhi earlier spent five minutes with the family of Dadaji  son Mitrajit, daughter-in-law Indira and grandsons Manish, Vijay and Deepak. We felt both happy and sad. Happy because he came to meet us and sad because Dadaji wasnt with us anymore, Deepak said.Rahul Gandhi took a round of our house and also asked us how he did his research. He said he would do his best to help the family, Deepak told The Indian Express.Congress leader MLA Vijay Wadettiwar gave a cheque for Rs 2.5 lakh on behalf of State Congress to Mitrajit.

Congress provided farm loan waiver in 2006 and was now doing so in Punjab and Karnataka, he said hinting it would be replicated countrywide.Like Modi, I will not give any false promises and I have come here to tell you that if we are elected we will do all that is needed to rebuild your confidence, he said while interacting with farmers. Rahul did not give a speech but directly started a dialogue with the farmers that lasted over 20 minutes.Modi government is dishonest, it only cares for the 15 rich, top industrialists and has provided them Rs2.5 lakh crore corporate loan waiver. It will not do anything for the poor farmers, he said answering a question from college student Sagar Khobragade. The student asked Rahul how the Congress would address unemployment problem while pointing out Modi government had failed to provide promised 2 crore jobs to youth.Rahul said food processing units at village levels could provide jobs to farmers children and better price for the produce. You have to first elect the Congress, he quipped.He landed by helicopter from Nagpur, travelling 100 kms, and first visited the house of HMT rice inventor and researcher Dadaji Khobragade who passed away on June 3. Then he started an interaction with a modest crowd comprising some farmers and mostly party workers in the region reeling under farmer suicide crisis for the last two decades.Has Modiji ever offered to take questions from public like this, asked Rahul and drew an immediate applause. He said his request to make petrol, diesel cheaper by including them in GST list was not acceptable to Modi. Because he wants to rob money from your pockets and generously pass it on to Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. These two have walked away with Rs 35,000 crore of your money. While this much money was lavished on them, how many jobs have these two provided, Rahul questioned.With the chaupal pe charcha, the Congress is trying to re-establish support for the party in what was once its impregnable fort.Khobragade, 67, developed nine rice varieties in his modest farm and home. The high yielding HMT variety revolutionized paddy cultivation in the country. Ironically, he struggled with poverty all his life and was even robbed of credit for developing the HMT breed.After Khobragades death, politicians have started rushing to his village and offering sympathy and largesse in the form of money to his only son Mitrajit and daughter-in-law Raibai. They are marginal farmers with a small holding.In all Rahul took only three questions. The other two were asked by Ramchandra Deshmukh, a middle-aged farmer, and a woman, Avisha Rokde, a Congress gram panchayat member from Bhisi village.Top Congress leaders, AICC general secretary and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, MPCC president Ashok Chavan, AICC general secretary and Maharashtra in-charge Mohan Prakash, leader of opposition in Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, deputy chairman of legislative council Manikrao Thakre, former MPs Naresh Pugalia, Marotrao Kowase, Nana Patole and deputy leader of assembly Vijay Wadettiwar were among the large number of party leaders who made it clear the whole event was aimed at scoring some political points though it was around death of a prominent Dalit farmers untimely death.Questions Rahul Gandhi took on WednesdayModi promised 2 crore jobs to the youth. Not only he failed to keep that promise, but many people have lost jobs in last four years. What will you do if you win in 2019?Sagar Khobragade | 20Rahul: We will work on agriculture, food processing industry network, infrastructure like roads, and marketers to help farmers.Farmer suicides are unending. How will you stop them?Ramchandra Deshmukh | 50Rahul: By building farmers confidence in themselves, loan waivers are a temporary relief. Increasing price of farm produce will give more income to farmersFarmers do not seek loan waiver, they want better prices for produce. How can you ensure this?Avisha Rokde | 40Rahul: Providing opportunities of value addition, government funds for farm infrastructure and better remunerative prices for farm produce will be the way to go for solving agrarian crisis."
5ce7d2b1e8e3fc56af41b789,Fines fail to deter stubble burning,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fines-fail-to-deter-stubble-burning/article25267643.ece,2018-10-20,"Between September 27 and October 14, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) imposed Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they collected only Rs. 3,05,000, according to figures from the organisation.The fines are collected over time  frequently the farmers dont have money to immediately pay them, Gulshan Rai, Chief Environmental Engineer, PPCB, told The Hindu . However our experience from previous years is that this is not a substantial amount.The Centre and the States  Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  have in several meetings through the year declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble for farmers, which, according to various studies, contributes anywhere from 17% to 78% to the particulate matter-emission load in the city during winter.To discourage farmers in Punjab and Haryana  who are responsible for the bulk of such fires  the government has also disbursed Rs. 591 crore to these States to sell subsidised farm implements that can do away with stubble without having to burn them.Officials in the PPCB, on the condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that they were frequently lenient when they caught farmers in the act of burning stubble  an offence that invites fines of at least Rs. 2,500 an acre.Officials said satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complex process.We are helplessWe get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to ascertain the farmer in question. Sometimes, farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence and sometimes poverty. We are helpless at times, said an officer tasked with following up on stubble burning fires in Punjab.Despite a vigorous focus by governments on making mechanised farm implements  combine harvesters-cum-straw management system, seed drillers, rotary harvesters  available to farmers, its still inaccessible to many farmers with landholdings less than 5 acres or those not rich enough to invest in such machines.In Bibipur village, Patiala, there are about 800 households, according to Hardeep Singh, a resident farmer, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields ripe for harvesting.These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are only three or four machines available (for a variety of tasks from cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw) for all of us, he told The Hindu . That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. However, farmers have barely two months  between mid-September and mid-November  to clear out the field.This year, delayed rains have shrunk the window further and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times, in keeping with subtle weather differences.In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, Mr. Singh added.Then theres the spike in diesel prices. Deploying the machines uses up nearly 5 litres of diesel per acre (running the tractors, to which these implements are hitched) to sow wheat and nearly 20 litres per acres to farmers who want to grow potato, said Jitender Pal, a farmer in Jaspal Bangar village in Ludhiana.At village Rola, in the Samrala tehsil of Ludhiana, Upendra, a daily-wage labourer from Bihar, was busy setting fire to a 1.5 acre plot of rice straw. It wasnt his land, he said, and was merely following instructions of the malik. The Hindu couldnt contact him. Sarabjit Singh, a farmer in Rola, said no machines were made available to his village. And thats true for 50 villages around, he added.Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, said that change would take some time. Were educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys soil nutrients, and increases their fertilizer requirement. Weve run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier  just Rs. 300 more per acre  than burning the field and helps preserve the environment as well as their health, he said in a media briefing.( The author was part of a media contingent, sponsored by the Union Environment Ministry, to review measures to address stubble burning in Punjab )."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityPHAGWARA: Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu , at the convocation address of the Lovely Professional University (LPU), urged the students to speak in their respective mother tongues at their homes. According to him, one should never forget ones mother tongue or motherland. Always speak in Punjabi at your home or whatever is your mother tongue, he said.Just recently, I returned from abroad and I found that even as people there know English but they prefer to speak in their mother tongue. It is very much required. Mother tongue is your eye sight and other languages are like your spectacles. Your eyesight is very important to use glasses also, he said, adding, First learn Punjabi and then Hindi , English.He observed that the heads of other countries who visit India also prefer to converse in their mother tongue. Once I asked our foreign affairs minister Sushma Swaraj if these visiting heads of nations didnt know English, she said that they know but they prefer to speak in their mother tongue. This should be the spirit of India as well. We need to promote our mother tongue, he said. He also advocated that medium of instruction from basic to higher education should also be in mother tongue. Those who wish to study in English, they can opt for that later, he added.He also expressed his concern over the fact that quality private sector education had become out of bounds for the poor and marginalized sections. Why should not private universities earmark certain percentage of seats for students belonging to poorer sections and subsidize their education, he asked.The VP pointed out that public sector alone cannot provide quality higher education and the private sector must pitch in. He said that industries and the private sector in general should supplement the efforts of the government in making quality education available to all. He also called for complete overhaul of the education system, adding that the majority of our colleges have become mere breeding centres for producing students with degree certificates rather than individuals with critical analytical skills. He expressed concern that students passing out of colleges were lacking in employable skills.Launching on the burning issue of the moment  farmers  Naidu lauded the farmers of Punjab for turning the state into rice bowl of India. He insisted that to make agriculture sustainable, innovative methods are necessary. He suggested that students studying agriculture must spend time with farmers to have a firsthand understanding of the problems faced by farmers. India must become self-sufficient to battle the challenges such as hidden hunger and malnutrition, he added.LPU chancellor Ashok Mittal and Punjab minister for industry and commerce Sunder Sham Arora were also present during the occasion."

That certainly seems to be the case. Take, for example, 30-year-old Rahul Mandal, who moved from Calcutta to Loughborough University eight years ago to do a PhD, now works as a research scientist, and has become a national figure because he has a one-in-three chance of winning The Great British Bake Off.This is a hugely popular TV programme which began life on the BBC but was sold for a sack of gold to Channel 4 two years ago and is routinely watched by around six million viewers.Each series begins with 12 amateur contestants, who are asked to bake cakes, tarts, bread and the like and show off their culinary creative abilities. Each week one contestant gets kicked off the show amid usually tearful scenes until three are left for the final.The current judges are Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith, while the programme also has two presenters  broadcaster Sandi Toksvig and comedian Noel Fielding.For the current series, the final takes place on Tuesday (October 30) with Rahul as one of three left standing after 10 weeks of baking. That itself is remarkable because back in Calcutta he did no cooking and  like most Bengali boys  allowed himself to be fed by a doting mother.One of the other finalists is also Indian  Ruby Bhogal, 29, a Punjabi project manager with London Underground, who is one of four siblings who grew up with their mother making jalebis. She is backed by the Daily Mirror because of her gorgeous looks.The third contestant, Kim-Joy, is also not of English ethnicity, which must count as ironic considering tea, cakes, scones with jam and cream are an essential part of English culture.Rahul, whose PhD was in optical metrology, now works in Sheffield Universitys Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, where he specialises in light-based measurement of engineered components.He says he is inspired by an East meets West style of baking and that his instinct is to undertake every bake with a forensic attitude to research and an uncompromising attention to detail. He tries to ensure his creations are beautiful, full of flavour and structurally elegant, too. He is trying to come up with crisps with a flavour of pilau rice or Palak Paneer.Even five years ago he was not even aware of The Great British Bake Off, a programme which provokes deep passions among its viewers. Some think Rahul should have been jettisoned last week but that the judges allowed him to finish his decorations even after time was up.Although he was interested in watching cookery programmes rather than sports as a child in Calcutta. I never baked when I was in India. My baking journey began in the UK about five years ago when I was feeling lonely, and needed to do something along with my studies. At that time, it was limited to making bread and biscuits. The first cake I made was about two years ago, when my parents visited the UK for the first time.It was a friend who pushed him into applying for Bake Off. He was surprised when he was accepted but not as much as his family back in India.Another Bengali, Tamal Ray, who appeared in a previous series in 2015, tweeted: Oh my god, I could watch a whole show about Rahul Skyping his parents!"
5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

The findings also revealed that rice residue contributes 56% of the total PM 2.5 emission, and wheat residue contribute 32%. While for PM 10 emissions, 56% is comes from rice and 22% from wheat residues.This is the first such inventory of crop residue burning emissions including greenhouse gases (GHG) and various air pollutants prepared by the School of Public health in PGIMER. The results of the inventory have been recently published in a high-impact Journal of Cleaner Production.The study, Emissions of air pollutants from primary crop residue burning in India and their mitigation strategies for cleaner emission, has been authored by Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, Dr Tanbir Singh and Dr Suman Mor from PGIMER and department of environmental studies, Panjab University.Using available data and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines, the researchers documented that last year, one fourth of the crop residue generated was burnt in the open agricultural fields.As the crop production increased from 476 metric tonnes to 618 metric tonnes, since 2003-2004 to 2016-2017, the crop residues burnt rose by 1.3 times from 89 metric tonnes.Indian agriculture accounts for 12.2% of worlds total GHG emissions. These emissions can be avoided if crop residue can be utilized in biomass power plants to generate electricity, said Dr Suman.Rice and wheat contributed maximum to crop waste residue, which is 63% of total crop primary residue. The inventory gives crop-wise waste residue contribution where rice is the highest at 43%, wheat 26%, sugarcane 10%, and coarse cereals 11%.The inventory is a database which will help to know the extent of air pollution due to crop burning. Accordingly, steps to mitigate the emissions can be taken, said Dr Khaiwal.Also, the carcinogenic emissions from the crop residue burning increases with increase in the values of PM 2.5 and PM 10. This decline in the air quality adversely impacts the health.Former national president of Indian Medical Association Dr K K Aggarwal said, The particulate matter results in inflammation of the respiratory tract. Now, we are more concerned about the indoor pollution as its too tough to regulate the outer pollution.The report concluded that if all crop residue will be used for energy production, it can account for 10% of current energy production in the country. We have done systemic reviews on how to mitigate farm fire by use of technology, non-technical ways and policy issues, said Dr Khaiwal.Despite the Punjab government's two-year plan under which it would be spending Rs 665 crore on providing straw management machinery, there has been a rise in fire farms. In 2015-16, the residue burnt in the country was 110.05 metric tonnes which was 116.82 metric tonnes in 2016-2017."

The cases were even higher in 2016 as 1,240 incidents were reported in the year.Aggarwal provided the information during a meeting with principal secretary (Sports) Sanjay Kumar and other officers at Bachat Bhawan.The DC said, The district administration is making extra efforts to ensure that farmers are educated about the ill-effects of burning of paddy straw. To keep constant vigil over the issue, nodal officers have been appointed for all villages and a cluster officer has been appointed to supervise the working of 20 such nodal officers and the cluster officer is supervised by BDPO or an SDM-level officer.Besides, all the SDMs have already formed WhatsApp groups in their respective sub-divisions so that they can keep a tab on such activities on ground level and cluster officers and other officials are part of these groups, he said.Aggarwal said till date, the district administration has imposed a fine of Rs 2.32 lakh on violators who set the paddy straw on fire.Sanjay Kumar appreciated the efforts of the Ludhiana district administration and urged them to make extra efforts so that the farmers are made aware about the ill effects of burning paddy straw to our environment as well as our health.Sanjay Kumar asked the agriculture and farmers welfare department to ensure that this machinery covers all 928 villages of the district so that maximum number of people can be benefitted from this scheme.He also directed the officials to ensure that paddy crop is purchased, lifted and payments made strictly within the timeframe set by the Punjab government.

The first happy seeder was handed over to Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Samrala. The happy seeder allows sowing of new crops without removing standing rice and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch.Baranwal also informed that cricketer Harbhajan Singh too has joined CGSTs campaign and has also voiced his concerns against stubble burning.The officials of the department are also conducting a swacchata pakhwara at the CGST Commissionerate and all of them took a pledge to keep the environment clean which was administrated by assistant commissioner V J Saharan.Other activities are also being undertaken by the department under its initiative which included organising a painting competition on the subject of cleanliness at Government Middle School, Civil Lines and donating one RO water purifier system for providing clean drinking water to students and staff. The officers also under took activities of cleaning the school premises and encouraging tree plantation drive."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.LUDHIANA: Stubble-burning in Punjab was higher this year than in 2017, Nasa satellites show, but the real story lies in the detail. Just four districts in the state recorded an almost 30% rise in crop fires while all the rest of the districts registered a decrease, eight districts by more than 25%, according to Indian satellite data with the government.The high number of crop fires  57,756 as per Nasa data till November 15 in Punjab and Haryana this year as compared with 55,404 last year  suggests the PMs Rs 1,151-crore package for management of paddy residues failed to make a dent this year.At the same time, the large variation in stubble-burning incidents, particularly within Punjab, indicates that several factors were in play, some that led to a spurt in burning as well as others that worked in reducing fires.The four districts where burning increased this year are Ferozepur (up 42%), Muktsar (38%), Moga (14%) and Bathinda (12%), as per figures collated till November 12 by the Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute (ATARI), Ludhiana. Together, these four districts alone accounted for 40% of fire events in the state, up from 29% last year. All four districts are in the western Malwa region of the state where kisan unions are strong, said a state agriculture department official.The unions have been demanding cash compensation of Rs 200 per acre to farmers for not burning stubble. In many areas, the unions ensured that farmers burned stubble in support of the demand, said a state agriculture department official.Political factors cant be ruled out as some of these areas are Akali strongholds, the official added.Time too played a big part in fuelling fires across Punjab. Rice sowing started late and harvesting was delayed by rains in October, leaving many farmers with a very small window to prepare the fields for the rabi (winter) crop.Each days delay in sowing of wheat after November 15 decreases yields by an average of 30kg per hectare. Pressed for time, many farmers opted to burn the paddy residue, said M L Jat from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), an international research organisation that promotes sustainable agriculture in the region in collaboration with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and other bodies.TOI travelled through Karnal (in Haryana) and Ludhiana, and farmers in both districts said the respective state governments did not crack down on stubble-burning by imposing challans, particularly when the fires were peaking in November.In the midst of these failures, there was heartening news as well. Outside of the four Punjab districts and Sirsa in Haryana, all places reported a reduction in crop-burning, as per data released by ATARI.Among areas that see heavy stubble-burning, Kapurthala (down 53%), Ludhiana (46%), Jalandhar (37%) and Karnal (45%) saw impressive reduction in fires. In many of these areas, in-situ residue management techniques like the use of happy seeders have been increasing in the past two years.In Taraori village in Karnal, for instance, farmers said roughly 100 acres out of 2,000 saw burning this year. The village has farmers such as Vikas Chaudhry and Manoj Kumar who have been using happy seeders for the past six years.Farmers from the village and neighbouring areas have been coming to us to look at how in situ management works and have seen the results. Most of them have now adopted these techniques, said Chaudhry.Punjab agriculture commissioner B S Sidhu agreed that large-scale demonstration of in situ techniques was needed, along with training for personnel to handhold farmers making the transition to burning-free agriculture.We plan to take up these activities on a wide scale in the coming year. We are sure we will reduce stubble-burning significantly next year, Sidhu said.Meanwhile, this years burning season is expected to end in a few days, with just around 10-15% of rice harvesting yet to be done, officials said."

The microbial consortium will help bring down pollution and will also increase fertility of the soil by adding nutrients, said NBRI director S K Barik.He said that four scientists, S K Tiwari, Poonam C Singh, Puneet Singh Chauhan and Suchi Srivastava were working on the microbial consortium and got results.It will be a double benefit technology as it will help to decompose crop residue left behind after harvest, said senior scientist Poonam C Singh.She said normally paddy stubble takes around 90 days for decomposition but the microbial consortium decomposed it in 30-45 days. The residue will be used to make rice straw pellets or cakes enriched with microbes for fast decomposition and plant growth promotion."

Now, you get pav bhaji and chole bhature everywhere.The change is more noticeable in terms of availability of non-regional fruits and vegetables to common people at Rythu Bazaars and with street vendors, says Karam Singh, a Punjabi who spent her early childhood here and has been in the city for 13 years as a consultant with an overseas education firm.I remember in my childhood when my father, returning from New Delhi, used to bring eggplants in sacks and distribute them among relatives fond of baingan bharta (mashed eggplant curry). Now, he doesnt have to do that. We now easily get carrots and radish too. Earlier, they were available only in supermarkets."

The procurement definitely will exceed the target this year too,"" the official told .There will not be any impact on procurement, though crop in Punjab, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh has been affected by deficient rain during September-end, he said.Asked about private procurement, the official said a pilot was to be taken up in Jharkhand but the companies have not shown interest and not placed any bids so far.""Wheat is easier to procure. In case of rice, they have to buy paddy and get it milled and stored. Many issues have to be kept in mind...,"" the official added.As per the latest data, rice procurement in Punjab reached 10.86 million tonnes, Haryana at 3.88 million tonnes, Telangana at 9,96,779 tonnes, Chhattishgarh at 3,02,319 tonnes and Uttrakhand at 1,71,098 tonnes so far this marketing year.Tamil Nadu has procured 1,10,771 tonnes of rice, while in case of Kerala it stood at 49,813 tonnes and Maharashtra at 17,880 tonnes in the said period, the data showed.Procurement is yet to begin in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The official said that Punjab and Haryana have completed 60 per cent of the their rice procurement. The buying is underway in other states like Chattishgarh.The paddy is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). State-run FCI and state agencies undertake procurement operation.For the current year, the government has fixed paddy MSP of 'common' grade variety at Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of 'A' grade variety at Rs 1,770 per quintal.The government has pegged rice output to be 99.21 million tonnes in the kharif season of the 2018-19 crop year (July-June), as against the actual output of 97.50 million tonnes in the same season last year.

With the latest detection, the department has been successful in checking bogus billing of about five lakh bags of paddy and rice in the ongoing Kharif marketing season.Food and civil supply minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said district manager Ferozepur on November 21 detected abnormal purchase at Jiwan Arain and Panje Ke Uttar Mandis by arhtias, Reet Enterprises. The minister said that they had made bogus purchases of 86,939 bags of paddy in connivance with Sunrise Rice Mill, against which payments to the tune of Rs 5.6 crore have been taken.According to Ashu, the Punsup held a meeting of its district mangers on November 20 to track the movement of paddy and rice from other states to Punjab. In the meeting, district managers were specially instructed to re-check the purchases of paddy and rice and verify those figures with the stocks in the premises of the millers.The minister further added that the miller was planning to buy paddy from other states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where it is much cheaper than the minimum support price (MSP) and then deliver it during the milling to make a quick profit.Ashu said that the investigation has revealed the money trail  funds were diverted from the bank account of Reet Enterprises, owned by Jaswinder Singh, to AM Industries Jiwan Arain owned by Harpreet Singh who is the brother of Jaswinder Singh. AM Industries further distributed these funds to SS Industries, GS Trading Company, MJ Industries, Harpreet Kaur and Amandeep. According to Ashu, further details are being collected from the banks.The food and civil supplies department has lodged an FIR against Reet Enterprises owned by Jaswinder Singh, Jagdish Chander and Sons, owned by Sandeep Kumar, Dhruv Commission Agent, owned by Rishu Mutneja, Sunrise Rice Mill, owned by Jasmeet and mandi inspector Hansa Singh."

She continued, What is smog ? How can you stay safe from bad air? The class continued for 45 minutes, at the end of which she displayed different plants known to purify air that one can put up at home.Twenty students in the class of 11-year-olds sat in rapt attention, naming stubble burning, cars and crackers as the prime causes of bad air when asked.The teacher, Soniya Nagpal, explained, When the rice harvest is over, farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Western UP burn crop stubble, which is a leading cause of smog in our air. She added this was the third year running when air pollution in the NCR had become intolerable. When she finished speaking, students bombarded her with questions. When will this end? What can we do to ensure we breathe healthy? With patience, Nagpal replied: Wear masks when you go out. Maintain plants that purify air at home, as not everyone can afford air purifiers.City schools are holding special classes to teach students about smog, pollution, stubble burning, AQI PM 2.5 , etc. Schools said the impact of these classes has been phenomenon, as students are eager to know how to deal with the problem.Sudha Goyal, director, The Scottish High School, said: Every day, in the zero period before school starts, we teach students about changes in atmosphere. Teachers explain kids what is smog or AQI level, and why we need to monitor it. Pollution classes shouldnt be part of the curriculum, otherwise students will approach it by rote. This is something which all of us should know.In one school, a red flag is placed on the field and AQI readings are updated daily outside every classroom. The school regularly hosts informative sessions to spread awareness about the pollution menace among students. Y K Sindwani, the head of Lancers International School, said: We regularly teach students about air quality. Daily monitoring of air also helps us modify plans for our outdoor activities.Other schools have even begun sending notifications to parents on why they should know all about air quality along with their kids. We sent notifications to parents that were on pollution, and on why students should be taught about it, said Goyal of Scottish High.Alka Saxena, deputy director (health and wellness), Blue Bells Group of Schools, said: Weve distributed a circular among students on how to be safe during the winter smog, and the need to abstain from the outdoors especially in the morning and evening hours. In the morning assembly, we regularly advise students to wear masks when stepping out. Along with vertical gardens inside the school, a green belt has been created around the school, in which over 500 plants have been planted.Vaibhav Kapoor, principal, Ajanta Public School, said: We sent a circular, telling our students and their parents to avoid artificial or electric gadgets, and to maintain plants that purify air instead. Arti Chopra, principal, Amity International School, Sector 46, concurred, saying, Weve spoken about rising pollution at the morning assembly.Another institution is holding seminars on the topic. P K Samal, director, Discovery Montessori Preschool, said: Weve conducted seminars with students on which masks they should wear, why stubble burning is bad, how we need to stop burning garbage and ways in which pollution can be brought down.Where state authorities often appear clueless about the rising menace, the can-do spirit of Millennium City has awoken to take up the slack."

It is here that the half-burnt bodies of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were cremated on the banks of Satluj river on March 23, 1931, after they were executed at Central Jail, Lahore. The area across the Satluj is topographically close to Pakistan.Retired bureaucrat Kulbir Singh Sidhu, who has served as deputy commissioner and divisional commissioner of Ferozepur, said Hussainiwala was an important route for trade and transit in Punjab, and should be opened with mutual understanding. It is also an emotional chord between people on both sides of the border, especially for those residing nearby, he said.Historian Rakesh Kumar said the Hussainiwala-Ganda Singh Wala border had immense social and economic value. People in Indian and Pakistan will welcome efforts to open it, he said.Punjab Cotton Factories and Ginners Association former president Bhagwan Bansal said the opening of the Hussainiwala trade route would be of immense benefit to both countries. Hussainiwala is part of Malwa region, which is also cotton belt. Cotton, yarn and basmati rice could be exported through the Hussainiwala border, he said.All India Combine Manufacturers Association general secretary Amar Singh said combines could be exported to Pakistan through Hussainiwala, and those would help Pakistan farmers save money.Before he unfurled the national flag in Ferozepur on Independence Day last year, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had stressed on the need to reopen the border route. At the time, he had said that a strong case should be made for reopening the Hussainiwala border for trade between India and Pakistan, as was the case before the 1971 war.Before this, former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had echoed similar sentiments in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to Hussainiwala on March 23, 2015, to pay tributes to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev."
5ce5f36de8e3fc56af41073b,Cutting through the smog,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cutting-through-the-smog/article25667099.ece,2018-12-05,"Incidents of stubble burning  following the harvest of paddy crop in Punjab and Haryana  cannot be averted by imposing fines, or giving notice or giving farmers capital subsidy. Instead, the issue requires long-term vision and strategic policy interventions.Air pollution is a worry especially in north India. Stubble burning is said to be a key factor behind the formation of a dense cover of smog in this part of India though its contribution is less than 20%. Farmers are held responsible for the crisis but what is at fault are the flawed and short-sighted policies of the Central and State governments.Policy of rotationIn the 1960s, wheat-paddy crop rotation was encouraged in Punjab and Haryana to make India self-sufficient in foodgrain production. Large public investments in irrigation and adoption of high yielding varieties under the Green Revolution helped achieve the goal and make the nation food secure. However, the negative externalities in terms of land degradation, adverse soil health due to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and plummeting water tables have surfaced.The share of paddy (rice) in the gross cropped area in Punjab has increased from 6.8% in 1966-67 to almost 36.4 % in recent years, while it has increased from 4.97% to 20% in Haryana. The increase has undisputedly been at the cost of the area under maize, cotton, oilseeds and sugarcane. The policy of minimum support price for crops, in tandem with their assured procurement and input subsidy, have left farmers with no option but to follow this rotation. Besides, Punjab enacted a water conservation law in 2009 which mandates paddy sowing within a notified period (some time in June instead of the earlier practice in May). A shorter period of sowing days prohibits transplantation before a notified date, which in turn limits the window available for harvesting paddy to between 15 and 20 days. As a result, farmers who are pressed for time to sow wheat and maintain crop yield find stubble burning to be an easy and low-cost solution.One possibility to curtail the practice is to ensure that the government encourages crop diversification towards less water-intensive crops by extending price incentives and better marketing facilities. In some districts, farmers have started growing kinnow fruit but are often dissuaded due to high price volatility and the absence of a market. The policy of a price deficiency system  as initiated in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh  should be adopted to strengthen the production and marketing of alternative crops. Another option is to replicate the Telangana model of providing farmers an investment support of Rs. 8,000 per acre each year and withdraw price-based support.Punjab faces another serious problem: labour shortage. In the Agricultural Census 2011, average land-holding size has increased from 2.89 hectares in 1970-71 to 3.77 hectares in 2010-11  higher than the national average of 1.5 hectares. Paucity of labour for various farm operations is substituted by machines for which the government extends financial support.A road mapFarmers have already made investments in seed drill machines for sowing wheat after paddy harvest. Increasing pressure by the government on farmers to purchase the happy seeder to abate stubble burning adds to the cost incurred by farmers. Even if the machine is available at a subsidised rate of nearly Rs. 1 lakh, it would remain idle the whole year and become a liability in terms of maintenance. It is not a viable option for small and marginal farmers who hardly earn Rs. 60,000 in a year. Imposing a fine for burning straw is again unreasonable. The fine imposed per hectare is much lower than the cost incurred on a happy seeder.A feasible remedy could lie in the setting up of custom hiring centres or inviting companies to make investments for rental purposes. If the state provides an app-based support system, to rent out tractors and farm implements and earn additional income  there are examples of this in Nigeria and also in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  it would be akin to the Uberisation of agriculture. It would avoid stubble burning and at the same time make farming more mechanised, cost effective and a source of employment.Another far-sighted approach could be in effective use of paddy straw. Unlike wheat residue, which is used as fodder, paddy straw is non-palatable to animals as it has high silica content. Farmers, who have already been sensitised to refrain from burning residue, should be given options such as biomass generation. Now, hardly 20% of straw is managed through biomass power plants, paper and cardboard mills. The government should use geospatial techniques to identify areas where stubble burning is severe and encourage installation of biomass plants at such locations. This will not only reduce transportation costs for the firm or village entrepreneurs but also help the government achieve its target of generating 227GW based on renewable energy sources by 2022. Farmers can also be incentivised to sell the residual for additional income. The residual has uses, such as in paper, cardboard and packing material making and also hydroseeding (defiberised rice straw can be used in hydroseeding for erosion control).Seema Bathla and Ravi Kiran are Professor and Research Scholar, respectively, at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi"

FCI authorities fear that if the strike is drawn out longer, millers and the central procurement agency could face problems.Millers started delivering rice on November 22. More than 170 lakh metric tonnes of paddy has been procured in Punjab and is stacked in rice mills. After every 100 kilograms, millers return 67% rice to the FCI after custom milling of paddy.Rice millers in Punjab say they are finding it difficult to deliver rice in the central pool after custom milling because of the strike. Cold weather and space constraint are also making storage difficult, they said.FCI workers association member Anand Kumar said, employees have been raising the demand for wage revision for a long time but no one paid heed. We started work to rule from November 8, meaning working up to 5pm. On December 10, we went on a complete strike. If our demands are not met, we will intensify the protest and make all operations come to a standstill.Association member Satish Kumar said if the strike continues, millers may have to face financial losses as rice would have to be stored in moist conditions after custom milling, which could lessen its weight. We want FCI management to make alternative arrangements for movement of rice from mills, he said.Manager, procurement, Bathinda Siddarth Chakkerpani said millers approached them for making alternative arrangements, but they are helpless."

Curtains can be made from tarpaulin, bamboo, dry grass, paddy straw, guinea bags and jute. Shady trees around the shed should be trimmed to encourage the infiltration of sunlight in the shed which will not only provide warmth but will also disinfect the animal houses due to action of ultraviolet rays.He suggested animals should be taken under direct sun during daytime. Animals shed and its floor should not remain wet and cool for longer periods of time. This may expose the animals, especially younger ones, to various ailments like pneumonia, fever, coccidiosis, diarrhoea and even death in severe cases, Dr Malik added.Dr Malik suggested that suitable bedding up to the depth of 4-6 inches in large animals and 2 inches for smaller animals should be provided on puccaa (concrete) floor as direct contact of animal with cold floor will leads to more body heat loss through conduction.Paddy straw, dry grass, wheat bhusa, saw dust, rice husk could be used as bedding material. Jhuls (clothing) made up of gunny bags may also be used on larger animals to provide them insulation and warmth during extreme winter season, he said.Good ventilation must be ensured during winters. Shed should be cleaned at least twice in a day for proper disposal of wastes and minimum piling up of ammonia gases.Animals should be cleaned regularly with clean cloth or some brush. Hairs of animals should not be clipped during winters. Bathing of animals with cold water during winter should be avoided.Animals should be provided with good nutritious and balanced diet during winters. Berseem, most abundantly available green fodder, has high protein percentage and water content, can easily support production level of lactating and growing animals. So, accordingly protein containing ingredients i.e. cakes in concentrates shall be reduced for economical production.He advised that one should never forget to incorporate 2% mineral mixture and 1% salt in concentrate feed during winters. It should be purchased from reputed manufacturers. Clean, fresh, lukewarm water should be offered to the animals during winters.De-worming should be repeated 21 days after the initial dose to prevent other worm eggs and larvae in their additional stages of development. One should use suitable acaricides in the shed and on animals to control this problem, he added."

These are some of the serious fall outs of ecological devastation caused by sewage water being released into the forest area by both Haryana and Punjab for several decades.The chief conservator of forest ( CCF ) Chandigarh has written to additional chief secretary, Forest and Environment and principal secretary local bodies of these states urging them to arrange for their own STPs to stop the release of untreated sewage water into the protected forest area.Since there is no sewage treatment plan in Kansal and Nayagaon so all the sewage of these areas are released into Chandigarh forest behind Sukhna lake. Untreated water of Saketri and Mahadevpur village, adjoining Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary is also being discharged into the Nepli Choe. The untreated water is likely to be mixing in the Sukhna Lake, one of the citys hot spot, so the water discharge must be stopped immediately, wrote Dabendra Dalai, CCF.Dalai said that a letter was written by his predecessor to these officials two years ago but received no response, not to talk of swift action by them. The Sambar deer caught skin disease by standing in the waterlogged area full of sewage to feed on Saccharum Munja vegetation. There can be other grave health hazards to the species and others which are yet to be examined, said forester Jitender Kumar Ranjan.According to Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator of forest, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) conducted a damage assessment of the area two days ago and found Carbon Organic Dissolve (COD) and Biological Organic Dissolve (BOD) level threatening to the ecosystem. Owing to this the forest department has begun some traditional method to cure water which has helped in reducing the BOD and COD level from 208 mg/l and 72 mg/l to 27 mg/l and 7 mg/lThe sewage water was bio-treated by constructing a 2.3 km water channel to divert water to shallow water body created under the City Forest Plan. Things like Saccharum Munja, rice straw bunch and gravel Iron ore were also put in the channel in order to increase the oxygen level in the water. Sand and gravel were put under the bed of channel as filtering agent.The roots of trees like Shisham, Sahtoot, Kikar, eucalyputurs, Dhak and so on also played role in absorbing some of the impurities and releasing oxygen into the sewage water before entering into the shallow water body, Qayum added."

On the more approachable level, you have Maratha Samrat in Pune and Gunpowder in Goa.Food trucksAfter the film Chef, all of a sudden there were food trucks everywhere, wanting to sell everything from kathi rolls to stir-fries and sundaes. If youre from Bombay, you may remember Hungry Eyes which used to be a food truck parked near The Oberoi in the 80s, selling noodles and fried rice throughout the day and night (especially popular after a night of drinking). Obviously, food trucks have been around, but it wasnt until the movie glamorised the whole concept that it became popular. The only thing that seems to hamper the growth is municipal permissions and the hygiene factor.

It also has branches in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Malaysia. This was followed by Barista and, more recently, Starbucks. The emergence of local, round-the-corner cafes, all serving lattes, cappuccinos and Italian-style espresso and macchiato  as well as a range of cold coffees and teas  almost makes me feel that we were born to a coffee culture. I saw this trend in Singapore 20 years ago, also a predominantly tea-drinking market like us. I wondered when it was going to hit India. Its not just about coffee, its also about the ambience, the cool vibe and the sheer selection on offer, both cold and hot. Tea doesnt have the same effect.

They were not considered serious wines till quite recently when many good winemakers in the region of Provence in the south of France decided to pay more attention to this variety because of growing international demand.Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitts rose from their Provence estate Chateau Miraval made waves in 2012 when it was produced and sold on the international market. It raised the bar for the rose wine. Jon Bon Jovi also helped his son Jesse launch a brand of rose wine. Star-powered roses then continued with Sophia by Francis Ford Coppola, and Drew by Drew Barrymore. Needless to say, the imports of rose from Provence into the US doubled in 2016. Rose wines are being made by leading wineries in India for some time  Sula, Grover Zampa and Fratelli. With the fashion statement it is making internationally, the rose wine might finally catch on here. The style is light, fruity and easy-drinking.
