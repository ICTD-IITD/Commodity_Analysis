58f4d19360de470aa339c273,Lives touched with extraordinary passion,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160101/jsp/nation/story_61559.jsp,2016-01-01,"HAND THAT FEEDS G.C. Shekhar in Chennai Picture: Arun Shanker Just before six in the morning, one corner of Pycrofts Road in Triplicane, central Chennai, wakes to the bustle of traffic and the tea stalls. But to one man waiting on the terrace of a two-storey building, its already breakfast time for his 3,000 friends. For the past hour, C. Sekar had been placing clumps of boiled rice, washed in water, on a dozen wooden planks. He inspects his work, washes his hands and steps back into the narrow staircase. Dont worry, theyll be here any minute, the 62-year-old says. As if on cue, a flurry of green wings arrives, screeching. A few at first, then a dozen more, till there are hundreds of them, as though Chennais entire parrot population has invaded Sekars home. For the next one hour, its a wavy sea of green on the terrace, broken at the edges by the black of a few pigeons, outnumbered in their own backyard. The parrots line up on the mesh of TV cables and eye the terrace gingerly before dropping onto the planks.As one batch finishes, another flies in amid an incessant cacophony of parrot talk. The occasional bus horn or vroom of a motorbike sends them into a brief tizzy before they land back on the planks. One hour later, the last of the parrots flies out, leaving behind the handful of local pigeons. Theyll be back at five in the evening for dinner, Sekar says. I tried counting them along with a few college students, and our estimate is that we get about 3,000 parrots a day. The love affair began in December 2004, a few days after the tsunami, when Sekar spotted a few parrots on his terrace. He threw a handful of grains at them and found they were only too happy to polish them off. I realised they were unable to find food, so I kept some rice ready next evening only to see more birds arriving. Their numbers kept increasing and they began arriving in the morning as well, expecting me to feed them twice a day. Sekar, who repairs cameras and has a collection of over 4,000 vintage cameras and accessories, some as old as 200 years, uses up 60kg of boiled rice every day, which comes to Rs 600 a day. Initially, all the money came out of my own pocket but seeing my dedication, several nature lovers now contribute every month. So my personal expense is only Rs 12,000 a month. A local trader supplies the rice at wholesale rates, Sekar says. A wildlife official who visited him after hearing about the parrots has told him the birds come from a national park near the IIT, from the Theosophical Societys large gardens and from a few cemeteries. He said the parrots do not fly more than 10km for food and are happy to find a regular feeding spot on my terrace.The routine means Sekar has rarely stepped out of Chennai these last 11 years. He left on his latest outstation visit, to a relatives wedding, after laying the breakfast spread in the night and returned before evening. A few of his neighbours tried to copy Sekar by laying out the same rice breakfast but the parrots simply ignored them. I gave up after a few days as the parrots preferred Sekars food to mine, said Shyam Das, who sells automobile spares and lives two streets away. Still, Sekar has to watch his friends eat from the staircase: They are wild creatures, you see  theyd fly away as soon as they see anyone on the terrace. The pictures had to be taken with a remote camera or from another terrace, hiding behind a cloak. During the recent floods, the number of parrots nearly doubled to 5,000 as they couldnt find food elsewhere, says Sekar. Every shower washed the rice away and Sekar, wearing a raincoat, kept replenishing the planks. This went on for almost 10 hours during non-stop rain on December 1. Sekar cant think of life without the parrots. Im willing to give away my camera collection to a museum; Ill be happy to spend the rest of my life feeding the parrots. What will happen to the birds after him? They found me, Im sure theyll find another like me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MAN O SCRIPTS Muzaffar Raina in Srinagar Picture: Muzaffar Raina When hundreds of his peers from Srinagars old city were trotting across the Line of Control to receive arms training a quarter century ago, a young Manzoor Ahmad Daikoo was keeping alive a legacy often associated with the Valleys fleeing Pandits. He was collecting rare manuscripts, some over a millennium old, that were getting lost to the mayhem following theadvent of militancy. I have more than 11,000 manuscripts, more than the state archives department has and perhaps the largest individual collection in north India, Daikoo, now 50, says. He calls the collection, stacked in racks and gunny bags at his home in suburban Nishat, the Kashmir Research Institute. Sure enough, it keeps attracting scholars from across the country and abroad. Many of my manuscripts are from unknown authors and without a second copy. Many are original, unpublished scripts, Daikoo says. Ive manuscripts written on paper, birch bark and even cloth.... They can buy me a fortune but Ill never sell them.Daikoo has what his mentor Triloki Nath Ganjoo, former Sanskrit professor at Kashmir University and a Shaivism expert, avers is a rare complete manuscript of the famed Kathasaritsagar, a 10th-century collection of stories. Most of the manuscripts are in the Sharda Lipi, the ancient script for Kashmiri and Sanskrit writing, or Persian.I also have manuscripts in Kashmiri (in the calligraphic Nastaliq script), Punjabi, Hindi and English.... I have pieces written with fingernails, called khat-e-nakhoon, an ancient art, Daikoo says. He explains that these were written without ink, by using specially pruned and nurtured fingernails as styluses to make fine grooves on paper that last centuries. I have a couple of manuscripts of nail-written religious literature in Sharda, around 300 years old. They are among my most prized possessions. What inspired Daikoo? Like many others in the Valley, mostly the Pandits, he had inherited a collection of manuscripts from his forefathers. When the Pandits migrated, many left behind their valuable collections, much of which was in danger of falling into the hands of thieves. Besides, the security forces, in their hunt for subversive writing, were questioning people over every piece of literature they possessed, prompting many to destroy their manuscripts. Even my uncle dumped a bag of scrolls once in the Jhelum to save his skin and mine, Daikoo says. That motivated me to do all I could to preserve these documents. I tried to convince whoever would listen that they were precious. I started buying as many as I could. He says he has travelled to Hyderabad, Badaun and Punjab to procure parts of his collection. But most of it was from Kashmir, covering aspects of Kashmiri life ancient and modern, from history, philosophy and religion to politics, literature and medicine. Many are about Kashmiri Shaivism or Trikishastra as it is called. There are translations of the Ramayan and the Mahabharat in Persian. One book shows how much our ancestors knew about the veterinary sciences. He says he has unpublished writing by Urdu poets from the last century, such as Brij Narain Chakbast and Nand Lal Farsi. Daikoo, who translates oriental literature for a living, had inherited large tracts of land, some of which he sold  he says they would fetch crores at current prices  to buy the manuscripts. Ganjoo says Kashmirs rich tradition of writing grew partly from its cold winters when many would sit indoors and write. He said there were 30 lakh Sharda manuscripts across the world, much of it taken away by western scholars during British rule. Daikoo also has thousands of books, administrative orders and key documents of past regimes, and old photographs, coins and newspapers. He says he never received any assistance. Only once I received preservatives worth Rs 1.6 lakh from the government. Most of his collection is therefore poorly preserved, stacked in gunny bags and easy prey for termites. Preserving them scientifically costs a lot. I approached the state government but it offered no help, he says.Nor did the Centres director of manuscriptology when Ganjoo met him, he says. Only 3,500 of Daikoos manuscripts are catalogued. You need experts to do that and you have to pay them. I spent Rs 2.6 lakh on cataloguing; I couldnt afford more, he says. He is saving up to build a preservation chamber on his lawns. It will take me Rs 30 lakh to build but I shall be better able to preserve them, he signs off. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FACE OF SCARRED MEMORIES Muzaffar Raina in Chahal, Baramulla When human rights activist Khurram Parvez wants to put a face to Kashmirs disappeared youths, he thinks of a very wrinkled one. Its the face of Baramulla farmer Atta Mohammad Khan, 82, who Khurram says is the only man in the Valley ready to declare he has buried nameless dead brought by the security forces  all 235 of them. Rights groups that estimate 8,000 men went missing in custody  the state says the number is far lower  want an international probe to find out who are buried in the unmarked graves. They claim to have found 2,700 unmarked graves containing more than 2,943 bodies in three of the Valleys 10 districts alone: Bandipora, Baramulla and Kupwara. Khan was the only gravedigger who came forward to speak about these graves and thus became the face of that expose. He said that at the most he could get killed, said Khurram, coordinator of the J&K Coalition of CivilSociety. I have buried some 235 people there (the local graveyard), Khan acknowledged at his ramshackle home in Chahal village, 80km from Srinagar. He gave them a proper burial, after conducting a funeral, when the security forces came from nearby camps with bodies and asked the village to bury them  a common occurrence across the Valley during the height of militancy.Khan volunteered because none else would, fearing trouble from either the forces or the militants. That was from 2002 till 2006, before the graveyard ran out of room. Manzor Ahmad points to one of the graves. Pictures: Muzaffar Raina Now Khan is bedridden with multiple ailments and his memory is almost gone. But one thing he doesnt forget is to keep reminding his son Manzoor Ahmad to take care of the graveyard. One of those buried at the graveyard was a six-month-old girl. I remember the army saying she was killed in crossfire. Nobody has ever come looking for her, Manzoor said. If that was one of the most heartbreaking sights Khan had to see, he was spared another. When the forces brought the body of his nephew Mohammad Salim one day, Khan was not home and, for once, somebody else buried him, Manzoor said. Later, when we checked the photograph (clicked by the police), he turned out to be a cousin of mine. He was not a militant but had been missing for a year or so. Khan, despite his failing eyesight and memory, tried to remember the appearances of the bodies he had buried so he could later help families who came looking for missing loved ones. Around half a dozen of the graves now have tombstones with names inscribed on them. My father helped identify them, Manzoor said. Some of them, possibly, were militants and some were not. Manzoor said the burials affected his fathers health over the years. I would help him bury these bodies, which were badly mutilated and in many cases defaced, he said. Every burial would leave him deeply disturbed and haunted by bad dreams for days. After the rights groups came out with a report titled Buried Evidence in 2009, with Khan the sole gravedigger who testified, the forces came looking for him and asked troubling questions. We faced harassment but were not harmed, Manzoor said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TURNING A CORNER Nishit Dholabhai in New Delhi Good morning, sir, the cabbie says in English. His accent, body language and ease of manner suggest a college education. Er, how far did you study? I ask hesitantly, wondering if he might see it as unwarranted curiosity. Well, I have a degree in civil engineering, he says after a moments pause and bursts out laughing. I join him, in disbelief and surprise. Ramit Arora, 29, had sometime in 2012 decided that signing up with Ola Cabs made better sense than sticking to his Rs 10,000-a-month construction supervisors job with realtor Gaursons India Limited in Ghaziabad. Id learnt by word of mouth how much they earned, the Ghaziabad businessmans son who graduated from a private engineering college in Meerut said, changing gears as he tackled the evening traffic at Mandi House, New Delhi. So, borrowing a little from friends, he bought a car. Today, he says, he works over 12 hours a day and earns at least Rs 90,000 a month. Ramit explained he had to pay Ola a portion of the fare, which rises sharply during the peak hours  6am to 11am and 4pm till late evening (a 25km ride in Delhi between 4.30pm and 6pm on December 6 cost me Rs 478). But the key is the incentive of Rs 225 per trip that Ola pays him during the peak hours  to pre-empt attrition in a fiercely competitive taxi-hailing industry. I hardly have to wait 10 minutes between two trips, said Ramit, looking smart in his Ola uniform  white linen kurtas with shoulder straps and matching jootis. But the road to prosperity offered a few tricky turns. First, the family found his new profession demeaning. When his sister, a lawyer, got married Ramit told his family he had hired a driver for his cab  just to spare them embarrassment before the in-laws. Harder to handle has been the condescending attitude of some of the passengers, who would address him with a tu and often speak disrespectfully. One afternoon there were some extremely impolite passengers; I dropped them halfway, near another cab, with folded hands and said I didnt want the fare, Ramit said. The company told me my ratings (which Ola seeks religiously from the passengers) would drop but I said I cant compromise on self-respect. Aprameya Radhakrishna, who founded TaxiForSure with Raghunandan G. before selling the company to Ola, said the average monthly income of a cabbie attached to a taxi-aggregating company was Rs 50,000. Theres a social mobility, with even students working as part-time drivers, he told The Telegraph. But Radhakrishna warned that Ramit and his peers might be enjoying a first-mover advantage that might not last. As the taxi-hailing industry grows  estimates suggest a combined fleet of 300,000 taxis in major Indian cities  only a handful of competitors would be left standing and the fares would rise while the incentives for drivers fell, he said. Ramit, whose father runs a wholesale grocery business in Uttar Pradesh, has inspired a cousin, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering, to become an Ola driver too. Ive been driving a cab for two years but my family doesnt know. Ill tell them once I buy a second car and hire a driver  that will raise my status, said the young man, who earlier worked in the machine tools department of a well-known gear company near Delhi. He asked that his name not be revealed lest it interfere with his marriage prospects. Ramit ducked a query about his marriage plans, smiling and saying he needed to save money first. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A LONG INNINGS Piyush Srivastava in Muzaffarnagar Pictures: Naeem Ansari When a young Vijay Singh walked out to bat  stage a dharna outside the Muzaffarnagar collectors office, actually  P.V. Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister and Sourav Ganguly a mere Test hopeful. Almost 20 years from that day  February 26, 1996  the frail-looking 54-year-old is still at the crease, on the same dharna, protesting large-scale land grab in his village of Chausana, 73km away. Thats nearly two decades spent non-stop on the roadside in rain and shine, 44C summer to 5C winter, protected by a canvas tent, surviving on roti and vegetables he cooked on a brick chulha and then a kerosene stove, leaving his post only to use the nearest public toilet. Except that one time the ex-schoolmaster had to visit Chausana when his father died in 2002. And, oh, that other time in 2006 when he had to be taken to hospital after suffering a mild heart attack. A few things have changed since last year, though. A sympathetic administration has allowed him to shift to an unused veranda inside the collectorate premises, where he has set up home with three plastic curtains. And he has an LPG cylinder, provided by an admirer. Masterji, enough is enough, go home now, a fresh-faced additional district magistrate would tell him now and then. Only after you meet my demands, would be the instant reply out of the 5-foot-7, 65kg frame. The DMs dont talk to him: he has seen off 23 of them, including a few who tried to browbeat him. Nowadays he sometimes leaves the spot to speak on human rights at school functions. Masterji has become part of Muzaffarnagars lore. The hawkers give him Hindi newspapers for free every morning. His handful of fans now contribute Rs 2,500 every month, so hes stopped accepting the money that his nearly estranged family of well-to-do farmers used to send through acquaintances. Singhs wife Pushpa, whom he left to bring up three young children all by herself, and son Gopal, a 21-year-old BSc student, look after their 23-bigha land, which grows sugarcane, paddy and wheat. Daughters Kalpana, 25, and Sakshi, 23, are doing MSc and BEd, respectively. Initially, my wife would call me a godly character because I was fighting for others. But after the first four-five years she began objecting. Now they all think Im crazy, Singh rued. Gopal and Kalpana accuse their father of being uncaring and doing nothing for them. The son last visited him three years ago but his daughters sometimes call him. In Singhs conservative boondocks, his wife isnt expected to travel and meet him in public. Does he feel guilty about abandoning them? Occasionally, yes, but he believes the cause is bigger. A boys cry It wasnt Singhs plots the mafia grabbed but 4,000 bighas of the government-owned gram sabha land, leased to Chausanas landless to grow food. Since 1982, when he was 21 and had just begun teaching economics and civics at the village school, Singh had been writing these victims applications and accompanying them to the collectorate. My life changed on a February evening in 1996 when, on my way home from school, I overheard an eight-year-old begging his mother for roti. She had none to give because the familys plot had been snatched, he said. I wept through the night. While there was so much fertile land, a child was sleeping hungry. I decided to quit my job and take up this fight, but I hadnt the foggiest that it would stretch 20 years. Within days, he had pitched his tent at the dharna sthal, a designated place for protests just outside the collectorate gates  a feature in many Uttar Pradesh districts. As a rich landowner, he could have led a comfortable life but chose to fight for others. Thats why we respect him, said Devraj Panwar, the man who provides the LPG cylinders. It was here that Singh had felt chest pain one day nine years ago. I had the phone number of the then city magistrate, V.K. Singh, whom I somehow managed to call from my mobile. He came and took me to hospital, Singh said. Nowadays, when I occasionally catch a fever, I can go to any doctor in town. They all know me and never ask for fees. We know his struggle is genuine but the land mafia have political patronage, said a district official, pleading anonymity because chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is seized of the matter. Singh had undertaken a 19-day, 610km padayatra to Lucknow and met Akhilesh on April 28, 2012. Akhilesh ordered a probe, which helped free 300 of the 4,000 bighas the same year. But progress has stalled again. Appreciation has been coming, though, with the Limca Book of Records in 2011 declaring Singhs protest the longest continuous one-man agitation in the country and the India Book of Records honouring him for his non-political, non-violent satyagraha the following year. What if he achieves his end some day, will he go back home? A shadow crosses Singhs face. I dont know if I can, he says. Since most of the land-grabbers are my fellow Thakurs, I fear ostracism if I return to Chausana. Besides, my familys alienated from me. So will he spend the rest of his life on this veranda? Havent thought about that yet, he replies slowly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INSULT TO CRUSADE Basant Rawat in Rangpar Picture: Basant Rawat Ratna Ala couldnt see their faces but the mocking laughter rang in his ears. What use is information for a blind man? Get lost, son, the sarpanch said to a chorus of guffaws. That moment changed the now 39-year-old Alas life, turning a mild-mannered, disabled herdsman in Kathiawad into a Right to Information crusader feared by the mafia and corrupt officials alike. This was sometime in 2007. Ala had been listening to a radio programme on the RTI Act, enforced since October 2005, and was impressed. Why dont I do something about my problem? he thought. So he turned up at the local panchayat office in Rangpar, 40km from Rajkot, to ask why they werent repairing the rutted village road he was finding difficult to negotiate. Their rudeness deeply disturbed me. But it made me think, Ala told this newspaper. He wondered how much a man who could only read Braille do. Ala had lost his father at 15 and studied till Class X with help from a philanthropic organisation. So, when he learnt about the RTI helpline run by the Ahmedabad-based NGO Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel, the first question he asked Pangti Jog, one of its officials, was: Can a blind man file an RTI plea? Of course, why not? she assured him before teaching him how to draft an RTI application. Since then, Ala has been unstoppable. The reply to his first RTI query told him the village road had been repaired twice in the past two years. On paper, that is. Ala got a local newspaper in Rajkot, 40km away, to publish the story, and the road was repaired soon. The same year, 2007, Ala prevented 281 acres of village pastures from being illegally handed over to a clock factory by local officials. In 2010, he exposed Rangpars incorrect voter list braving threats from a political group that thrived on bogus voting. A friend told me that when he went to correct his name on the voter list, he saw many names without photographs, Ala said. His RTI plea revealed that the rolls carried the names of 35 who had left the village and 10 who had died. A grateful Rangpar fielded him as a peoples candidate in the local polls three years ago and elected him its deputy sarpanch unopposed, sending him to the office from where he had returned insulted five years earlier. He then found out that the mining mafia was scooping out moram, a soft gravel, from village grazing land at night.They had political patronage and tried all kinds of tactics, he said. Some people came to my home in my absence and warned my wife Ila that since both of us are blind, they would eliminate us and nobody would be the wiser. Like the former sarpanch, they would soon learn that abusing his blindness only helped stiffen Alas resolve. So they tried a new tack, offering to build Ala a two-storey house. My fight goes on, the 12-bigha owner said in the two-room thatched house he shares with Ila and school-going sons Ajay and Ashish, a few yards from a polished village road that stands witness to how Ala humbled the scoffers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THUMBS-UP TO LIFE Ananthakrishnan G in Kochi Sometimes, asking the wrong question can lead to a right answer. Its perhaps the best lesson little Amrita Antony of Kochi has learnt in school. An anxious query by the Class III girl, heartbroken at a younger mates brain tumour, has triggered a campaign by her school that will help save lives and was highlighted before the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Except that the Prime Minister did not know of Amrita, or teacher Abhilash T. Prathap who found the answer to her query, or the unfortunate Bhavana Lakshmi who had inspired it. Cant we give her a new brain? an anguished Amrita had demanded at the school parliament at St Marys Upper Primary School, Kochi. She had just learnt that Lakshmi, the Class I girl who had stopped coming to school last year, was severely ill even after two brain surgeries. No, what Amrita had asked for was impossible. But it provided to the young Sanskrit teacher Prathap his eureka moment. It was an innocent question from Amrita. Its impact hit us a little later, and the discussion veered to organ donations. Participants wondered what we could do to spread awareness, said headmistress Shajimol K. Thomas. It was then that Prathap suggested the map. It was this colour map of India, printed on a sheet of cloth and covered with white thumb impressions that give it a mottled look, which was sent to Modi with a request to promote organ donations. The 2,500 thumbprints signified 2,500 signatories. Four large pieces of cloth were sewn together for the map, which was displayed as our 400 pupils organised a street play on organ donation on August 11, Prathap said. The onlookers and passers-by gave their thumb impressions. Till now, the school has got 150 adults, including many of its teachers, to actually sign up with an authorised NGO, pledging their organs after their death. Of course, organs can be harvested only from beating-heart cadavers  patients who have suffered brain death while being attached to a ventilator that keeps their hearts and lungs functioning. This is a possibility when death is caused by conditions such as head injury (as in road accidents), stroke or a brain aneurysm. Still, signing up formally means that if any of the 150 are eligible to donate organs after death, their relatives cannot block it. Initially, I was surprised: why a map of India from thumb impressions? Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat broadcast on October 15, before lauding the schools efforts. When the school celebrated its newfound fame, it invited Lakshmi too. She was happy but didnt seem to understand what it was for, Thomas said. Lakshmi has been advised 30 chemotherapies but the family had to stop after three as she was growing increasingly nauseous. We funded the second surgery in July by mortgaging our house, her father R.S. Moorthy, an auto driver, said.Prathap has his own problems. Like many other teachers in government-aided schools, he and his wife, a fellow Sanskrit teacher in another school, are not paid because the government is yet to recognise their posts. The matter is in court while Prathap, father of a nine-month-old girl, works part-time as a welder and gas-stove repairer to sustain the family. All the while devising new ways of thumbing his nose at adversity, no doubt. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FOR THEM, WORLDS A SCHOOL Nalin Verma in Araria Kerala Public School is hardly a signboard youd expect to see in a north Bihar town, 10km from the Nepal border and 2,500km from the state whose name it bears. Nor would the school have existed in Araria, or drawn the Election Commissions attention during this years polls, if gun-toting Naga militants hadnt visited the home of the owners  Bindu and N.J. Shaju  in Assam a decade ago.If thats confusing, first things first. After getting a BA in English in her home district of Wayanad, Bindu had trained as a nurse and joined a hospital in Lumding, Assam, in the late 90s. It was a low-paid job in a small hospital. Id been a good student and wanted to shift to teaching which I loved, Bindu, 40, said. I applied and got a job at Don Bosco School, Lumding, in the year 2000. Her family married her off the same year to Wayanad boy Shaju who, after graduating in English, was running a grocery. He was only too glad to join his wifes school as a fellow teacher. We lived happily. Then the terrorists targeted migrants, Bindu said. Four men brandishing firearms and sickles barged into our home and set us a deadline to leave. Many of the couples relatives and friends from Kerala, working as professionals, teachers and nurses in Lumding, left because of the threat. After several fearful days, we received a call from some of our relatives and friends who were working in southeast Bihars Maoist-hit Jamui-Munger region, where missionaries from Kerala run several educational institutions, Shaju, 43, said. We caught a train to Jamui. But the wages at the private school that recruited them were very low. So they left for Lakhisarai to work at a girls school. Members of the land mafia were on the schools board and fought among themselves. The school was in perennial turmoil: our wages were kept pending for months, Shaju said. So, on to north Bihar and Araria. This time they opened their own school from a rented house. It was 2009.We were given two small rooms at a congested place. The landlord fleeced us, and we didnt attract enough students, barely 15-20, Shaju said. We began looking for another neighbourhood. Picture: Nalin Verma A violent tropical storm that struck in April 2010 and killed 90-odd in north Bihar also left an asbestos-roof house in Ararias Mahadev Chowk devastated. The owner was very generous; he rented it out to us on a nominal rent and asked us to open the school, Shaju said. We had no money; so we removed the debris ourselves and shifted here in 2010. Five years on, Kerala Public School has 320 students including 80 girls and stands as a beacon in a district whose literacy rate of 55.1 per cent trails the national average of 74.04. Of the 15 teachers, 11 are from Kerala. People here believe that teachers from Kerala are better. We too feel a connection because we believe we have something to offer to these backward areas whose new generation wants to study, Shaju said. Literacy is high in Kerala, so is the competition in the field of education. Bihar gave us the chance to follow our passion. The English-medium school, affiliated to the CBSE, draws the children of Ararias middle class and its elite  district officials, Sashastra Seema Bal officers and local businessmen. Bindu said the tuition fee was Rs 450 to Rs 500 a month. Its an extremely good school, an SSB officer averred. My kid is doing well. Shes learnt to speak English. The couples younger son Shabil, 11, lives with them but the elder Shabin, 13, studies in Thiruvananthapuram.The school caught the eye of the election authorities who paraded its students on Ararias streets ahead of the Assembly polls to urge people to vote. District officials and townspeople had perhaps told them what they told this newspaper: that Bindu and Shaju ran Ararias best school."
58f142fca3d24b245e597e20,"Higher MSP won't solve pulses problems, says NITI Aayog's Ramesh Chand",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Higher-MSP-wont-solve-pulses-problems-says-NITI-Aayogs-Ramesh-Chand/articleshow/50401413.cms,2016-01-01,"Ramesh Chand has spent over three decades in farm research and teaching agricultural economics and policy. He has now been appointed as a key member of the NITI Aayog to prepare a blueprint for the revival of the agricultural sector. In an interview to TOI, Chand talks about prices, rural distress, role of cutting edge technology and the need for state run institutions in the farm sector. Excerpts:The fortunes of the agriculture sector are cyclical. But the recent slowdown which followed 7-8 years of good growth has been further aggravated by two successive years of adverse monsoon rains. The rabi crop was hit by excessive rainfall. That further pulled down agri growth. This time despite low output, prices are also depressed. It's a double whammy for farmers. That is why you hear stories of agrarian distress. We have looked at a number of factors which can revive growth. One of them is good quality seeds. Another is fertiliser. And the third is in the area of prices.It does not always have to be through government support. We have serious problems with marketing. Markets are not only inefficient, their inefficiencies are rising. In some markets cartels are operating. I am a strong supporter of increased private sector participation in agriculture marketing. Under normal circumstances, the market should take care. That is not happening. One reason is that because of APMC Act (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) there are so many restrictions.States are not doing it. This is the problem. Central government has been trying to do it for the last 12 years. I would say traders' lobbies are opposed to reform of the APMC.One is to expand the national common market gradually. Hopefully states should come on board.Higher minimum support price alone is not a solution. If you can assure the farmer that you will get a reasonable price, he may put area under pulses. It may make some difference. But it will lead to very little increase in productivity. Prices help in harnessing potential created by technology, prices do not create potential by themselves. This synergy between prices and technology is very essential.There will be a lot of emphasis on public research and development and even on private sector. Many people are against GM technologies but my position is that in critical areas where we are not able to find success through conventional technology we should not shy away from trying it. In ICAR, the best brains are being applied to increasing productivity of rice and wheat. They need to re-prioritise their research portfolio and put more people on pulses.Pulses is a problem of deficiency, onions is a problem of management. No other crop has the kind of growth rate that onion has. We are asking ICAR and state agriculture universities to provide seeds for onions. Yes cartels are at work. I wrote a book where I said there are clear cases of market manipulation.We have to go in for some sort of public sector intervention. We have to build some kind of storage structure in the public sector. Our public agencies maybe inefficient, but they are needed in these kinds of situations.We need the public sector. A country like India needs institutions like the FCI. The inefficiencies can be addressed. FCI could say that we do not have autonomy. Inefficiency of FCI is partly operational and partly related to policy.Of course they should be. There are problems with FCI but they are not of FCI alone. I am a strong supporter of the presence of public institutions in important food items for safeguarding the interest of consumers. Imagine if the problems of onions were to happen to wheat and rice? We have had two consecutive droughts in many parts of the country but we are still comfortable. There is need to reform FCI but we should not take the extreme step of closing down FCI or even think of dismantling such an organisation. Why don't you allow FCI to procure from newly emerging surplus states such as Bihar? They need autonomy and their management should be in the hands of professionals rather than bureaucrats.I have been taking this position in G-20. Some kind of food inflation is good and we should accept it. If there is no food inflation there is no incentive for the farmer to raise production. But that inflation should be in farm harvest prices not in retail and wholesale prices alone. Some inflation in the farm harvest prices acts as a great incentive for producers. Only if it goes beyond a certain level one should feel concerned."

A decision was taken to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell to state fair price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from the procurement chain.This has been done by adopting the Centres scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) of foodgrain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and Public Distribution System (PDS). But not all States had switched to it.A finance department report forwarded to the State Food and Civil Supplies Department last month had pointed out major lapses in Maharashtras paddy and rice procurement and warned that a rice scam like the one that occurred in Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was in the making if the millers and the FCI were kept part of the chain any longer. All three States have still kept FCI as part of the procurement chain.Senior officials of the State finance department told The Hindu that a report has been pending approval. The report points out procedural lapses in the existing process, in which paddy procured by the State is sent to a rice mill and the rice is stored in the FCI godowns and later supplied to the PDS shops.The miller was dependent on FCI for verification while he himself was supplying poor quality to pass the verification scrutiny. We had strongly recommended the procedural lapses be corrected earliest, said an official.The State cabinet approved the DPS on Tuesday allowing the State to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers to meet the need of PDS and fair price shops. The scheme will be implemented from March 1, and the responsibility of rolling out the scheme has been left to the State Adivasi Vikas Mahamandal and the State Marketing Federation, and monitoring will be done by district authorities.Under the DCP scheme, the States undertake the responsibility to procure foodgrain, store it scientifically and distribute it through Targeted Public Distribution System.Currently, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala are procuring rice under the decentralised procurement scheme. Due to the decentralised process there has been an increase in procurement of rice in these States, the data shows. The finance departments suggestion has been included in report of the food and civic supplies departments. We have considered those points, reads the note of the cabinet."

It does not matter whom they vote for as long as they do so. Last time, the voting was about 47 per cent. This time, we hope at least 60 per cent of voters will cast their ballots,"" she said.When asked whether increased voter turnout will be beneficial to the TRS, Kavitha said ""I do not know if the increase will help TRS or not. More voters taking part will be good for democracy. It does not matter where the people are originally from -- Andhra, Bihar or any other part of the country -- what matters is that they vote.""Explaining her party's strategy for the polls, Kavitha gave the example of the Gandhinagar ward, of which she is the campaign in-charge, where TRS activists will be working as teams at the booth level.""I have people from my Nizamabad constituency as the team leaders, and each will work with a five to seven member team. The TRS has faced several elections and all our leaders and workers come from a humble background. They will visit every household and request votes for the party. That is all we are going to do. There is nothing out of the box in our approach,"" she said.Asked about the disparity, or a perception of it, in the development between the new and the old city areas, she remarked, ""Virasat mein mila hai, kya karen?"" The perception that development happens in the more modern parts of the city is not correct, she said, giving the example of the Samagra Kutumba Survey during which, for the first time, officials went to every household in the Old City and people came out to provide data about their families.""They have faith in KCR garu and that something good will come from government actions. Now, families in the Old City and elsewhere get 6 kg rice per person as there is no cap on the number of people who can benefit from it. We have reached every house with welfare measures, we have done the most for the poor,"" Kavitha explained.Giving another example, she said that against 6,000 old age pensions in Khairatabad constituency, the government now distributes 20,000 pensions. ""The 6,000 people used to get Rs 200 a month. Now, 20,000 people get Rs 1,000 a month. We want to cater to every section of the society. Don't you think people will vote for the TRS after such steps were taken?"" Kavitha asked.As far as development of physical infrastructure is concerned, Kavitha said progess would have been visible in every part of the city had the junction improvement programme taken off as planned. ""In the first few months of the government, KCR garu started the Rs 50 crore junction improvement project and called for tenders on annuity basis, but there was lukewarm response. This slowed matters down. Roads will be laid, junctions will be developed and new buildings will come up. It is just a matter of another year or so to see changes in the city roads,"" Kavitha said.The TRS Lok Sabha member, however, expressed some disappointment that Telangana's request for relaxation of borrowing limits by the central government is yet to be approved. ""Had that happened, you would have by now seen a big change and improvements in the city,"" she said.BOX'No truck with MIM'K Kavitha, TRS MP and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's daughter, said her party has no plans for any truck with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) for the GHMC elections. ""For the present, there are no plans of an alliance. It is an issue that will be dealt with after the elections,"" she said.Though the TRS will contest from all the 150 wards in the GHMC area, Kavitha said, ""I cannot predict how many seats we will win but can tell you that we will be the single largest party."" ""I think we will be able to do it (winning control of the GHMC council) on our own,"" she added.She also explained that any deficit in support, if at all, can be overcome ""with the ex-officio votes from the MLAs and MLCs from the GHMC area who have joined the TRS.""Kavitha, however, did admit that it has been a challenge to find candidates, especially in areas where the MIM is very strong. ""Everyone knows that just fielding a candidate in MIM strongholds is very difficult. We are now trying to pick the best of the candidates we have in such areas,"" she said.QUOTESI do not know if the increase (in no. of voters) will help TRS or not.

58f58436a3d24b0b70c22289,Banking on populist policies,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banking-on-populist-policies/article8079526.ece,2016-01-08,"s the ruling party begins trumpeting its achievements in the run-up to the elections, it will be banking on the governments flagship scheme  of free mixies grinders and fans, targeting 1.85 crore families.By this month-end, the government would have spent a staggering Rs 8,800 crore for this popular package aimed at relieving women of the domestic drudgery and improve their lives.Now the facts: Female voters outnumber male voters in Tamil Nadu as per the draft electoral rolls. The AIADMKs traditional vote base comprises mostly women. The party is led by a woman leader in Jayalalithaa. And the party founder MGRs charisma and the two leaves symbol still get votes in rural areas.If the Jayalalithaa government has, as promised, relieved 1.54 crore women of drudgery till now, will it fetch the ruling party votes enabling it to recapture power?Interaction with women voters in a few localities in the city revealed that the women are happy with the freebies. The women admit that the freebies, each worth about Rs. 5,000, have certainly improved their lives. And they have no problem with the working of the mixies and grinders, which they received three years ago.Mallika, a resident of Otteri, is a house help and the head of a large family, says: The mixie and grinder are of immense help,Ask her and her neighbours if they will vote for the ruling party in return, you only get chuckles. My husband is a great fan of Kalaignar [Karunanidhi], she says.Meena, a house help from Chindadripet, said she found the freebies to be of much help and is all praise for the present government. She also has in her house a colour TV and a gas stove given during the DMK regime.But many others lost their household items, including the freebies, in the recent floods. Their essential concern lies in rehabilitation and beneficial schemes that will help them in the long run. We cant say if freebies will influence our voting choice. As long as they are all useful products, we are happy, says her neighbour.Saraswathi of Doomingkuppam in Santhome said that since her ration card was not listed she was unable to get the freebies, though most of her neighbours did get them. She also wont say if she will vote for or against the government.Till last year, 1.54 crore families with rice ration card were covered for the free mixie, grinder and fan scheme. We were unable to finish it on schedule due to the rains in the flood-hit districts. We hope to do this by Pongal, said a senior civil supplies official.Like the present government, the previous DMK regime had distributed 1.60 crore colour television sets by spending Rs. 4,000 crore. To top it, the then deputy chief minister M.K. Stalin was banking heavily on Self Help Groups (SHGs) as officials made him believe that the SHGs were a trusted vote bank. Mr. Stalin gave enormous thrust to the SHG movement. None of it worked. The DMK lost even the Opposition leader post in the Assembly.Game changerFreebies really have not won elections. It was MGR who last won successive elections. The previous DMKs Re-1 rice scheme was launched [in 2006] and it was a game changer. It changed the political economy of food and agrarian relation by taking away the control over food. Still, the DMK lost the [2011] elections, points out J. Jeyranjan, a developmental economist.The Dravidian parties ruling the State alternatively, however, continue to expand the populist schemes. The voters, though, like to keep them guessing. Recent political history shows they vote for the ruling party in by-elections, but vote it out in the Assembly elections, he says.(Additional reporting by Anjana Shekar and Abrar Sultana)Beneficiaries of the free mixie, grinder and fan scheme admit it to be of help"

On getting passed from the upper house, the bill will become an act.The minister said that the government looks forward to strengthen the infrastructure of the consumer court for which the judicial process should be simplified. This will ensure that the consumer will not have to run pillar to post.Paswan while highlighting the features of the bill to be cleared by the standing committee said that if a person makes purchases suppose in Delhi and is a resident of Kanpur, for lodging a complaint against the substandrad project, he will not have to go to Delhi to do the needful instead the same procedure could be done in the city of his residence. Also the consumer will not require to hire a lawyer to fight a case in the consumer court, instead he will be able to defend himself of his own.Further addressing the newspersons, Paswan said that his government is committed to put a ban on the astray advertisements.

5903c72e7be9e02646bd7d8c,Colleges rush to nurture future entrepreneurs,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/522381/colleges-rush-nurture-future-entrepreneurs.html,2016-01-10,"Colleges rush to nurture future entrepreneursBy Natasha Singer, Jan 11, 2016, International New York Times 23:41 ISTThe original charter of Rice University, drafted in 1891, established a school here dedicated to the advancement of literature, science and art. These days, Rice seems equally dedicated to the advancement of the next Mark Zuckerberg.The university offers academic courses in entrepreneurship strategy and financing, extracurricular start-up workshops and a summer prog-ramme for students seeking to start companies.In August, Rice announced a multimillion-dollar entrepreneurship initiative to develop more courses and programmes in the subject. And administrators say they hope to erect an entrepreneurial centre to house classes and services supporting student projects.We want Rice to be one of the schools at the top of the list of schools that prospective students with entrepreneurial aspirations say would be a good place to realise their ambitions, said David W Leebron, Rices president. This is a nontrivial group of students, some of the smartest students, the most creative students.Ten years ago, it may have sufficed to offer a few entrepreneurship courses, workshops and clubs. But undergraduates, driven by a sullen job market and inspired by billion-dollar success narratives from Silicon Valley, now expect universities to teach them how to convert their ideas into business or nonprofit ventures.As a result, colleges  and elite institutions in particular  have become engaged in an innovation arms race. Harvard opened an Innovation Lab in 2011 that has helped start more than 75 companies. Last year, New York University founded a campus entrepreneurs lab, and this year, Northwestern University opened a student start-up centre, The Garage.Todays students are hungry to make an impact, and we have to be responsive, said Gordon Jones, the dean of a new College of Innovation and Design at Boise State University in Idaho and the former director of Harvards Innovation Lab. Yet campus entrepreneurship fever is encountering skepticism among some academics, who say that start-up programmes can lack rigor and a moral backbone.Even a few entrepreneurship educators say that some colleges and universities are simply parroting an innovate and disrupt Silicon Valley mindset and promoting narrow skill sets  like how to interview potential customers or pitch to possible investors  without encouraging students to tackle more complex problems.A lot of these universities want to get in the game and serve this up because its hot, Jones said. The ones that are doing it right are investing in resources that are of high calibre and equipping students to tackle problems of importance.In trying to develop rich entrepreneurial ecosystems, many institutions are following a playbook established years ago by Stanford University and MIT, which involves academic courses, practical experience and an extended alumni advisory network.Some universities are redoubling their efforts. Princeton, offers a variety of entrepreneurship courses. But, in a report released in May, a university advisory committee concluded that Princeton had fallen behind competing schools that had made major upgrades to their programmes.Among other issues, the report said, Princeton had allotted only 1,500 square feet for student incubator and accelerator programmes, whereas Cornell has 364,000; Penn 200,000; Berkeley 108,000; Harvard 30,000; Stanford 12,000; Yale 7,700; NYU 6,000; and Columbia 5,000.In November, Princeton celebrated the opening of a 10,000-square-foot Entrepreneurial Hub near campus. The university is also starting a summer internship programme in New York City so that students can spend time at young companies.Mung Chiang, the director of the Keller Centre for Innovation in Engineering Education at Princeton, said the university wanted to help students, faculty and alumni become more entrepreneurial in business, government, and nonprofit work. Its about broadening peoples mindsets and capabilities, Chiang said.The growth in campus entrepreneurship is clear, administrators say. In 1985, college campuses in the United States offered only about 250 courses in entrepreneurship, according to a recent report from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which finances entrepreneurship education and training. In 2013, more than 400,000 students were taking such courses.The prospect of starting the next Snapchat or Instagram is one attraction for students. But in a tight job market, where young adults say they expect to change employers every few years, some undergraduates are signing up for start-up training in the hope of acquiring self-employment skills.To be honest, our generation is no longer interested in doing one thing for the rest of our lives, said Mijin Han, a senior at Rice with an English major and a business minor focused on entrepreneurship. Our generation is interested in learning different things, and, if the environment does not provide it, we want to jump out and take a risk.Funding ideasTo support the programmes, colleges and universities are raising money and seeking mentors among successful alumni and local business leaders. Some provide stipends for students participating in accelerator programmes or offer seed capital for their start-ups; others may negotiate revenue-sharing arrangements if graduate students want to commercialise ideas developed in university labs.Yet the quick start-up workshops offered on some campuses can seem at odds with the traditional premise of liberal arts schools to educate deliberative, critical thinkers.Real innovation is rooted in knowledge and durable concern and interest, not just I thought of something that nobody ever thought of before, said Jonathan Jacobs, who writes frequently about liberal education and is the chairman of the philosophy department at John Jay College of Criminal Justice of The City University of New York. Thats not educating people, frankly.That is one reason Rice administrators say they are consolidating and analysing current programmes before embarking on additional efforts. As part of that process, the university introduced an interdisciplinary forum last month to promote campus research, discussion and broader courses in entrepreneurship.Leebron, Rices president, described the initiative as part of an effort to improve the hands-on, project-based learning students are requesting. Theres no question that more people at the age of 18 are coming to universities saying, I have an idea; I think I can have an impact, he said. What are we going to do with these folks? How are we going to support them?"

(Vasant Prabhu) The restaurant that had started in 1944 folded up in the late 1990s. (Vasant Prabhu)BACK in the early 1990s, when Farokh Irani launched the Chicken In Wine at his much-loved open air restaurant, he reluctantly agreed to share the recipe with one of his most loyal customers, a senior banker and fellow Parsi. I told him that when we received an order for Chicken In Wine, a staffer would rush from the basement kitchen to the area where we kept fowl, open a chickens beak, pour in a good measure of wine, wait for the bird to start tottering, and then rush it, freshly slaughtered, to the chef, says Farokh Irani, a former owner of Cafe Naaz, the restaurant that stood in the 1980s and 1990s atop Malabar Hill, forerunner of all Mumbai cafes where writers, film-makers, artistes, journalists and others lounged for hours. The funnier part of Iranis story is the footnote: He actually believed me.Maybe what was truly intoxicating was the view. From Cafe Naaz, one could see the curvaceous Marine Drive beyond the lush greens of Malabar Hill. Or maybe it was company you kept there  Mahesh Bhatt, Shobhaa De, Sanjay Dutt, Sheetal Mafatlal, theatre personalities, artistes, writers, journalists, film-makers, this was where the hip crowd gathered.King Kong visited once. The Shah of Iran did too. Vinod and Kavita Khanna are said to have thrown a grand wedding party here. A young socialite rented the three-level cafe for a private party, liveried waiters setting up the food before she arrived, a rather elaborate affair for a solitary guest  a textile magnate she would later marry.Over 100 Bollywood movies had scenes featuring Naaz. Sanjay Dutt, during the shooting of Aatish for which the cafe was let out to the producers for a month, laid a wager with Irani on whether it was still possible to source Ice Cream Soda. The Iranis won that bet.Naaz is the stuff of urban legend, as were its chelo kababs, succulent meat on a bed of rice fragrant with Iranian saffron. Our Cafe Naaz was for the guy who drove up in a Cadillac as much as for the handcart-pusher who would stop for chai, says Irani. So if the Chelo kababs were priced at Rs 250 a plate, there was always a Rs 5 cup of tea to be enjoyed, the view came free. Whatever it was that drew them to this Irani cafe, it kept them returning for more.The restaurant was started in 1944 by another generation of Iranis, when Malabar Hill was thickly forested with only a mud path leading to the top. In the late 1990s, following years of litigation, the restaurant had to fold up with the BMC ousting its tenant over an expired lease. The BMC had taken the land back ostensibly for its water works department. A few years ago, the authorities also floated the idea of an observatory, a vantage point to look over the city, for a fee. Now, well over a decade later, part of the property is used by a municipal union as office space, the rest of the once-bustling cafe and sit-out reduced to a large litterbin and an overgrowth of weeds.Today theres no signboard, no anticipation of a turnaround, nobody to claim the space as the citys. Cafe Naaz keeps its desolate vigil over the bay, standing over interments of memories of a different city, another ethos.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

After cotton crop failure and losses due to basmati rice price crash in the last kharif season, we were pinning our hopes on a good harvest from wheat, but it looks like the crop could fail and our miseries will continue, said Mr. Bains.Minimum temperatures have been hovering above 2 to 4 degree Celsius above normal at many places in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana during the past few days and are expected to continue to be a little higher than usual for the next few days, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).It will be mostly dry weather prevailing during the next 7 to 10 days across the northern region and parts of central Indian States, said B.P Yadav, weather official at IMD.Yield may be hitCurrently temperatures are on the higher side and wheat needs cold conditions to thrive. Its a crucial period for the crop and if temperatures continue to remain high there would be definitely a yield loss, said P.S Rangi, agriculture expert, adding that rain was also required at this moment."

We receive the second highest number of complaints of bonded labour from Odisha after Uttar Pradesh,"" said Justice D Murugeshan, member of the NHRC, here on Tuesday. He was speaking at a national-level workshop on elimination of bonded labour organised by the NHRC.He said that most of the complaints received from Odisha are regarding the 'bartan' system in which the upper caste employs lower caste families for menial labour jobs for a pittance - as low as 15kg rice a year. ""The 'bartan' system is a major violation of the human rights of a person. Government officers must be sensitive while identifying and rescuing bonded labourers. Rehabilitation of the rescued along with alternate employment is very important so they are not forced to migrate again,"" he added.According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011, Odisha has a total 6,353 bonded labourers of whom 5,413 have been legally freed. Since 2011, a total 1,747 bonded labourers have been identified. The state government has so far rehabilitated 493 bonded labourers and has sought permission from the Centre for rehabilitation of 891 more. The state government and the Centre give Rs 10,000 each to a bonded labourer under the rehabilitation scheme.Senior officers of the state government, representatives of the State Human Rights Commission, voluntary organisations, and representatives of brick kilns, stone crushers and other related industries participated in the day-long workshop.""The objective of the workshop is to familiarize and sensitize district magistrates, sub-divisional magistrates, state labour officers and members of vigilance committees, brick kilns, stone-crushing and other related industries involved in the process of identification, release and rehabilitation of bonded labourers and with the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 and other related legislations,"" said chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi.A large number of people - including from the washermen and barber communities - are still working as bonded labourers in Puri and Cuttack districts. Meanwhile, many rescued bonded labourers in Nuapada and Balangir districts are again migrating due to delay in payment of the assistance money of Rs 20,000 each, alleged organisations working for the uplift of bonded labourers."

This has long been the standard for most schools in India, where children learn both national languages (English and Hindi) and often their regional language. Americans are now following suit in raising children to be bilingual or even trilingual.So, why do we seek to learn languages other than our mother tongue? Why spend hours memorising the genders of new nouns, different verb conjugations and how to pronounce letters in a new alphabet? Each person has his/her own answer to this question. Whether it is to communicate with a beloved grandparent, to stay competitive in a global market or simply to increase your knowledge.However, it is essential to learn the culture in tandem with the language you are learning as well. We need to understand culture in order to get the perspective of native speakers, understand the history of the language so we can visit the region in which that language is spoken.In the initial stages of learning a language, it is overwhelming enough to learn the basics such as the alphabet, vocabulary and verb tenses. At that point, being able to write and speak in coherent, grammatically correct sentences is an accomplishment in itself.But becoming an advanced beginner or intermediate student of a language requires more than just being able to county to twenty, name colours/ animals and introducing yourself. It requires you to see the language from the viewpoint of a native speaker, and for that, you need to learn the culture.According to Katherine Surko, her experience in studying Hindi at Washington University in Saint Louis has been fantastic. In September, I knew may be half the alphabet tops, but now I am able to read and write whole paragraphs, which is well beyond what I thought I would be able to accomplish within a year. It is so exciting for me to be able to see such tangible progress, and it makes me really excited for new levels I will reach within the upcoming years. I enjoy the holistic approach our class takes from focusing on writing to speaking to having scattered events throughout the semester, and I look forward to continuing my Hindi studies in the fall in order to meet both my personal and professional goals.Knowing traditions and values better allows us to understand the idioms. An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the usual meanings of its constituent elements, or from the general grammatical rules of a language. Idioms are used in every language but often seem foreign to non-native speakers because they cannot be translated directly. Understanding their usage requires a certain amount of exposure to the language as well as insight into the culture.Take for example, the Hindi phrase Khichdi pakaana. Literally translated to English, it means to make khichdi but this makes no sense without knowing what khichdi is. Khichdi, a mixture of rice and lentils cooked with spices and sometimes vegetables, is the quintessential north-Indian comfort food, a meal cooked on rainy days when people are cooped up indoors. Armed with this tidbit of information, it makes sense that the phrase figuratively means to scheme secretively/hatch a plan.History as linkAnother aspect linking language and culture is history. Just as culture evolves with times, so does language. Thus, the cultures past shows us the factors that have gone into shaping the language as we know it.A great example of this is the Hindi-Urdu language, otherwise known as Hindustani. In the early second millennium BCE, Sanskrit was brought to the Indus valley by those who settled there. A member of the Indo-European family of languages, Sanskrit soon became the standard (both spoken and written) in the region.In the mid-16th century, the Mughal empire (a Muslim Persianate imperial power that ruled much of India for the next few centuries) brought Arabic and Persian languages to the region. These, combined with the Sanskrit derivatives spoken by natives, created a blended language called Hindustani. The mid-19th century saw the introduction of British Raj in India.To allow for communication with the colonial rulers, English words were incorporated into the Hindi vernacular (such as the months of the Judeo-Christian calendar). Even the partition of India in 1947 brought changes for the language.While Urdu and Hindi are written in different scripts, they share a common set of sounds, words and grammatical rules due to their common history. In fact, speakers of Hindi, for the most part, are able to understand Urdu and vice versa.Regardless of ones relation to Indian culture, it is virtually impossible to escape its influence in the United States. Open a newspaper every morning and one can find an article regarding Indias role as an up and coming economic and cultural force in the world. Turn on the television and one can find entire TV shows, such as Outsourced, related to India. Historically tied to the West, Indian culture now permeates every aspect of American life from curry cook books to yoga.At the basis of these trends are the linguistic traditions rooted in Hindi. Along with Indias role in international affairs, the demand for an education based on South Asian culture and language is growing and US universities are answering the call.The history and nuances of a language derive directly from the culture of its speakers. Thus, attempting to learn a language without learning its associated culture is to miss out on everything that makes the language unique, exciting and beautiful.(The writer, a linguist, teaches at the Washington University in St Louis, USA)"

Members of the community have been celebrating Bhogali Bihu for nearly 170 years now.Bihu, like other harvest festivals celebrated by various agrarian communities during January, holds a cultural, rather than religious significance, making it easier for communities to adopt the rituals and make them their own.""Bhogali Bihu holds a cultural significance for us. Just like people in Tamil Nadu celebrate Pongal, we celebrate Bihu in Assam,"" said Allen Brooks, a member of the state minority commission, adding that prayers are held on Bihu days to thank god for a bountiful harvest.It was in 1841 that the Assamese Christian community came into existence when writer Nedhi Lebi Farewell converted to Christianity. Farewell was also a prolific songwriter who translated Christian hymns into Assamese. He worked with Miles Bronson, an American Baptist missionary working in Sadiya and other parts of upper Assam, and gave rise to a small but strong community which takes pride in displaying the cultural markers of the state.In some villages, Assamese Christians wear dhotis and mekhela chador to church, while many sing hymns and devotional songs to the tunes of traditional Assamese songs. During Bihu, they, too, savour 'peethas', 'seera', powdered rice and jaggery and feast on traditional dishes.""Bihu is part of our culture. We celebrate it like the Hindus. We also celebrate uruka nights. Bihu celebrates harvest and there is no religion involved,"" said Aziz-ul-Haque, pastor of Guwahati Baptist Church."

Lokur and Justice R.K. Agrawal asked the Union agriculture secretary to hold meetings with counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Chattisgarh to evolve a coordinated strategy to tackle the problem.The bench passed the direction while dealing with a PIL filed by an NGO, Swaraj Abhiyan, through counsel Prashant Bhushan complaining that no proper succour was being provided by most states and Union territories except Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Apart from 5kg of rice/wheat per person every month, the petition said each family should be provided 2kg of dal and at least 1kg of edible oil.The NGO also urged the apex court to ensure that children are provided free milk or eggs under the mid-day meal scheme, so they get adequate protein.Bhushan told the court that under the National Food Security Act, 2013, the government provided 5kg of rice per person per month only to BPL households.Bhushan pointed out that the rural job scheme provided guaranteed employment for only 100 days to a rural household. He pleaded that the number of days be increased to 150 to tackle the drought crisis.Solicitor-general Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Centre, said that since data relating to rainfall and drought relief were with the states, he needed time to collate it for placing it before the bench.According to Kumar, the Centre had earmarked Rs 61,200 crore under the state disaster response fund for the five-year period of 2015-2020. It was for the states and Union territories to utilise the funds effectively, he added.Justice Lokur, heading the bench, then asked the states concerned to consider the measures suggested by the NGO when their representatives meet the Union agriculture secretary."

Finding worthy leads to follow is not the demanding part; neither is reviewing, which you can learn on the beat. But getting artists to talk about their work? Thats a different story. It is easier to chat up random strangers in the street, than get some of our artists to sing about the thoughts and processes that govern their output.To be sure, there are exceptions to that rule. Ive had a wonderful time interviewing Sudhir Patwardhan, who is as gentle as he is eloquent, qualities that underline most of his cityscapes. Both Reena Saini and her husband Jitish Kallat, who I met recently, are not only articulate, they are also patient and engaging in their explanations. More often than not, however, I have to struggle to put together a structured interview; a process that leaves me feeling a bit guilty. The artists job really is to make art, not to offer lengthy elucidations on the subject, often in a language they might not be comfortable with.So it was with utter delight and surprise that I listened to Bharti Kher talk about her practice this last weekend at Sunaparanta-Goa Centre for the Arts. Housed in a beautiful bungalow in Panjims Altinho Hills area, the centre is hosting the second edition of its arts and literature festival, Sensorium. Curated around the theme of love, Sensorium brings together the work of several contemporary artists including Mithu Sen, A Ramachandran, Atul and Anju Dodiya, Thukral & Tagra, Anita Dube, and Chitra Ganesh. If you choose to visit it, Id point you to a particularly lovely installation by Tushar Joag, Remember you each night, where each broken object is a reminder of a lost love.The Centre has also been inviting artists to talk about their work, and the presentation by Kher, (whose 2006 sculpture, The Skin Speaks a Language Not its Own, created auction history in 2010 when it breached the $1-million mark, a record for a female contemporary Indian artist) was part of that. She spoke about her beloved art teacher, Martin Shaw, and the rigours of art school; about meeting a rice engraver at Dilli Haat who she went on to collaborate with for Sing to them that will listen (2008), where she displayed 2,50,000 grains engraved with matrimonial ads; about her inhibitions regarding working with sex workers whose bodies she used for life-size plaster casts for an upcoming exhibit.Refreshingly, she didnt make a single reference either to her 2006 sculpture or to the sperm bindis that are such an important motif in her work.But the part of the conversation that continues to linger with me is when she was asked about failure. You have to allow your material to fail, she said. The first thing I do when I start a new work, is to soil the paper with my hands.It isnt every day that you can draw such a rare, beautiful image informing a profound thought from an artist, one that offers such a keen insight into an artists discipline. But its well worth the wait.(The writer is a former deputy editor of National Geographic , India)"

(Express photo by Bhupendra Rana) A tribal sifts through the dirt on track for grain. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)As soon as the doors of the goods wagon slid shut at the railway yard in Vadodara, a group of women tiptoed in, armed with brooms, sieves and cloth bags. They gently slipped under the wheels of the train, each staking claim to a spot.Then, they carefully started scooping up and sieving the grain that had spilt over and got mixed with the cement, dust and stains of crude oil on the tracks. A couple of hours later, they silently signalled to each another and moved out, evading the security guards on duty.For these tribal women of Dahod, who do not figure on the official Below Poverty Line (BPL) map of Vadodara despite settling here 10 years ago, this is the only way to keep their families from starving. Even if that means scavenging for dirty grain on the railway tracks.These grains help us survive for a few weeks or even a month. We fear being caught for trespass and being harassed. We come here only to collect some grains that are of no use to anyone, says Surti Pagra Bhil, a widow with two sons and a daughter, who was able to gather more grain in a plastic bag she had picked up on the way.The menfolk are unable to earn much money as daily wage labourers, says Surti, dressed in a frayed cotton skirt and blouse, with a dupatta covering her head.From the yard, the women hire autos in threes to carry the grains to their encampments along the Narmada canal in the Chhani area, where UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon had inaugurated the countrys largest canal-top solar power plant last January.Outside each hut, they spread out the grains to pick out the bigger impurities  crushed train ballast, cement chunks and weeds. We wash the grains in water and dry them before crushing them with our stone-grinders at home. Each of us manages to collect about 4 kg wheat from the tracks. It is sufficient to last our families for a few weeks. For the rest of the days, we survive on what our men earn, says Dholki Damor, another tribal woman from Dahod.Most families here were part of the slum census carried out by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation in 2010. Surti even has a hut identity card, with a magnetic chip, issued by the civic body in her name.Woman collecting grain from dirt. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana) Woman collecting grain from dirt. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)But she says what she really wants is a BPL card. My son, who lives with his wife and three children in the adjoining slum, earns about Rs 2,000 per month. But no one has told us about the BPL card. We do not have any such card. The authorities gave us this (hut identity) card when they conducted a count a few years ago, says Surti.When contacted, District Collector Avantika Singh said that the families that migrated from Dahod, mostly in search of work, fall under the limits of the civic body.Kavita Desai, project director of the urban community development programme of the municipal corporation, said, We are following the BPL list from 2000.However, sources in the Vadodara collectorate said that the BPL list is due for a revision soon.Until then, the train wagons remain the only hope for these families. The women are given the task of keeping an eye on the grain wagons. As there is no fixed schedule, we often visit the yard to see what wagons have come in, says Dholki.If the women are lucky, two trains full of grains arrive in a month. We often return disappointed as cement and sand comes in more often. Then, we rummage through dust bins to look for food, says Dholki.Vadodaras railway yard sees wagons bringing in grains for the Food Corporation of India (FCI) as well as private dealers  mostly rice and wheat. Wagons carrying cement, crude oil and other chemical or construction material also arrive here.Women taking away the stock of grain collected by them.

Says Anil Shrivastav, area manager (Baroda), FCI, It is very rare that grains spill out off bags while loading or unloading. Even those that can be retrieved are picked up by our workers as we have to tally the weight from the loading and unloading points. Only those grains that get mixed with impurities are discarded on the tracks.Shrivastav added that there is no fixed schedule for the trains. The grain wagons come in as per the requirement put forth by the state government. The grains are offloaded at Vadodara and stored at the FCIs Chhani godown. On an average, the FCI sees grain wagons coming in every two weeks, he said."
58f4be8260de4776e36946cc,Green power on Nalanda mind,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160201/jsp/bihar/story_66791.jsp,2016-02-01,"Nalanda University, once constructed, will have a self-sufficient energy source. In doing so, it will join the league of universities such as University of Illinois, University of Massachusetts, Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and IIT-Jodhpur closer home. The upcoming varsity in Rajgir will also focus on economic development of its neighbourhood villages. The university plans to generate power from solar photovoltaic panels, which will be fitted above water bodies on the campus. It would generate power from rice husk, biomass and other renewable sources. According to Nalanda University professional adviser A.R. Ramanathan, as the varsity will meet much of its energy requirement through rice husk and biomass, help and cooperation from villagers will be required. He said: ""The university will purchase rice husk, cow dung and biodegradable waste from nearby villages for power generation."" (Non-biodegradable waste does not break down for many years. Plastics, plastic grocery bags, plastic water bottles, metal and glass are examples of non-biodegradable waste.) Sources said 1 tonne of rice paddy produces around 220kg of rice husk. Similarly, 1 tonne of rice husk produces around 400-550kWh. (kWh is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilowatts and the time in hours.) Sources said the benefits of rice husk technology are numerous as by-products of rice husk, can be used in cement and steel industries. According to Nalanda University officials, farmers selling rice husk and biodegradable waste stand to benefit as regions across Rajgir and Nalanda have an agrarian society with high production of paddy and potatoes. Moreover, the role of university will not be confined to just purchasing raw material from villagers. A team of the university will also enlighten the villagers about the technology. Elaborating the point with an example, Ramanathan said: ""Much of the water requirement will be met from a centrally located pond. The university will focus on harvesting rainwater. Big towers will be constructed to act as air-conditioners. These towers will suck in the outside air, absorb moisture and release it inside the campus."" The university construction work will begin from March-end. Nalanda University vice-chancellor Gopa Sabharwal said: ""The university's academic activities are not just confined to classroom teachings. As part of their curriculum, our students have been visiting nearby villages and interacting with the residents there, imparting knowledge and seeking their cooperation."" The villagers, naturally, are delighted. Ram Naresh Singh, a resident of Rajgir, said: ""We are happy that Nalanda University will help us in social and economic development. It should also focus on educational development of the region. The town is so educationally backward that it doesn't even have a single college to cater to the needs of its residents."" Singh, who runs a grocery shop at the Rajgir market, added: ""The university should take initiatives to open colleges for the youths here. Not everyone here will get a chance to study at Nalanda University."" Colleges and universities essentially operate as self-contained small cities, providing huge amounts of energy to its campuses. Given the large energy needs of our college campuses, combined with the social conscience of today's faculties and students, it is not surprising that institutions across the world are beginning to take a leading role in development and implementation of renewable energy projects."

It would be Modi's second visit to the state in a month after he inaugurates the Paradip oil refinery of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) on February 7.Addressing a news conference here, Singh vied for PM's special love for the eastern state while announcing the PM's rally plan for Bargarh, two weeks after he addresses a meeting in Paradip. Modi would be felicitated for his pro-farmer initiatives at the Kishan Mahasammelan. He will interact with farmers to understand their problems apart from sharing the government's landmark initiatives for the farm sector, he said.He would address four farmers rallies in February, the others being in Madhya Pradesh (February 18), Karnataka (February 27) and Uttar Pradesh (February 28). BJP sources said the PM would publicise the pro-farmer initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana during the rallies.The BJP's selection of Bargarh as a venue for the PM's peasant rally seems politically significant because allegation of highest farmers' suicide has come from this district. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had chosen this western Odisha district to address a farmers' rally on November 19 last year and announced Rs 35,000 crore package for the underdeveloped western Odisha.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too had chosen Bargarh for a padayatra to highlight the plight of farmers on September 10 last year and had interacted with kin of around 10 farmers who ended their lives over agrarian distress.Of the around 140 farmer suicides across the state, Bargarh district witnessed the highest of over 25 in the last kharif season. Bargarh, on Odisha-Chhattisgarh border, is termed the rice bowl of Odisha. It contributes about one-fourth of the total around 30 lakh metric tonne paddy procured annually in the state. A major part the district (Bargarh sub-division) is irrigated for two paddy crops from Hirakud water reservoir while Padampur sub-division is drought-prone with almost no irrigation facility even for single crop."

They have set up an agriculture and food products company in Sikkim. What has surprised them is the pat on the back they got from none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi who praised Anurag Agrawal and Siddhi Karnani for their initiative in his radio talk `Mann ki Baat' on Sunday.Agrawal and Karnani graduated from IIM-A's agri-business course in 2013 and set up their company, `Parvata Foods Pvt. Ltd' in 2014 to provide employment to people in Sikkim. The two now successfully employ around 300 farmers. Now they are planning to hire more than 5,000 people over the next three years in Naxal-affected areas of Orissa.When contacted, Agrawal told TOI that he and Karnani eel fortunate that the PM mentioned them in his `Mann ki Baat' programme.""The PM was very impressed when he visited Sikkim on January 18, where we have set up a small unit. He praised us as he knew that we had launched our start-up after IIM-A and that too in an agriculture related business in the Northeast. We feel Parvata Foods is on the right track. We feel there is great potential in the Northeast."" Agarwal said.His colleague and co-founder of the start-up, Siddhi Karnanai, said that she was surprised when PM mentioned their efforts in the North-East. ""We work with organic farmers in the North-East and, right now, we are more active in Sikkim. We have set up an organic rice processing plant in Sikkim with the state government.

58f4c09b60de4776e369499e,SC 'secession' lash on Gujarat for food law,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160202/jsp/nation/story_67086.jsp,2016-02-02,"New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Supreme Court today came down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat for failing to implement the National Food Security Act, 2013, wondering whether it wanted to ""break away from India"" and had scant respect for Parliament. The apex court also asked what Parliament and the Centre were doing when the state was not implementing the food law. The bench felt that if Gujarat was allowed to have its way, other states following the law would also stop doing so, citing Gujarat as an example. The food law guarantees 5kg of rice/wheat to each member of a family. Under the programme that seeks to cover 75 per cent of the families in rural areas and 50 per cent of the households in cities, the rice is to be provided at Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2. The court was hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, Swaraj Abhiyan, saying the act should cover all families in 11 drought-affected states. Ranjit Kumar, representing the Centre, told the bench during the hearing that Gujarat was one of the states not implementing the food law at all. Kumar - who at the last hearing had been asked to collate information from all states on the scheme - said Gujarat had certain reservations over the programme. The reply invited the wrath of the bench, comprising Justices Madan B. Lokur and R.K. Agrawal. ""You (Gujarat government) want to break away from the Union of India? It is an act passed by Parliament. Tomorrow, Bihar will say we are not implementing it because Gujarat is not implementing it,"" Justice Lokur, heading the bench, told Kumar. Neither Kumar nor the Gujarat government's standing counsel, Hemantika Wahi, could give any convincing reply, except for saying the state was yet to take a decision. At this, the bench observed: ""A law is passed by Parliament. Tomorrow, some other states will say we will not implement it. What is the Government of India doing? What is Parliament doing? What about the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code)? Tomorrow, some other states will say we are not going to implement it (CrPC), we will not implement the IPC, the Indian Evidence Act."" The solicitor-general replied that besides Gujarat, eight other states were not implementing the food law but pleaded that he did not immediately have details about them. ""Today it is Gujarat, tomorrow Bihar.... Then, Chhattisgarh, Haryana will say the same thing. Where is the system going? Jharkhand has been implementing, but from tomorrow they will be saying Gujarat is not doing it, we will not do it. Karnataka is doing it (implementing the scheme), they will say we will not implement. Madhya Pradesh will say we are not implementing. Telangana will say the same thing,"" Justice Lokur observed. As Kumar tried to make some submissions, the bench asked twice: ""Gujarat is unique? Gujarat is unique?"" The court made it clear that ""we are nobody to tell you (the Gujarat government) what you should be doing"". ""But the question is whether you believe in Parliament, or Indian laws? As of now, the law (Act) stands or not? If not, why?"" the bench asked. Later, the bench directed the solicitor-general to place before the court details of the scheme's implementation in various states by February 12 and posted the matter for further hearing on February 15. Swaraj Abhiyan counsel Prashant Bhushan and Pranav Sachdeva pleaded that besides 5kg of rice/wheat free for each person, all families in the drought-hit states should be given 2kg free dal and 1kg of edible oil. Children should be provided an egg free daily or 200ml of milk.

58f17b09a3d24b245e59aaa4,An ode to the traditional art of warq-making in Lucknow,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/An-ode-to-the-traditional-art-of-warq-making-in-Lucknow/articleshow/50827850.cms,2016-02-03,"LUCKNOW: Deep in the narrow bylanes of Chowk, where fragrance of flowers from 'Phool wali gali' meets the perfumed air wafting from ittar shops, comes the muffled but defining sound from the shops of silver 'warq' makers.The serpentine lanes are enveloped in cultural history and time stands still here.A look at the traditional art of warq making or the the process of making edible silver leaves that are used on mithais, can be exquisite.Honed to perfection, some 'warq makers' (craftsmen) still uphold the legacy of Lucknow's royal culture in the 'gali of taksaal' or the lane where coins are made.Devoting lengthy hours, they sit on the floor, pounding small pieces of silver into bright, flimsy, square sheets. Unfortunately, time is gradually weeding out the legacy of this extraordinary trade.""You never felt the need to ask about the shop of a warq maker. The little faint sound would naturally draw anybody there. Even a tourist would know. However, when I visited Lucknow this time after 15 years, I had to ask commuters in Chowk where I can find the warq shop,"" says Suraiyya Saleem, who visited her hometown after a long time.Of the 15 shops then, only about four are left now which preserve the traditional art.Asma Naqvi, a resident of the vicinity, says, ""Our ears were accustomed to the soft rhythmic sound of the hammer. Now, I feel a fragment of culture is missing"".Process of warq makingA small piece of silver, less than half inch in width, is pounded by a special hammer after it is placed between the translucent pages of a small book. It is hammered for four hours persistently to become wafer thin.The tiny piece of silver expands by the heat produced and turns into chandi ka warq or silver leaf.The book is called auzaar or instrument as it works like one for them. Its pages are made up of deer skin and Agra is the only place where the book is manufactured. It is boiled with 356 herbs including mush, amber and zafraan (saffron). It is later seasoned with the stone called Makool. The book costs about Rs 8,000 and lasts for about four months. The silver bands are brought from Varanasi and cut into tiny rectangles.History of warq makingSome 2,000 years ago, silver and gold warq were used in Ayurveda medication and by Hakims for its rich medicinal properties to treat infertility and build immunity. It was also believed to cure chicken pox within a short span of three days when one fourth of gold warq was consumed mixed with honey.Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, who ruled Oudh from 1847-1856 made this art a popular trade in Oudh. Delhi, Hyderabad, Bareilly and Varansi are also major producers of silver warq but the warq crafted in Lucknow is transcendent. ""You do find chandi ka warq in Hyderabad. But the warq crafted in Lucknow is unparalleled,"" Says Rafat, a trader from Hyderabad.During Nawab Wajid Ali Shah's reign, the khansamas (chefs) garnished food with silver and gold warq. Moti pulao or pearl pulao was cooked by coating rice grains with silver and gold leaves.Mohd Saleem is a warq maker whose forefathers devoted 250 years to preserve the legacy of this craft. But, he says, the traditional warq making art is gradually dying.""Karigars are leaving because it's not fetching good wages. Machines do the job for less money,"" he says.""A few years ago, residents in the vicinity complained about the constant disturbance due to the hammering sound from morning to evening. The police asked them to either move their business elsewhere or get sound-proof doors. Most people switched business; some relocated their shops,"" said Saleem.A concern he shares is that people nowadays avoid consuming sweets with warq because they believe it to be coated with aluminium or silver foil mixed with other toxic metals. ""In traditional warq making, adulteration is not possible. The warq obtained is pure silver.""But, another shop owner says that the powder-like substance used in the machine during the process is toxic.Besides, as silver is expensive, some sweet makers use foil made up of inferior metals.Differentiating between the original silver leaves and fake ones, Saleem says said leaves made up of other metals like gilat (an alloy of nickel and aluminium) are blackish silver in colour. They usually don't disintegrate on touch but roll into tiny balls. A silver leaf, on the other hand, instantly sticks to one's finger when touched and the colour is bright silver.Saleem also makes gold leaves, used mainly in medicines and rarely in food preparations because it is expensive. One gold leaf costs Rs 300 per piece and silver Rs 3 per piece.Saleem grimly adds that the traditional art of warq making is invincible and the government should take initiative to preserve and promote the legacy of the Lakhnawi culture."

""The government should not restrain research, otherwise we may have to rush to dig a well when water is needed,"" he told TOI. Kakodkar was in the city to attend the IIEFA seminar organized by Vijnana Bharti and Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA).The scientist was responding to a question on state government's move to stop the confined field trials of maize, chickpea, rice and, cotton in July last year. The trials were planned to be undertaken last monsoon on the basis of state's approval, but were abruptly put on hold by objections from RSS arm Swadeshi Jagran Manch.On the committee's reply to the objections, Kakodkar said certain incidences related to GM crops were reported, but not backed with any scientific explanation.Kakodar added that using the GM technology is the subsequent step. ""First it has to go through its own process which include field trials. However, the very trials which are part of research should not be restrained,"" he said.On the use of technology, he said that though, personally he was in favour of genetic engineering, the whole process of trials and other scrutiny should be gone through first. ""Now the ball is in state government's court,"" he said."

(Source: File | Reuters) More than three lakh farmers in Madhya Pradesh cultivate basmati on over four lakh hectares of land and were hoping for a favourable order, which would have earned them more in exports. (Source: File | Reuters)Madhya Pradeshs battle to get the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for basmati rice grown by its farmers in several districts has hit a hurdle, with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) ruling against it.The assistant registrar of the Geographical Indications Registry had ruled in favour of Madhya Pradesh on December 31, 2013. But the Delhi-based Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) challenged the order. The Chennai-based IPAB has now sided with the APEDA, which had argued against allowing GI tag for basmati rice grown by MP farmers.More than three lakh farmers in Madhya Pradesh cultivate basmati on over four lakh hectares of land and were hoping for a favourable order, which would have earned them more in exports.We will move the Chennai high court. We will eventually succeed, Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister Gaurishankar Bisen told The Sunday Express, a day after Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal gave their ruling.Principal Secretary (Agriculture) Rajesh Rajora said the state and other applicants had submitted detailed documentary evidence, such as the gazetteers during the British rule, to shore up the states case. He said the appeal will be filed in the next few days.Though there are hundreds of varieties of long grain and scented rice grown all over the world, basmati is the best known due to its unique properties attributable to agro-climatic conditions prevailing in a geographical area.The assistant registrar had asked APEDA to include some districts in Madhya Pradesh that grow basmati before giving GI tag to the rice grown in parts of seven states, including Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The APEDA, which functions under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, had challenged the erroneous order on several grounds. While arguing against MPs inclusion, APEDA claimed to have legally challenged in 40 countries third party attempted registrations in the name of basmati or any deceptive variations.Saying MPs evidence was based on improper verification and illegible and unreadable documents, it was argued that the state does not fall in the Indo Gangetic Plain. In the 235 goods granted GI tag by the registry, only two have been challenged so far.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f4bd7260de4776e3694547,Tea garden hands drop return plan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160210/jsp/siliguri/story_68456.jsp,2016-02-10,"Feb. 9: Over 350 people who left the ailing Bagracote Tea Estate for other states in search of jobs have cancelled their plan to return home after the management backtracked from an assurance to pay workers their dues in phases from January 31. Bagracote in the Dooars is one of the 14 estates owned by the Duncans Industries Ltd and workers complained that there had been irregularities in distribution of rations and payment of wages in all the gardens since April last year. On January 22, the management told the state government that workers would be paid their dues in phases from January 31 and activities in the garden would be regularised from February 1. However, the Centre authorised the Tea Board on January 28 to take over seven of the 14 gardens. Following the decision, the management decided not to go ahead with the January 22 assurance in the remaining seven gardens, including Bagracote. ""So far, 372 men in Bagracote have migrated to states like Kerala, Haryana, Punjab and Tamil Nadu and are doing odd jobs at industrial establishments and construction sites to run their families. The migration had started in June and even last month, a number of workers left the garden in search of jobs,"" said Hemant Pradhan, a resident of Bagracote. According to him, these people were sending money to their families who were still staying in the garden. ""They could at least save their families from death because back in the garden, it is only rice which is available from the state government. Many of them would speak of the problems they are facing at the new workplace,"" said Pradhan. The dues in all the 14 Duncan gardens were said to be around Rs 70 crore. Several deaths have also been reported in some gardens although the suspected cause - malnutrition - has not been conclusively established. After the January 22 assurance by the management, over 350 men, most of whom were workers in Bagracote, decided to come back home from their current work sites. People like Francis Lakra who is in Chennai and Kishore Chhetri who is in Kerala, decided to buy train tickets. ""Those staying outside Bengal were happy to hear the promise. The family members told them that it was imperative that they were back in the garden and collected the dues. They had to spend extra money to get the train tickets. We had spoken to them and they were so happy to know that the impasse was finally over,"" Laurantus Kerketta, another resident of Bagracote, said. However, the ray of hope faded away within a week. ""As the central government issued a notification on January 28, mentioning the acquisition of seven tea estates of the Duncans Group, the management wrote to the state labour department on January 30, saying it was deferring its plan. The migrants were contacted by the family members and asked to cancel train tickets. They were also told to continue working at their respective places,"" said Pradhan. ""I have spoken to at least a couple of them. They are desperate to return home at the slightest opportunity but cannot afford to do so. Otherwise, their families would be struggling to live,"" he added."

The meet, which comes a week ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's peasants' rally in Bargarh on February 21, coincided with oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan reviewing the preparation for the PM's rally there.""The Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanwaya Samiti, an umbrella body of farmer organizations, discussed how political parties are competing with each other to exploit the agrarian crisis for political reasons without taking sincere steps to address the problems,"" said farmer leader Ashok Pradhan.The paddy belt of Bargarh remains the focus of farmer politics. Bargarh, termed the rice bowl of Odisha, contributes about one-fourth of the total 30 lakh metric tonnes of paddy procured annually in the state. After Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi undertook a padayatra on September 10 last year, chief minister Naveen Patnaik followed it up with a farmers' rally on November 19 two months later. Now, Modi is supposed to address the farmers there.Samiti spokesperson Saroj said the various political parties see Bargarh as a potential political battleground for farmer politics, but they don't really do anything to address their concerns ""A fraction of the amount spent could have solved the farmers' problems. The organizing cost of the two rallies held here (by Congress and BJD) and the upcoming BJP one must be above Rs 30 crore, while the total debt of over 30 farmers who committed suicide in Bargarh district in the last khariff season would not be more than Rs 3 crore,"" Saroj said.""The Samiti is of the view that the government should implement the Swaminathan committee report, which recommended a 50% profit margin for farmers in the minimum support price,"" he added.Speaking to reporters in Bargarh, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said that the PM's meeting is very significant because he will interact with farmers to get a better understanding of the ground situation in the region. ""Moreover, the rally will help agriculturists learn about the benefits of new initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) so that they draw maximum benefits out of it by enrolling them,"" said Pradhan.The Samiti, however, feels that the PMFBY, which the PM is scheduled to publicize during four rallies across the country, including the one in Bargarh, will not make any significant difference to farmers' lives. ""The proposed rate of premium for crop insurance under the PMFBY at 2% for kharif and 1.5% for rabi crops in already in practice in existing insurance schemes in states such as Odisha,"" he said.Buoyed by the large turnout at the PM's Paradip meeting on February 7, BJP has been aggressively mobilizing people for the party event in Bargarh. Tribal affairs minister Jual Oram is scheduled to address the party workers on February 19 followed by Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh on February 20, party sources said."

As many as 20 farmers have committed suicide in the last 18 months in this backward district where farming remains the prime occupation.Agriculture Department officials say that Suryakanth Sidramappa Nalagave (44), who committed suicide in Bhatambra village in Bhalki taluk recently, can be considered as the 21st victim of the agrarian crisis.The ill-fated farmer had taken Rs. 3 lakh as loans from various sources and had suffered crop loss for four agriculture seasons. Nalagave was upset when the rabi crop was destroyed, Mahadev Belure, his friend and fellow farmer, said. Suryakanth was found hanging from a tree in his field three days ago.Basavaraj Shanumukhappa, octogenarian farmer from the village, said he had never seen such a severe drought. We have suffered water scarcity and erratic rainfall every 10 years or so. We thought the worst was in 1972. But this year seems to be worse than that, he said.The name of our village Bhatambra means rice and curry in Marathi. Such a prosperous village should not witness such tragic events. I dont know why the rain gods are so angry with us, he said.The situation is grim, say officials. The number of farm suicides will cross 70 if we count the incidents since 2013, when the drought started, a senior Agriculture Department official said.The three-year spell of drought is one of the reasons. Second is the dependence on water intensive crops such as sugarcane.Third is the lack of efforts to recharge the aquifer by planting trees, watershed development or rainwater harvesting. Remnant moisture is also sucked up as farmers dont follow practices like staggered cropping or crop rotation, another officer said."

A shortfall of rice is on the cards, as a result of decrease in sowing, especially in the city.At present, a kg of Sona Masoori rice, is priced anywhere between Rs 45-60 in the open markets. Traders are of the opinion that the price could soar to Rs 80 or higher.""To cultivate paddy, water must be made available in copious amounts. But in the last one year, we have been facing a drought-like situation. Now, even the borewells have dried up, which is why many of us have stopped sowing paddy,"" said D Shyam, a farmer who has 30 acres of barren land in Bibinagar.However, the worst affected would be the urban consumers, according to J Jayaram, general manager, marketing, state civil supplies department, as the monthly consumption of rice in the entire city is around 1.8 lakh tonnes. But with the shortfall in paddy cultivation, farmers fear that the maximum yield that they can now achieve would barely be one-third of the monthly requirement.""If the acreage of cultivation comes down, apart from a dip in the quantity of rice, the rate for procuring the produce, milling and making it fit for consumption goes up. And, this additional price would have to be borne by the consumers,"" said Venkateshwarulu Manchu Konda, president, Rice Millers' Association, who supplies rice to several supermarket brands in the city.Not just the farmers, even agrarian experts like G V Ramanjenayulu highlight how the crop production has come down by half. ""Most of the farmers had pinned their hopes on irrigating their farms with the rainwater. But unfortunately, all their hopes were dashed,"" he said.Even, senior officials from the department said they are fast losing hope on early rains. ""It is only the farmers with access to a working borewell, who are taking up paddy cultivation,"" C Parthasarathi, secretary of the department."

I asked him why he didnt eat it, my friend Sudeshna Shome Ghosh wrote. His response was, How could I? I didnt know what it was. My friend rolled her eyes (you can now do that thanks to an updated emoticon app), I LOLd and that was the end of it.The conversation brought back dabba memories, of going to school and opening my stainless steel lunch box in the afternoon, hours after it was packed, wondering about its contents. With the mother being a fabulous cook, the dabba was usually crammed with theplas folded in half with a dibbi of mango pickle, jeera rice with caramelized onion and curd, or rotis that miraculously stayed soft so that they could be torn with two fingers and eaten with sabji . There was lunchbox envy, where I coveted my classmates tiffins because they brought food that wasnt familiar to me. I yearned for cucumber sandwiches, after re-reading Enid Blyton books, even though the white bread would be curling up at the edges by afternoon. I even wanted the dabba that held cold, clammy Maggi noodles, something that I now wouldnt touch with a barge pole. But at that time, it was as exciting as moringa leaves are now to chefs.Now there are plenty of cookery books, blogs and Instagram accounts with innovative lunch box ideas, all just a Google search away. Blogger and nutritionist Nandita Iyer, better known as Saffron Trail online, has simple, healthy ideas, which include vegetable peanut noodles, pita pocket pizza sandwiches, and puliyogare or tamarind rice. Lulu Loves Bombay blogs about travel, her children, and food. Her sweet potato discs sound like a lovely addition to the dabba , as do her methi thepla and mango chunda. Sanjeeta KKs blog, Lite Bite, has a Lunchbox Bites section with some handy tips and recipes such as for muthiyas and wholegrain chillas.On Instagram, Lunch Box Dad, Beau Coffrans mealtime hacks include rocket ships from bread and cheese, and Spider-Man lunches with berries; while bleary-eyed parents may not be keen to wake up and make food art, its a fun account to follow. Grace Halls Eats Amazing blog focuses on Bento-style lunches for her son and follows themes such as Halloween, rainbows, and gardens. Her #PackedLunchLove Project has creative boxes that, she promises, take just a few minutes to prepare and are a visual feast. A few years ago, graphic designer and illustrator David Laferrieres innovative sandwich bag art went viral. Hes made over 1,800 sandwich bag drawings with monsters and kites.And when in doubt, return to the library.Apart from the usual cluster of recipe books, check out Karen Le Billons French Kids Eat Everything , a charming account of a family, with two picky-eater children, that moves from the USA to France and discovers how the French government and the school system strengthen food education. Then theres Chris Butterworths Lunchbox: The Story of Your Food , illustrated by Lucia Gaggiotti. A picture book, it takes young readers on a journey from farm to fork, getting them to think: where did the food in my lunchbox come from? Its a lovely way of engaging children with farmers who grow our food and get them curious about what they are eating.Mommy Go Lightly, a.k.a. journalist and author Lalita Iyer, writes lovingly about dabbas on her blog, Food is intuitive, she writes about packing her son Res lunch box. At least thats how it should be. Try different things and figure out what works for your child. My tip is, make it visually exciting. Make it look good. All you need is colours. Pretty much all my mommy and daddy friends gave me tips like that when I talked to them about the art of dabba packing: fruits and dry fruits in small Tupperware boxes to snack on in the bus; use leftovers innovatively.Shinibali Mitra Saigal, who packs food for her nine-year-old daughter said, Mine doesnt like anything soggy, squidgy or leaky. My daughter claims that thanks to me, she had to eat pickled strawberries, which taste vile. When I asked her what she meant, she added, According to her, the pickle in an airtight container leaked and ran into the strawberry in a different compartment. So that makes it pickled strawberry and an excuse not to finish her lunch box.Ghosh wakes up ten minutes earlier in the morning to make extra sandwiches for her sons friends. According to my son, none of them want to share the fruits I pack, she said, with a sigh. But hes telling me that, and well, he hates fruits. SoLooking back, we can appreciate that one person who woke up at the crack of dawn to toil away in the kitchen to prepare fresh lunchboxes for the family. I regret the dabbas that I brought back home uneaten, even the alu methi, which really doesnt do itself any favours when cold. Okay, maybe not the alu methi.The author writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru."
591f8a297be9e025a5d4f6e7,How is Telangana doing?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/531640/how-telangana-doing.html,2016-02-28,"Ajay Gudavarthy, February 29, 2016, Bengaluru, DHNS 0:37 ISTABOUT 2 YEARS AFTER BIRTH : The most visible change has been in the situation regard-ing power supply but water remains a major problem in much of thIn a few months time, Telangana will be two years old. The state was formed after a prolonged agitation and popular protest, largely as a fall out of deep agrarian crisis, growing unemployment and cultural denigration. Though the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) won a whopping 99 seats in the recent Municipal elections, we need to ask as to how Telangana is doing now.The most visible change has been in the situation regarding power supply. Power supply that was not only irregular but also contributed to agrarian crisis has improved dramatically. Today, all villages get uninterrupted power supply to the households and for six hours for the agricultural purposes, which the new government has promised to increase to nine in the next few months.The government, immediately after assuming power, announced loan waiver up to Rs 1 lakh per family. However, this was waived in installments of 25% every six months.According to the farmers, this has not really helped them to get rid of the loans and instead, they continue to reel under debts as most of the waiver is being used to pay the interests and the principle amount is being repaid only partially in small amounts. Further, they pointed out that there is no policy for providing support price or subsidies on in-puts such as fertilisers and no compensation being provided for crop failure.Water continues to be a major problem in much of Telangana. Most of the projects are either contested in water tribunal or many of the pending ones have not been cleared or completed. The government has instead taken up the project called Mission Kakatiya under which old lakes, ponds and other water bodies that had dried up are re-dug, hoping that a good monsoon will fill them up.In a few districts, free borewells are being supplied but the ground water level is too low (in most cases bores go as deep as 800 metre to strike water). Similarly, under Mission Bhagiratha, the TRS government has promised to tap water for every household.Labour and wages remain the other major problems in the agrarian sector. While wages have not risen for the landless after the formation of Telangana, farmers holding land continue to complain about the lack of the availability of labour making agriculture untenable.Many of the farmers now demand that the labour under the rural job scheme (MNREGA) needs to be shifted for agricultural purposes instead of other developmental activities, which they believe in any case, are not of much use.The policy of Re 1 a kg rice scheme with 6 kg of rice per person is a very effective scheme providing great relief to the BPL families. Along with the rice scheme, the governments pension scheme is also popular in the rural hinterlands of Telangana. The new government has increased the pension amount from Rs 200 to Rs 1,000. In the last one year, after the formation of Telangana, close to 900 farmers have committed suicides, next only to Maharashtra where 2,568 farmers committed suicide.Agrarian crisisThe agrarian crisis was the single most important reason why the demand for Telangana erupted. Questions need to be raised if it continues to be of priority for the new government. While it has disbursed a range of welfare oriented policies (much of which are a continuation of the policies formulated by the previous Y S Rajasekhara Reddys government) the agrarian crisis is yet to be averted and it needs some pressing and fast paced steps from the government to stop further suicides.Similarly, alongside the farmers are the Muslims, the other social group that remains marginalised in Telangana. Under the YSR government, Muslims were awarded 4% reservation as part of the OBC reservations. The TRS government has promised to enhance it to 12%.The Subramanium Committee, instituted in 2007, had identified 28 groups out of which 14 groups were made ineligible for reservation due to their superior social status, including sects such as Sheiks, Sayeeds, Pathans etc.These, in a sense, are perhaps the few communities that can afford higher education but having been denied the provision of reservation, we find almost 80% drop outs among Muslims. There is an impending need to provide educational loans and build social welfare hostels, which contributed in a big way towards improving literacy among the SC/STs.The most popular policy that has struck a chord among the Muslims is Shaadi Mubarak where the government offers Rs 50,000 to perform the marriage of girls from the economically weaker sections (the Hindu counterpart Kalyana Laxmi, with similar grant).Most of the Muslims continue to be self-employed and without land holding in the rural hinterlands of Telangana. They continue to live under conditions of social segregation, fear and many a time implicated in false cases of crime. Culturally, Telangana had a strong Sufi tradition and even today, besides Muslims, a large number of Hindus visit dargas. Perhaps, political parties such as the MIM are not the best representatives of this tradition. It is a literal everyday tussle between the social and political worlds.It is in this context that one can read the recent Chandi Yaga that Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao performed at a whopping cost of Rs 7 crore. In order to balance his pro-Muslim policies, he has also appointed a Muslim as the deputy CM. It is also a move to capture the space that the BJP-RSS combine has been laboriously building with manufactured issues of Charminar being built over the destruction of a temple and recalling the memory of Nizams rule and role of Razakars in wantonly using physical force against the Hindus.(The writer is with the Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

591f8c547be9e025a5d4f882,Policy interventions hold key,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532520/policy-interventions-hold-key.html,2016-03-03,"Policy interventions hold keyBy Prasenjit Chowdhury, Mar 04, 2016, DHNS: 0:03 ISTIf the farmers get the benefit of Minimum Support Price (MSP) as envisaged, it might prevent many farmers' suicides.On the face of it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi put his mind where his mouth is. The higher allocation for the rural sector and farming suggests that he considers rural recovery as key to overall GDP growth. Some time ago, he spoke of the need to make agriculture employment-oriented and how it, along with manufacturing and service sectors, forms backbone of the countrys economy.The Union Budget 2016-17 introduced a 0.05% Krishi Vikas Cess on all services to fund its ambitious programme of rural welfare besides keeping aside outlays for setting up Self-Help Groups (SHGs) for rural development and for the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) to boost pulses production.Not to miss the thrust on rural road connectivity in the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and the marquee crop insurance scheme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), launched in 2015-16 with a generous allocation (Rs 19,000 crore and Rs 5,500 crore respectively). If the farmers get the benefit of Minimum Support Price (MSP) as envisaged, it might prevent many farmers suicides.Talking about farmers suicides, the enormity of which long demanded public policy interventions, it is important to recount that more than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide in the last 16 years  the largest wave of recorded suicides in human history. A great number of those affected are cash crop farmers, and cotton farmers in particular.In 2009 alone, 17,638 farmers committed suicide  thats one farmer every 30 minutes. Going by the official data, on average nearly 16,000 farmers committed suicide every year over the last decade or so. Every seventh suicide in the country had been a farm suicide.According to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), as many as 5,650 farmers committed suicide in India in 2014, among which five states  Maharashtra, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka  accounted for about 90% of the total farmer suicides. As per NCRB data, bankruptcy or indebtedness was the main cause, accounting for 20.6%, closely followed by family issues (20.1%), failure of crops (16.8%), illness (13.2%), while drug abuses/alcoholic addiction accounted for 4.9% cases. These five causes together accounted for 75.6% of total farmer suicides.In Maharashtra, that tops the list of states in the country in terms of the number of farmers suicide, it has been seen that frequent droughts, crop failure, non-realisation of prices for agricultural products are some of the reasons pushing farmers to take the extreme step.But what is the bigger picture? Farm-policy analysts point out how desperation arising out of a fundamental unsustainability is pushing people out of the countryside far faster than industry can create jobs for them in cities and towns. It is exacerbated by the decree that the government can force farmers to sell their land for infrastructure projects without seeking their consent.Address agrarian distressProminent environmental activists like Vandana Shiva are of the opinion that genetically-modified seeds  specifically, suicide seeds sold by the agricultural behemoth Monsanto  are driving farmers to lose control of their age-old farming practices as its proprietary policies forbid farmers from planting, selling, or even accidentally growing seeds from its patented crops thus pushing them to an edge.The perceived consensus has been in favour of the need to design interventions that can address distress among various demographic groups, and not aggravate the problem by focusing on indebtedness alone. And such interventions not merely mean offering special packages but a pre-emptive long-term policy. For instance, poor health has been found to lead to more than seven times as many suicides as compared to debt or bankruptcy.So health reform, particularly in rural areas, is a worthier interventionist goal to achieve.Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, posing himself as an agrarian activist, had been too nebulous to point out to the shortcomings of crop insurance and the imperfect rollout of bank accounts needed to receive compensation payments. He chose rather to make a fetish of his pro-farmer identity, regardless of the growing uncertainties of farming as a vocation in India.It has been pointed ad nauseam that while nearly half of Indias population works in agriculture, they produce only 14 to 18% of GDP, compared to, say, the United States, where farmers constitute around 1 to 2% of the workforce and represent an approximately equal share of GDP. The 65% of farm households owning less than one hectare of land are usually seen to spiral into debt, only to be buoyed by periodic waivers of farm loans.Addressing economic causes leading to erosion in farm income, exposed to both production and market risks, is liable to procedural error when institutions such as Agricultural Insurance Company undertake crop damage estimates at block or sub-block levels and not at the individual farm level. Any solid mechanism for market risk evaluation is not in place. The low penetration of crop insurance (not more than 25% of farmers) and the difficulty of claiming farmer insurance and settlement might not make it a panacea.Going by the nature of objections over the 2015 land bill brought in by the NDA government, the tendency to bypass the consent and social-assessment requirements of the 2013 law on the grounds that they are onerous and time-consuming is visible. On the flip side, the rich farmer with his access to free/ subsidised water and electricity, to free fertiliser and benefits from minimum support price that the government offers on the purchase of rice and wheat must be brought under the tax net.The Economic Survey points out that the implicit subsidy on electricity is Rs 37,170 crore. The farmers committing suicide are martyrs to the final, lumbering churn of India in its transition from agrarianism to industrialism. We must keep a close watch if policy interventions can really buck this trend."

State government records show the highest price rise across the state was recorded in Visakhapatnam in superfine and fine rice categories in recent times.According to the essential commodity report (ECR) from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, AP government, superfine category rice was sold in the city at Rs 52 per kilo, the highest price in the state, as on the second week of March. The price was Rs 8.12 higher than the state average price, which stood at Rs 43.88 per kilo in the second week of March. The lowest price of the superfine variety was reported at Tekkali in Srikakulam district where the price was Rs 38 per kilo.Similarly, fine category of rice was sold at Rs 42 per kilo in the city which is Rs 4.8 higher than the state average price of Rs 37.2 per kilo. The lowest price of the fine variety was reported from Gudur in Nellore district where the price was Rs 31 per kilo.G Madhusudhana Naidu, proprietor of Maruthi Minerals Pvt Ltd in Vijayawada, said that the maximum price of superfine rice was reported between Rs 48 and Rs 50 per kilo in Vijayawada during the period.Rice traders attributed the exorbitant rise in prices to several reasons such as unavailability of superfine and fine category of rice that is preferred by Vizagites in the district. Almost all rice traders in the city procure the food grain including the preferred variety Lalitha from other parts of the state like Peddapuram, Mandapeta, Nellore and Guntur.Along with this rise in transportation and labour cost and increasing population in the city also affect prices. Besides, the 'Smart City' tag has led to the increase in rents and other essential items impacting food prices. Labourers charge Rs 200 to Rs 250 per quintal of rice shifted from the trucks to the godowns at the wholesale markets.""Rice preferred by Vizagites are procured from other parts of the state as it is not produced in the district or even neighbouring Srikakulam. However, even though the lowest price of superfine rice was reported from Tekkali, there is a lot of difference in the quality sold in Vizag and Tekkali,"" said S Sudhakar, secretary of Food Grains Dealers' Association for Visakhapatnam city.K Nirmala, civil supplies officer for Vizag city, said that prices are high in the city as consumers are willing to buy the rice at a higher price. ""80% of the rice consumers procure the essential commodity from the public distribution system at Re 1 per kg. The department is also ensuring that more variety of stock at different prices are available in the market to cover all categories of consumers,"" Nirmala told TOI.K Srinivasa Rao, an Andhra University employee, who was spotted at the Rythu Bazaar at Pedawaltair, said the steep rise in prices was impacting the common man as meals were becoming expensive at home and at restaurants.""The state government should focus on such issues on a priority basis. Unfortunately, the state government is not taking any sincere measures to regulate the price of the essential commodities in the state. Instead it is focusing on the capital development at Amaravati,"" Rao opined.An agriculture official said on anonymity that the price can be stabilised if the government took efforts in procuring superfine and fine rice from other states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra where production is high and consumption is low."

(Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) An opium farmer whose crop has been ploughed back into his field using rotavator. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)The current crisis in agriculture seems to have spared none  not even those engaged in legal cultivation of opium poppy.Extreme moisture stress from a failed monsoon and lack of winter rains have led to an unprecedented 95 per cent of the 19,651 licenced opium growers in Madhya Pradeshs (MP) three northeast districts of Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam to seek destruction of their crop this year. The reason: expected yields falling below the minimum 58 kg per hectare level stipulated by the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) under the Union finance ministry.The CBN, under whose regulation and monitoring the licenced cultivators operate, requires growers to request for destruction of their standing crop if they anticipate yields to be lower than the minimum qualifying level. Not tendering such request and harvesting less than the minimum qualifying yield (MQY) of opium latex would make them liable to lose their cultivation licence.Share This Article Related Article Afghan opium cultivation jumps 10 per cent in 2016: United NationsAfghan opium cultivation jumps 10 per cent in 2016: United Nations Tech lag: Indias opium finds few takersTech lag: Indias opium finds few takers Conditions eased for farmers seeking opium licenceConditions eased for farmers seeking opium licence Rising drug trade threatens Myanmar's aspirationsRising drug trade threatens Myanmar's aspirations Myanmar declares war on opiumPoppy in a rice bowlEvery year, there are some growers who approach the CBN with crop destruction requests. But the extended dry spell this time has resulted in only about 1,000 of the 19,651 licenced cultivators agreeing to harvest the crop, which is sown during late-October/November and is ready for lancing in February. Under the rules, such requests are to be made before lancing or scratching of the poppy seed pods (fruits) from which the opium latex leaks out. The latex that coagulates on the pods and dries to a sticky yellow residue is what gets tediously collected by the cultivators; they are supposed to account for every gram that is thus obtained. While growers are still coming to terms with the poor yields on account of natural causes, their main grouse  for which they have taken to the streets  is the Centres decision to plough back the entire crop that is not harvested.Previously, the crop affected by natural calamities or disease could be uprooted under official supervision, with the cultivators allowed to take out the poppy seeds (khas khas) from the pod after latex extraction and sell these in the open market. Although the pod husk (doda chura) remaining after extraction of the opium latex and poppy seeds is classified as a narcotic under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act  in view of containing some morphine that can give a high when used in sufficient quantities  it could also be sold to contractors with licenses from the state government.These bulbs are yet to be harvested. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) These bulbs are yet to be harvested. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)The current changed opium cultivation policy mandates the entire sub-MQY crop to be ploughed back to the soil, which growers complain deprives them of revenues that can at least recover their cost of seeds, fertilisers and chemicals. I realised my crop had failed, so I informed the authorities. But what about the costs I have incurred and the time spent in cultivation? asks Rajmal Kabra, a resident of Bahi Parasnath village, about 16 km from Mandsaur. The 55-year-old, who cultivates poppy on a plot of 10 are (0.1 hectare) claims he has never in my life witnessed so much damage to an otherwise most hardy crop.The CBN has defended the new total-ploughing-back policy on grounds of preventing smuggling and black-marketing of opium. Growers dont want to risk their licenses. But they also want to make money from selling seeds and diverting poppy husk illegally, says a CBN official. He adds that the policy was actually issued first in 2009, but its implementation was deferred twice.This time, the CBN has even used rotavators to destroy the un-harvested sub-MQY crop, although the Neemuch-based Assistant Commissioner of Narcotics Mahesh Kumar denies it was done on any significant scale. We dont have any rotavators. It is only a few farmers who have these, and which may have got used, he clarified. Either way, that operation has been kept on hold, following farmer protests.Ek ne bhi chira nahi lagaya (not a single one in my group has lanced his poppy), informs Chandraprakash Patidar, a grower in Bahi Parasnath, who also has 67 cultivators under his jurisdiction. As the mukhiya of the group, he has to maintain a register tracking the daily opium extraction by each of them.Satyanarayan Patidar is among the few who has gone ahead with lancing his pods. He grows opium on a 20 are (0.2 hectares) patta that has yielded just 9 kg. At 45 kg per hectare, this is below the MQY of 58 kg. I am scared to lose the licence next year, observes Patidar, whose patta is in his grandfather Shrirams name. This patta yielded 15 kg or an average of 75 kg/hectare in 2014-15.Producers are paid a minimum price of Rs 870 per kg for opium yields up to 44 kg/hectare. The price rises to Rs 1,000 for yields between 44 and 52 kg per hectare and going as high as Rs 3,500/kg for 90 kg and above. Last year, Patidars family earned Rs 24,000 from their 15 kg opium at Rs 1,600 per kg. But they made even more from sale of 215 kg of khas khas (Rs 96,750 at Rs 450/kg) and 205 kg of doda chura (Rs 25,625 at Rs 125/kg).We are awaiting further orders and clear guidelines from the finance ministry, Mahesh Kumar told The Indian Express when asked about the authorities response to the demand for allowing farmers to recover poppy seeds and also not to cancel licences due to lower yields from unfavourable weather this year. For the moment, the CBN has permitted farmers to pluck and crush the opium pods for obtaining the khas khas, before ploughing back the poppy husk along with the plants into the soil. We dont object to the seeds, as they are not narcotic, explains an official, while confirming the relaxation.MP accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the countrys 44,438 licenced opium cultivators, who are also from Rajasthan (Kota, Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Pratapgarh and Jhalawar) and Uttar Pradesh (mainly Barabanki, Faizabad, Mau and Ghazipur). In 2013-14, 318 tonnes of opium was produced from 5,893 hectares where legal cultivation took place.Opium collected from farmers is sent to government-owned factories at Neemuch and Ghazipur for final analysis, drying and processing. The factories convert a part of opium (150-200 tonnes) into alkaloids (morphine, codeine and thebaine) for supply to medicine manufacturers. The balance is exported as raw opium to the US, Japan, Hungary, UK, France and Thailand for medicinal purposes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The rice mills in Ghoti now want the state agricultural and other departments' concerned to provide the special status to the commodity.This variety of rice, processed at Ghoti in Igatpuri tehsil of the district, is in high demand acorss the country and is used to make 'khichdi' and 'bhaat' (cooked or boiled rice) consumed as part of daily meal. Around 3.5 lakh quintals of rice worth Rs 125 crore are produced in Ghoti annually, including 2.5 lakh quintals of Indrayani and remaining 1 lakh quintals of Lachkari variety.GI is a name or sign used on products corresponding to a specific geographical location. The use of a GI tag may act as certification that the product is made traditionally or has a reputation owing to its geographical origin. Navsukhbhai Picha, president, Ghoti Rice & Bhagar mills association, said, ""Around 60 rice mills located in the hilly Ghoti areas process two varieties Indrayani and Lachkari. Of the total 3.5 lakh quintals of rice processed, 2.5 lakh quintals are Indrayani. This variety has a unique smell and taste too and is small in size as compared to other varieties.""In Ghoti, the yield of paddy is around 40 quintals per acre. From 100kg paddy, 48kg of whole rice and 15kg broken rice is processed. The total area under cultivation of paddy in the district is close to 75,000 hectares, including 35,000 hectares in Igatpuri."

Ramachandran, managing trustee, Foundation for Agrarian Studies, and Hannan Mollah, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha.Photo: M. VedhanFarmer incomes were in focus on Saturday when National Commission on Farmers chairman M.S. Swaminathan reviewed the implementation of the recommendations that were submitted nearly 10 years ago.Prof. Swaminathan said technology could only increase yield; it takes public policy to take care of the economics of agriculture.If you want to make farming viable and retain young people, your first goal is to improve the economic viability of farming and substantially increase the net income for farmers, he said, recalling a central concern of the NCF as it went about its work during 2004-2006.His talk, delivered at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, was at an event that saw the launch of the website of the Foundation for Agrarian Studies, a Bangalore-based charitable trust.N. Ram, publisher of The Hindu , chaired the panel, which included Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha.Mr. Ram prefaced the session by saying, The NCF recommendations are perhaps the most important intervention in the thinking about Indian agriculture in several decades.In the light of Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys Budget promise to double farmers income in five years, the NCF proposal on fixing minimum support price (MSP) of a crop at the cost of production of that crop plus 50 percent came to be discussed the most.It can be done, but requires a lot of work and action, said Prof. Swaminathan on the possibility of doubling farmer incomes. On his Commissions MSP recommendation, he said, If this single step is accepted, it will make a lot of difference.Mr. Mollah was, however, sceptical of the success of the income objective. Prof. [Swaminathan] mentioned that income will be doubled. How we can we believe it? We have calculated it  for doubling farmer incomes in five years, 14 percent growth is required. With the (current) one-and-a-half percent growth, how will we do it, he asked at a presentation during which he said that it was pre-election propaganda that led to the last Budget adopting a pro-farmer tone.He also talked of how the MSP recommendations of the NCF had led to a nationwide demand by farmers for implementation of the report.He pointed out that there remained a yawning gap between what the NCF set out to achieve and the current status of agriculture in the country. [It] recommended (loans at) four per cent, but actual farmers are taking loans for between 30 and 120 per cent, he saidProf. Swaminathan said, The latest Budget takes some of our recommendations forward. For example, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare: we recommended that the name of the ministry should be changed; the Prime Minister announced this in his August 15 speech. The reason is, we should not focus on productivity alone, but the well-being of the farmer, he said.Prof. Swaminathan dwelt in detail on the pressures of land and income on agriculture. Punjab farmers, at the heartland of the Green Revolution, with an average farm size of 3.79 hectares, growing wheat and rice get an income which is less than the starting salary of a Class Four employee. That is the crisis in Indian agriculture, he added."

The showily decorated ballroom of a city 5-Star is awash with the sound of people talking and munching their way through food of the continents. I am at yet another of those endless weddings which take place during the hitching season between November and March and balk at the sight of the gastronomic feast which assails the senses. As I ponder on finding the nearest exit to make a quick getaway, a friend trips by laden with diamonds and food. Suneeeta, have you tried the Jaapaanese stall? The tappanyaaki (read teppanyaki) is to die for, she trills, before teetering off on her Manolo Blahnik shoes.I am not in my element in big weddings. The glitterati and the chatterati disorient me and I get tired after a while of the air kissing and fake bonhomie. Worst of all, the sight and smell of myriad cuisines, to showcase the wealth and ingenuity of the hosts, creates a confusing babel of tastes which neither appeases nor gratifies the palate. Japanese Lebanese Thai French Turkish Greek: the hostess wants you to taste it all even as she trips over her shawarma, er, sharara.My mind wanders back to a few days ago when I attended another wedding in a tiny hamlet in the southern part of Maharashtra. Here the atmosphere, while as chaotic as any city wedding, is more welcoming and traditional. The village is small but the festivities are big considering my host is the sarpanch of the village. Everyone in the village is invited and everyone is lending a hand to make sure it is perfect. Out of town guests are housed in neighbors homes (there are no hotels here). All the women of the village have spent the last few days preparing all the savories and desserts needed for the spread. No event managers, no liveried staff, no Yo-Yo or Happy-Shappy to provide the entertainment.And the food? Simple and utterly delicious, bringing to mind those happy days in childhood spent at my maternal grandmothers place where every tidbit at the dining table was freshly cooked. Here too, from the pickles to the papads to the vegetables (straight from the fields), all the edibles are sourced from the village itself. In a large room fragrant with the smell of rose water and jasmine gajras, the guests are seated in pangats or parallel rows in front of chowrangs.  These are short wooden tables decorated with traditional rangoli on which is placed a banana leaf. There is the traditional food offered at weddings such as ussal (sprouts cooked with minimum amount of spices, masale bhaat (spice-flavored rice), aamras (mango pulp), tak (buttermilk) along with vegetables ranging from potatoes to yam. At the end of the meal, there are paanch pakwaan which are mandatory in a wedding feast. The host has decided to go with motichur laddoos, puran polis, karanjee, kheer and basundi (all indigenous Maharashtrian desserts).With a sigh, I come back to the hullabaloo in the ballroom and will myself to try the opulent food on display. From lobsters flown in from Maine, cheese from Switzerland, truffles from France: the hosts have put on a gastronomic blitzkrieg. To add to the adventure, there is even an iceboat filled with shrimp and crab legs and a table with a five-tier Marie Antoinette cake.Just as I have decided to go and try the Japanese counter where the Michelin-quality chef is meticulously putting together Donburi bowls (a bowl of cooked rice served with different meats and a sweet/savory soy-based sauce), I see my friend approaching. This time she is accompanied by two other friends and all of them are advancing purposefully. Oh no, not her, whispers the chef furtively. I raise an eyebrow. She wants me to season her Japanese dish with a bit of tadka. She says my food is too bland! I flee from the station before I am eating Japanese food tadka-maar ke!"

In Uttar Pradesh, Ballia is most prone to arsenic contamination followed by Bahraich, Rae Bareli, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Meerut, Chandoli and many more.The technology is ready for field trials. Senior NBRI scientist Debasis Chakrabarty, who conducted the research recently, visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippine and discussed the possibilities of field trials. The institute in principal agreed to help in this regard.""The institute invited us to become familiar with ongoing research work at NBRI and has agreed in principle to conduct field trials subjected to clearance by governments of both countries,"" said Chakrabarty, head of the eight-member team, which carried out research published recently in an international journal 'Metallomics' published by 'Royal Society of Chemistry'.The scientists said the transgenic rice has 'arsenic methyl transferase', a gene isolated from a fungus that accumulates less arsenic and would be less toxic.He explained that arsenic present in groundwater percolates in soil during irrigation and contaminates rice with arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure through groundwater contamination affects more than 150 million people worldwide and over 500 million people in Ganga, Meghna and Brahmputra areas.Rice is the crop most susceptible to absorbing arsenic during cultivation. Cultivating rice varieties that accumulate less amount of arsenic can tackle the challenge of exposure to carcinogens (cancer causing elements) that affect population in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha."
58f50a077be9e018510a210e,There is a new flame in the forest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/opinion/story_77293.jsp,2016-03-31,"The term, Jangalmahal, is a misnomer. On my way to Gopiballavpur from Jhargram, I spotted several bald patches in the sal forests on either side of the silken highway that snaked its way through the green canopy that is no longer dense. Bands of sunlight flooded the forest floor where trees had been felled. I was in West Midnapore to get a feel of the imminent elections. Voting would take place in six constituencies in Jangalmahal, including Gopiballavpur, Salboni and Nayagram, on April 4, the day assembly elections begin in West Bengal. Elections energize metropolitan journalists. They suddenly muster the energy to travel to remote areas in a bid to bring to public attention the gaps that exist between the State's claims of development and the bleak ground reality. Their reports, which examine the chasm between promise and delivery of Constitutional entitlements - food, shelter, education, employment - are a democracy's tool-kit to assess the performance of an elected dispensation. But I was travelling in Jangalmahal's pockets - Lodhasuli, Gopiballavpur, Nayagram, Salboni and Jamboni - with a different agenda. I wanted to understand the differences in the way development is perceived by the State and by Jangalmahal's adivasi citizens. My first stop was the Subarnarekha College in Gopiballavpur. The college, which takes its name from the river that lay dry and lifeless nearby, is spacious. But the infrastructure, especially some of the rooms meant for teachers, are small and shabby. Two teachers led me to a lecture room so that I could interact with the students. Many of them, I was told, live in distant villages and had to travel some distance to reach the college. The conversation, expectedly, started with an appraisal of the Trinamul Congress's performance in the constituency. (Chudamani Mahato of the TMC is the sitting MLA.) The students appeared to be satisfied with the condition of the roads, even though buses are not available in some parts after dusk, making commuting difficult, especially for the infirm and for patients. The girl students admitted that some of them had faced harassment - bureaucratic delays as well as insensitive remarks by officials - during their visits to panchayat offices to claim funds under the Kanyashree scheme. A super-speciality hospital has come up in Gopiballavpur (picture, below). But skilled doctors rarely take up postings here. (I visited the hospital the same evening, but could not find either the superintendent or a senior physician to corroborate the allegation.) Other places in West Midnapore have also witnessed frenetic construction activities after the near-annihilation of the Maoist movement. Metalled roads are no longer a dream. Lalgarh, over 60 kilometres away from Gopiballavpur, now has a polytechnic institute as well as a training centre for nurses. Nayagram and Salboni have received new colleges and stadiums and have also been promised modern healthcare. Yet, it was evident that the first glimpses of the State's version of the development process have not weakened the resolve of some segments of adivasi society to express their anxieties concerning the survival of their identity and of indigenous culture. Santhali had been included in the Eighth Schedule years ago (2003). The students voiced their anger with the government's neglect of local dialects and scripts. (The manifesto of the TMC is available in Alchiki though.) The State's attempts to revive vanishing performance arts traditions were also dismissed as elitist and cosmetic. A student who had participated in the Jangalmahal Utsav admitted that she had found the experience of performing on a concrete stage quite alienating. There were also complaints of interventions on the part of the organizers that had led to scripts and performances losing their authenticity during the extravaganza. Their experience of cultural alienation reopens an older debate concerning the reorganization of states. Purulia, which was carved out of adivasi-dominated Manbhum, was made a part of West Bengal. The students were critical of not just the apathy that is causing the slow death of languages but also the government's neglect of heritage structures. Interestingly, not all of these mansions are built by rulers from the adivasi community. In Jhargram, where I was based, I had been struck by the effort - a joint initiative between the state government and the resident royal family- to restore the rajbari. But Chilkigarh palace and the ancient temples on its premises - they can be reached after a brief trek through a forest that was alive with the calls of playful langurs - lie in a state of ruin (picture, below). My conversations with the respondents - students, villagers and activists - made it apparent that a fine line still separates the people from the State. For instance, the former held back from welfare projects that do not complement adivasi sensibilities. Some among them have also begun to differentiate between fundamental rights and political allowances. The cynicism of the students towards subsidized food grain, as opposed to their popularity in Amlasole, is a case in point. Equally telling was the propensity to perceive the manifestations of State welfare - especially the cultural festivals - as dubious initiatives to pollute and co-opt the remaining segments of a shrinking society that has resisted adulteration by modernity. The anxiety is emblematic of the state of siege - real and imagined - that pervades the community's consciousness. The willingness of Jangalmahal's tribal people to insulate - fortify is a better term - themselves from some kinds of State intervention probably stems from a heightened awareness of the pitfalls of identity politics. Adivasi identity was the plinth that supported the Lalgarh movement that had initially been led by the Peoples' Committee Against Police Atrocities. But its appropriation by the Maoists, and, later, its disintegration under political and military pressure has made the community wary of institutional efforts to revive indigenous culture. These tensions are inevitable, given the State's refusal to view development as a layered, but organically linked, idea that brings with it not just motorable roads, schools and hospitals but also helps nurture the fraying links between a community and its culture. From Gopiballavpur, I headed for Nayagram, near the border with Odisha. The landscape changed dramatically. The pucca road turned into a dirt track; agricultural fields gave way to shrub land; only the thinning forest remained unchanged. (The forest officials I met later attributed their inability to check felling to the lack of manpower and funds as well as the nexus between the political establishment and the timber mafia.) In Bihankuria village, I had expected the adivasi families to talk about such measures as the provision of 35 kilogrammes of rice at two rupees or the decision to raise the price of kendu leaves. Instead, the animated discussion turned towards the falling water table, the disappearance of local trees such as piyal, the proliferation of the eucalyptus, and sand mining that has ravaged the Subarnarekha. The ecological crisis in Jangalmahal has gone unrepresented in the political manifestos of all contending parties. Before I left the village, I was given mahua fruits that were being dried. I asked my host if this was a ritual associated with departure. He laughed and said that this was not a gift, but a relic. If I were to visit him again, he was not sure if I would find the mahua trees. I was expected to visit Jamboni and Binpur the following day. As I made my way back from Nayagram, I wondered whether the day's conversations were indicative of an emerging charter of development, one which was far more holistic than the model that has been imposed upon the people by the State. Health and education are priorities. So is employment. Data from the government suggest that over 30,000 people from Jangalmahal have found employment not in industry or agriculture but within the various tiers of the robust security apparatus that is still in place. (I was asked to produce my identity papers twice by the Central Reserve Police Force during my sojourn.) The devastation that has been wrought in Jangalmahal's environment and culture certainly registers in the people's engagement with the idea of development. Whether this consciousness is new remains unclear to me. It could be that the adivasi notion of progress is inherently inclusive. It could also be that education and improved connectivity with the city have brought about a sharpening of perception regarding their own needs. Or that the issues raised by the 'bon party' - the term used to describe Maoists - such as the community's rights over natural resources, linger in public memory. But I did get the impression that Jangalmahal has decided to renew its faith in the democratic apparatus, its limitations notwithstanding, in a bid to negotiate its demands with the State. The armed insurrection, and its crippling consequences, continue to haunt the people. The bon party's ideology and tactic stand discredited. The forest seemed to agree with my thoughts. On a road bathed in the falling light, I noticed the fire lines that had been lit by the forest department shimmering among the trees. Yet this was not the fire that had threatened to burn down the forest. This was a new kind of fire, a flickering flame, that had set the forest alight."

Earlier, the GI tag was awarded to Kolhapuri chappals, Kolhapuri jaggery, Mahabaleshwar's strawberries, Nashik's grapes, Jalgaon's brinjals and Nagpur's oranges .A geographical indication (GI) is a name or a sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin like a town, a region, or a country. A community's intellectual property is attached to that particular product.""It took 2-3 years to get GIs for these products. The tag for these products means that their uniqueness has been verified by an expert committee of the Government of India,"" Ganesh Hingmire, chairman of Pune-based Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), which has been instrumental in securing these certificates.Scoring a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price like the northeast India's Darjeeling tea. The GI creates a distinct identity of the product, assures the buyers of quality, brings reputation to the product and creates an international market for the products.Vengurla's cashew got a GI for its scientifically proven nutritional value and because its vitamin C content is five times more than that of an orange.Ajara's ghansal rice has been proven to be better than Basmati. The elongation ratio of ghansal rice is many times more than Basmati. Sindhudurg-Ratnagiri's kokum is naturally rich in hydroxycitric acid helpful in weight-loss tablets. Lasalgaon's onion has the highest sulphur percentage.India is a heavy consumer of beans (rajma) and 90% of it is imported. The rest mostly comes from Waghya's ghevda. Mangalveda's jowar and Navapur's tur are nature's gifts and tribal products, respectively. Navpur's tur is famous for its fragrance and pleasant taste.Since most of these are agricultural products are from villages, an immediate export market is created and it helps create an international demand for them, experts said.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level.The ultimate beneficiaries of this process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits, Hingmire said.Another seven products were accepted for GI certification and their names were published in the official journal no. 78, 79 and 80 by the Union government.""Certificates to these will be issued in a month's time,"" said Hingmire. These products are Sangli's raisins, Waigaon's turmeric, Jalna's sweet orange, Beed's custard apple, Solapur's pomegranate, Purandar-Saswad's fig and Jalgaon's bharit brinjal."

Divisional commissioner Ravindra Pastore said all the collectors of the adjoining districts had asked the farmers to grow more vegetables. The farmers were even provided with seeds to this effect months ahead of the festival. He assured that the vegetable supplies would be arranged from the adjoining districts at the administration and the wholesalers end. Superintendent of police MS Verma said special care would be taken to ensure safe movement of vehicles carrying food stuff and milk to the city in the nights.However, peoples fear is not baseless as over five crore people are expected to visit the city with five lakh population during the festival time. This is going to put pressure on food availability, sources said.Pushkaran Dubey, an old city resident who usually buys one kg of potato and onion, bought 50 kgs of each on Friday as he fears short supply during the Simhastha.Even if other leafy vegetables are not available, I could at least have aalu ki sabzi for my family and guests who are expected to come for the fair, he told HT.Not only Dubey, many citizens could be seen buying veggies with long shelf value from the market.One Usha Chhajlani, a resident of Mahashewta Nagar, said that she had stocked a sack each of tuwar dal, rice and besan along with 15 kg tins of edible oil and other groceries. She said procuring the usual food stuff could be a problem during the Simhastha in the face of high demand. My house is going to be flooded with relatives from different cities so preparations to serve them have to be made early, she said.Arun Agrawal, owner of a leading cereal shop, said the police allowed unloading only during the night during the fair. Arranging workers would then be a problem, which might also timely supply of food items."

It was tolerant to water logging, pests, highly suitable for non-irrigated areas, and ideal to combat effects of climate change. It also had lower cost of production, needed less fertilizer and was suitable for organic farming having a better ginning ratio compared American hybrids, CICR said.After the BJP came to power, the RSS and its allied organisations like Swadeshi Jagraan Manch have been strongly lobbying against genetically modified crops. Last year, field trials for gentically modified varieites of chickpea, maize, rice and cotton were put on hold by the Maharashtra government following questions raised by these organisations which had to be satisfied first. The researchers have already allayed their fears. Other farm activists have also been blaming Bt for farmers' suicides.CICR suggested that a separate minimum support price (MSP) should be fixed for the desi cotton. The rate had to be more than that available for the same staple length of American variety. The Cotton Corporation of India should have a special procurement scheme apart from starting a drive on Make in India.THe agency submitted a list of 12 purely Indian varieties of non-Bt cotton varieties saying these were best suited for Indian conditions being drought and pest resistant. They had longer staple length and were better than the Bt variety, CICR representatives told the meeting. ""A field test of the varieties will be held in 21 locations throughout the country. This is being done to ascertain which region a specific variety will be best suited to,"" said Dr Keshav Kranthi, director of CICR.Originally Indian cotton had short staple due to which the American variety was preferred. Over the years, longer staple indigenous varieties have been developed.The indigenous varieties mooted by CICR were developed during the last 10 years. Around eight varieties with 27 to 30cm staple length were developed in the last decade and those having a length of 30 to 32cm were developed recently.Monsanto entered the Indian market with Bt cotton in 2002 and currently its second version Bollgard II is available. There are plans to launch Bollgard III too. The company changed the very dynamics of cotton cultivation. Bt seed gave a higher yield due to its resistance to bollworm pest that takes a major toll on cotton crop. It also led to an increase in cost of production. Recently, the government recommended a cut in the royalty charged by Monsanto that led to the multinational threatening to withdraw from Indian market."

Feasting in the sight of urchins, for instance, or kissing on the street in a nation starved of feasts, love, sex and foreplay. In the same category of vulgarity is the watering of cricket grounds in a state where there is a drought. It deserves lament, perhaps in a sweet mediocre collegiate poem. But to take the matter to court is out of proportion.The pubic interest litigations against the hosting of a cricket tournament in Maharashtra have fanned a moral outrage that is, like many urban moral outrages, a confluence of serious concerns, contempt for a wealthy organisation, pious exaggerations, irrational arguments and personal agendas.The issue before the Bombay High Court was that Maharashtra should not be allowed to host the Indian Premier League matches because cricket grounds consume thousands of litres of water every day in maintenance. The court saved Saturdays inaugural match but asked, probably with anger, Are cricket matches more important than people? Now, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is a despicable private club of industrialists and politicians, but the courts question was hyperbolic. Also, people matter to the board because that is how it makes money.And what exactly is the reasoning of the court? Is not an international-grade cricket ground maintained when there is no tournament underway? If an active cricket ground exists, it would be watered on most days, or it would die. So why this fuss before the tournament? Also, the calls for the cancellation of matches are comical for a simple reason  it is on the days of the matches that the grounds are not heavily watered.Read | Tackling drought is states responsibility, not cricket boardsThe water that is used on an Indian cricket field, according to an official, is about 15,000 to 20,000 litres of non-potable water a day, or less than five tankers. That is as much fresh water that is required to make one kilo of chocolate, according to the data of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a global network.Sunil Gavaskar, whose relationship with the BCCI, it is reported, has collapsed and whose lucrative contract with the board may end, wrote in his column, The issue of drought is one such where many lives are at stake. (True). I am no expert on ground and pitch preparation (True) Nor do I know whether the water that will be saved if the matches are not played can be used to irrigate the lands that have become dry and parched. (It cant be used). He went on to suggest that the matches should be moved out of Maharashtra. It is a small price to pay, for the alternative could well be unnecessary loss of lives of those whose hard work gives us our daily roti and dal.This is a mystifying exaggeration  the suggestion that if matches are held in three cricket grounds in Maharahstra the lives of farmers would be at risk. But it is a popular view.Read | No way we can do this: BCCI official on moving Maharashtra IPL matchesThere is much veneration of farmers in India by those who are not farmers. These are the very people whose greatest fortune was that their grandfathers or fathers ejected their progeny from the agrarian economy. Most farmers in India have small land-holdings and they are doomed. The reason why most Indian farms are land waiting to become real estate.If people really cared about water, all they have to do is adopt a healthy diet  quit eating red meat (just one kilo of mutton requires over 10,000 litres of water to produce, or half the quantity of water required by a cricket ground in a day), quit rice (one kilo of rice needs about 2,500 litres of water, but half of this does re-enter the hydrological system), wheat and sugar (about 1,000 to 1,500 litres for every kilo).Read | Tea without sugar more effective than IPL banThe human body does not require rice and wheat. In fact it does very well without grain. Rice and wheat are the staples of the world because they have been subsidised to be so. The world has promoted an unhealthy diet that takes considerable fresh water to produce. Add to it the evil called sugar, we have a species that sucks out water to eat poorly. The hypocrisy of those who are outraged by the watering of cricket grounds lies in their very paunches.And, if people really care about poor farmers they would fight for a greater role of science. India is unable to experiment with biotech, which includes processes to create drought-resistant crops, because the Donald Trump of science, Vandana Shiv has maligned the technology.It was inevitable that the talk of farmers and drought would bring up the outlandish hypothesis of farmer suicides, first popularised by Shiva and later sustained by other noted activists, like P Sainath, because it aligned with their economic grouses. Let me repeat an assertion this column made earlier while arguing that farmer suicides are primarily a depression story where poverty only plays a role:In a country where most people can be termed farmers, it is not anomalous that most people who kill themselves would be farmers. In fact, what is anomalous is that a huge majority of farmers who commit suicide are male. If both official and activist statistics are considered, it would appear that women in impoverished farming communities are among the least likely Indians to commit suicide. Activists who ascribe social, economic and political reasons for suicides would never be able to explain why. In most nations of the world, including India, the number of men who commit suicide is several times more than the number of women. this pattern is reflected in the gender ratio of farmer suicides.But the idea that farmers commit suicide because of crop failure or loans or that India is not socialistic enough, is a beloved of activists. There is a book waiting to be written here if you are interested and may I suggest a title: P Sainath Loves A Good Farmer Suicide.Manu Joseph is a journalist and the author of the novel, The Illicit Happiness of Other PeopleTwitter: @manujosephsanThe views expressed are personal"

58f5a4307be9e01a17c9e08c,Small tea estates bane for paddy production,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Small-tea-estates-bane-for-paddy-production/articleshow/51859862.cms,2016-04-17,"Jalpaiguri/ North Dinajpur: The ailing status of north Bengal tea gardens notwithstanding, the small estates mushrooming across the regions are eating into other agriculture land, posing a threat to crops, especially paddy.Going by current figures, over 40,000 small tea gardens in north Bengalmost of them in North Dinajpur and Jalpaiguri districtsstretch over 1,25,000 acres. Merely 15 years ago in 2001, the number of gardens was 7,500, covering 24,000 acres only. This means, over the past decade, tea gardens have flourished at over 500%, taking over 1 lakh acres, and rising. ""It is the steady average price of tea leaves that is alluring more farmers to switch to tea gardening. For every kg of tea leaves, a farmer gets Rs 15, earning a higher profit than from any other crop,"" said Bijoy Gopal Chakraborty, president of the Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers' Associations (CISTA).""For immediate profit, small farmers sell their agrarian land to big tea companies. The practice affects our agricultural production and even culture,"" said MLA Karim Choudhury. He had forced the state to resolve against further procurement of land, but can do little when it came to private land.A tea estate covering an area less than 15 acres is given the ""small garden"". The state had ruled that any such estate coming up after March 31, 2001, would be considered illegal. But giving in to pressure, the deadline was first extended to 2006, then 2009 and now, considering a further date. ""There are at least 24,000 small tea gardens in North Dinajpur, which are yet to get the legal stamp from the Tea Board. Without the no-objection certificate, they can't get subsidy or bank loans. Only 5,800-odd gardens have been listed as legal,"" said Debashis Paul, CISTA secretary. ""Being left out of government benefits, these growers face problems but they do not have to pay tax and they are more than happy about it. They earn a huge amount from the leaves, which they wouldn't have had they followed the law,"" said Sudipta Das, a garden owner.Those who have switched from other agriculture sectir to tea plantation, like to call themselves ""tea farmers"" and not the traditional ""tea growers"". A case in point is Tarun Singha from Islampur, who made a foray into tea industry just a year ago. ""I grew paddy and wheat on my small land. Uncertainty over returns and labour crisis were problems.""As tea estates grow, production of other crops vanish. Rice varieties, such as kalo nania, kalam, aguripak, swarna, arikalam, chunakathi, jashoa and mala, are no more available in local markets. The little that is still cultivated is not enough to meet the demand. The agriculture department record shows even till 2002, rice was cultivated on 40% of land, now it has dwindled to less than 13%, giving in to the demands of the cash crop. ""With tea, farmers are sure of a return, the crop can endure natural calamity and elephants do not eat it. These qualities make them attractive to the farmers,"" a department official said. A case in point is Sudhir Biswas of Kalamati village in Maynaguri. ""I have only one bigha of land where I could grow 20kg paddy. The paddy rate was Rs 250-300 for 40kg. After I shifted to tea, I earn Rs 300 from 20kg,"" said Sudhir Biswas of Kalamati village in Maynaguri. Once known for only bazra and kaon (poor crops), this part now houses thriving small gardens. ""It has changed our economy,"" Kamrul Alam of Barivit said. ""Once people didn't want to give their daughters to our village grooms, in fear of being fed with kaon.""Although the agriculture department is trying to ensure that no more farmer take into tea gardening, the allure of tea trade is unavoidable, especially for those farmers who have small patches of agricultural land.But the Tea Board is worried about the poor quality of tea from small gardens. These estates, which account for 36% of the total production in the country, allegedly do not maintain the minimum quality check, and the leaves are not fit for export. But, as industry insiders said, the tea scene is not exactly rosy. ""Leaf prices have not risen, cost has,"" said Ashok Samaddar. ""Besides the high pesticide price and irregular rains, labour cost has gone up. These unauthorized small estates depend on agents of Bought Leaf Factories. During crisis, the tea price drops to Rs 4-5 per kg."" Changing to tea industry has another pitfall: Switching back is almost impossible owing to the astronomical cost.""Once planted with tea plants, the lands can never be converted to paddy field. It involves huge cost which we can hardly afford"", conceded Harsha Sarkar of Kamlapur.After all how many like lawyer Mansur Ali could afford to uproot tea plants to sow crops again? It is learnt that three in Islampur have uprooted tea plants this year.According to the agriculture department even till 2002 local rice was cultivated in 40 percent of land. Now it has reduced to below 13 percent. Traditional agriculture has changed to commercial agriculture over the past decade"
5904b0137be9e04154dfa6ba,"Mamata faces a fight: But in north Bengal, the rural impoverished talk positively about Trinamool",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Addictions/mamata-faces-a-fight-but-in-north-bengal-the-rural-impoverished-talk-positively-about-trinamool/,2016-04-21,"Writing on elections in West Bengal is a delicate affair. In Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, voters generally speak up with enthusiasm on who they will vote for and why. Its a different story in a state where political violence has claimed thousands of lives over the last four decades. Hinterland common folk are uneasy about revealing their preference. A dozen variations of the expression, dekhte hobe (well have to see), is what one gets to hear.In a climate of fierce political partisanship, where one is often forced to choose sides, staying anonymous looks like a safer option for survival. Even so, journeying through the picture-postcard villages of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and the stunted expanse of Malda district in north Bengal, one gathers that the Mamata Banerjee government enjoys a fairly positive rating among the rural impoverished.Several marginalised farmers and daily wagers admit to benefiting from state welfare schemes. According to them, PDS functions better than ever. Rice is readily available for Rs 2 (shades of Raman Singhs Chhattisgarh government here) and atta for Rs 3.50 a kg.Like Bihars Nitish Kumar government in its previous avatar, the TMC government has distributed thousands of bicycles among needy school students. These bicycles, painted a political shade of blue, stand out. Miles of roads in rural areas have been laid with fresh tar.Many would love to lump Mamata alongside Lalu Prasad, a mass leader hardly associated with progress. But evidence shows she is closer to the development-driven Nitish. Its possible to argue that TMC lacks a long-term vision for the state. But in contrast to the small-town and mofussil middle-class who are less than satisfied with TMCs five-year performance, the underprivileged in north Bengals countryside have generally positive things to say about her tenure. This class also seems relatively indifferent to the scams (Saradha, Rose Valley) that have put Mamatas party on the backfoot in recent weeks.Throughout north Bengal, flags of the Left parties and Congress flutter on trees and poles like conjoined twins. The erstwhile bitter rivals are new comrades-in-arms. Political alliances, for all their compulsions and contradictions, can be electoral master strokes. Last year, for instance, when RJD supremo Lalu and JD(U)s Nitish rediscovered each other to combat BJP, Bihars caste calculus tilted decisively in favour of the two Mandalites and a piggybacking Congress.In Bengal, this is the question everybody wants a definitive answer to: Is the Left-Congress alliance working on the ground as it unofficially did during the Siliguri municipal elections last year? What one can say for sure is that the unlikely union has energised the duos cadres and party workers, hugely demoralised after the thrashing in the 2011 state polls and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The jot (alliance) and the fervent wish that it can synergise votes is the hook both parties have hung their hopes on.Any election is also about managing public perception. In that regard, the pact has reasonably succeeded. The allies are sharing stage, attending mohalla booth meetings, even occasionally shouting Inquilab Zindabad together. At least publicly, theres a show of unity.But will party workers of both Congress and Left Front, divided for years by ideology and memories of hate, be honest to that public show of bonding inside the polling booth? It appears that a fair percentage of vote transfer among party workers could happen on that account. And thats primarily because theres an increasing realisation that another electoral setback could be ruinous to their future.However, the same may not hold true for the ordinary party voter, who might walk his own line. Most pre-election opinion polls have given a majority to TMC, in greater or lesser degree. But the alliance, boosted by the surround sound of those who benefited during the 34 years of Left rule, has partially dented the self-confidence of TMC. Whether it is enough to alter the final outcome is another matter.Amidst this battle for the top slot, BJP has marked its physical presence far and deep. From the lush hamlets of Jalpaiguri to the water-parched villages of Malda district to the forest areas of Alipurduar, the saffron flag can be seen in most corners of north Bengal.In the 2014 Lok Sabha poll where BJP got 17.02% votes, pundits attributed the surge to the Modi wave. Thats partly true. Over the years, RSS as well as its political wing have set up base in dozens of villages. Shakhas are common.Broadly speaking, their support base includes sections of SCs (rajbonshis, namasudras), a small portion of STs, parts of the non-Bengali population and the anti-Left, anti-Congress middle class. The party stands a chance in Baisnabnagar and Kalchini assembly seats. Its vote-share should be far higher than the 4.06% it got in 2011 assembly polls. However, the 17% peak of LS 2014 could still be a bridge too far. BJP is a party in search of an articulate and widely-accepted local leader.PS: Another saffron votary is making his presence visibly felt. His visage can be seen outside every shop peddling his goods even in the border outposts of north Bengal. No other businessman comes close. Guess who? Baba Ramdev."

The daughter of a farmer, who was married to a farmer's family, would not let her two sons - Kuntal and Soumyodeep - to till land. Sitting in her in-laws' home at Hitta village in Burdwan's Galsi, Madhumita, whose husband Sushanto committed suicide in January 2012, unequivocally declares: ""They will never be farmers."" Her father-in-law Bikash Chandra Ghosh nods in agreement as the two boys, who study in Classes VI and VIII, stand next to her wearing blank looks. Life is full of uncertainties for the Ghoshes as they do not know how to pay back the banks Rs 3 lakh. The future of the two boys is uncertain as their mother does not have the resources to fund their education. Sushanto's parents don't have money to buy medicines. The family members of Sushanto Ghosh, who committed suicide. Picture by Partha Protim Koner The exact reason behind Sushanto's suicide is not known as the family's version that he killed himself to escape indebtedness has no takers in the administration and hence, no government support. ""What do I say? We lost everything because we are farmers,"" she says. Her torn green sari bears signs of penury. Some neighbours listen to her conversation with this correspondent with rapt attention on a sultry afternoon of April, the harvesting time for the boro crop. Asked why they aren't in the fields, most of them say they haven't sown the seeds. ""Why should we? Farming means losses,"" replies Panchu Gopal Ghosh, who has been farming for at least four decades. The veteran offers a rough calculation to explain the lack of incentive in farming. Such answers from members of farmer families in Galsi block - the top rice producer for years in Bengal and regarded as the Granary of Burdwan, which itself is the state's granary - may surprise outsiders but not the people of the district, where 70 per cent of the population has something or the other to do with agriculture. ""There is no point talking about what it was before and how happy and prosperous we farmers were.... Today, it is even better to be a manual labourer,"" says Swapan Ghosh, who has given up farming and become a mason. This approach of farmers - seen and heard in the rice belt of the district, including Galsi, Bhatar, Raina and Khandaghosh, and the potato belt covering Memari, Manteswar and Jamalpur - has become a worry for the ruling Trinamul ahead of tomorrow's elections, when 16 Assembly constituencies of rural Burdwan will go to the polls. If slogans in Burdwan are any indication, the writing on the wall captures the mood. Sample this: "" Kake vote dilam kaka? Mill- e dhan, bank-e taka, chashir haat sudhui fanka (Whom did we vote, dear friend? Mills are stocked with paddy, banks stashed with money, but the farmers' hands are empty)."" In the 2011 Assembly polls, Trinamul had won nine of the 16 seats. Mamata Banerjee's Maa-Mati-Manush slogan had worked wonders in the district as Trinamul swept the panchayat polls of 2013. There were, however, complaints of electoral malpractice. The trend continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with Trinamul candidates leading in 13 of these constituencies. Aroop Biswas, the Trinamul observer for the district, says the summer of 2016 will not be an aberration either but several lower-level party functionaries feel otherwise. ""The CPM is building its campaign on the agrarian distress and it's striking a chord with common people.... Our target of sweeping the district will not be met,"" a Trinamul leader in Burdwan said. According to him, the CPM's campaign, highlighting a list carrying names, addresses and other details of over 140 farmers who committed suicide in the past few years, has caught on in the region. Trinamul sources concede the chief minister is aware of the discontent brewing in rural Burdwan and she tried to tackle it by holding Mati Utsav in the district, where some farmers were given cash awards and certificates for excellence in production. ""But that hasn't helped much,"" admits the source, adding that the list of problems has only grown for farmers. One of the recurring complaints heard across rural Burdwan is the Mamata government's failure to ensure remunerative price for farm produce while the cost of agriculture has galloped because of a rise in fertiliser prices and a subsequent increase in electricity tariff. ""A 60kg sack of rice used to yield anything between Rs 850 and Rs 900 till 2011. But now the farmers are getting between Rs 620 and Rs 650 per sack. There is genuine discontent,"" says Arup Kumar Chattopadhyay, a professor of economics at Burdwan University. Although on paper the farmers are getting Rs 814 a sack because that's the minimum support price for paddy, price realisation is much less, several farmers have said. ""Now that the panchayats play a role in procurement, they deduct charges like cost of collection of paddy from farmers' homes and various other handling expenses.... Such deductions weren't made during Left rule,"" says Abdur Rezzak Mondal, the district secretary of the CPM's peasant wing. The state government's plan to ensure payment through cheques has boomeranged as most farmers are complaining of delay in payment, which adds to their interest burden on the capital they borrow from money lenders. Scarcity of water is the other problem. The ripples of the discontent in rural Burdwan can be felt in Burdwan town as well. Traders complain of poor sales in the past few years because of the agrarian distress. ""Burdwan doesn't have any industry.... The surplus from agriculture sustains trade here but the flow of money has stopped and all the traders are suffering,"" said Sumit Dutta, the convenor of a traders' body in Burdwan. Agrarian distress and its negative impact on the economy are not unique to Burdwan or any other district in Bengal as a host of factors - some beyond the control of the state government - have made agriculture unviable. But the CPM has made it a poll issue in Burdwan and the hope for the party's revival is riding on the farmers' discontent. The focus on farmers' issues has already helped the CPM as its leaders have managed to build up resistance against Trinamul in the run-up to the polls by campaigning in areas like Raina and Khandaghosh and even finalising the list of polling agents to be stationed in the booths tomorrow. In contemporary Bengal, the finalisation of the list in itself is an achievement. ""We have made a turnaround because we have exposed how the ruling party has ruined agriculture in Burdwan.... Tomorrow is the final and we are ready to resist Trinamul goons if they try to loot votes,"" said CPM state committee member Amal Halder. The similarity with the summer of 2011 cannot be missed. Mamata had then played the farmers' card to her advantage. Amid questions whether the CPM can reap similar benefits, it is almost certain that Trinamul will fare worse than in 2014 in rural Bengal and it will be a blow to Mamata in central Bengal.

RNR 15048 has gained ready acceptance after its release last year because of its unique grain size, short slender shape, high grain yield potential, high head rice recovery, good cooking quality and above all robust blast resistance characteristics.One of the striking qualities of this paddy variety is that it can be raised in both kharif and rabi seasons in a short duration of about 125 days.Hyderabad-based professor of Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) has developed the new rice variety two years ago to enable the farmers overcome recurring problems associated with delay in monsoon and deficiency in rainfall, besides reaping good harvest with low investment, sources said. Its low Glycemic Index (GI) of 51.5 percentage compared to the popular BPT 5204 rice variety (GI of 56.5) has made it a preferred choice for health conscious consumers, particularly diabetic patients. Many farmers in Nelakondapalli, Chintakani, Mudigonda and several other mandals in the district have raised Telangana Sona (RNR 15048) in over 1,500 acres in the rabi season, says Dr. J. Hemantha Kumar, Programme Coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Wyra.Prompted by their success in cultivation of the new rice variety, more farmers are showing interest to take up cultivation of Telangana Sona.We are recommending Telangana Sona in place of BPT 5204 due to its suitability for late planting conditions in kharif and potential to reap good yield with low expenditure in both crop seasons, he notes.I have raised Telangana Sona in 6.5 acres in rabi season, which gave a good yield of nearly 250 bags of fine quality of short slender grain, says M. Venkateswara Rao, a paddy grower of Chennaram in Nelakondapalli mandal.It is highly palatable and suits health conscious consumers, he remarks, adding that the new variety has proved its efficacy in harsh weather conditions, he emphasises.The government should supply seed of Telangana Sona to the small and marginal farmers, especially in tribal areas, and encourage them to cultivate the high yielding and blast resistance new rice variety and overcome agrarian crisis, suggests Balram, a tribal farmer of Chandrugonda."

Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."

The 32 bighas of land that Mr. Singh shares with his three brothers also boasts of a one-of-a-kind rural museum, the Humane Agrarian Centre. A farmer-activist based in Bandas Badokhar Khurd village, Mr. Singh believes that his experiment with sustainable and traditional farming could be replicated at a larger level, and could pave the way for a policy change.The idea is to ensure the prosperity of the farmers family, ecological balance and food security of the country.He calls his pioneering method of sustainable farming Aavartansheel Kheti. Loosely translated, as per a book he co-authored with Belgium environmentalist Johan Dhulster, it means periodic proportionate farming.Key elements of this approach are crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, planting and research for improving soil fertility and seed development. The essence is to minimise the farmers reliance on the market while improving their standard of living.The farmer would have to utilise his farm by dividing it into three parts: one-third would be used for rearing fruits and crops, the other for growing timber and the remaining portion for animal husbandry. Mr. Singhs multi-pronged technique, pioneered and implemented by him for over a decade, is similar to the idea of farming Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been propagating in his addresses to farmers.The farmer, known in the area as pragatisheel or progressive, advises farmers to not directly trade their produce in the market but to sell the processed extracts. For instance, sell paneer but not milk, and so on. That will link the farm to the kitchen. And also give the customers a better quality and nutritious product, said Mr. Singh. Some of the popular products at his farm are amla pickle and candy, cow ghee, mustard oil, organic rice and flour (wheat, gram, and barley). Asked whether it was practical for small farmers, Mr. Singh said, yes, with certain adaptations and adjustments.Born in 1964 into a farming background, Mr. Singh studied philosophy in Allahabad University but soon turned to his ancestral vocation. In 1995, he adopted a traditional method of farming, triggered by his dismay at the negative impact of the Green Revolution.He says the Green Revolution and other policies played a big role in dismantling the traditional structure of farming and pushed the farmer to the mercy of unsustainable methods, which also harmed environment. Mr. Singh links it to the present crisis, where three consecutive droughts, with bouts of unseasonal rains and hailstorm, have devastated the morale of the Bundelkhand farmer.The outside knowhow of some experts was forced upon farmers. Till 1980, not a single bag of urea was purchased in Bundelkhand. But due to the governments policies, farmers were forced to abort traditional and more sustainable methods, eventually leading them into debt-traps, Mr. Singh said. Every time a farmer commits suicide, the government says he was burdened by debt. What is the key reason for the debt? The farmers are dying because they follow the schemes of the government. This is the real injustice.Droughts are not new to Bundelkhand. As per records, in the last century it witnessed 17 major droughts, 10 of them caused by deficient rainfall. But the traditional water-recharging methods, numerous ponds, and natural harvesting techniques of people then mitigated the scarcity. The steps taken by the government in the last three decades have nullified the work of the ancestors, Mr. Singh said.The crops grown then did not require much water. With the Green Revolution, underground water began to be extracted heavily to sustain the thirst of the seeds. The local seeds were tested and adapted to fight drought. But the seeds introduced by the government needed excess water and urea to grow. Tractors further increased the costs, Mr. Singh said.At the centre of it all, said Mr. Singh, was the ruling class apathy towards farmers, manifested in their lack of representation in policy formation. The farming sector was bearing the brunt of their mistakes and excesses of the industrial and service sectors.His farm has plenty of water, many trees bearing fruit and a steady produce of organic products"

The state government has planned to increase the area under horticulture to nine lakh hectare by 2026 from the current 2.5 lakh hectare. In the next 10 years, the government wants to increase the ratio of land under cultivation of horticulture versus agriculture to 25:75 from the current 7:93.Addressing a national seminar on 'Development of states, with special emphasis on northern-western states', organized at Institute for Development and Communication (IDC) on Thursday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the government was setting up centres of excellence for horticulture in every district in this connection. During the workshop, experts discussed issues contributing to the agrarian crisis, such as growth of farm debt and suicides and groundwater depletion. They said the growth of major crops of rice and wheat had experienced a decline in the past decade, and this could be attributed to Punjab reaching its highest attainable productivity under the current high-yielding variety (HYV) technology.IDC chairman and former union minister of planning and power Prof YK Alagh said they cannot have anti-grain policies, but it is equally important for them to diversify to produce jowar, maize, and pulses which can be achieved through incentivization. IDC director Dr Pramod Kumar stressed there was a need to give subsidies to agriculture. ""Subsidies are given as doles, and doles are a feudal response to the crisis of capitalism, while subsidies are a state-led capitalist response to the crisis of capitalism. On the other hand, elimination of 'freebies' is a market fundamentalist response to crisis of capitalism,"" said Kumar. ""It would be worthwhile to examine sectoral needs for subsidies to promote equity and productivity,"" he added. Agriculture scientist Devender Sharma said since the 1970s, the minimum support price has increased only 19 times, whereas the increase in incomes of other sectors has been almost 150 times.Chairperson of IIM-Ahmedabad's Centre of Management in Agriculture Prof Sukhpal Singh, Ludhiana's Punjab Agriculture University vice-chancellor Prof B S Dhillon, Punjab's chief finance and economic adviser Prof B S Ghuman and Centre of Research in Rural and Industrial Development's Prof S S Sangwan also spoke on the occasion."

Maximum sales of musical instruments take place during Ganeshotsav, say Dabghars.SITTING amid teeming commotion in his shop, with tools to mend the broken ring of a tabla, Suresh D Chauhan works hard to bring it to the desired size. Suresh, who keeps a close watch on his subordinates work and customers in his century-old Lalbaug shop, belongs to a community of Dagbars, whose expertise in making musical instruments is well-known.With his life spent as a skilled artisan, Suresh cherishes the age-old art of making musical instruments, particularly related to the origin of Marathi music.Dabgars come from Indias western belt that includes Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. Having long practised and promoted the art of making quality musical instruments, they specialise in nagadas, dhols, pakhawaj, mrudungs, tablas, dholkis, tuntunas, halgis and other instruments.My grandfather would make the jheels (leather strips tied on the tablas) of tablas and get a bag of rice in return. He, and other Dabgars, would also get silver coins which they would use to come to Mumbai, Suresh reminisces, seated around an ensemble of instruments.What keeps him going is the satisfaction of putting his hard earned skill to practice in his shop.For Ishwarlal Chauhan too, another one from the community, the profession is where he derives his identity from. He has been running the shop for over five decades now and takes pride in passing on the art to his sons. His son Atul says, I have been making dhol-tashas since I was a nine-year-old, and I completely adore my job. I think the market still holds importance for recognising the work of artists like us.However, with preferences substantially tilting towards electronic instruments such as keyboards, electric guitars and recorded sounds at processions and devotional functions, Suresh says its future is bleak. Nobody likes to work in this field now. From about 12 shops in 1940 of dhol-tasha makers in Lalbaug, just three or four remain. I frankly believe the following generations would not even want to touch these instruments, he fears.But Dabgars believe they are better-off. With maximum sales of musical instruments happening during Ganeshotsav, musical events and repair works keep accounts running for the rest of the year. As electronic items are a bit expensive and tougher to use, connoisseurs of classical music and musicians who cannot afford to spend more become the target audience for Dabgars.It takes ten years at least for any artisan to learn the job perfectly. In our community, we do not care about artisans class, as whoever masters the skill and performs the work perfectly is the winner, says Suresh.With popular Lavanis or folk music of Marathi films making use of instruments made by these Dabgars, the community has not lost hope, yet.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The grain processing machinery manufacturing companies, which includes national as well as international ones, will exhibit the latest technology which can be beneficial to farmers and grain mill traders. Bihar is an agrarian economy and as the state has a good production of paddy, wheat and maize, the grain processing machinery manufacturing companies aim to target farmers and grain mill traders, as there is no big grain processing unit. Surinder Gupta, the chairman of Business Empire, the unit which is organising the exhibition, said: ""In absence of big grain processing units in the state, the wheat and paddy produced in the state are processed in other states especially at Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Due to processing of grain in other states, the farmer as well as mill owners suffer losses."" The idea behind holding the exhibition is to showcase the latest technology in grain processing so that farmers and mill owners can introduce new techniques. The paddy, after going through various process in mills such as de-stoning, whitening, polishing, colour sorting, the rice is recovered which after packaging is sent to markets. Manish Sahay, director of Bihar Enterprises Association, said: ""The rice mills operating in district as Rohtas, Sasaram, Kaimur and Buxar have middle level rice mill processing unit. The mills are inferior to ones in Punjab and Haryana, as they hardly go for colour sorting. The technique is used to remove black colour from paddy. Sahay said the idea is that farmers and grain mill owner will know about the new technologies which can be beneficial to them, thus improving the quality of whole processed grain. The average cost of installing grain processing unit (middle level) is around Rs 30 to 40 lakh. The organisers claimed that with introduction of new technology, not only will there be improvement in qualities of processed grain but also there will be increase in production. Sahay said: ""The modern machines not only increase the output of processed grain, but also takes less time in processing than normal machines."" Similarly, the exhibition will also have wheat and maize processing machines. As the Kosi region leads in maize production, in absence of advanced grain processing unit, the farmers are left with no other alternative but to sell their produce at lower rates. The modern maize milling machine can help the farmers get various kinds of corn products, such as cornflour and others. The exhibition will be inaugurated by industries minister Jai Kumar Singh. At the exhibition, farmers and interested mill owners booking machines will also get discounts."

Known for the dacoits of Chambal and the Rani of Jhansi, the arid region, occupying districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has experienced drastic variation in climate in recent times. It faced a drought from 2003 to 2010, then floods in 2011, delayed monsoons in 2012 and 2013, and drought again since 2014. Farmers tried everything to adapt  growing a mix of dry crops during the kharif season, while interspersing the winter rabi wheat with cash crops like chickpea and mustard. They invested heavily in borewells, tractors, threshers and seeds and fertilizers through formal and informal credit.The past two winters, with hailstorms and unseasonal rain, destroyed crops (chickpea yields were mostly wiped out, the arhar crop failed completely), leading to farmer suicides (3,500 since 2003) and mass migration. Mitigation has been lacking; contractors not farmers benefit, and instead of providing crop insurance, warehouses are built. Bereaved families, hoping for compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government (Rs.7 lakh on death), were instead offered wheat bundles.India, a climate change hotspotIndia is uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures  it ranks in the top 20 in the Climate Change Vulnerability Index. Our average surface temperature, over the past four decades, has risen by 0.3 Celsius, accompanied by a rising incidence of floods, droughts and cyclones. With the majority of all landholdings in India measuring less than a hectare, marginal farmers face a steep decline in household income and a concomitant rise in household poverty through exacerbated droughts. Climate change would impact soil health, with increasing surface temperatures leading to higher CO{-2}emissions and reducing natural nitrogen availability. Mitigating this by increasing chemical fertilizer usage could impact long-term soil fertility, leaving the soil open to greater erosion and desertification. Meanwhile, migration patterns, farmer suicides and stagnating rural incomes, along with increasingly ad hoc land acquisition in the name of public goods, have politicised the idea of climate mitigation. Marginal farmland will increasingly be useless for agriculture.Our dependency on rain continues to amplify  rain-fed agriculture is practised in the majority of our total cropped area supporting a significant proportion of the national food basket (55 per cent of rice, 90 per cent of pulses, 91 per cent of all coarse grain). Our regional crop patterns assume a specific range of weather variability, failing to cope with the recent high periods of heavy rainfall with long dry intervals. In 2013, large crops of wheat, gram, lentils and mustard, weeks away from harvesting, were destroyed in untimely rains. Indias flood-affected area has doubled since Independence, despite generous state spending on flood protection schemes.Research has highlighted the deleterious impact of climate change on crop production. By 2100, the kharif season will face a varying temperature rise (0.7-3.3 Celsius) with rainfall significantly impacted. Limited temperature rises could lead to a 22 per cent decline in wheat yield in the rabi season, while rice yield could decline by 15 per cent. Other staple crops  sorghum, groundnut, chickpea  could see a sharp decline. Its impact is already prevalent: it is estimated that without rising temperatures and rain variability, Indias rice production over the past four decades could have been 8 per cent higher. India is home to the largest hungry population  falling agricultural yields will only make matters worse.Some policy prescriptionsOur low agricultural productivity remains a key constraint. According to the Swaminathan Committee on Farmers (2006), for rice, we produce 2,929 kg per hectare, while China produces twice as much. For other staples, we remain woeful, producing 913 kg of groundnut per hectare, while Indonesia produces nearly half as much more. As suggested by the National Commission on Farmers, a rural spending plan, focussed on investments in agriculture infrastructure, particularly in irrigation, rainwater harvesting and a national network of soil-testing laboratories is needed. Simple water harvesting and conservation measures (micro-irrigation, watershed management and insurance coverage) can reduce the majority of the potential loss due to drought (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Drought strategies should be extended to the village level  for example, each village should have a village pond, created under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Indian agricultural policy has made us structurally vulnerable to climate change. As suggested often by the National Commission on Farmers, conservation farming and dryland agriculture should be promoted. Each village should be provided timely rainfall forecasts along with weather-based forewarnings regarding crop pests and epidemics in various seasons. Afforestation, in a biodiverse manner, should be encouraged to help modify regional climates and prevent soil erosion. Our agricultural research programmes need to be retooled towards dryland research  it has been argued that adoption of drought-tolerant breeds can help reduce production risks by nearly a third, while offering attractive returns to breeders. Changing planting dates could have a significant impact; research highlights that planting wheat earlier than usual can help reduce climate change-induced damage. Zero tillage and laser-based levelling can also help conserve water and land resources. Crop planning can be conducted as per the climatic zones of different regions, while utilising better genotypes for rain-fed conditions.We should focus on expanding our formal credit system to reach all marginal farmers. Insurance coverage should be expanded to all crops while reducing the rate of interest to nominal levels, with government support and an expanded Rural Insurance Development Fund. A debt moratorium policy on drought-distressed hotspots and areas facing climate change calamities should be announced, waiving interest on loans till farming incomes are restored. The Centre and States should launch an integrated crop, livestock and family health insurance package while instituting an Agriculture Credit Risk Fund to provide relief in the aftermath of successive natural disasters.Climate change will impact the entire food production chain, affecting our food security. Livestock production, often considered to be a substitute to farming for marginal farmers, would face reduced fodder supplies given a decline in crop area or production. With Indias population rising, demand for diversified crops will be hard to square with diminishing yields. Agricultural investments in food crops, along with systemic support for irrigation, infrastructure and rural institutions can help move India beyond climate change-induced food insecurity, strengthening our stressed food production systems.

Disturbing TV visuals of her ministers taking bribe, collapse of a Kolkata flyover killing over 20 people prior to the election had little impact on the results in West Bengal as Mamata Banerjee stormed back to power for a second consecutive term, leaving many political pundits baffled and fumbling for words to explain her unbelievably massive victory both in terms of seats and vote share.How can one explain Mamatas triumph? Is the mandate a yes in favour of her governments development activities or a no to a hastily conjured alliance of two ideologically opposed partners, the Left and the Congress? The story contains both.The no factorTrouble was brewing within the Left-Congress alliance since its inception. Many CPM leaders, from the Polit Bureau to the district committees, were ideologically opposed to the idea of joining hands with the Congress. It is no longer a secret now that many Left voters chose NOTA (None Of The Above) instead of an alliance candidate. Similarly, a large number of Congress supporters refused to vote for Left candidates, they voted for the Trinamool instead. In short, neither the arithmetic nor the chemistry worked for the alliance.The Left-Congress partnership emerged too late, barely two months before the polls, giving it too little time to bloom. Also, after repeated electoral debacles, first in the 2011 Assembly polls and then in the municipal and Lok Sabha elections, the powerful organisation of the Left, which won them so many elections in the past, collapsed completely. So, while Trinamool workers were busy campaigning in the villages, the Left leaders had little option but to use air-conditioned studios of news channels as their primary vehicles of campaign.The silent voters, whose votes finally determine the outcome of every election, did not trust the alliance. Many believed the Left-Congress bonhomie would not last long even if the alliance came to power. As a result, the government would fall, requiring another round of elections. These silent voters chose stability and voted for the Trinamool.The Muslim community influenced electoral outcome in at least 80 of the 294 seats by supporting the Trinamool. The Left could be credited for preventing communal riots, but they virtually did nothing for the Muslims during their 30-year rule. True, Mamata promised much and delivered little, but unlike the Left, she delivered something, felt the Muslims, particularly those in the rural areas.Finally, the Left-Congress leaders expectations on the possible swing in the BJPs vote share in their favour went horribly wrong. True to their calculations, the BJPs vote share came down from 17% to 10%, but the swing entirely favoured the Trinamool.The yes factorStrange though it may sound, but many of the accusations against Mamata in fact helped her. The Trinamool was accused of running a syndicate raj in West Bengal. True, the syndicates fleece realtors, supply low-grade building materials at prices much higher than the market rates, but syndicate members, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, have no other source of livelihood.There are at least 30,000 syndicate members in the Rajarhat-New Town area alone, and the Left-Congress alliances promise of action against syndicates if they came to power worried these young men and they worked body and soul to ensure a Trinamool victory. Syndicates exist in all urban areas in Bengal and all of them worked for the Trinamool. Similarly, the Oppositions charge that the government was wasting tax payers money to give donations to the local clubs alienated the club members, who doggedly worked to ensure Mamatas victory.On the other hand, in spite of the financial constraints and the resulting shoe-string budget, Mamatas government successfully implemented a slew of development projects, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. In spite of repeated incidents of violence against women, Mamata managed to win them over by distributing cycles to girl students. Owning a cycle in a village is like possessing a Maruti car in a city. Interestingly, the idea of distributing cycles was floated by a chief secretary during the last leg of the Left Front rule, but the proposal was bluntly shot down by the then finance minister Asim Dasgupta.Finally, distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg came as Mamatas masterstroke. Better road connectivity, availability of water and medicines increased the Trinamools vote share. Though corruption was clearly visible, local Trinamool leaders were pardoned by the rural voters. Issues like the Saradha chit fund scam, Narada sting operation, flyover collapse and campus violence eroded the Trinamools vote share, but the erosion was confined to urban seats and every Narada-tainted minister won, albeit with a lower margin.So, where does Mamata go from here? Insiders say Delhi is her next target. If the Third Front takes shape after the Uttar Pradesh elections, she hopes to play a major role at the Centre. Till then, she will concentrate on the next panchayat election in West Bengal to further consolidate her position.(The writer is a senior journalist based in Kolkata)"

Hence, Maharashtra government should lift the moratorium on conducting trials of all genetically modified (GM) crops in the state. Such bans or restrictions in conducting research trials will only push the agriculture sector backwards rather than taking it forward.These were the observations by CD Mayee, former chairman of the Agriculture Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB). Mayee was speaking to reporters at a programme organized by the Association of Biotechnology-led Enterprises  Agriculture Focus Group (Able-AG) in city on Tuesday on the importance of increasing productivity and profitability of oilseed and pulses.""Indian agriculture is at the cross roads and there is strong need to improve the stagnating yields of all crops,"" Mayee said.""India imports pulses costing Rs30,000 crore and oil costing Rs90,000 crore, the highest imported items after gold and petroleum. Vidarbha has a high potential for pulses and oilseed crops. Andhra Pradesh allowed the Bt chickpea trials. But Maharashtra didn't. It is sad that this is despite the Kakodkar committee recommendations,"" he said. Mayee admitted that GM crops alone cannot be an answer to all problems in agriculture. But an adequate mix of all types of technologies, including organic, can minimize the agrarian distress.In India, 16 types of trials are on in different crops including cotton, rice (drought tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency), brinjal, sugar cane (drought tolerance), Bt chickpea and maize. ""Farmer wants technology, be it Swadeshi or foreign. If Swadeshi technology is available, it is always welcome but that doesn't mean that foreign technologies should be restricted,"" said Mayee.The Able-AG executive director Shivendra Bajaj, speaking on the proposed fields trials in Maharashtra and barriers in the way of introduction of agricultural technology in the state, said that GM technology was always a supporting technology and definitely not the only solution for all the problems in the agriculture sector. But he stressed on the need for openness in allowing research and development by the states. ""There is no issue of safety so for in any of the GM crops. GM technology is commercialized only after rigorous trials. Concerns of the general public and scientists can be addressed only through discussion and not banning trials,"" he said.Two progressive farmers from Yavatmal district, Vijay Niwal and Vasant Kale, also voiced the need for newer technologies for improving agriculture as they didn't see any future in conventional methods of farming. ""Every technology has some limitations, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be tried. We want solutions to our problems. Whether they come from home or abroad is immaterial to us. Younger generation would never take up agriculture unless it is technology based,"" said Niwal, who is surviving on Bt cotton since 2003."

A large part of the country is witnessing drought, declining ground-water levels, and shortage in reservoirs, following two consecutive sub-normal monsoons.Deficit rainfallRainfall deficiency in 2014 and 2015 stood at 12 per cent and 14 per cent of normal, respectively. In 2015 rainfall received by Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab and West Uttar Pradesh was more than 50 per cent below normal. This has taken a toll on agricultural production, according to the report.As per the third advance estimates for 2015, rice output was down two per cent, coarse cereals fell 12 per cent, pulses declined by 0.5 per cent along with sugarcane (0.5 per cent) and oilseeds, (six per cent) exacerbating rural distress. Agriculture GDP growth averaged 0.4 per cent in the last two fiscals, much below the long-term trend of 3 per cent.An above-normal monsoon this year will augment groundwater and reservoir levels and in turn increase crop production, according to the report.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reiterated its April forecast of a good south-west monsoon  at 106 per cent of the long period average (LPA). However, the report said that the sensitivity of crops to rainfall signals the need for improvement in irrigation facilities, change in cropping patterns, harnessing of rainwater, adoption of water conservation techniques and availability of stable electricity. Also, efficiency of water usage needs to improve. India currently uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, compared with half that  or 1,321 cubic metre  in China. This underlines the need to address structural issues. An important source of irrigation in India is groundwater, which accounts for as much as 60 per cent of water used for irrigation. Also, irrigation accounts for close to 90 per cent of the total groundwater consumed in the country  the proportion is 98 per cent and 94 per cent for in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.Farm outputDuring the green revolution, the report said, with excessive use of inputs to pump up farm output, farmers increasingly moved towards using groundwater compared with surface water for irrigation. This was supported by government subsidies for electricity supply and irrigation equipment. Excessive use of groundwater has led to depletion of the water table. Between 1993-94 and 2014-15, the share of wells with groundwater less than 10 metre has fallen by 6 percentage points, while that of wells with groundwater more than 60 metre has risen to 6 per cent from 4 per cent, making it increasingly difficult to access ground water.India uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, while China uses half that amount"
58f55ebc7be9e01a17c9868b,Talk of restarting GM crop trials faces stiff opposition,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Talk-of-restarting-GM-crop-trials-faces-stiff-opposition/articleshow/52662706.cms,2016-06-09,"Nagpur: The statement by CD Mayee, a member of state government's technical committee on genetically modified (GM) crops, in a seminar in the city on Monday that the field trials be restarted has evoked sharp reaction from those against genetic engineering. The anti-GM group says the crops are not suitable for conditions in Maharashtra. Mayee is also the former director of city-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR).Last year, the state government had put on hold the restricted field trials of seven GM crops, including rice, maize, chickpea and cotton, after organizations like RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch raised objections.On Mayee's statement, Ajay Patki of the manch's core team said any attempt to introduce GM crops will be opposed tooth and nail. This can also be in the form of protests involving farmers and other means, he warned.""It is already proven that GM crops like Bt cotton need abundant availability of water, and large areas in Maharasthra are under dryland farming. Rather than GM, the country's indigenous varieties can also be promoted,"" said Patki.He said GM crops, especially Bt cotton, have increased the cost of production. Though not initially, in last 10 years or so the requirement of fertilizers has increased in the GM seeds, which has led to a major hike in the cost of cultivation. This has disbursed the economics of agriculture and often driving farmers into financial crisis leading to suicides, he said.Patki said his organization has already succeeded in stalling GM brinjals in 2009, when Jairam Ramesh was the minister for forest and environment under the UPA regime. A public hearing for GM brinjals was held at that time and the manch despite its minority was able to bring moratorium.""There is no need to introduce any manipulative technology for a commonly grown vegetable like brinjal. At that time, there was a major glut in brinjal supply in Vidarbha with rates crashing to 3 a kg."" said Patki.During the seminar, Mayee had insisted that trials should be allowed for at least drought-resistant varieties. One of the crops which was due for trial is drought-resistant rice.On this, Kishore Tiwari, who heads state government's Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), said normally rice is grown in assured rainfall regions so there is a little requirement of a drought-resistant seed for this crop. On the trials, Tiwari said he is not against research but that should come from the universities rather than corporates which eventually create a monopoly on the product.On an experimental basis, Tiwari's organization and the agriculture department in Yavatmal are distributing indigenous seeds in the 50 villages of this farmer suicide prone district. ""The traditional seeds which have evolved over a long period of time are itself drought resistant. The HMT developed by a local farmer in Bhandara can also work in low water conditions,"" said Tiwari.Vijay Jawandiya, a veteran farm activist, said the ready round (RR) up ready variety of Bt is suited for countries like the US where agriculture is mechanized. In India, weeding operation provides a major employment to rural labour. Bt cotton will stand its true test if it is successfully grown without fertilizers.He also questioned those backing Bt cotton. ""Why are straight line varieties, which are cheaper, available in the US than,"" he asked. In India, hybrid Bt which costs more is only available in the market.Mayee, on other hand, said adopting the technology comes later but at least trials should be allowed to test the pros and cons. These are limited field trials conducted in university farms. Distances from other fields are maintained as per the norms so that GM seeds do not contaminate other crops. However, if the test itself is barred, it will be a major setback to research and development. At least, drought-resistant and nitrogen-efficient crops in the batch of seven, which where genetic engineering of non-biotic nature, should be allowed for trials, he said.Maha yet to decide on field trialsOver eight months after the state's technical committee on GM crops gave its report setting aside objections raised against field trials of seven crops, the government has not reverted with an answer, CD Mayee told TOI.The committee is headed by former chairman of atomic energy commission Anil Kakodkar. The last meeting was held eight months ago and now the file is learnt to be put up before the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Tests have been held in states like Gujarat, Andhra and Punjab, but Maharashtra remains. This can be a major setback to research activities, he said.Last year, the tests were stopped after organizations like Swadeshi Jagran Manch raised objections which the committee was supposed to address. ""The government should now take a clear stand instead of delaying decision. When the union minister for environment and forests Prakash Javadekar was approached he said there is no policy against GM trials. Even the respective state government has to give its approval. The Maharashtra government is however, sitting on the file, said Mayee."

However, the delay in implementing the order by cooperative banks has put farmers in the delta region in distress.Due to this delay, farmers who had taken loans in 2007-2008 are still adjudged defaulters and are not eligible for new loans from the cooperative banks. The farmers are ready to take up kuruvai cultivation for which they rely on crop loans from the same banks.""If the process for loan waiver had commenced soon after the CM's announcement, the problem would not have arisen. Without getting any official communication from higher officials, the heads of cooperative banks are unable to identify beneficiaries of the waiver and make it public,"" said Trichy district secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam Ayilai Sivasuriyan.The chief minister had also allotted 40 crore to provide 4,000 as 100 per cent subsidy to those involved in mechanised cultivation process under systematic rice intensification (SRI) method in the special package for kuruvai due to uncertainty over the release of water in the Cauvery on June 12. However, farmers say that the amount will not be enough to meet the needs of all farmers taking up kuruvai this year.""The subsidy of 4,000 per acre is a meagre amount. Loans alone can save them. Besides the defaulters, fresh applicants also cannot avail of the loan now. This will force them to take loans from private banks,"" said state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran in Trichy who recalled a similar situation when the DMK government announced waiver of loans in 2006.Farmers were able to get around 23,000 loan for paddy and around 50,000 for sugarcane from cooperative banks. Now, they expect 30,000 for paddy and 60,000 for sugarcane.Besides the paddy farmers, sugarcane farmers have also been affected by the delay. ""It is a bad time for sugarcane farmers who are in debt after the delay in payment from sugar mills. Now, the cooperative banks have also delayed the loan process citing the waiver. Considering the plight of the farmers, we appeal to the CM to take quick action to solve the issue,"" said Swamimalai Vimalanathan, district secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers' Protection Association."

In this way, the PM had dishonoured the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers, even though he addressed a large gathering near the place, said Tiwari.In a press communique, Tiwari said that the PM had mentioned that 18,000 villages were not electrified after freedom and ""we (BJP) will take steps for the electrification of these villages"", but he failed to mention that the electrification of these 18,000 villages was being done under the 'Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme' started by the Congress government.On the PM's claims on fighting corruption, Tiwari said Modi had failed to look at the performances of the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Shiv Raj Singh Chauhan, and Rajasthan, Vasundhra Raje Scindia, who were also sitting on the dais.Madhya Pradesh, said Tiwari, was facing the biggest corruption scam in the form of the Vyapam case in which about 51 murders had also taken place. There was also the Lalitgate scam in Rajasthan, and the Rs 36,000-crore rice scam in Chattisgarh."

PTI Chandan Bose, the accused in Jawahar Bagh clash, being taken to jail in Mathura on Thursday. PTIRam Vriksh Yadav, the head of the cult outfit Swadhin Bharat Vidhik Satyagrah, had such sway over his followers that continued to live in camps in Jawahar Bagh in Mathura despite being served namak and roti (salt and chapati) and khichdi, alternately as lunch and dinner.The alleged mastermind of the violence on June 2 during police action to evict the squatters, Ram Vriksh had told his followers, who had illegally encroached the public park that police can never attack the camp as they cannot use arms against women and children. The followers who expressed desire to leave the camp for their native homes fearing action from the local administration, were motivated to stay back and told how they can attack the police if they ever raided Jawahar Bagh.These are some of the details that Ram Vrikshs close associate Chandan Bose, who was arrested along with his wife from Basti district Wednesday, revealed during the police interrogation.Bose and his wife were produced in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Thursday, which sent them to 14 days judicial custody. The couple had been on the run after the violence on June 2 saw 29 people, including two police officers and, reportedly, Ram Vriksh, dead.SSP Mathura, Babloo Kumar told The Indian Express that during preliminary interrogation Bose divulged crucial information about the functioning of the camp in the Jawahar Bagh. Bose, who is said to be the second-in-command in the cult outfit, told the police how the followers were assigned different duties in the camp based on the their educational and personal skills.Watch Video: Whats making newsA quack from Buxar, who was also a follower of Jai Gurudev, acted as the doctor in the camp while Bose was handling finances and ration. Those who were skilled in handling arms, used to give shooting training inside the camp while those who had studied management and law were dealing with their respective sections of fund management and legal issues, the SSP said quoting Bose.According to police, Bose told them that there were some 2,500 people living in the camp till June 2, the day when police moved in to evict the area. There used to be a head count of the members every night before they went to bed, Bose told the police.Ram Vriksh used to collect funds to run the camp from the inmates even as many of the rich followers of Jai Gurudev used to donate lakhs of rupees.Bose recalled that recently some from Deoria district donated Rs 10 lakh. But, such big donations came only once in a while. Ram Vriksh used to issue receipts against the donations too, the SSP said.Bose also told the police that those living in the camp were urged to go to their native villages during harvest season and bring back maximum donation of foodgrains. The villagers used to come back with trucks loaded with wheat, rice and sugarcane, the SSP said.The modus operadi of collecting funds was reportedly copied from the Jai Gurudev Trust in Mathura and Pithora.Bose accepted that people in the camp had laptops, mobiles and guns. He, however, could not reveal from where the arms were procured saying that he wasnt in charge of that section.The SSP said that based on Boses interrogation, they now have several leads, which will help them in carrying out the probe.Accused of inciting the violence on June 2, Bose told police that he was a native of West Bengal and had shifted to Ludhiana about 20 years ago. He ran a small garment business and claimed to have came in contact with Ram Vriksh during the latters visit to Ludhiana a few years ago, police said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58fef3817be9e0420db29e95,The jail that sparked many a story,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/bihar/story_92019.jsp,2016-06-19,"I stop at Purnea to meet Girindranath Jha, a journalist, who has returned to his ailing father and begun farming. I read his blogs and Facebook posts on harvesting potatoes, the impact of the westerly wind - pachiya - on fruits, the joy of seeing rice saplings sprout, the significance of green fields and running rivers, all intermingled with his own fiction and research on the writings of Phaniswarnath Renu, one of the greatest modern socialist writers from Bihar. We decide to start by visiting the Purnea Jail. My father had been a political prisoner there as a 25-year-old in 1957 with the Maharaja of Vizianagram Vijay Gajapati Raju, Loknath Joshi, Kalikaprasad Singh, Sarju Mishra and about 95 other socialist leaders. They were all part of a pan-Indian movement to remove English from official use. My father used to describe the room where 65 prisoners were jailed with one open toilet between them, the mess, the courtyard where they did yoga, the tree that had thousands of bats hanging from it... As we drove to the jail we stopped at the Indubhushan library, started by the father of Satinath Bhaduri, a socialist writer who wrote the great novels Jagori and Dhorai Charit Manas about India's freedom struggle against the British. Professor Partha Chatterjee, whose writing and teaching have helped to decolonise the humanities, was informed by the subaltern characters in Dhorai Charit Manas in writing The Politics of the Governed. The writer (top) in front of the Purnea central jail where her father was a political prisoner in 1957. Pictures by Sudhanshu Bhaduri was born in Purnea and went to jail in Bhagalpur, Giri reminiscences, and Renu was born in a village in Araria and went to jail in Purnea. Bhaduri was Renu's guru. Both were influenced by the Indian National Congress and later the Congress Socialist Party. The characters in Jagori and Dhorai Charit Manas describe the jail in Purnea as does Renu. We reach the jail and meet the kind-hearted jailor, who does not let us inside the actual prison, but we are allowed to peep in from the outside and visit the room with an open toilet that my father occupied. It is disused. The jail is clean, there is a garden and the prisoners are allowed to pursue cultural activities. Indians have done better than the British in the treatment of prisoners. Bihar has gone one step ahead. National Crime Records Bureau data reveal that Chhattisgarh and the Union territories are arresting increasing number of people, whereas the numbers of those arrested in Bihar are going down. I had read recently that Sweden has closed down its prisons because they do not have anyone to arrest. They have chosen to use the funds to invest in people instead. Perhaps, the socialist government in Bihar is going to follow its socialist partner's path. Purnea was the first district to be created by the British in 1771, one of the worst exploited and thus the worst hit by the Bengal Famine. Timber contracts to those in service of the British Raj ended up turning this area, once called Puran Aranya (Total Forest), into a swamp, that generated one of the cruellest cholera outbreaks in human history. As a result, Purnea became the centre of resistance and intellectual ferment. Its young men and women were delegates to the Indian National Congress, attended rallies, spun the charka, went to jail, wrote pamphlets and books. Purnea became a literary centre. Today it is one of the big education centres of north Bihar. The disused rooms in the jail could easily be turned into a museum on the role that Purnea played in India's independence struggle. It would be a striking way to remind the next generation of their hard won independence. Over lunch at Sanjha Chullah it is evident that Giri will carry on the legacy of Purnea's literati. Like Renu his writings are both reportage and fiction. His newest book, Ishq me Maatisona, has been published by Rajkamal. I then go to Gulabh Bagh, one of the most notorious red-light areas in north Bihar, situated near the largest grain depot in eastern India and on a highway. Truckers used to routinely buy little girls here and the traffickers would provide a constant supply of poor, low caste children from nearby villages. To my pleasant surprise, I heard from a young girl, Roshanara, on her way back from school, that a female police officer, Kim Sharma, has arrested many of the kingpins and things were much better here. Roshanara adds, ""One more push and investment in the girls and women here could make this a non-red light area."" I leave, thinking that perhaps, we are too hasty in saying nothing has been achieved in 60 years. We have forgotten what once was. The legacy of zamindari and the Raj are vanishing. Two days ago, women won more than half the seats in the Purnea municipality.

591f15787be9e025a5d4a7ac,Pulses shortage: Set up procurement mechanism,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/554708/pulses-shortage-set-up-procurement.html,2016-06-27,"Pulses shortage: Set up procurement mechanismSagar Kulkarni, Jun 28, 2016, 23:37 ISTAround July last year, soon after celebrating a year in office, the Narendra Modi government woke up to the steady rise in the prices of pulses. The first year in office was marked with low inflation levels  thanks to the decline in global crude and commodity prices and sluggish domestic demand. But July of 2015 brought with it the rude shock of a steady increase in prices of pulses. As the festive season of September-October approached, arhar or toor was retailing at Rs 200 per kg, forcing the government into action.The first response was to ramp up imports by tapping the usual sources  Canada, Malawi and Myanmar. But global crop failure and non-availability in international markets kept the prices high. This year too, pulses continue to cost dear to the common man who spends about 5% of his food expenditure on his key source of protein in the diet. And, the government has come up with the expected response  increase imports and build up buffer stocks to enable market intervention to cool down prices.A look at the data put out by the government clearly states that India has been dependent on imports to fill in the gap between demand and supply of pulses. The increase in rural wages in the latter part of the past decade had led to a steady increase in demand for pulses. In 2007-08, the demand for pulses was 16.77 million tonnes, while domestic production was 14.76 mt. Over the years, the domestic production stagnated at around 18 mt and the demand this year has been pegged at 24 mt.A study by Assocham in November last year has pegged pulses imports at 10.1 mt for 2015-16 raising questions whether India would need to depend on buying from global markets perpetually to meet its domestic needs of the protein source. The Indian Institute of Pulses Research has forecast a demand of 39 mt of pulses by 2050.According to a Crisil study, this would require production of pulses to grow at an annual rate of 2.2%, compared with the 0.9% growth witnessed in the last decade.The need of the hour is to dramatically increase domestic production to meet the growing demands for pulses. It needs a mix of policy and technological interventions to bridge the demand-supply gap. The Economic Survey 2015-16 had pointed out that most of the land dedicated to growing pulses in each state was unirrigated  thus leaving the output at the mercy of the rain god. It had made a strong pitch for increasing production of pulses on irrigated land to meet the high and growing demand.The recent spike in prices of pulses has sent the government scurrying to Africa and Myanmar once again  this time round exploring the possibility of contract farming in foreign nations to meet the domestic demands. Law and order issues in some African nations and high transportation costs have been cited as key hurdlesin previous attempts to explore land leasing options.The earlier attempts were made by the private sector and now India is holding government-to-government talks to explore avenues to ensure stability in supply of pulses. Top Central officials visited Mozambique and Myanmar last fortnight and are expected to present their reports to the government. This comes even as the government is pushing farmers to grow more pulses. But what ails the pulses sector? And why has India been unable to keep pace with the growing demand.The Green Revolution began in India in the early 1960s and within a decade the food grain production was on a steady increase. In 1970-71, total food grain production was 108.43 mt of which rice and wheat amounted to 42.22 mt and 23.83 mt, respectively. Production of pulses was 11.82 mt. By 2006-07, the total food grain production had doubled to 217.28 mt. While rice production zoomed to 93.35 mt and wheat to 75.81 mt, the growth is pulses amounted to 14.20 mt.Low yieldIn the absence of technological breakthrough, farmers were saddled with low yield seed varieties that help them produce about 700 kg of pulses per hectare, against the global average of 800 kg per hectare. Some states do much better than the all-India average, but even the key pulse producing state of Madhya Pradesh has yields (938 kg/ha) barely three-fifths that of Chinas (1550 kg/ha). This also makes a case for examining the viability of genetically modified variety to increase yields.Pulses are also high risk-prone crops as most of the production takes place in rainfed areas. Only 16% of pulses coverage is through irrigation thus exposing the farm output to monsoon shocks. Moreover, 70% pulses production comes from four states  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Barring Rajasthan, the rest three states have received deficient monsoon for the past four years thus affecting the production of pulses.In June, the Centre increased sharply the minimum support price (MSP) for pulses. But farmers were not enthused by the increase as wholesale prices are almost double the MSP.There are also demands for increasing the MSP to the level of the rates at which government imports pulses. They also recall the glut in chickpea production three years back when prices had fallen below the MSP. The government had failed to intervene and procure at the support price.But the biggest intervention from the government could be in the form of setting up a procurement mechanism to buy pulses from farmers at it does in case of wheat and paddy. The government procures between 30 and 40% of wheat and paddy produced in the country. But in the case of pulses, procurement is almost negligible.The Shanta Kumar Committee on Restructuring Food Corporation of India had suggested better price support operations for pulses to encourage farmers to take up cultivation on a large scale. The government needs to act on this."

58fedab47be9e0420db2867b,Rainfall low but no crop worry yet,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160630/jsp/nation/story_94049.jsp,2016-06-30,"Crop weather specialist Nabansu Chattopadhyay isn't worried yet by the multiple patches of dark red on a map of India on his computer displaying rainfall deficit zones since the start of the 2016 monsoon. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has documented 12 per cent lower than expected normal rainfall across the country between June 1 and June 29, but 36 per cent of India's land area has received deficient or scanty rainfall. While the monsoon's onset was delayed in many parts of India, weather scientists say the delayed advance is not expected to have any significant impact on the amount of rainfall. Crop performance largely hinges on the rainfall during July and August, they add. ""Sowing activities are proceeding as expected in several places despite the rain deficit,"" said Chattopadhyay, a senior agrometeorologist at the IMD Pune, who is among scientists tracking the monsoon's progress and providing guidance to farm activities. ""Rice transplantation has already started in Kerala, coastal Karnataka, and Konkan and Goa and rice seedlings are waiting in nurseries for transplantation in Odisha, Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, among other rice-growing areas,"" he said. Scientists say there is nothing in the behaviour of the monsoon thus far to indicate any deviation from the IMD's long-range forecast that India would receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall during the four-month season from June to September. India's kharif crops such as rice, maize, pigeonpea, sugarcane and groundnut, among others, rely significantly on monsoon rains. ""But a 12 per cent rainfall deficit during June is no cause for any alarm,"" said Vadlamudi U.M. Rao, the president of the Association of Agrometeorologists. ""Even some amount of weak rain during June helps in preparing land and soil, but July and August are crucial for most crops."" Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch have experienced the largest rainfall deficits during June, with Gujarat receiving 80 per cent lower than normal rainfall and Saurashtra and Kutch receiving 72 per cent lower than normal rainfall. ""There is still time, but only a week or two - after that we'll have to think about alternative crops for this region,"" said Vyas Pande, professor and head of agrometeorology at Anand Agricultural University. ""Farmers can wait at the most until mid-July - beyond that they could face the risk of reduced yields,"" he said, referring to cotton and groundnut, the main kharif crops cultivated in the state. The IMD, in its long-range forecast issued earlier this year, had predicted that rainfall would be above normal during July (107 per cent of long-period average) and August (104 per cent of the long-period average.) #Some parts of eastern India, including the Gangetic region of Bengal and Bihar, have experienced subdued rainfall activity soon after the monsoon advanced there between June 17 and 19. Meteorologists have attributed this to changes in wind patterns that drove moisture to southern Odisha and coastal Andhra Pradesh. Gangetic Bengal has a current rainfall deficit of 28 per cent, while Bihar's rainfall is 17 per cent below the expected amount over the past four weeks. ""Computer forecasts predict rainfall will pick up in the coming two weeks,"" said P. Chandra Sekhara Rao, a senior meteorologist at the IMD. ""After the onset, the rains don't fall every day, there are break periods. Moreover, we're still in the aftermath of an El Nino that is just going away,"" he said, referring to subtle changes in the Pacific sea surface temperatures that have in the past been linked to poor monsoon rainfall."

Telegraph picture Three young men from Patna have launched a start-up that offers better rates than regular middlemen to farmers for their produce. Farmanze, the company started three months ago by IIM-Lucknow alumnus Sumit Kumar (26), Banaras Hindu University alumnus Ankit Chandra (24), and chartered accountant Vineet Agrawal (26), has tied up with more than 500 farmers in nine districts: Patna, Ara, Gaya, Buxar, Nawada, Jehanabad, Lakhisarai, Begusarai and Sasaram. The company buys the farmers' produce and supplies it to 15 supermarkets including 9 to 9 and S Mart, 40 grocery stores and a few restaurants in Patna. ""There are four to five middlemen involved from the farm to the market,"" said Ankit. ""The Nawada farmers with whom we tied up first for marketing their sonachura rice were getting Rs 25 to 27 for per kg of rice but we gave them Rs 35 to 38. We sold the rice at Rs 45 per kg in the market, and kept the surplus. We also take care of cleaning, packaging and transportation (of the produce)."" He said a farmer's earning from an acre's produce has gone up from around Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000. ""Farmanze initially tied up with 15 farmers of Warsaliganj of Nawada district and another 24 farmers from Sasaram district,"" said Sumit. ""At Sasaram, we found middleman had exploited farmers to a great extent. There were many who wanted to give up the farming of the Sasaram katarni rice as it was not giving them much profit. The farmers were selling the rice at Rs 18 per kg but from us they get Rs 25 per kg. The (regular) middleman misguides the farmers by saying that their produce is not up to the mark. Farmers are thus in a way forced to sell their produce at a low cost by middlemen."" It was not easy for Farmanze to gain the trust of the farmers, who initially were weary of another bunch of middlemen. ""At every village, we make it a point to go with a known person of that village who can help us break the ice with the farmers,"" said Vineet. Ankit added: ""It is only because of our transparency that we have been able to collaborate with more than 500 farmers in just three months."" Farmers who have tied up with Farmanze seemed happy. Gopal Kumar, from Lai village around 40km southwest of Patna, said rice for which he got Rs 16 to Rs 17 per kg, he now receives Rs 24 per kg. ""Fifteen people from our village have collaborated with the company,"" said Gopal. ""We are very happy as our profit margin has increased."" Pankaj Kumar, from Usri around 100km southeast of Patna, said the farmers from his village were not getting sellers for sonachura rice for the last two years. ""We could sell the rice only at Rs 25 to Rs 28 per kg but after collaborating with Farmanze, we got Rs 34 per kg for the same variety,"" Pankaj said."

In comparison, so far in the June, monsoon was 12% below the long-period average. Investors were enthused by IMD's announcement that rains had covered almost the whole of India, which could give a fillip to sowing of rice and pulses. In the two previous years, sowing had suffered due to below-average monsoon.In Thursday's session, some stocks also got a boost from the government's decision to implement seventh pay commission recommendations. Stocks of auto companies were in the limelight with Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Maruti and Hero MotoCorp among the gainers. Market players feel the extra money that government employees will get after pay commission proposals are implemented could enhance demand for two-wheelers and passenger cars.According to Sahaj Agrawal, deputy VP, derivatives research, Kotak Securities, Indian indices outperformed their global peers as downsides to the Indian market remained limited and there was broad-based participation as buying emerged at lower levels of the index. ""We continue to remain positive on the broader markets and expect (nifty levels of) 8375/8550 in the near term. At present we do not see any significant downside risk in the index,"" Agrawal said.In other markets, the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts have been showing resilience from day one and have been trading at levels higher that last Friday's close at 7.50%. In contrast, the rupee is still below the 67.50 per dollar mark, which closed its Thursday session at 67.69 and is still some way from its pre-Brexit close at 67.25."
58f495baa3d24b68099aef5d,Can the Aam Aadmi Party win Punjab?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Can-the-Aam-Aadmi-Party-win-Punjab/article14468549.ece,2016-07-02,"Pre-monsoon rains bring some relief in the June heat as farmers sow paddy in the fields. The fields gradually give way to the bustling, noisy Sirhindi gate in Malerkotla. The only Muslim-majority town in Punjab, which remained untouched by violence even during the dark days of Partition, convulsed in anger on the night of June 24 after torn pages of the Koran were recovered outside a cemetery. Vehicles were torched and a few people, including local policemen, were injured. Elsewhere in Punjab, pages from the Bhagwad Gita were found strewn on the street in Ludhiana in November last year; a month prior to it, the Guru Granth Sahib was mutilated in many towns of the State.Taheed Mohammad, a fruit-and-vegetable vendor in Malerkotla, lays the blame squarely on politicians for such mischievous acts intended at diverting attention from the real issues ahead of the Assembly elections in the State some months from now. Im not going to vote this time. Its a sheer waste of time and effort. They [political parties] are all the same. After grabbing power, they are least bothered about our problems, says Mr. Mohammad, in a rush to sell his wares so that he could be home in time to break his roza (fast).Many in the Malerkotla market share Mr. Mohammads cynicism, of the sameness of Akali and Congress rule. So, it is not without reason that there is guarded optimism about the new party on the block, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which made a spectacular debut in the State by grabbing four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 general election. As it bids to make a winning debut in the Punjab Assembly next, the AAP is making a lot of noise here. Posters of a recent CVoter survey predicting an AAP victory are plastered all over town in Malerkotla. We want better roads, regular water supply and jobs for youth, and if AAP assures us of these, we might consider supporting it, says Mohammad Shamshad Hazi, a local barber across the street, as customers waiting in line for a snip nod in agreement.The third playerAs battle lines get drawn in Punjab between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine and the Opposition Congress for the 117 Assembly seats in early 2017, theres a third player on the horizon seeking to tap into bipolar anti-incumbency  the AAP  turning it into a three-way contest.The ruling Akali-BJP government, in power for over nine years, is battling a deep agrarian crisis, which has led to indebtedness experts peg at roughly Rs.60,000 crore, with 20 farmers committing suicide every month on average. The rampant drug menace in the State has only added to its bag of woes. With inter-sectarian fights between religious groups to boot, many are taking a dim view of the stranglehold of the Badal family  Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and Deputy-Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal  on the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (that manages all gurdwaras in the State) and State politics at large.The AAP, which is pitching itself as the alternative to the Akalis and the Congress, is preparing its cadre at the grass-roots level harping on anti-incumbency. We present an honest alternative. We will get support from all sections, specially those [aged] between 18 and 40 years which will be the deciding factor in these elections, says Sanjay Singh, in charge of Punjab affairs for AAP, adding that the party will focus on the agrarian debt, the drug mafia, the transport mafia and the sand mafia which he alleges enjoys the patronage of Akali leaders.It is easier said than done, though. Says Pramod Kumar, director of the Institute for Development and Communication, Chandigarh, The ruling party is under pressure this time on these issues but I doubt whether this will work to AAPs advantage as it is unable to address the complexities of Punjab politics. The AAP does not have a historical baggage, but neither does it have historical advantage.For starters, finding a leader with mass appeal across the State and deciding on candidates have proved to be the biggest challenges the party is grappling with. Insiders say Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, State convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur and senior leader H.S. Phoolka are the top chief ministerial contenders but as Dalit writer Desraj Kali points out, the party does not have a local mass leader who can pose a challenge to heavyweights such as Parkash Singh Badal and Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh. In fact, the CVoter survey in April that predicted a win for AAP had Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as its chief ministerial party face for Punjab!The campaign constituenciesThe AAPs campaign is primarily endeavouring to tap into the unrest and anxieties of farmers, youth, women and marginalised sections such as the Dalits. Borrowing a leaf out of its successful Delhi playbook, it is leveraging bands of volunteers in every Assembly constituency at the booth level. In Ludhiana zone alone, the party has 10,000 active volunteers on its rolls. All AAP wings  those for farmers, industry & traders, youth, women, ex-servicemen and Dalits  have team heads in place for outreach activities. Within one week of the Parivar Jodo campaign in February, we had connected with over seven lakh people, claims senior AAP leader Kanwar Sandhu.Dalits account for nearly 32 per cent of the population in Punjab, the highest percentage among States, and it is in the Doaba belt  Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Nawanshahr districts  that they are in large numbers. The district is also known as the NRI hub of Punjab due to the significant numbers migrating overseas. Hence, all parties, including the AAP, are courting the Dalit and NRI vote in this belt. Mr. Sandhu claims the party is getting huge support from this unexpected quarter [NRIs]. The Doaba belt has had support for the Bahujan Samaj Party in recent years, but could rally behind the Congress this time unless the AAP has a clear programme for Dalits, says Gurmeet Singh, a senior Jalandhar-based political commentator.The party is also focussing on women and youth by linking issues such as drug addiction to the two demographics. Drugs and liquor have ruined the lives of my husband and son. I have tried to get my son treated at de-addiction centres, but all efforts failed. Its the [drug] supply chain that has to be cut. No NGO has approached us, but an AAP volunteer of the village made a commitment to me to help out, says Baldish Kaur of Diwali village in Jalandhar. With the youth constituting more than 30 per cent of the States population, Mr. Kejriwal, the partys national convenor, will release a Youth Manifesto for the Punjab polls in Amritsar on July 3. But manifesto apart, there is a lot of work ahead if one goes by what Vineet Bajaj, a BTech final-year student of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, has to say: I dont think AAP will be able to make a huge difference in Punjab as they are not performing well in Delhi. However, people are fed up of Akali-BJP rule, while the Congress is marred by infighting. So AAP has the chance to grab a few seats.The agrarian crisis has given the AAP the opportunity to tap into farmer resentment. In Dhudike village of Moga district, consistently lower prices for the produce against rising prices of farm inputs have pushed farmers into a debt trap. We have been suffering losses year after year but the government hardly pays adequate compensation. Last year in April, my wheat crop failed due to unseasonal rains and while I was lucky that my rice variety fetched a decent return during the last kharif season, many farmers in the neighbouring villages suffered huge losses as prices of basmati rice crashed, says Nirbhay Singh, who owns 14 acres and has mortgaged three acres with Rs.20 lakh still to be repaid to local moneylenders and a bank. Mr. Singh feels that a new government at the helm may just be what it takes for his fortunes to change  a sentiment shared by fellow farmer Balwinder Singh, though he hints that he is still undecided between the AAP and Congress.The challengers challengesThe AAPs first list of candidates will be out in mid-July or July-end, followed by lists every fortnight. The campaign will go full steam in October. Our message to the voter is that you have seen them all  they are all the same. Try us this time, says Mr. Sandhu.But the message has been foreshadowed by mutiny in the AAP ranks. Two of its MPs, Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa, had their primary party membership suspended in August last year after raising their voice against what they termed as Mr. Kejriwals autocratic style of functioning.If AAP plays its cards well, it still has a chance. But if people of dubious character from other parties are enrolled, it leads to the perception that AAP is not a party with a difference... and this is exactly what is happening, says Dr. Gandhi, adding, The Punjab unit of the party is being controlled directly from Delhi like a colony.The way old dedicated volunteers are being marginalised by Delhi and Punjab leaders, many would leave as I did, says Harmeet Kaur, who has now joined the Swaraj Party, the rebel group of AAP floated in May by Manjeet Singh which is backed by the Swaraj Abhiyan of former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.The Punjab Congress unit, which fancies its chances after the long spell of Akali rule, considers the AAP to have already peaked during 2014 parliamentary elections. In 2014, the AAP got the advantage of double-disillusionment in Punjab  the nationwide disillusionment after 10 years of Congress rule at the Centre and a strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Akali-BJP combine in Punjab, says Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh.The AAP peaked then but its progressive decline started soon after. Today the party is not in a position to win even a single seat in Punjab, he claims. The Congress chief is, however, mindful of their appeal: he has scaled back his trademark style of addressing large rallies in favour of an interpersonal outreach through campaigns such as Halke Vich Captain, i.e. Captain in your constituency, for you.The ruling SAD-BJP government too claims the AAP is no threat. Arvind Kejriwals anti-Punjab stance had been exposed in the Sutlej-Yamuna canal issue. He displayed a soft corner for Haryana as he hails from that State, alleges SAD spokesperson and Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema.Whether the AAP peaks in time or not, the dismissive attitude of its opponents will turn into no-holds-barred attacks as the campaign plot thickens in the months leading up to the elections.The AAPs campaign is primarily seeking to tap into the anxieties of farmers, youth, women and marginalised sections such as the DalitsThe Punjab Congress unit, which fancies its chances, considers AAP to have already peaked during the 2014 parliamentary elections.

58fed5f97be9e0420db27ebf,Eyes on July after tardy rains onset,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160704/jsp/nation/story_94704.jsp,2016-07-04,"Nagpur, July 3: A slow-off-the-mark monsoon in a year billed for good rainfall by weather scientists has hobbled crop-sowing, leaving farmers hoping for adequate and uniform rainfall in July. Data released by the Union agriculture ministry on July 1 show that farmers are yet to start planting crops in full swing across large tracts, particularly central India. Officials are blaming the slow start on a delayed southwest monsoon and deficient June rainfall, with the added factor of a cash crunch among farmers after two to three years of drought. Delayed sowing leads not just to delayed arrival of fresh crops but also to lower yields. Crop scientists don't see a problem yet because, in many parts of the country, sowing picks up pace in July and even spills onto the first week of August. But any climatic aberration in July - either low rainfall or extreme weather events - could spell disaster for a vast majority of farmers in rain-dependent regions such as Marathwada, Vidarbha and Bundelkhand. The good news so far is that the India Meteorological Department's weekly forecast on Thursday suggests the southwest monsoon is gathering steam. Officials in Maharashtra blamed the delayed onset of the rains on a change in their pattern of arrival in the state. The southwest monsoon usually strikes Konkan first and then spreads to the state's eastern parts. This time, it entered Maharashtra from the eastern Vidarbha region and spread westward. Konkan and Mumbai witnessed heavy rain over the past week, but Vidarbha, Marathwada and western Maharashtra are yet to receive enough rain to start sowing. Seeds need a certain level of soil moisture for better germination and growth. Premature sowing is fraught with the risk of failure, necessitating re-sowing and thus pushing up the cost of production and labour. Besides, in many states, farmers are cash-strapped after successive years of drought. The banks have yet to restructure the outstanding loans and issue fresh credit for the current season. Maharashtra alone has more than 25 lakh such farmers. On July 1, going by the official data, sowing was way behind schedule in the case of crops such as cotton, pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals. If one considers only the major crops, India's farmers had finished sowing on 279 lakh hectares by this time last year. This season, the figure stands at 216 lakh hectares - a deficit of nearly 23 per cent. ( See chart) ""We have finished sowing but the rain has not been satisfactory,"" Sudam Pawar, a five-acre cotton grower in Wardha district, about 60km from Nagpur, said. ""We expect good rain this week,"" he added, drawing hope from the forecast for the region. The India Meteorological Department has predicted above-average rainfall in July and August, but farmers say it is crucial that the rain is uniform in spread and pattern. The past several years, including the so-called good-monsoon years, have seen extreme rainfall events in these parts. ""It's not just the amount of rain but the number of rainy days and its spatial spread that is important to us,"" said Pawar. India grows cotton on roughly 120 lakh hectares; a third of it in Maharashtra. Friday's ministry data showed that cotton-sowing had crossed barely 30 lakh hectares in the country - half the acreage compared with the corresponding period last year - mainly because of scanty or unsatisfactory rainfall in the cotton belt. Marathwada and Vidarbha, key cotton-growing regions, have faced droughts the past two to three years and, therefore, lower yields. Pulses, whose prices are sky-rocketing across the country owing to shortages caused by successive droughts, too have lagged last year's acreage - less than 20 lakh hectares sown against 22 lakh hectares last year. In the case of oilseeds, the figures are 28.7 lakh hectares this year compared with 54 lakh hectares by this time last year - lower by 47 per cent. Sowing is likely to speed up once the monsoon gathers steam in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, officials say. Coarse cereals like jowar, bajra and millets, grown mostly in the drier regions, have been planted across 37 lakh hectares, lower than the nearly 44 lakh hectares planted in the same period last year. The area under rice, the main kharifcrop, stands close to 48 lakh hectares, marginally higher than last year, thanks to good rainfall in Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The seasonal area under rice is 393 lakh hectares. Sugarcane too has a marginally higher acreage this year but officials attribute it to good rainfall in western Uttar Pradesh, where most of the crop is planted around this time. Sugarcane acreage in water-stressed regions like Marathwada and north Karnataka, they fear, would drop this year."

We, four friends, are heading towards the western Uttar Pradesh town, about 60 kms from the capital, as food explorers.Meerut has an impressive resume. We know it was the raging heart of the great 1857 revolt that shook British raj. The small town was once the centre of a multi-million rupee Hindi pulp fiction industry and still manufactures the finest cricket bats in the country. But many may not know that Meerut is a gastronomic delight too.Our first stop is the famous Jain Ki Shikanji shop at Modinagar. There are dozens of shikanji sellers in this town once famous for Modi suiting and shirtings. But Jains small cubicle-size shop, located by the police station, is the real McCoy. Shikanji was created to beat the summer heat. And at Jains, you know how. The drinks preparation is a short seven-step to heaven. First, a measured portion of sugar syrup is poured into a glass; followed by a strong squeeze of lemon.The glass is stuffed with crushed ice. Then a bottle of soda is emptied over it. This is followed by a spoonful of the special shikanji masala. The glass is then capped and shaken. Your drink is ready. Unlike Coke, the ingredients is no state secret. You can buy them separately too.The drink fortifies us for the lunch ahead. Asking passers by every 50 metres, we arrive at Papa Ji Daal Wale (sic), a dhaba near the old Baghpat More bus stand. Daal is to any meal what Laxman is to Ramayan: vital and self-effacing. At Papaji, it commands centre stage. The shop, owned by a genial sardarji, specialises in urad-chane ki daal which is slow cooked over low fire overnight. We want to pack some for dinner.But sardarji hasnt come in yet and without him, the staff refuses to serve. We leave with a heavy, hungry heart.Delhi Durbar, next to Imliyan Masjid, is on Hapur Road. Far more accommodating, they usher us into the new air-conditioned section where a young man is feeding what looks like fruit-cream to a woman in burqa. Our order is simple: chicken kali mirch and tandoori roti. One of us orders a chicken biryani too. The biryani is a crushing disappointment, it feels more like chicken in fried rice minus the finesse. But the chicken kali mirch is just right; its thick curry blended in cashew and cream. Flavour and taste blend to create a dish that is pure bliss. It is worth a hundred trips from Delhi. Anytime.Thats the unanimous view.On the way back, we pick up the dal. But before that we stumble upon the culinary treasure of the day. We spot a hotel whose name reminds me of an old Bollywood song. Its called, Char Yaar, and it was set up in 1950. Its basically a sweet shop that specialises in halwa-parantha. The deep-friend paranthas are the size of a large pizza and its crisp and flaky, much like a patty. The halwa, topped with cherries, is equally oily. You can say, its a dish to die for.Rather literally. But as food explorers, this is our discovery of the day. We taste some and pack the rest. It has been a week since that afternoon but the taste of the chicken kali mirch lingers on."
58fed8e67be9e0420db2838e,Repeat school meal plunder by jumbos,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160706/jsp/siliguri/story_95067.jsp,2016-07-06,"HIDE THE RICE, JUMBOS HERE Jalpaiguri, July 5: A Jalpaiguri schools midday meal rice has been polished off six times since May, not by thieves, but elephants. Bichabhanga Primary School, on the fringes of Gorumara National Park, now does not know where to hide the rice. Last night, the rice meant for 90 students was kept on the top of a watchtower as the small school kitchen had been broken into by a herd of elephants. This morning, the watchtower was found damaged and the rice eaten. The wild elephants are visiting the school at regular intervals. Since the first week of June, the elephants have come here at least six times. Every time, the animals have damaged walls of the school and furniture to eat the rice in the school, Khurshed Alam, a schoolteacher said. Even the small kitchen we had was damaged by the animals. It seems the school has become a place for the elephants to get fodder. As they are aware that rice is being kept here, they are coming here again and again. We dont know how the rice can be saved from the wild elephants, the teacher said. Interestingly, it was not only the school building that the elephants were searching for food. After repeated incidents last month when the mid-day meal rice was consumed by the herd, we decided to keep the sacks at a watch tower close to the school. Yesterday night, the elephants came and this time, they damaged the watchtower and devoured the rice. We have approached the sub-divisional administration in Malbazar to help us as we have no idea where we should keep the rice, Alam said. Forest officials, when asked about such repeated visits of wild elephants, said it was usual for jumbos to do this. The elephants have understood that easy fodder is available in the school. That is why they are visiting the site again and again. They can smell rice easily and it would not help even if the rice is concealed somewhere, a senior forester said. The animals can be prevented from visiting the school if the rice is not kept there. There are cases when it has been found that after foraging for fodder in a known area for two-three days, if the elephants do not get it there, they leave that site and go to other places. In the Dooars, elephant attacks on schools on the fringes of forests in blocks such as Metelli and Nagrakata are common. We have reports from different schools, mostly primary schools, that elephant herds are damaging the buildings and taking away rice kept there. Some schools had tried to store the rice by burying the sacks under the floor but even that did not help, J. Tanti, the SDO of Malbazar, said. We will soon speak to forest officials on the issue."

Sure, biryani is an integral part of Eid celebrations, but there's more to the festival, too...the Eidi. As part of celebrations, everyone looks forward to receiving gifts from their elders. Here are some of the city peeps' plans for, and favourite memories of Eid...Eid is very special for the reason that it brings the entire family together for the month of Ramadan. My entire family gets together for Eid. They start preparations for the meal the previous night itself and mostly the biryani is ready as early as 3am. Women on the previous night will also spend time putting mehendi for each other. After the Eid prayer at 10am, we will start distributing biryani to our friends, needy people and then sit together for lunch. It is mostly kurtas for men and saris with lot of chamki work for ladies. Since my sister owns a designing unit in my native Salem, all the saris, ghagra designing work is done by her. My favourite memory is when I got my mom a gold bangle with my first salary and a nice linen shirt for my dad. It was way back, but seeing them wear on Eid day was the best.Eid is always a special festival, because it is the one occasion that brings us all together back home, no matter where we are. Of course, I fasted during the Holy Month of Ramadan like every year. This year, too, I will be spending Eid at home with family and close friends. Apart from a grand lunch at home, I will also be sending biryani to a few friends as well as distributing them in a few slums. My most memorable Eidi was two years ago, when a 10-year-old girl, Aparajitha Ramesh, from Dubai, paid me a surprise visit. She apparently was quite impressed with my work, which she learnt about after watching a few of my videos. She, too, wanted to become an activist. She came bearing gifts, too  chocolates  and it really was the best gift. I offered her biryani in return, but she was vegetarian, so, she couldn't eat it. She told me she would rather have a sapling to take back home instead. This incident is something that constantly keeps me inspired.Every year, my mother arranges for biryani to be prepared for all our houses. So, the cook makes it for her place, mine, my sister's and my brother's houses. My sister has got me new clothes, which I intend to wear today. This year, I fasted for all the 30 days of the Holy Month and visited the mosque with my niece, too. For celebrations this year, I've invited a lot of friends home. Most of my friends are non-Muslims and some are even Brahmins, so there will be special vegetarian biryani. We will also be making sweets like kesaris and laddoos, vadais and a chicken shorba. So, the feast is grand. Every year, we get Eidi from my brother Rahman, and it is always special because at no other time does he indulge us with money like this. Every year, my mother buys all of us clothes, and that has become a tradition now.On Eid, I try my level best not to work, but invariably I end up going to the studio. The day starts with my regular prayers. Everybody, for some reason, assumes that this is the day of the biryani, but after fasting for over a month, it is difficult to have a lot of biryani. You are so used to a certain diet. I generally go to my hometown Trichy for Eid and I haven't been able to do that for the last two years. I miss doing that. Eidi for our family is a lot about charity. So, we are generally busy doing that.I will be wearing a beautiful chudidhar kurta in yellow and my dupatta will be grand. I think no Indian festival is complete without good food, so yes, we will have an elaborate lunch. So it is going to be a lot of biryani and chicken. Eidi is a lot about charity, and we do a lot for it as part of my trust. We contribute towards children's education. Eidi is also about good-luck money. I still get my Eidi and also give it to the youngsters in the family. I believe that Ramzan is not just about fasting but it is also about restraint. There is no point of fasting if you are going to be angry and yelling at everyone. It is also about introspection.This Eid is going to be about new clothes, mutton biryani and lots of sweets. My mother generally prepares the meal, but since she is not well, I will take over the kitchen. We have ordered the biryani and I will making semiya and rice payasam. I am the last in the house, so when I was young, I used to get all the Eidi. Right now, my niece's son is the youngest, so he collects all the money."

58fed91c7be9e0420db283f2, journalist Sydney Schanberg dead,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160710/jsp/foreign/story_95846.jsp,2016-07-10,"(From left) New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg with Dith Pran in Cambodia in August 1973; Actor Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran and actor Sam Waterston as Schanberg in Roland Joffes Killing FieldsJuly 9: Sydney H. Schanberg, a correspondent for The New York Times who won a Pulitzer Prize for covering Cambodia's fall to the Khmer Rouge in 1975 and inspired the film The Killing Fields with the story of his Cambodian colleague's survival during the genocide of millions, died today in Poughkeepsie, New York. He was 82. His death was confirmed by Charles Kaiser, a friend and former Times reporter, who said Schanberg had a heart attack on Tuesday. A restive, intense, Harvard-educated newspaperman with bulldog tenacity, Schanberg was a nearly ideal foreign correspondent: a risk-taking adventurer who distrusted officials, relied on himself in a war zone and wrote vividly of political and military tyrants and the suffering and death of their victims with the passion of an eyewitness to history. In the spring of 1975, as Pol Pot's Communist guerrillas closed in on the capital, Phnom Penh, after five years of civil war in Cambodia, Schanberg and his assistant, Dith Pran, refused to heed directives from Times editors in New York to evacuate the city and remained behind as nearly all western reporters, diplomats and senior officials of Cambodia's American-backed Lon Nol government fled for their lives. ""Our decision to stay,"" Schanberg wrote later, ""was founded on our belief - perhaps, looking back, it was more a devout wish or hope - that when the Khmer Rouge won their victory, they would have what they wanted and would end the terrorism and brutal behaviour we had written so often about."" But when the guerrillas rolled in, after a brief period of calm, there was widespread shooting, looting and many executions. Schanberg and Dith were seized and threatened with death. ""Most of the soldiers are teenagers,"" Schanberg noted in his last dispatch. ""They are universally grim, robotlike, brutal. Weapons drip from them like fruit from trees - grenades, pistols, rifles, rockets."" Dith's pleas saved Schanberg, and the two journalists took refuge in the French embassy compound, a vestige of colonial rule. Later, Dith and other Cambodians were expelled from the compound and forced to join an exodus of civilians into the countryside. It was the beginning of a monstrous social experiment: the expulsion of millions from cities and the suppression of educated classes to recast Cambodia as an agrarian utopia. The failed experiment over the next four years cost the lives of two million people to starvation, disease, slave-labour brutality and murder. Two weeks after his capture, Schanberg and other foreigners were evacuated by truck to Thailand, where he filed the first account of the fall and emptying of Phnom Penh. He told of massacres and fires, of streets and roads littered with bodies, of forced marches that turned the city overnight into a graveyard. ""Two million people suddenly moved out of the city in stunned silence - walking, bicycling, pushing cars that had run out of fuel, covering the roads like a human carpet,"" he wrote. ""A once-throbbing city became an echo chamber of silent streets lined with abandoned cars and gaping, empty shops. Streetlights burned eerily for a population that was no longer there."" Schanberg returned to New York. Overwhelmed with guilt over having to leave Dith behind, he asked for time off to write about his experiences, to help Dith's refugee wife and four children establish a new life in San Francisco and to begin the seemingly hopeless task of finding his friend. He was showered with awards, including the Pulitzer, which he said he shared with Dith. He also became a metropolitan editor and columnist at The Times. For years there was no news of Dith, who had disguised his educated background and survived beatings, backbreaking labour and a diet of insects, rodents and as little as a tablespoon of rice a day. In 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and replaced Pol Pot with a client regime. Dith escaped over the border with Thailand in 1979 and was soon reunited with Schanberg. After moving Dith and his family to New York and helping him obtain a job as a photographer at The Times, Schanberg wrote The Death and Life of Dith Pran, a 1980 cover article for The New York Times Magazine, which was later published as a book. The story became the basis for Roland Joffe's 1984 movie, The Killing Fields, starring Sam Waterston as Schanberg and Haing S. Ngor as Dith. Ngor, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor, was a physician who had also survived the Cambodian holocaust. The film was widely praised. "" The Killing Fields emerges as an emotionally charged vision of hell on earth, a jolting reminder of the wanton destruction of a gentle people by another of history's madmen,"" Kathleen Carroll wrote in The Daily News. But Vincent Canby of The Times called it ""diffuse and wandering"", adding, ""Something vital is missing, and that's the emotional intensity of Schanberg's first-person prose."" Sydney Hillel Schanberg was born in Clinton, Massachusetts. NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"
58feffec7be9e0420db2b1ea,Strait is the gate,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160713/jsp/opinion/story_96266.jsp,2016-07-13,"If the prime minister, Narendra Modi, had been aware of a closely held secret of how the nuclear deal with the United States of America came about, he may not have persisted in pushing for India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group at this stage. Such a push has triggered an avoidable domestic controversy and generated uncertainties abroad about India's standing in the world. If Rajnath Singh, said to be the most superstitious of Modi's cabinet colleagues, had been told by at least one of his numerous astrologers that any year ending in 6 is a bad one for India for taking new diplomatic initiatives in, he would have persuaded the external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, to somehow prevail upon the prime minister not to stake too much on NSG membership this year. If S. Jaishankar, who has done more than most diplomats to end India's long nuclear winter, had time off his virtually round-the-clock foreign secretary's schedule to reflect in hindsight on some of the impressive landmarks of his career, he may have resisted the push to go for NSG membership now mostly by people with political clout but with little understanding of strategic issues. The India-US nuclear deal was exclusively a George W. Bush initiative that few others in the US president's administration or in the American political establishment of that time wanted. The state department was unenthusiastic about it. There was little support, in the beginning, in either chamber of US Congress for the deal. A rare exception was Condoleezza Rice, who had left her White House job as national security adviser shortly before the deal was announced in July, 2005, to become secretary of state. She went along with Bush on the deal with India. Some say Bush went along with Rice on the offer to end New Delhi's nuclear isolation. But even for the US president and his secretary of state 11 years ago, the nuclear deal, as originally conceived, was a way to freeze, roll back and eventually eliminate India's nuclear programme. In return, India would be offered trade in nuclear weapons and technology and access to nuclear power to meet the country's energy shortages which were slowing down economic growth. The first draft of the nuclear agreement, handed to Shyam Saran, then the foreign secretary, by the the under secretary of state for political affairs at that time, Nicholas Burns, in London a few weeks after the announcement of the deal envisaged a formal commitment by India that it would not test nuclear weapons any more. The restrictive clauses in that draft were exclusively reported by this newspaper within days after the draft was exchanged in London, causing furore in Parliament and outside. When Manmohan Singh was in Washington again, two Indian diplomats were asked to conduct a survey on the support in the US Senate for the deal. Such support was crucial for its passage on Capitol Hill. The survey revealed that only 20 of the Senate's 100 members were supporting their president's nuclear deal with India. For New Delhi's negotiators, the most alarming aspect of the survey was that Hillary Clinton, who then headed the Senate India Caucus, was one of the senators who were opposed to the deal. The story of how Clinton was converted into being a supporter of the deal by Indians and Indian Americans working together cannot be revealed because such an exposure is fraught with the risk of a defamation suit. The full story could still somewhat damage Clinton's current bid to return to the White House as its tenant after 16 years. It took full two years of difficult and complex negotiations for New Delhi and Washington to finalize the text of a bilateral agreement that would create the structure of the nuclear deal. Even so, when the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, addressed a press conference on July 27, 2007, along with the foreign secretary and the chairman of the atomic energy commission, his opening words were, ""We are happy to inform you that the governments of India and the United States of America have finalized the text of the bilateral agreement for cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy."" That was it. The nuclear deal with the US was for ""cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy"", notwithstanding the spin for domestic opinion within India that the US had recognized India as a nuclear weapons State. In its pursuit of NSG membership, the current political dispensation in New Delhi forgot that India had not moved an inch beyond that position. Events in Seoul last month needlessly resurrected a reality, forgotten - or perhaps overlooked since the Indo-US nuclear deal - that India is not a de jure nuclear weapons State, that the world expects New Delhi to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and conform to the comprehensive test ban treaty even if it refuses to sign the latter. Often in the past, when India's de jure status within the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture has been brought up, both the United Progressive Alliance government and the current National Democratic Alliance have skirted the issue. The NSG's decision to shut its doors on India proves the common reality that neither the UPA nor the NDA wants to confront: macho declarations that India is a nuclear weapons State and that it is not looking for any certificate to that effect from anyone are mere bravado. If successive political dispensations in New Delhi actually believe that such chest-thumping will change ground realities, they ought not have to go to NSG or anywhere else to validate India's nuclear status or to seek the approval of the global consensual non-proliferation architecture. The verdict in Seoul was that India cannot have the cake and eat it too. There is a way out, though. That way out was not chosen because Modi is unaware of a crucial secret of how the Indo-US nuclear deal came about. On July 18, 2005, after extensive consultations between Indian and American diplomats over the joint statement in Washington by Manmohan Singh and Bush, a final draft was given to the Indian side by the Americans. A very senior Indian diplomat then quietly changed a word in the final draft in the second paragraph relating to ""India's plans to develop its civilian nuclear energy programme"". Without telling the US side, he changed the prescription relating to India ""signing and adhering to the Additional Protocol"" of the International Atomic Energy Agency. When the joint statement was approved by Bush and Singh and released, India's requirement became ""signing and adhering to an Additional Protocol"" because this perspicacious diplomat replaced the word ""the"" with ""an"". The American side did not notice the change, but they were now committed to the new formulation. Without that change, India would have been in the same situation with the IAEA on the nuclear deal as it finds itself today in the NSG. With the new joint commitment in hand, when the time came in 2009 to finalize matters with the IAEA, India insisted that it would not sign ""the"" additional protocol, which applied to signatories of the NPT that could not legally possess nuclear weapons or weapons materials under international treaty obligations. India signed ""an"" additional protocol, which was different from the NPT model. It was created to suit New Delhi's special needs. It was because of the uniqueness of India's ""an"" additional protocol that although it was signed in Vienna on May 15, 2009, it took another five years and two months for the IAEA to bring it into force. It is reasonable to assume that Jaishankar knows about this episode. If the perspicacious diplomat who made the change told this columnist about it on the night of July 18, 2005, during celebrations in the Indian camp as Singh triumphally concluded his Washington visit, it is highly unlikely that he would not have told Jaishankar, who was then the joint secretary in charge of the Americas and a key member of the prime minister's delegation. The moral of the story is that there is no straight path into the NSG, and Modi and his team must fashion tactics similar to what India employed in the White House on the nuclear deal. In conclusion, the curse of the years ending in 6 on Indian diplomacy needs to be explained. In 1996, India was routed by Japan and humiliated in its effort to enter the United Nations security council. In 2006, the government in New Delhi nearly fell on account of diplomacy: the effort to operationalize the Indo-US nuclear deal. Ten years hence, in 2016, India lost its bid to join the NSG. Rajnath Singh ought to have been told about this long shadow that falls on Indian diplomacy every 10 years. [email protected]"
58fed7dd7be9e0420db281e8,Professor who inspired 'fat tax',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160721/jsp/nation/story_97930.jsp,2016-07-21,"Muhammed Kabir Thiruvananthapuram, July 20: As Kerala's finance minister Thomas Isaac made headlines by introducing ""fat tax"" on junk food, economist Muhammed Kabir was quietly rejoicing from the shadows, happy that his fight against unhealthy food had begun to bear fruit. It was on an email suggestion from the city-based, retired economics professor that Isaac had incorporated the 14.5 per cent levy in his budget. Kabir is happy Isaac acknowledged his contribution on Facebook but upset that he has taxed the health-friendly rice bran oil, which is ""counterproductive and against the spirit of a system of fat tax"". A pragmatist, Kabir admitted there was a world of difference between practice and preaching and that it would be difficult to stop people from eating unhealthy food unless it became prohibitively expensive. Kabir, who retired as head of the department of economics of Government Women's College, told The Telegraph he had taken up the question of fat tax with Isaac only two days before the budget. ""I'm very happy he understood its importance and implemented it, even though it was a last-minute suggestion."" Two days after the budget, on July 19, Isaac wrote on his Facebook page: ""It was Muhammed Kabir, a college teacher who studied in the Centre for Development Studies, who put forth this demand (to introduce fat tax) in an email."" Isaac was a faculty member at the Centre for Development Studies, a city-based social research institute, when Kabir was a student there. So what made the economist go after pizzas and burgers? ""Concern for public health,"" says Kabir, and attributes it to his PhD guide and economist, late T.N. Krishnan. ""Krishnan's area of interest was public health and it attracted me too. We did a joint paper in 1992 titled 'Social intermediation and health changes: Lessons from Kerala'. That's how I grew interested in public health,"" he said. Kabir was also part of a Dutch-funded study on Kerala's Health Status between 2004 and 2007. The study, conducted in Kannur, Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram, showed that ""lifestyle diseases were on the rise and constituted a major chunk of morbidity rates in Kerala"". ""During my PhD days, I came across literature about how Denmark imposed fat tax and withdrew it within a year,"" Kabir said, adding that Denmark's failure should not discourage Kerala. ""Denmark was unsuccessful because people started smuggling the taxed items from neighbouring Germany and Hungary. That scenario cannot be applied to Kerala,"" he opines. The retired professor conceded there was nothing to directly link obesity to calorie intake, but added it was well known that there was definitely a link between what people chose to eat and their health. He referred to a 2011 study on school students in Kochi. Done by Alice T. Cherian, Sarah S. Cherian and Sobhana Subbiah of the department of paediatrics of city-based Lakeshore hospital, the study on 1,634 students from three schools between the ages of 6 and 15 found that 3 per cent boys and 5.3 per cent girls were obese. About 10.2 per cent boys and 12.1 per cent girls were overweight. The study said instances of obesity and excess weight were found more among the high-income group and was lowest among children of the low-income group. ""The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Upper Income Group in this study is comparable to levels of overweight and obesity in developed countries,"" it said. The study attributed the trend to ""easy access to calorie-rich foods with growing economic prosperity coupled with lack of awareness in parents about childhood obesity and nutritive diets"". ""A UN report had placed India in the list of top 10 countries with obese people,"" Kabir said, explaining how agrarian Kerala, known for its healthy food habits that have deep links with ayurveda, had changed since the Gulf boom in the mid-nineties. ""There is something called demonstration effect. It refers to the idea that people expect or want to buy or have things because they see that other people are able to have them. It happened after the Crusades when Europeans felt an affinity for things eastern,"" said Kabir. ""Same happened to Malayalis who went to Persia, which was what Gulf was popularly referred to as. But what they brought back from places like Dubai was not just the money, but also the culture. ""After 1985, Kerala's economic growth picked up after long stagnation mainly due to the Gulf income. The prosperity also influenced food habits and people moved away from traditional cuisines. ""National Sample Survey Organisation data shows... a fall in the proportion of income spent on cereals and increase in the proportion spent on non-cereals, meat, egg and packed foods. What has happened to Kerala is that this change in consumption patterns has not been in a manner beneficial to people's health."" Wouldn't it be more appropriate to tax porotta and beef than junk food to which exposure is still limited? ""Porotta and red meat are dangerous to health and must be discouraged with more taxes. Hope that happens in the next stage,"" said Kabir. Asked a similar question, Isaac wrote on his FB page: ""It is not yet time to tax porotta and beef which is consumed by common people. Unlike in the West, it is the elite sections which eat the food items that have been brought under tax net. Let the debate go on. Then we can bring more and more unhealthy foods in the net."" On his objection to taxing rice bran oil, Kabir said it was one of the healthiest of edible oils as it had little saturated fat. ""Taxing it would be opposite to the concept of fat tax."" He added: ""Isaac explained at a seminar that it was only for the purpose of adjusting MRP and was not to disincentivise the health alternative."" The minister could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. Asked if he was hopeful that higher taxes would stop people from having junk food, Kabir breaks into a smile and refers to his two-year-old granddaughter. ""She was so thin that doctors advised that she be given meat and other fat-rich foods. ""Now she knows almost every chicken and shwarma outlet on the way from our home to the city. She is so fond of it and there's no point trying to dissuade her."" If family could not be dissuaded, how could the rest of the world be persuaded? Kabir is candid: ""A noted Malayalam poet once wrote a poem on ahimsa. A Gandhian liked it very much and called on the poet to express appreciation. ""But what he saw there shocked him. The poet was biting into a juicy chicken leg. The upset visitor asked him how come he was a non-vegetarian and writing on ahimsa. To this the poet replied that the poem was his philosophy and what the visitor witnessed was his life."" Kabir continued: ""What I mean to say is it will be difficult to deter people unless junk food becomes prohibitively expensive. Tax should be imposed in such a way that demand becomes elastic. That is to say the demand should fall with rising prices. Let's wait and see if the fat tax makes demand for food items elastic. If not, we must even think of increasing it."" He said his suggestion about fat tax was based on two grounds. ""One, the incidence of life-style diseases and, two, the level of obesity in Kerala. ""As per NFHS 2005-06, Kerala is next only to Punjab in terms of obesity. About 17.8 per cent men in Kerala (against 22.2 per cent in Punjab) and 28.1 per cent women (against 29.9 per cent in Punjab) have a BMI of more than 25. The relationship between obesity and life-style diseases, including coronary heart diseases, diabetes and strokes, is known."" It was not just consumption of fat-rich food but sedentary lifestyle that added to the danger, he said. ""A part of the tax so collected may be used to build gymnasiums and other health-improving infrastructure in the rural areas,"" he suggested."

Millions of government employees recently received hefty pay hikes, while more farmers are going bust.The dusty village of Sisauli puts the dilemma facing India's policymakers into clear focus.Sisuali is three hours by rough road from New Delhi, making transporting goods difficult and expensive.Layers of middlemen also clog the supply chain and take their cuts. Some farmers say their produce can go through at least four intermediaries before reaching customers.Malik says he sold rice for 16 rupees (24 U.S. cents) a kilogram to a middle man. In a market 10 minutes away, it retails for three times as much.""Inflation has come down only on paper; in reality, there is no let up in surging prices,"" Sudhir Kumar said in his grocery shop, which also has a small TV set he uses to keep an eye on commodity prices.DECADES OF NEGLECT BUBBLING OVERRural India has long suffered from neglect, but tensions are rising as food prices have surged after two years of drought.Retail inflation in rural areas has consistently outpaced urban areas in the past 18 months, hitting 6.20 percent in June, well above 5.26 percent in cities such as Mumbai.That has pushed overall inflation to a near two-year high of 5.77 percent in June, near the upper end of the RBI's 2-6 percent inflation target.RBI officials have stressed that many of the causes are structural and beyond the central bank's control, but the spike in inflation could complicate the next governor's job.Though India has become the world's fastest growing large economy, political pressure on the RBI is growing to cut interest rates more aggressively to spur full employment, at the risk of unleashing even stronger inflationary forces.Outgoing Governor Raghuram Rajan was lauded by investors for introducing inflation targeting last year, restoring the RBI's credibility by linking price management to numerical targets. Investors are closely watching to see if his successor will stick to tough targets or water them down.Economists polled by Reuters see only one more rate cut over the next year, if inflation does not pick-up too sharply.NO EASY FIXESModi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is already facing a tough electoral test in the state next year. Uttar Pradesh will be a crucial test for its re-election bid in 2019.""You are not ready to pay more to farmers because that is bad economics,"" said Malik. ""But no one complains when hefty pay increases are given to government employees.""The government is making some strides. It is spending on infrastructure and is seeking to weed out middlemen by giving farmers an option of selling their goods across India via electronic trading platforms set up at wholesale markets.But progress is slow, and middlemen continue to hold sway as farmers lack the means to ship directly to buyers.Rate cuts would do little for villagers such as Narpendar Jhinjha, a heavily indebted 52-year-old farmer, who says another bad year will force him to sell his land.""A farmer is hit on both sides,"" Jhinja said, referring to low crop prices and higher prices for goods he needs to buy.""And on top of that we have our loans to pay for. Farmers have been condemned to a life of misery."""

(PTI) Guwahati, July 27: The flood situation in Assam remained grim today with 16.68 lakh people affected in 21 districts as the surging waters of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries inundated more areas. The floodwaters have claimed five persons since yesterday while two world heritage sites, the Kaziranga and Manas national parks, remained submerged. Dabal Mili, 8, was washed away by the surging waters of Boginadi in Lakhimpur district yesterday. In Dhubri district, the body of Wazed Ali, 50, of Jhagrarpar village, who had gone missing yesterday while fishing in floodwaters, was recovered last night. A one-and-a-half year old baby drowned at Bilasipara last night. In Chirang district, ailing Jogesh Roy, 55, and Naba Roy, 24, who were marooned, died for want of medical treatment. The army, NDRF and the SDRF today rushed to Majuli to evacuate people from flood-affected areas. More than a lakh people in 110 villages have been displaced there. Jorhat deputy commissioner Virendra Mittal also rushed to Majuli to take stock of the situation. He wrote to chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia, recommending departmental action against 11 officials (of different departments like education, agriculture and veterinary) posted on the island for leaving without intimation or permission from the sub-divisional administration. Vittal told The Telegraph over phone from Majuli this evening that the officials were not found on duty at a time when the island was in the grip of severe floods. He said he had received complaints that these officials, including engineers, leave Majuli every weekend without informing or taking the approval of the sub-divisional administration, which is compulsory. He also directed Majuli sub-divisional officer (civil) Narsing Pawar to issue showcause notices to nine other officials for not attending flood-review meetings in the past few days in Majuli. He has issued a directive that no government employee posted in Majuli can leave station till August 15. In Golaghat district, the Brahmaputra breached the Halodhibari-Besamara embankment near Bongaon last evening. Punya Saikia, a resident, said the houses of 14 families were washed away. They somehow managed to save their lives. ""About 15,000 people took shelter on the embankment. The only food they got was flat rice and jaggery. Till 11 this morning, no one from the administration had visited the site. My house is also flooded and all my clothes and other articles have got damaged,"" he said, adding that those stranded on the other side of the embankment had not got any relief. In Dhubri district, more than three lakh people, including those in urban areas, reeled under floods as the water level of the Brahmaputra showed a rising trend. Of these, about one lakh people remained trapped in floodwaters despite rescue operations by the SDRF and the NDRF, administration sources said. A senior official of Dhubri district said the situation was likely to remain critical for the next 24 hours with more areas getting inundated. ""Floodwaters in Dhubri are heading towards the highest level (30.36m) recorded in 1988. It is predicted to cross 30m, which will be a matter of great concern,"" Dhubri additional deputy commissioner Debojit Khanikar said. An official of Dhubri division water resource department said the danger level of the Brahmaputra is 28.62m but it is flowing above 1.16m in Dhubri with a rising trend. In Dhubri town, all shops downed shutters following inundation and private schools and institutions remained closed. Nearly 30,000 people marooned in the town demanded relief materials. The situation, however, improved slightly in the lower Assam districts of Kokrajhar and Chirang with water levels of major river receding fast, though many areas remain submerged forcing people to stay in relief camps. In some flood-affected areas of Chirang, the administration started rescue and relief operations today with the help of NDRF. Though the water level of the Aie and its tributaries receded, the low-lying and riverine areas remained submerged. Two medical teams have been sent to Sidli and Bijni revenue circles. Nine relief camps in Sidli and four in Bijni have been set up. In Kokrajhar, 15,000 people in about 50 villages have been affected by the rising waters of the Sankosh, the Sormanga and the Gongia. Altogether 9,526 people are taking shelter in 11 relief camps."
5904285d7be9e02646bdc881,Carving a niche for themselves,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/561204/carving-niche-themselves.html,2016-07-30,"Carving a niche for themselvesR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, July 31, 2016 23:51 ISTHome Guards in Coimbatore district in Tamil Nadu have taken up a unique venture to carve out a niche for themselves. Besides launching initiatives like planting saplings and holding blood donation camps, they have started many projects which not many of their ilk have attempted so far.Going beyond their usual voluntary services, a 320-member Home Guard contingent, including 50 women, is engaged in creating awareness on the importance on organ donation, fighting man-animal conflict and helping the authorities at Kasi temple in Uttar Pradesh by sending coconut shells for the cremating the dead.Recently, over 100 home guards in Coimbatore helped a hospital to get an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for popularising the cause of organ donation by enrolling 13,206 donors in just eight hours. They also pledged their organs on the occasion. To create an awareness on the importance of eye donation among the people, the home guards have also pledged their eyes.We were doing our usual work till a few years ago. However, all of us thought that we should do something different to the people, which should help them, says Balaji Raju, Area Commander, Coimbatore district Home Guards.Accordingly they started rice bucket challenge two years back, a unique programme with each home guard providing one kg of rice to one family living on the street and daily wage workers.After the rice bucket challenge, the district Home Guards have now taken up another initiative to provide clothes to the downtrodden in society. The condition of children and men was pathetic as many had only two pairs of clothes, according to Balaji. The plight of those living in far-flung areas inside Thengumarada Forest, Kallampalayam, Melur and Keelur was horrible and many women were wearing torn clothes to cover their bodies. Called adai kodai (donate clothes), sarees, dhothis and kids wear, both new and used, were donated to the poor in those areas.As Coimbatore and its neighbouring districts are surrounded by forest area, animals like elephants and leopards enter human habitat frequently. This was a great concern for the district authorities as many people have lost their lives in the man-animal conflict in the last one decade.In a bid to help forest officials, home guards chipped in to help the authorities. Following our request, the forest authorities conducted a training programme in Annamalai Tiger Reserve, which was mainly focused on animals in hilly areas and preventive measures to keep them inside the forest, K Sidharthan, a home guard, said.He said the man-animal conflict programme is focused on Pollachi, Thudiyalur and Mettupalayam areas. Each unit is headed by a company commander, he said.The comprehensive training covered the safety measures needed to prevent animal attacks besides stocking rice and salt at PDS shops in a manner that does not attract elephants and other animals to human habitats, Sidharthan said. We were also trained on light and sound alert systems and SMS introduced by the forest department"".Under the SMS programme, a message on the movement of animals is sent to the nearest forest department outpost. The Home Guards and forest officials will alert people through public address system.Deputy area commander Vidhyashree Dharmaraj said that her unit has launched a novel programme called Kasi Pasumai Yatra. She said in Kasi trees are cut for burning bodies. We thought of a remedy to this and our cadres started collecting coconut shells, which can be used as alternative for wood to burn bodies, she said. We send the shells regularly to Kasi and an NGO helps us in this regard, she said.Vidhyashree said on some occasions, home guards also help the local police in nabbing criminals. Last month, our cadres Shanmuga Sundaram and Satish were on night duty when they noticed two people moving around suspiciously in the wee hours, Vidhyashree said. On seeing the home guards, the two attempted to flee. After a long chase, the home guards caught the hardcore criminals with guns and handed them over to the Mettupalayam police.Another Home Guard company commander Jaikumar said his cadres along with college students travelled to the flood-hit areas with relief materials. A group of home guards went to Chennai and Cuddalore district, which were devastated by December 2015 flood, and supplied food and helped in rescue and relief works.In another attempt to enter into the Guinness Book, the Home Guards cleaned Coimbatore city recently in association with the municipal corporation under Swachh Bharat Mission. The unique work included removing nails from trees and illegal hoardings. With an aim to stress on the importance of girl child, home guards were asked to take selfies with their daughters and post them on FaceBook.Recognising their efforts, the Tamil Nadu police have provided a distinct white uniform to the Home Guards , which is similar to the ones used by traffic cops in Coimbatore. Like traffic police, our cadres could also be identified during nights, which is not possible in the usual khakhi uniforms, Balaji Raju said.Interestingly, women cadres are also involved in activities such as cleaning local hospitals, providing temple security and extend escort to VIPs.Kalpana, who is in catering business, said: ""I am proud to be a part of the Home Guards team. Though I have lots of commitments at home, I do devote some time to public service."

Telegraph picturesb Kokrajhar, Aug. 1: The residents of 37 families at Choto Nilibari in Chirang district have endured a week of hapless misery after the Aie and its tributaries washed away their village. It was late on July 25 evening when the Aie, which flows downstream from Bhutan, charted a course of destruction. ""The river has taken away everything - our house and land. We have nowhere to go with our three bighas of land engulfed by the Aie,"" said Haita Daimary. ""The river has swallowed our land and our house,"" lamented Tezi Basumatary, 40, another villager. ""I don't know where we are going to stay. Our future is bleak,"" she added, gazing at the place which was once the site of her house, with betel nuts, jackfruit, guava and mango trees all around. Haita Daimary and his wife Longsri stand at the spot where their house used to be at Choto Nilibari The situation is the same in neighbouring Dababil and Naturbari. Eight families at Dababil and nine families at Naturbari have lost everything to the Aie's hungry tide. ""We could never imagine that there would be so much damage. As the river was rising dangerously, we tried collecting all that we could. But how much can one collect?"" asked Sunil Roy of Dababil, now camping at Subhaijhar High School. Sunil, along with eight other families of the village, has not only lost his house but also five bigha of cultivated land. ""The future of our children looks uncertain. God knows if we can rebuild our lives again, said Mahesh Basumatary of Choto Nilibari, who has schoolgoing children. ""BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary has promised us land to rebuild our houses. We hope he keeps his promise,"" he said. Tezi Basumatary at the ruins of her house The people of the three villages are now taking shelter at Subhaijhar High School and Subhaijhar community hall, about 5km away. The camp houses over 50 children, 30 of them less than six years old. Lankeswar Basumatary, the head teacher of Dababil Adivasi LP School, expressed concern over the fate of his children. Lankeswar, who hails from Choto Nilibari, has also lost his home and land. The women in the camp have also expressed concern over the food supplied by the government. ""We are getting only dal, rice and oil. How can we expect our children to survive on this? We would be happy if we are provided some vegetables and nutritious diet for the children,"" a woman with two young children said. The Aie has also breached the embankment at several places in Dangaigaon and Birhanggaon villages adjoining Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, posing a danger to the refinery and Bongaigaon town, 5km away. Hundreds of people from the flood-affected villages today came out and attempted to erect dykes at Choto Nilibari, using bamboo and boulders. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who had visited and assessed the damage caused by erosion a few days ago, also expressed concern and stressed the need for a permanent solution to tackle the erosion."

We have demanded to hike it to `80 per quintal, he said.The millers who convened a meeting here to discuss issues concerning survival of rice milling industry demanded to frame policies properly and implement separate rice Out Turn Ratio (OTR) for each State as per their respective output instead of a uniform OTR of 68 per cent. Eastern India, especially Odisha and West Bengal, never produce rice above 63 per cent of the paddy supplied due to climatic condition. But millers in these two States are asked to provide 68 per cent rice, Saini said.General secretary Santosh Sonthalia said instead of storing entire procured paddy will millers, the State agencies should have their own storage arrangements from where the millers can lift paddy against 100 per cent security from time to time by rotating delivery. The millers warned to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in September if the Government fails to consider their demand. More than 400 millers from different parts of the State and office bearers of State associations from Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry attended."

Booming exports of basmati also resulted in higher returns for the farmers of both states as rates of Pusa Basmati 1121 variety had touched Rs 4,500 per quintal.Manpreet stated that entire basmati industry in the northern states have large exporting units who had expressed their shock over the reported move to include certain area beyond the Indo-Gangetic plains which traditionally never cultivated the aromatic crop. ""Such a step will be detrimental to the aromatic traditional basmati which is the heritage of this region cultivated with the irrigation of five rivers. Basmati of our area will lose its premium tag over other regions,"" he said. In February this year, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) allowed the GI tag on the basmati grown in certain states. Farmers and exporters and Madhya Pradesh wanted to be included in the list of states approved by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the statutory body responsible for export promotion and development of certain scheduled products.IPAB chairman Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal had stated that basmati rice cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on the foothills of the Himalayas covering areas of the rice grown in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, western Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu and Kathua, would be issued the GI tag.According to APEDA, India exported 37 lakh tonnes of basmati rice overseas in 2014-15 valued at Rs 27,597.87 crore. The agency stated India was the world's leading exporter of the rice."

Pictures by Prem Singh.New Delhi, Aug. 13: Santosh Kumar chuckled at the thought that the Trinamul Congress was allotted the plot that is his home in Delhi but dropped it like a hot potato. It was bound to happen, the 34-year-old squatter from Bihars East Champaran district said. Ive been here for long years and have seen thousands come, measure the land and leave. No one ever came to stay. Santosh is one of 1,500-odd encroachers who live in shanties in a 6,000sqm patch of land off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg in central Delhi, from where the Centre recently offered Trinamul a 1,886sqm plot to build an office.But the party was horrified when it found that the plot is home to two temples  one to Sai Baba and the other to Shiva  and refused to accept it. Does Naidu (Venkaiah Naidu, the urban development minister) want us to demolish temples now? Trinamul member Sudip Bandyopadhyay had told The Telegraph on Wednesday night while conveying the partys rejection of the allotment.Santosh is certain that the central government had sold Trinamul a fast one. It was a political ploy, he said. People like us always find plots that lie between temples and mosques to live in  we know that no one will ever touch the area. Some Trinamul sources too said they had a feeling that Naidus ministry had tried to short-change the party by offering it a piece of land that no one wanted. Trinamul sources said the Centre had promised the plot in the days ahead of the passage of the goods and services tax bill, when it needed their partys support, but the allotment came after it was passed. They said that Naidu had been on his best behaviour with senior Trinamul MPs when they approached him for a plot, asking an official in front of them to show the party clean areas to choose from. The area off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg is prime real estate, located a few kilometres from Parliament and a stones throw from the headquarters of most of the big political parties. But for decades, its been home to rickshaw-pullers, mostly migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal. The rows of parked rickshaws take up a large slice of this tract of land, which has four temples of which two stand bang in the middle of the plot offered to Trinamul. Several eateries stand on the plot: they serve chicken curry and rice to their mostly labourer customers. There are multiple grocery stores and tea stalls, and a barber shop-cum-residence that caters to the nearby slum dwellers. Then theres Santoshs makeshift public telephone booth, which also serves as a ticket counter for travellers and an online service centre that helps the rickshaw-pullers pay their bills and send money home. This land is not ours, and well no doubt have to get out if the government tells us to. It hasnt happened in 20 years, though, said Mahesh Shah, 45, who came from Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh. Shah, a rickshaw-puller, lives on a part of the 1,886sqm plot the Trinamul was offered. Sudip had said that the residents had confronted Trinamul MPs staff when they went to see the plot on Wednesday, prompting them to escape with their lives. But the encroachers this newspaper spoke to denied having had any exchanges with the Trinamul representatives.Sudip said Trinamul was determined to assert its right. They were trying to shuffle on to us a plot no one else wanted. Why should we take such a plot? he told this newspaper on Thursday. What we have asked for is our legitimate right and we should get it. We have conveyed this to Naidu and he has promised that more plots will be shown and we can decide which one to take. This newspaper tried to contact Naidu over the phone at his offices in Parliament and at Shastri Bhavan on Thursday and Friday but his staff said he was busy with meetings. A source close to the minister said that Naidu himself had been surprised that Trinamul had been provided a plot with temples and had advised Sudip not to take it. He has promised him two more plots to choose from, the source said. Sudip confirmed this. But the encroachers are thanking the temples. These temples have saved us. Only someone willing to demolish them will get the plot, but who is going to do that? said Naresh Thakur, 50, the barber who runs his shop adjacent to the Shiva temple and opposite the Sai Baba temple. Nowadays, temples alone are the saviours of the poor, he signed off."
58f652197be9e031f13b2731,Alpana decision taken at Kala Bhavan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Alpana-decision-taken-at-Kala-Bhavan/articleshow/53703523.cms,2016-08-15,"KOLKATA: It was at Kala Bhavan that the idea of including alpana as part of the fine arts syllabus germinated, through a series of workshops that Rabi Biswas was called in to conduct. Biswas, in fact, has been crusading to revive folk alpana, with foundations like Daricha and Intach playing a key role.To most of us, the word alpana means patterns drawn with rice paste on auspicious occasions. In today's age, when one has very little time to soak and grind rice to make the paste and then take time out to draw the patterns, stickers make for easy use. The result is that one of the most vibrant folk traditions of Bengal is gradually becoming extinct. However, two of the country's premier art schools have taken it upon themselves to make alpana a part of their teaching-learning process, to help start a revival of sorts.The one-year foundation course at Kala Bhavan - compulsory for all students taking up fine arts at the undergraduate level - has been revised to include alpana, both in the Santiniketan gharana that was perfected by Nandalal Bose's daughters Jamuna Devi and Gauri Bhanja, and also the genre inspired by folk traditions. ""All students of painting, sculpture, graphics, design and art history have to first go through the foundation course, get their grades and then be given a chance to choose their specializations,"" said principal Dilip Mitra. "" Alpana now features in the foundation course because we want every student to be aware of both the Santiniketan and the folk traditions. This will save it from extinction.""The most popular among these are the six different kinds of 'Lakshmi brotos', coupled with specific corresponding alpanas. There are brotos in the monsoon for sowing paddy seeds popular in Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia, where the paddy sheaf is the central alpana motif, brotos for the Nabanna festival, for a custom called Punyipukur, where the pond and the lotus are the central motifs, for Dasputul, where the alpana is inspired by the 'Ramayana', the Senjuti broto that characterizes evenings in the month of Agrahayana, with a 52-motif elaborate alpana, the Jampukur broto where the god of death is appeased through rituals and alpanas, and the Hyachra broto to ward off seasonal diseases like chicken pox.Though unrelated to the Visva-Bharati initiative, similar alpana workshops by Biswas were a routine affair at Rabindra Bharati University at its state academy of dance, drama, music and visual art. ""We are toying with the idea of expanding a portion of the painting syllabus to include folk traditions from Bengal, including alpana of the different districts,"" said head of the painting department at RBU, Nikhil Pal."

That there is a resurgence of Goan culture is now being increasingly acknowledged and was on display as the villagers opened their church yard and hearts to everyone.One was greeted by a carnival of colours and villagers on the grounds of the Our Lady of Socorro church. The happy mood and camaraderie overflowed as one eased into the festivities. The yard was brought alive by zigzagging coloured flags while the church stood stoic, almost indulging the community celebration.The festival, in its fifth year, was originally conceived by Marius Fernandes from Divar , who is most devoted to reviving Goan traditions. That this fest also coincides with India's Independence Day makes it even more collective and welcoming. The festival has stuck to it guns of no plastic, no alcohol, no sponsorship, no contests or prizes, and most of all, no chief guests.Fernandes tells TOI, ""We want to empower women and children, remind everyone of their Goenkarponn , help each other with organizing the festival. Remind everyone that it is our festival and that the community is in control,"" he adds, ""the highlight this year is that we trained our youth to use Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to spread the message and that is why we have people from as far as even Daman ."" He says he's thankful, ""for the villagers from Saligao who sent no less than four dance troupes this year"".Guests are in for a treat of liberally doled out patolles (a traditional sweetmeat of newly-harvested rice ground to a fine paste, grated coconut mixed with jaggery and steamed to perfection in turmeric leaves).While the feast is essentially celebrated as a community gathering, organized by the Socorro Socio-Art and Cultural Association - Soccorrkars invited dance troupes from nearby villages and even a troupe from Jharkhand that perhaps drew the most interest with their rhythmic slow hip and feet dance, low chants, accompanied by a solo drummer.Cultural personalities of Goa such as Alexyz, Prajal Sakhardande, Pantaleo Fernandes, Socorro de Santacruz volunteered their time, while Fr Santana Carvalho , parish priest of Socorro, took over master of ceremonies duties.It begins to feel even more culture-soaked Goans with a display of proud heirlooms, a dance troupe from far Jharkhand, visitors from across the seas, urban-settlers and Goans from hinterlands across generations with all faiths mixing against a background of a church and the India tri-colour.Ivy Rosario flew in from Goa's former colonial outlier, Daman. What drives her to make it all the way just for the fest? ""I had promised Marius and I wanted to be at this fest which is everything Goan and community-driven. I have not seen such a fest before!"""
58fda9e87be9e012bf285182,Stoked about yolk,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2016/aug/25/Stoked-about-yolk-1512977.html,2016-08-25,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Yolks are yum. Theres no debate to egg on here. But try it the way the food loving populace of Singapore does iton everything from macarons to ice creamand its hardly a breakfast story anymore. If you havent heard of this trendy culinary excess, the salted egg yolk is a sweet and savoury golden sauce made of brined duck eggs, which has become something of a Singapore staple this past year.So, of course, when I got the call to fly to the Lion City, the Merlion statue was the farthest thing from my mind. Instead, I found myself plotting a missionto hunt down as many salted yolk delights as possible. Imagine my joy when, as I board our Scoot plane, I notice that it has the largest splash of yellow you will ever see at an airport. Clearly the Universe was giving me a go ahead.Bulls eye beginningsHours after landing, I get my first runny yolk on the trip. An old-school bulls eye at the brand new Ibis Styles Singapore on MacPherson Road. As I swipe into my gorgeous room for the next couple of days, with a spectacular view of the pool below and ruler-straight traffic lines further in the distance, for a moment (a teeny one) the poke of the egg yolk takes a back seat. Our guide thinks it appropriate that our first stop be a place close to home, Little India. Bollywood tunes blare, cell phone shops boast names like MGR Mobiles and gold jewellery showrooms are everywhere. No yolks, but its ok. As Mr Incredible says in the beginning of that movie, Ive got time. Four days to be precise.Hawking crab masalaI am sure I will find the answer to my yolk cravings at the Tekka Hawker Centre where we head for lunch. But after not one but two walk arounds that throw up everything from goose and duck rice to South Indian meals with crab masala served on a banana leaf, it is evident Ill have to reroute my craving to something more traditionally local. So we settle for a delicious bowlful of laksa and chicken rice with chilled soy milk to wash it down.Rose blossoms for teaHeavy lunches call for a nap or a walk after. We pick the latter, to make the most of our trip, and end up on Haji Lane, home to indie designer stores, graffiti walls and adorable little cafs. We head into one called Shop Wonderland that has dried flowers on the walls, which also seems to inspire their patisserie selection. Dessert is a delectable slice of rose blossom cake with raspberry icing. As I polish this off, I feed my yolk obsession by asking the girl at the counter whether they can get me a fix. Oh, we dont have any, she says. But head over to Toast Box. Ive tasted salted egg yolk there and its pretty good.Golden lava on toastOur party of four really make an effort to find Toast Box. And we put off shopping at a premium Singapore mall in the bustling Bugis junction to do it. But when we do find it, there is just no question about lost opportunitiesfreshly made toast served with cold kopi beats an evening of shoe shopping any day. I order the French toast oozing with a golden lava-style yolk that is sweet and rich. That first bite will be stuck in my memory and Instagram forever. The egg-cellent cocktailHappy with the first taste of my yolk adventure, I return to my room to locate my next stop. I figure perhaps a bar would give me a glimpse of Singapores night life and throw up some new yolk experiences. So I set my sights on The World is Flat by Tanuki Raw, Shinkansen and Standing Sushi Bar. Founder Howard Lo promises a wide selection of favourites on the menu with a yolky twist, including chicken wings and a salted egg yolk char siew pork donburi.At this point, every type of F&B business here has gotten in on the trend. Whether its a fast food or budget dining spot to a high-end eatery, everyone is doing something with salted egg in it. Its also hit that saturation point where its starting to get some backlash, some of that, oh man, not another salted egg yolk dish! he shares.Cold comfortOther memorable highs in my food diary include the award-winning oven-baked spring chicken at the Mercure Bugis restaurant, Sauces, and a Mediterranean assortment that has me gobsmacked at a must-try dinner spot called Artichoke.The writer was invited by AccorHotels and Scoot."
58f221b4a3d24b68099aa776,The race to light up the last village,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-race-to-light-up-the-last-village/article14592893.ece,2016-08-25,"Jalan Singh, 30, has not removed the cardboard carton that protects the sides of his new Godrej refrigerator. You cannot miss the striking red cooling machine in the room. Having spent Rs.12,000 on it, Singh is proud of his acquisition. Sixty-nine years is a short time in an independent countrys life but it has been a long time for power to reach Singhs village, Tanwarpura, an hours drive from Barmer city in Rajasthan. Power that arrived in the village two months ago, although erratic, nudged Singh to buy a refrigerator. He opens it to show it to us, but its empty. The rains may have tripped some lines, a government official offers an explanation. Rains did lash the village a few days ago. Having been consistent this year, they promise good harvest and some extra income. Singhs spirits are not dampened by the temporary absence of electricity; he reels off his wish list: a fan, a cooler, and an atta chakki (flour mill).Rukh Singh, his neighbour, has beaten him to procuring an atta chakki . The flour mill means two extra hours of sleep for his wife. In the early hours before dawn, Tanwarpura wakes up to the sounds of the chakki as women work it to pound flour. With the manual mill, it took my wife four hours to prepare the flour for our daily meals. The electric one takes an hour, Rukh Singh says. His wife smiles behind her veil, allowing Rukh Singh to speak on her behalf.The Singhs got an electricity connection under the Modi governments flagship scheme of rural electrification launched in July 2015, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The governments goal is 100 per cent electrification by 2019. Official estimates peg the number of un-electrified villages in India at 18,452. Of this, the government claims to have electrified 10,097 villages till date, a figure that doesnt go uncontested.The lifelines of a villageAt least there is light, says 34-year-old Chagan Kanwar, a mother of two. Two weeks ago, for the first time, solar energy lit up houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti in Barmer district where she lives. Designated as a Desert National Park area and situated almost at the farthest edge of the State, a few kilometres before the border with Pakistan, the village has around a hundred households. Power for Kanwar means less pollution. The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining, she says. The inhabitants of this basti were accustomed to travelling 25 km to Gadra village to charge their mobile phones. A shopkeeper there would ask for Rs.10 to charge each phone. We used to take 10 phones once a week to get them charged, says Pan Singh. Mobile phones, lifelines for the villagers and the only connection to the outside world, when powered ran for a week.Their main lifeline, however, is the sun. Under the off-grid scheme of DDUGJY, houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti have been provided with a 100W solar panel which can light five LED bulbs, one standing 12W fan, and a socket to charge a mobile phone. These three utilities come as part of the solar kit, a one-time investment of Rs.1,029 which works out to 5 per cent of the total cost incurred to install the kit in every home. There is no burden of electricity bills.The villagers have become so accustomed to the absence of power that even its presence does not prompt them to switch on the fan. The two villages, Tanwarpura and Salam Singh Ki Basti, are examples of the grid and off-grid programmes of the Centre, which are committed to providing electricity in every village. Explaining the decision for this, the Executive Director of Rural Electrification Corporation, Dinesh Arora, says: States have generally preferred and adopted grid connectivity for most of the villages except in areas where connectivity is either not feasible or cost-effective.In Rajasthan, as at the Centre, a Bharatiya Janata Party government is at the helm. Both Central and State officials are racing to power villages, but they are also wary as the media has turned its gaze to the claims made by the government in rural electrification. Officials everywhere are now tutoring villagers on the art of communicating with the media. With a spate of critical reports on the app-based claims of electrification on GARV making the government more watchful, even the hint of a journalist in the remotest of villages sends officials into a tizzy.Promise of powerMeanwhile, in distant Uttar Pradesh, power is a touchy issue, especially as elections are set to take place next year. When the Centre claims credit for any development, the State is quick to point out loopholes.In Anandpur, a village at the edge of Hathras district which is famed for asafoetida, a dried latex that is indispensable to curries and dals (lentil), power comes and goes. A gift from Delhi, an LED bulb, has brought light into the lives of 70-year-old Ram Prasad and 17-year-old Rahul. The electricity meter, wrapped in plastic, is a prized possession and is precariously mounted on the mud wall of the house that has a small porch, a room, and a tube well in the courtyard. There is a toilet too, Prasad points out, seemingly well-versed in the drill of showing to outsiders the trappings of modernity that have crept into the village. The toilet is pitch dark; light hasnt travelled there yet.For rural India, the DDUGJY brings not only the promise of power to every village, but its attendant trappings too. Our ancestors will be happy. They never saw light, says Savitri, a resident, as she begins cooking potatoes and chapattis under the light of a solitary bulb. The bulb has freed her from having to swat insects that she would have otherwise battled with under the light of a kerosene lamp or candle.Glimpses of a fractious relationshipAnandpur is an odd mix of upper castes (mostly Thakurs) and backward castes. Adversity and deprivation is the glue that holds these communities together. Most of the villagers wear a bemused look as officials from the electricity department come inquiring about the availability of power here. Mukesh Kumar from the State Electricity Board examines 18 meters installed in Anandpur and requests people to show their papers. He looks agitated. We were not informed about the installation. What if the villagers refuse to pay for the power or their homes collapse in the rains? he asks. The question hangs in the air, offering a glimpse of the fractious relationship between the Centre and State.The Prime Minister claimed in his Independence Day address that Nagla Fatela, a village in Hathras, was electrified but the media found surprised villagers and a dark village when it reached there. The embarrassment caused by this episode has left everyone on edge here and the U.P. government is determined to keep a check on every connection by sending its officers to the field. Kumar is one of them. Other senior officials have been dispatched from Lucknow. Says Rakesh Verma wryly: Ideally, the village should be getting 14 hours of power but that seldom happens. Lets see what happens after the elections. The officials wait patiently for Anandpurs residents to show their cards. Others who also wait are the men who installed the meters, the Centres officials.The scheme is premised on the Centre and the State working in tandem. The Centre provides the infrastructure; the State provides the power after working out its availability  12-14 hours a day is what has been calculated. The reality plays out differently as power keeps tripping. Young Anshu whispers that she saw a snake first when the light came on some time at night in her thatched hut just two days ago. Snakes are common in the tiny village of Anandpur, which is ringed by paddy fields. The villagers could not steal power like other villages nearby  katiya , or the illegal tapping of power, is rampant there  as high tension wires made that impossible.The power is erratic and the wait long and uncertain. We wait and watch; so do Savitri and Rahul. Everyone looks at the cooler fan installed upside down, a common jugaad in these parts, which works when the electricity comes. This is a welcome addition to their huts as it helps make the nights less muggy.In Anandpur, the monthly income of a family of five rarely exceeds Rs.2,000. Electricity is a luxury. Agricultural holdings are small, and income is supplemented by selling milk. The villagers are worried; they ask as they wait for the power to come, Do we have to pay the bill? As per the plan, the village will get power from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pointing out the absurdity of the schedule, an official on a visit to the village says, We dont draw the plan. We follow instructions from Delhi. Contesting this, Mr. Arora says, The responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.These villagers are the Antyodaya card holders. In other words, they are the poorest of the poor whose entitlements are a few kilograms of rice and two litres of kerosene a month. The supplies get exhausted quickly and they are forced to purchase these goods from the open market. The nearest school is 2 km away and the villagers are wary of sending their girls to school. Rahul is studying for an examination and he finds the light a godsend. I can study now when the light comes; I dont have to study under the lamp, he says, wistful though for a regular supply.The State government is working out a way to regulate the tariff so that people pay for the power they consume. From the headquarters in Lucknow, the chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Desh Deepak Verma, has been keeping a watch ever since false claims were made about electrification, by dispatching officials to the ground. He says the problem is with the definition of an electrified village. One in 10 homes is all that a series of schemes have focussed on. What about the 9 others? And within the 10 per cent, only poles have reached some villages; last mile connectivity is still distant.Its 6.30 p.m. when dusk falls to herald the night. Thirty hours have passed, but Tanwarpura has no power. Is it because of the rains? Electricity is transformative, but only when it is available, Rukh Singh says. We get it for about two hours a day. A tiny bulb dispels darkness in Jethmal Singhs house. I got my connection under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) governments Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) before it was re-christened by the BJP government as DDUGJY. Only five connections have come in the last six months under the DDUGJY, he says. Thirty of the 35 households which have electricity in this village were electrified under the RGGVY. A Tata Sky dish hangs at the back of Jethmals house. The TV, however, is missing.On August 12, the governments field engineer encouraged us to purchase a television so that we could tune in to Prime Minister Narendra Modis Independence Day address. We bought the set on the 13th, he says. People gathered in Jethmal Singhs house on August 15. But the TV conked off after the Prime Ministers speech and has been sent for repair.Bhiram, who lives ten minutes away from Jethmals house in the nearby village of Tirsingra, also listened to the Prime Minister speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort. The field engineer told me that light would reach my village too, he says. But there was a problem. In April 2015, the government identified 34 un-electrified villages in Barmer. Tirsingra was not one of them.Un-electrified and not on the listA hundred kilometres away from Tirsingra, Mahadev Nagar has a similar story. There is no power in the village and it is not on the governments radar. Surta Ram, 40, calls fellow villagers to gather on the lawns of the primary school to discuss the problems related to lack of power. Photographs of Indira Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar hang prominently in his house. He calls himself a samaaj sevi (social worker). For the last five years, we have been contacting government officials at all levels: the Collector, the MLA, and others. Now they tell us that our name is not in the government survey, he says. Ten days ago, the MLA said that our village will see light this Diwali. Lets see.Mahadev Nagar has a primary health centre, a facility that other villages mentioned as lacking here. But it is just a building. There is no doctor here. No one wants to come here because there is no electricity, Surta Ram says.Adds 39-year-old Puga Ram: Yesterday, three malaria patients had to travel for 5-10 km for injections. The ambulance also doesnt come inside our village. Puga Ram teaches in the village school and is concerned about the childrens education. This is the age of computers. How will these kids get digital literacy if there is no electricity, he asks, distressed. There are five classrooms in the school; one is under construction. The heat inside the room compels the teacher to take his classes on the sands outside under the trees. Misra Ram shows a receipt of Rs.200 dated November 2015. For electricity connections, we had to apply in groups of five. A hundred such forms have been sent from our village. I have applied thrice. But there is no progress, he says.All conversations with the villagers start and end with electricity. Its announcement and presence have fuelled aspirations long bottled up.Back in Salam Singh Ki Basti, Abdul Khan shakes his head, disgruntled with the governments solar-powered electricity scheme that is oddly restrictive as well as liberating. We wanted electricity powered by the grid. The current set-up limits us to a few predefined utilities. There is nothing more that we can do with this, he says. The power limitation of the solar kit doesnt allow them to use other appliances. Unlike in Tanwarpura, electricity in this village doesnt match aspirations. Also, the government is advocating for one kit that fits all. This means that the village school in Salam Singh Ki Basti gets the same set kit as the houses. There are multiple classrooms, but only one fan.In the summer heat in Anandpur, 70-year-old Prasad dreams. Now that we have seen light, we have become a little greedy. Dil aur chahta hai (the heart desires more), he says. That means a few hours more hours of light. And a fan that will make the summer more bearable.The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining. Chagan Kanwar, resident, salam singh ki bastiThe responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.

591f8c3f7be9e025a5d4f872,Agriculture takes back seat,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/566925/agriculture-takes-back-seat.html,2016-08-25,"Devinder Sharma, August 26, 2016 23:17 ISTECONOMIC REFORMS : Providing rightful income to farmers is what will push domestic demand and revitalise rural economy at the same time.Come to think of it, in the past 25 years, ever since economic reforms were unleashed, the average monthly basic income of a government peon has gone up from Rs 7,500 to Rs 18,000, and of the cabinet secretary from Rs 30,000 to Rs 2,50,000. Although the wage hike of government employees has nothing to do with economic liberalisation, still I find the rise in their salaries is shown as a bright outcome of the reforms process.Now, compare this with the income a farmer gets out of agriculture. Economic Survey 2016 tells us that the average income a farmer gets from farming activities, including what he keeps for his family consumption at home, in 17 states of India is Rs 20,000 a year. In other words, the monthly income of a farmer in these states is a paltry Rs 1,666. On a national level, the NSSO works out the average monthly income that a farmer derives from farming operations to be just Rs 3,000 per family.The deplorable condition of farmers is certainly an outcome of economic reforms. Simply put, economic liberalisation or economic reforms or market economy whatever you prefer to term it as, has bypassed the majority population. Agriculture, like other unorganised sectors, has been the biggest casualty.It was in July 1991 when Manmohan Singh delivered the historic budget speech as finance minister that opened up the country to economic liberalisation. I recall the speech wherein he unshackled the industry from the control regime and showered all bounties on industries and in the very next paragraph acknowledged that agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy.But since agriculture is a state subject, he left it to the state governments to provide the much needed impetus to farming. But what he forgot to say was that industry too was a state subject and should have been left to the state governments. The bias therefore was clearly visible.This was simply not an unintended fallout of the process of economic liberalisation. It was actually part of a design. Later, in 1996, the World Bank directed India to move 400 million people out of rural areas to the urban areas in the next 20 years, saying that land is a precious asset in the hands of people who are inefficient producers, meaning farmers.Since the younger generations among farmers do not know anything except farming, World Bank suggested that India set up a network of training institutes to train these people to become industrial workers. This should be accompanied by land rentals and land acquisitions.Going by the World Bank prescription, successive governments have been blindly playing to the tune. As prime minister, Manmohan Singh had time and again said that 70% farmers in India were surplus and need to shift to urban areas. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is on record saying that big ticket reforms will happen when India moves a large share of the farming population to the cities. And more recently, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has blamed agriculture for not being able to provide subsistence to a large section of the population thereby increasing inequality.What he forgot to say was that successive governments had deliberately starved agriculture of financial resources and had kept the farming population impoverished. This is evident from the way agriculture remains a low priority area when it comes to budgetary allocations. In the 11th Plan, agriculture received only Rs 1 lakh crore as budget outlay for the five years. In the 12th plan period, agriculture got Rs 1.5 lakh crore.Incidentally, the budgetary support for agriculture, which employs 52% of the population, is less than the annual provisions being made for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). In addition, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for wheat and rice had remained almost frozen, with annual increase in farm prices not exceeding 4% on an average. No wonder, 48% farmers want to quit agriculture if given an alternative.Higher labour wagesIn fact, the plight of agriculture is not only deliberate but has for all practical purposes, sustained the economic reforms. If the farmers were paid their economic due by way of, lets say, a higher MSP, the industrial and business sector would have gone for a toss because of the additional costs involved for paying higher labour wages that incorporates resulting high food prices.At the same, a higher price for farm produce would have raised the cost of production of many industries. In addition, a high paying agriculture would have also reduced the rate of migration and thereby reduced the availability of cheaper labour for infrastructure and real estate.The real cost of economic reforms therefore is being borne by rural India, of which farmers constitute the majority. The first-ever Socio Economic Census has clearly brought out the stark reality. Indias performance when measured as per the Human Development Index too shows the burgeoning inequality. India ranks 130 among a ranking of 188 countries. The economic reform that we talk about therefore has largely been pro-rich. The rich 1% own 51% of countrys wealth.Keeping agriculture impoverished all these years has sustained economic reforms. The big bang reform India needs is essentially in agriculture. Providing the rightful income into the hands of farmers is what will push domestic demand and at the same time revitalise rural economy. If the Seventh Pay Commission is being seen as an economic booster, as it is expected to create more demand for consumer goods, imagine the kind of shot in the arm a higher income in agriculture will give to the Indian economy."
5904746d7be9e04154df7204,Ethiopian food: Thaal se thaal bajaa!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ethiopian-food-thaal-se-thaal-bajaa/,2016-08-25,"There are no forks or knives on the table. Not even spoons. Everyone is eating with their fingers and the only sound punctuating the Oohs and Yums is the occasional slurp. As I look around the room, I notice that even the most well-heeled customers are uncomplainingly and happily rolling up the bread, scooping the stew or vegetables and paying tribute to the chef by a single-minded focus on the delicious meal in front of them.I am at an Ethiopian restaurant Zeni in San Francisco with my sister, her husband and my younger son, The Foodie. We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."
59419dbd7be9e0192d33abb1,"GI certification: Madhya Pradesh demand to grow basmati opens a Pandora’s Box, both economically and politically",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/geographical-indication-battle-over-basmati/,2016-08-25,"Basmati farmer Krishnakumar Tomar at his field in Badi, Raisen district. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) Basmati farmer Krishnakumar Tomar at his field in Badi, Raisen district. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)When Krishnakumar Tomar, one of the first to grow basmati in this fertile belt, harvested his crop 14 years back, he had no idea where to sell it. With no local takers for the aromatic paddy, the 40-year-old from Badi, which falls in Raisen district, was told he could get a good price for it at Delhis Narela mandi or Kota in Rajasthan, both many hundred kilometers away.I wondered whether it was worth the trouble going all the way there, recalls Tomar. The long road journey to Narela may only have further sowed seeds of doubt over his decision to switch from growing regular high-yielding paddy.But today, basmati is my main crop, declares this science graduate, who grows Pusa Basmati-1 (PB-1), a variety bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, on his entire 35-acres farmland. He devotes more resources and attention to it than even wheat, which is cultivated during the rabi winter season and sold to government agencies at the official minimum support price (MSP).Tomar used to previously cultivate paddy varieties such as Mahamaya and Kranti, which gave yields of up to 30 quintals per acre. PB-1 yields are lower at 18-22 per acre. The difference, however, is in prices.Ten years ago, ordinary paddy sold at Rs 600 per quintal. Even today, the governments MSP is only Rs 1,470. In basmati, prices rose as high as Rs 3,900 per quintal in 2013. They have fallen since to Rs 2,000, but are still more than that of non-basmati, he points out.Tomar is among the many farmers in this area  having assured irrigation, thanks to the Barna Dam completed in the late 1970s  who have stopped planting regular paddy or soyabean in the kharif season. They have prospered by switching to a crop that is now a bone of contention between Madhya Pradesh (MP) and the northern states led by Punjab and Haryana.All the three are, incidentally, ruled by the BJP either by itself or in alliance.At the heart of the dispute is MP staking claim for inclusion of 13 of its districts  from Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri and Guna in the north to Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur in the central-south  in the Geographical Indication (GI) area officially demarcated for basmati cultivation.As of now, only seven states in the Indo-Gangetic plains on the foothills of the Himalayas  Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu & Kashmir  have been granted GI certification rights for growing basmati.The states that have been issued the GI tag  mainly millers and farmers in Punjab and Haryana  are vociferously opposed to extending the same to MP. Their contention is that the state neither has a history nor the specific agro-climatic conditions suitable for basmati cultivation.But for farmers here, basmati is what has brought them prosperity that was non-existent till a decade ago. Tomar may have, then, struggled to dispose of his crop. But that changed with the entry of millers, who sensed an opportunity to procure basmati from MP at rates lower than what it cost in the traditional northern belt.LT Foods Limited was the first mover. The company, which sells basmati rice under the well-known Daawat brand, went on to establish a state-of-the-art plant in 2006 at Mandideep, about 20 km from Bhopal. In no time, many others also moved in. They included S.S.A International and Narmada Cereals Pvt. Ltd, which have also set up milling facilities at Mandideep, technically in Raisen district.There is no dearth of buyers for basmati, unlike wheat, where we are entirely dependent on the government. Nor do we have to go to any procurement centre to sell, as the company agents come to us directly to purchase from our doorstep. And the basmati crop does not fail from less or more rains, which is not so with soyabean, notes Sunil Sharma.This 40-acre farmer, also from Badi, took to basmati after seeing Punjabi Jat Sikh farmers settled in the region growing it.The Class XI-pass Sharma owns a Mahindra Bolero SUV, while his friend and fellow-farmer Mukesh Chouhan drives a Scorpio.Many people in these parts have purchased four-wheelers and even property 100 km away in Bhopal. It is all only due to basmati. Yes, prices had shot up to Rs 4,000/quintal three years ago and are now half of that. But things are still better than 10 years ago, when we did not even have our own tractors, he points out.These farmers are equally clear that they cannot be denied the right to cultivate basmati, in the name of GI protection. We did not oppose their getting the GI, why should they oppose ours, then? Punjab is, no doubt, the leader in agriculture, but we are trying to catch up. Whats wrong in that? retorts Sharma.The primary argument of the northern millers and farmers  supported by the scientific community and bodies like APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority)  is that MP never had any tradition of basmati cultivation, a prerequisite for grant of GI. They started growing basmati only from the start of this century. All this pressure to include MP is for just helping one company, said a Delhi-based miller, while alluding to LT Foods.The company, however, denies the charge of the MP government fighting a proxy war on its behalf. We buy less than 15 per cent of the states total basmati paddy production. The rest is bought by many others, including millers and traders in North India, says Rajinder Wadhawan, Director (Operations) at LT Foods.MPs farmers are the ones who would be affected the most, in the event of the state government losing the GI battle, he adds.According to Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary (Agriculture) in the MP government, the state has submitted evidence, including documents and publications dating back to the British era, to prove that basmati was being cultivated in the relevant districts long enough to warrant a GI tag.That evidence was, however, not accepted by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, which, in an order on February 5, directed the MP government to file additional evidence. The latter has since challenged the order and the matter is currently before the Madras High Court.All this wrangling comes even as basmati exports from India have shown a decline in the last couple of years, after posting a more than ten-fold jump to over Rs 29,000 crore between 2006-07 and 2013-14.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive.The spread of basmati cultivation, beyond its traditional confines of undivided pre-Partition Punjab, Jammu, West Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, can be put down to a single phenomenon: Advances in crop breeding.The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive. They needed a short day length for flowering; the plants would simply not produce flowers until the sunshine hours fell to 12 or less.That condition was available from end-September  when the kharif paddy crop should normally commence flowering  only in the north/northwest parts of the subcontinent on either side of the Indus River. In central and southern India, the day length was 14 hours or more through October. These areas couldnt, therefore, grow or at least had no recorded history of farming basmati in contiguous stretches.This changed, though, with the release of improved basmati varieties from the late 1980s. These strains  especially Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509, bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  were not just high-yielding, but also relatively less sensitive to photoperiod or day length variations, giving more planting time flexibility. Since they could flower even when sunshine hours were long, farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh could now grow them.But as AK Singh, head of the Division of Genetics at IARI, points out, the grains from the basmati paddy cultivated in the non-traditional belts have quality issues. Basmati rices most distinctive trait  apart from long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking, and fluffiness  lies in its aroma, which, in turn, derives from a compound called 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline. The accumulation of this highly volatile compound in the grain, contributing to basmatis characteristic fragrance, is largely a function of environmental conditions.The retention of aroma, courtesy 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline, is best when the flowering and grain-filling phase coincides with a cool climate, with temperatures below 30 degree Celsius during daytime and just over 20 degrees at night. These conditions are, again, obtained during October only in the traditional basmati belt.Moreover, it isnt aroma alone. Higher temperatures during the roughly one-month period from flowering to maturity can also affect the texture and milling quality of the grain. When temperatures are high at the time of grain-filling, the packing of the starch granules in the rice tends to be loose. So, you get grains with more chalkiness (opaque areas caused by incomplete filling) and resulting in higher percentage of broken rice during milling, explains Singh.What all this means is that Pusa-1121 basmati can well be grown in MP or Maharashtra. But the aroma, appearance and milling quality of the grain produced from there cannot really match what one would get from the basmati grown in Amritsar, Karnal, Kathua, Kangra or Dehradun. The cooler climate during the critical crop maturity and grain-filling period in those parts cannot possibly be replicated elsewhere. And theres little even plant breeding science can do about it.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Idols are made in an empty pot with a seed inside the idol. After 10 days, when the idol is immersed, water gets mixed with the soil and a new plant will grow from it. The team is also teaching people to make idols with soil, decorating it with pulses, rice and wheat. When festivities are over, idols easily get dissolved in water and grains, either in soil or water, cause no harm to flora or fauna."

As his quest to add movement to the dolls depicting the different small forms of Krishna Leela began in 1947-48, it was the eco-friendly way that he went for.Putting together aluminium from old clothes hangers, circular wood cut out from rolling pins, cycle rims, old levers, pulleys, ropes and other things lying at home, the 88-year old retired medical professional has since then managed to extend his hobby to family members and devotees who form a beeline year after year with the stories of Lord Krishna in continued sustained motion.""I wanted to do something new, ahead of what was being done by my elders at home back then. Studying at Kanpur medical college that time helped me a great deal in understanding human body movements, which I developed into all these dolls, without even having any knowledge of mechanics,"" said Dr Mathur , who did his MBBS from King George's Medical University and retired as additional director of medical health, Uttar Pradesh.From the aura behind the head of Lord Vishnu , to the chakra moving continuously on his finger, the shadow display of Kans to Lord Krishna opening up his mouth to show mother Yashoda the universe within, from the water play during Holi to the 'cheer haran' of Draupadi - all stories with limb movements of the wooden dolls have been made by him.While it takes around 25-30 days for the entire tableau to be assembled, the entire family, from Mathur's children and grand children, all has a role to play. ""I paint the dolls' face now, earlier my aunt used to do that. My father narrates the stories to people who flock our home for the six days. Every person has a department to take care, from sewing clothes for the dolls, to assistance with the mechanics,"" said Shubhra Mathur , the third generation. Regular visitors come in every evening and schoolchildren come in during mornings for the tableau to be up at the house till August 31.""The most difficult movement to solve was in the story of Krishna-Sudama , where I had to depict snatching of the rice packet. The Mahabharat scene with Krishna lying in the bed, getting up and turning his neck was also a difficult one. But it all came God gifted for me to solve,"" said Mathur, sitting in his Khurram Nagar house."

He is an artist-par-excellence who single-handedly sculpted the Big Foot at Lotoulim and created Ancestral Goa which is a famous tourist attraction in the state. But, very few know that he has a huge collection of 3,123 idols of Lord Ganesha and it is growing with time.These idols of Lord Ganesha are in different hues made of stone, glass, metal, wood, leaf, grain, porcelain, gold and silver either gifted, collected or bought from various parts of Indian and abroad, over a period of more than last two decades.Such is his craze for rare idols that he collected the idols from many parts of India like Sawantwadi, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Orissa, Maharashtra and foreign countries like Nepal, Burma, Malaysia, Tibet and China.Call it a passion or devotion that he gradually developed, Alvares has a carving of Lord Ganesha on a rice grain and the biggest is 12 inches.Speaking to TOI, Alvares said his collection was accidental. He was mostly invited for judging community (sarvajanik) installation of Lord Ganesha during the festival. As a momento, he received these idols which were lying with him. One fine day, he decided to display it in his museum. To his surprise, his friends started gifting him with Ganesha idols from various places in India and foreign countries. His friend Anand Khandeparkar then gifted him with the antique piece and thus his collection started growing.""I am in the process of categorizing them in different folk art to bring out the folklore of that particular place. Ganesha, being the 'God of Nature', in Sawantwadi, most of the time they carve it in wood, in Orissa they do it in metal (wire), Jaipur in stone, so on and so forth. In some places, artisans do it on grains, hence it is a befitting to Lord Ganesha,"" says Alvares."

Men, women and children sat glued to the television sets in their homes from morning.Finally, at around 2 p.m. they learnt that the land acquisition by the Left Front government had been cancelled. They erupted in joy and the ambience of the sleepy agrarian town changed dramatically.The villages of Baraberi, Khaserbheri and Goplanagar were the worst affected by land acquisition. Women in these villages came out of their homes blowing conches. People smeared green abir [coloured powder] on each others faces and burst into slogan-shouting.Every locality of Singur was celebrating. People shouted, sang and danced on the streets.We are all overjoyed, extremely happy, said Badal Santra, a farmer whose two and half bighas of land was acquired for Tatas small car project. Look at my thatched house, she said turning emotional. Does someone who owns so much land deserve a home like this? In the past ten years, how much rice and potato I could have cultivated. How many lakhs I could have earned, said the farmer who had refused to accept any compensation.I have been waiting for this day since 2006, said Manorajan Malik, father of Tapasi Malik, who was raped and killed for protesting the land acquisition. I am grateful to God that the farmers have finally got what they fought for."

India had demanded market access for products including non-basmati rice, pharmaceuticals and several fruits & vegetables among others.Indias goods trade deficit with China has surged from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16. Beijing has been denying market access to India's non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its concerns included the likelihood of a pest called Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.China was the worlds largest rice importer in 2015-16 followed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq.Mill inspectionOfficial sources said after several requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials have finally agreed to visit India during September 19-28 to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are situated in states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.To export to countries including China, it is mandatory for Indian rice exporters to be registered with the NPPO  the Indian government body in charge for inspecting these mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO will assist its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection from September 19-28 for pest risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian commerce ministry is also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.The inspection is a very significant stage in the process, A. K. Gupta, Director (Basmati Export Development Foundation, foreign trade, World Trade Organisation-related matters & agri-export zones), APEDA, said. He expressed hope that following the inspection, China will soon issue a formal notification regarding permission for non-basmati rice exports from India.The Chinese authorities had carried out a similar inspection in 2009, following which in 2011-12, they gave their nod to basmati exports from India to China, Mr. Gupta added.Pointing out that the 19 mills are involved in processing non-basmati and basmati rice, he said, therefore, the inspection will cover both varieties.Rajen Sundaresan, Executive Director, All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA), said he was also hopeful that the Chinese authorities will shortly give green signal for non-basmati rice exports from India to China. He said a recent joint survey done by AIREA and the leading agro-chemical (including pesticides) firm UPL found that the allegations regarding the presence of Khapra beetle in processed Indian rice were wrong and vastly exaggerated.Pakistani importsPointing out that China imports non-basmati rice from Pakistan, Mr. Sundaresan said Beijings objection to Indian non-basmati export seems more political in nature than anything else.Trade sources said there are reports of rice (basmati & non-basmati) exports from India to China happening through Hong Kong and Thailand. In 2015-16, India exported 6.2 million tonnes of non-basmati rice worth Rs.15,000 crore, he said."

We've had enough of those, really . Newage eateries are using a host of exciting ingredients from across the world and far-flung corners of our country  from Bulgur wheat to kokum, unagi to chorizo and more -to rustle up lip-smacking delicacies that will leave you surprised, excited and craving for more! Check these out...SRIRACHA, FROM ASIABUFFALO WINGSBODEGA CANTINA Y BARSriracha, a spicy sauce, is definitely one of the biggest food trends in India this year. Sriracha is highly flavoured, and is used extensively in Thai cuisine. For Bodega Cantina's Buffalo wings, they home-make the Sriracha. ""Our Sriracha is inspired by the original and made with different kinds of chilii and vinegars and then fermented for a long time,"" says owner Urvika Kanoi.LAVASH, FROM WEST ASIALAVASH CRACKERSCRAVE FOODWORKSLavash is a kind of flatbread that is widely consumed through the entire region. Though it is commonly believed to be Armenian in origin, food experts also claim that it has Iranian roots.The lavash crackers at Crave Foodworks are a relatively newer take on the soft flatbread, that's crispy and spicy, and can be had with or without dips or sauces. In this restaurant, it is served with classic hummus or labneh.GUNKAN AND NORI, FROM JAPANIKURA GUNKAN MAKIFUJIGunkan maki is a more complex kind of sushi, commonly known as battleship or warship sushi. Ikura, which is salmon roe or the fully ripe egg mass of the fish -just like caviar -is one of the more uncommon soft toppings used to make this sushi. Another uncommon ingredient used is the nori -a Japanese edible seaweed which comes in sheets. If you are all for gastronomic adventures, this one should be on top of your must-check-out list.KOKUM, FROM THE WESTERN GHATSKOKUM RITASPICE KRAFTIf you are a fan of the ubiquitous margarita, but also have a taste for the indigenous, Chef and owner Sambit Banick will recommend to you the Kokum Rita.""To the classic cocktail, we had a very interesting twist -that of the kokum fruit. I get my kokum saar, which is the extract of the Indian fruit from Khamkaar in Mumbai, a very old and well-known shop that stocks all kinds of pickles and spices. It is authentic and we use to it serve our indigenous take on the Margarita,"" says chef Sambit.BULGUR WHEAT, FROM WEST ASIATABBOULEHCALCUTTA STORIESBulgur wheat originated in Bulgaria and is a broken wheat rich in fibre. Bulgur is a common ingredient in Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Syrian, Israeli, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. For Tabbouleh, which is essentially a salad, the wheat is steamed and tossed with three-coloured bell peppers, cucumbers and black and green olives. Now that's what you call a bowl of freshness.CHIA SEEDS, FROM MESOAMERICASUGARFREE FIG AND DATE KULFICAFE PRANAHChia seeds come from a flowering plant of the mint family, which is native to Mexico and Guatemala. Rich in B vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and loads of other healthy stuff, these seeds are traditionally used in drinks and sherbets. At Cafe Pranah, they use it in the sugarfree fig and date kulfi. ""It is a body coolant and adds a beautiful textural contrast to the richness of the kulfi,"" informs Rahul Arora, chef and owner of the cafe.QUINOA, FROM LATIN AMERICAQUINOA SALADHAKUNA MATATAGradually, but steadily, Kolkata is waking up to the quinoa phenomenon. A gluten free, organically grown seed, it is used in food in the capacity of a grain. The history of this seed goes back to the Inca empire, when it was known as the mother of all food, given its nutrient-rich status. At Hakuna Matata, the quinoa salad also has rocket leaves, grilled veggies, tomato, cucumber and pomegranate yoghurt dressing.PS: Nasa scientists are reportedly looking at quinoa as a plant to be grown in space.DUXELLE FROM FRANCE & MIRIN FROM JAPANSTIR FRIED SCALLIONS WITH MUSHROOM DUXELLE, SPICY MIRIN REDUCTIONSPICE KRAFTAt Spice Kraft, chef and owner Sambit Banick makes it a point to mix and marry cuisines. For their stir-fried scallions and mushroom duxelle, with spicy mirin reduction, the marriage is between classic French duxelles and a spicy Asian sauce. For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.WILD RED RICE, FROM NORTHEAST INDIAWILD RED RICESANTA'S FANTASEAA tribal dish, the wild red rice is big in the northeast food scene. It's unpolished, unlike the white rice we commonly use. ""The unpolished dhenki-chhaat chaal is full of nutrients. It might not look very shiny, but it is much better for our health,"" says Kaushik Ghosh, owner of Santa's Fantasea. In this restaurant, it is served with a gravy that is made from traditional northeastern herbs and the superhot bhut jolokia, or raja mirchi, as it is known in Nagaland.CHORIZO, FROM SPAINCHICKPEA CHORIZOBODEGA CANTINA Y BARA Spanish pork sausage, chorizo is increasingly becoming one of the staples at new-age restaurants in Kolkata. It is spicy, made from coarsely ground pork and seasoned with chili and paprika. It is widely used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. ""Chorizos are centuries old, but it is relatively new on India's palette. We buy it from a Spanish couple in Bangalore, who make the chorizos themselves, to preserve the authentici ty. The spicy pork goes wonderfully with the flavours of chickpea, and present it as tapas,"" shares Urvika Kanoi, head chef and owner of Bodega Cantina Y Bar.CHIMICHURRI, FROM ARGENTINACHIMICHURRI PRAWNSSMOKE HOUSE DELIThis is an Argentinian sauce, which is used as a dip with fried fish or grills. In Smoke House Deli, they make it from scratch, which is their take on the original chimichurri, and use it as a marinade for prawns.""The prawns are marinated in this sauce for 30 minutes, before being grilled and baked,"" said head chef Fatik Mir. Apart from infusing the prawns with a burst of flavours, the vibrant green chimichurri contrasts with the slight pinkish shade of the prawns.UNAGI, FROM JAPANUNAGI NIGIRIFUJISorry to burst your bubble, but Unagi is not the total state of concentration that Ross of FRIENDS claimed to have mastered. It is actually a freshwater eel that is a very common component of Japanese seafood. If that makes you squeamish, remember that Fuji uses this fish with wasabi, gari, rice and sushi vinegar to make a nigiri, which is also another form of sushi. Not take a look at the plate, doesn't this look like art on a plate?RIBOTIDE, FOOD ADDITIVENACHOS WITH CHEESE SAUCECREAM CENTREThe controversy surrounding MSG, a flavour enhancer widely used in southeast Asian cuisine, came as a huge blow to Chinese restaurants and food manufacturers. But then, as they say, when one door closes, another opens up. So now there are powder flavor enhancers in the market, known as Ribotides. These can be used in a way similar to MSG and are considered safe. It is a Japanese derivative and is used in the cheese sauce of Cream Centre, which is served with their nachos. Though the nachos cheese and mozzarella cheese here are both customized with secret ingredients, at least we know that they use a highly expensive flavour enhancer, which accounts for their huge fan following!COUSCOUS, FROM NORTH AFRICAVEGETABLE TAGINE WITH COUSCOUSTHE FACTORY OUTLETCouscous has been a part of Kolkata's menu for quite some time now. However, with the trend moving from traditional grains such as wheat and rice to uncommon ones such as quinoa and buckwheat, couscous is also getting its share of limelight. A traditional North African dish, it is made of moulds of semolina and flour. A dish in itself, more and more restaurants are deconstructing it to suit Indian palettes. It can be served with broth, veggies or meat. Sometimes it's had just by itself -a bowl of comfort food. For the veg tagine with couscous at The Factory outlet, they serve the steamed dish with preserved veggies."

Mangla said the directions to the police were issued in the wake of a number of specific complaints that the biryani vendors were serving beef. After Mewat, sampling will be done in other districts as well.Why just biryani and not any other preparation like mutton curry and kebabs? Mangla believes he has got the logic right. ""Selling beef openly is difficult,"" he says. "" According to the complaints we received, the vendors are mixing a little rice with the meat to camouflage it.""Haryana has one of the most stringent cow slaughter acts in the country with a maximum jail term of 10 years.The police have been told to immediately book vendors if they find beef. ""At the same time, we have also asked the food and drug administration to ensure early reports of tests,"" he said.Former minister and senior Congress leader from Mewat, Aftab Ahmed has termed the move as an attempt by the BJP government to embarrass and humiliate the particular community and a particular district. ""This violates constitutional provisions of people's right to work,"" he said. ""This is totally vague, unjustified and targeting of a particular community."" The Ayog has even pinpointed specific areas with beef trouble. These include Ghaseda, Nuh, Ferozpur Jhirka, Rawali, Nagina, Pingawa, Bhadas, Malab, Punhana, Shikrawa and Choukha.Mangla will be convening the meeting of preachers and the prominent persons in the district and ask them to spread the word that beef should be totally avoided during the festival.Arora, on the other hand, said the police have already started collecting samples. ""So far, we had selectively collected samples, but now the sampling will be random, targeting all vendors selling biryani,"" she said."
58f6d59fa3d24b0b70c2f7a7,Dark clouds over the PDS,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Dark-clouds-over-the-PDS/article14631425.ece,2016-09-10,"Indias Public Distribution System (PDS) has improved steadily during the last 10 years. The system used to be most ineffective and corruption-ridden, with leakages of around 50 per cent at the national level, going up to 80 or 90 per cent in some States. Around 2007, Chhattisgarh took the lead in reforming the PDS  making it more inclusive, methodical and transparent. Within a few years, the system was overhauled. Today, most rural households in Chhattisgarh have a ration card, and are able to secure their entitlements (typically 7 kg of rice per person per month) on time every month.The Chhattisgarh modelLater on, it turned out that the Chhattisgarh model (so to speak) was replicable. Odisha was among the first States to emulate Chhattisgarhs experience, with similar results. Many other States also initiated Chhattisgarh-style PDS reforms: broad coverage, clear entitlements, de-privatisation of PDS shops, separation of transport agencies from distribution agencies, computerisation, fixed distribution schedules, tight monitoring, active grievance redressal, and more.In the last few years, I have been involved in several surveys of the PDS initiated by independent researchers with student volunteers. In 2011, we studied the PDS in nine States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. We found that the system was working reasonably well for below poverty line (BPL) households: on average, they were receiving 84 per cent of their foodgrain entitlements from the PDS. A similar picture emerged from a follow-up survey in 2013. However, high leakages continued in the above poverty line (APL) quota, which tended to be used by the Central government at that time as a dumping ground for excess food stocks.The National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted three years ago, was  and still is  a chance to complete the process of PDS reform and ensure a modicum of food security for everyone. Under the NFSA, the APL category is abolished and eligible households come under two well-defined categories: priority households, entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at nominal prices, and Antyodaya households (the poorest), entitled to 35 kg per household per month. The PDS is to cover at least 75 per cent of rural households at the national level, rising to 80-90 per cent in the poorest States.Impending setbackIn June this year, we went back to six of Indias poorest States (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal) for an update. We found that four out of six had a fairly good PDS, with most NFSA cardholders receiving the bulk of their entitlements every month and relatively low exclusion errors. The last two, Jharkhand and especially Bihar, still have a long way to go. Even there, however, the situation is much better than it was a few years ago. In Jharkhand, for instance, the transparency of the system has vastly improved, and the official NFSA website is among the best in the country. However, recent progress is in danger of being undone soon due to the Central governments counter-productive push for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. This involves installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at PDS shops, and verifying the identity of cardholders by matching their fingerprints against the Aadhaar database over the Internet.This system requires multiple fragile technologies to work at the same time: the PoS machine, the biometrics, the Internet connection, remote servers, and often other elements such as the local mobile network. Further, it requires at least some household members to have an Aadhaar number, correctly seeded in the PDS database.This is a wholly inappropriate technology for rural India, especially in the poorest States. Even in State capitals, network failures and other glitches routinely disable this sort of technology. In villages with poor connectivity, it is a recipe for chaos. Note that Internet dependence is inherent to Aadhaar since there is no question of downloading the biometrics.Recent developments in Rajasthan illustrate the dangers of forcing biometric authentication on the PDS. During the last few months, the Government of Rajasthan has tried hard to enforce the system. The use of PoS machines is compulsory and every PDS shop has one. Yet, according to official data compiled by Nikhil Dey, only 61 per cent of Rajasthans foodgrain allocation found its way through the PoS system in July 2016, with a similar figure (63 per cent) for August. The rest is either siphoned off or delivered using the old register system  which of the two is hard to say since utter confusion prevails about the permissibility of using registers as a fallback option.Further evidence comes from Ranchi district in Jharkhand where the PoS system is also mandatory. In July 2016, NFSA cardholders in Ranchi district received less than half of their foodgrain entitlements through that system, according to the model website mentioned earlier. The situation was much the same in August.As in Rajasthan, it is not clear whether those for whom the PoS system does not work in Ranchi are getting any grain through the old register system. Officially, that is not allowed, according to local PDS dealers and officials (indeed, some dealers have been suspended for using this fallback option). Even if it happens unofficially, this dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the PoS system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst. The reason is that only PDS dealers know whether and when the register system is permissible, and they have no incentive to share that information with the cardholders. Quite likely, the new system is reviving PDS corruption in Jharkhand, reversing a healthy trend towards lower leakages in recent years.A short visit to a PDS shop just outside Ranchi quickly brings out the multiple vulnerabilities of the new system. Within minutes we met many people who had been deprived of their food rations for months because they had no Aadhaar number; or because their Aadhaar number had not been correctly seeded; or because their biometrics did not work, or simply because the PoS machine returned various error messages.Even those for whom the system works face huge inconvenience. Often they have to make repeated trips to the PDS shop, or send different members in turn, until the machine cooperates. Sometimes schoolchildren are asked to skip classes and try their luck at the PDS shop. This unreliable system causes a colossal waste of time for everyone.By the way, all this is one year after I was told by the Food Departments upbeat consultants that the PoS system is functional throughout Ranchi district.The Aadhaar juggernautIn spite of ample warnings, the Central government continues to push for compulsory Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. Incidentally, this is a violation of Supreme Court orders. The court did allow the use of Aadhaar in the PDS, but not making it compulsory for PDS users. Nor can the government invoke the Aadhaar Act to justify this move: the relevant sections of the Act are yet to be notified.PoS machines seem to be expected to ensure a corruption-free PDS. This expectation, however, builds on a misunderstanding of PDS leakages. The main vulnerability today, at least in the States I am familiar with, is not identity fraud (e.g. bogus cards), but quantity fraud: PDS dealers often give people less than what they are entitled to, and pocket the rest. PoS machines are ineffective in preventing quantity fraud. They may help in reducing identity fraud, such as it is, but that does not justify depriving people of their food entitlements when the technology fails.As with many other applications of Aadhaar, this one is proceeding like a juggernaut, without paying serious attention to the collateral damage. Instead, the Central government peddles bogus figures of Aadhaar-enabled financial savings (often relayed by unsuspecting columnists or economists) to justify further imposition of the technology. It is only when concerned journalists, activists or researchers make enquiries from the victims that we learn about the adverse effects of Aadhaar on the PDS.The Central government and its advisers pride themselves on their commitment to evidence-based policy, but this is a case where evidence is being systematically ignored to press on with technological solutions based on blind faith (handsomely nurtured by commercial interests). The drive to impose biometric authentication on the PDS must stop immediately to avoid further damage. There are better ways of plugging last-mile leakages, including the use of simpler technologies not dependent on the Internet. Imposing a technology that does not work on people who depend on it for their survival is a grave injustice.Jean Drze is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University.The dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the Aadhaar-based Point of Sale system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst"

But then, these were best kept another day.""He was calm, as always and asked me not to hurry up. He put his hand on my head and asked me to go home and take care of our grandson,"" said Archana while entering her home at Dhirendra Nath Ghosh Road at Bhowanipore Sakharipara on Friday. ""This is the happiest day in the last few years of my life,"" she added.Alongside her was her daughter-in-law, Swati, who had been active in politics along with her husband Swarup, campaigning for Mitra in the last assembly election, which Mitra had fought from jail but had lost.""Months after I had come to this house after my marriage, baba (referring to her father-in-law Mitra) was jailed and the house lost its head of the family. This is the worst situation any newly married girl can face. I am happy after almost two years, my baba will be back home and be with us,"" said Swati.She added that the entire family had spent a sleepless night on Thursday anticipating for the order of the magistrate. ""Now as the magistrate has granted bail to my father-in-law, our faith in judiciary has been restored. In the past two years, the circle of our life has revolved around home, hospital, jail and the court. I just hope no family has to go through the kind of turmoil we have been through,"" she said.Swati added that since Mitra was jailed, the family hadn't even performed rice ceremony of her son, Maharup, who is now aged one and half years. ""With my father-in-law back, we would now conduct the ceremony shortly,"" she said.Another relative said Mitra has strictly instructed the family to ensure there is no major celebration outside his home or on his way back from the jail. During November last year, when Mitra was granted bail, his supporters had whisked him from SSKM within few hours after Mitra had learnt that CBI was gearing up to challenge his bail at the high court. Mitra was rushed in an ambulance violating one way traffic and supporters from several parts of Kolkata had come to his house to celebrate the occasion with flowers and abir. Days later, Calcutta high court cancelled his bail and Mitra was back in jail.""We haven't planned any major celebration this time. We are constantly telling supporters not to go for any over the board celebration that can send a wrong message to the court leading to cancellation to his bail like last time. We have asked cops to help us and ensure there is no gathering outside our house,"" he said. State education minister Partha Chatterjee was also heard making a similar appeal: ""Don't do anything out of excitement that can harm Mitra.""But supporters from Bhowanipore and Kamarhati kept on crowding outside Mitra's home from evening. As hours went by, the crowd continued to increase, even as police asked them to move away. At one point of time, traffic movement even came to a stop because of crowd pressure.""He is like our dada. No matter if he stays as a minister or not, he would be our hero. He is the reason we follow the party,"" said Ujjal Das, who runs a stationary shop at Kamarhati.Like Ujjal, there were hundreds of others who had come with garlands, sweet boxes and abir, but Mitra loyalists and family members time to time urged them not to distribute sweets or play with green abir outside the house.The organisers of Agradut Uday Sangha , the puja organized at the Sankharipara alley where Mitra lives, said for the last two years, their puja had lost their glitz. ""Mitra was our guardian. This puja is his brainchild. He controls the crowd, takes the final decision on the theme, gets artists to perform for the cultural function and oversees the entire puja rituals. In his absence, we struggled to manage the puja by our own. Now that he is back, we are sure to revive our old glory,"" said Swapan Roy, the club secretary. Another club member standing beside him added: ""We have already won the award even before the start of the puja. Our dada is our biggest award this puja."""

(Are you from the PK team?) Thats the question on the lips of most farmers turning up for the roadshows as the Rahul Gandhi caravan rolled into Jaunpur, at the end of the first leg of his yatra that started from Gorakhpur and covered 100 Assembly constituencies in eastern-central Uttar Pradesh, straddling Awadh and Poorvanchal.The Congress party has only one MLA from these 100 seats at present  this is Samajwadi Party turf mostly, accounting for Muslim-heavy areas like Azamgarh.An answer in the negative to that question sees the farmer losing interest and turning away in quest of someone from the PK team.The reference is to Congress strategist Prashant Kishor, and this parallel buzz shows how the Congress party is building up some momentum in its bid to revive itself in this huge swathe of Uttar Pradesh.Prashant Kishor is moving around with a team of partymen who are armed with forms, where the most relevant entries relate to the loan/debt owed by the farmers. Locals are zeroing in on the team in the belief that this is a quasi-official exercise that will ultimately lead to a loan waiver, as Rahul has been promising in his speeches.Theres something markedly different here from the last Assembly poll campaign. There too, Rahul had campaigned but Akhilesh Yadav ended up getting the votes. But it was an optics-heavy approach last time  Rahul would walk through the rice fields, occasionally picking up a poor child on his shoulders. This time, he has focused more tightly on farmers issues. The tactics are more process-oriented.A well-mounted PK style campaign, it is aimed at gathering steam on the way, which it is doing.And its running on the shoulders of local leaders  they are gathering people, also providing funds for local coordination. Unlike the impression people in Delhi may have of a dormant party structure, Youth Congress and NSUI cadre are visible on the roads. Rahul, when hes travelling within a town, uses an open-top SUV. Bottles of water are kept at the ready (so that no repeat of Sonias Varanasi fiasco happens).On the highways, he shifts to a huge bus  done up with slogans in Hindi on loan waiver, cut in bijli (power) price and hikes in MSP. The faces of a lot of local leaders adorn the sides of the bus too, along with that of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi.Saturday afternoon, ahead of a two-day break for Eid, Rahul stops for lunch at a madrassa in Jaunpur. The bawarchi (cook) is from Lucknow, says an insider.Thats typical. A common touch, along with food fit for the nawabs.Heavy SPG deployment is of course part of the bargain. They are constantly sanitising the route.During a roadshow at the Malipur chauraha, an SPG man was seen sanitising the fat marigold garland that is to be put around Rahul over and over again. In his speech, he picks up one Guptaji for cross-questioning on the petrol price, job creation and topics like that.Janta trast, Modi mast (people in distress, Modi in delight) is a favourite one-liner for Rahul.After the Eid break, the caravan will resume its journey into central and south UP from Allahabad, K Raju, Rahuls close aide, tells Express. Just a two-day break, then we are back on the road. Less khat Sabha (cot conference) more roadshows."
58ff20807be9e0420db2d1b8,Bengal part of Patanjali's Rs 50000cr vision,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160912/jsp/business/story_107615.jsp,2016-09-12,"Haridwar, Sept. 11: Yoga guru Ramdev plans to invest Rs 3,000-5,000 crore to set up half-a-dozen plants across the country to manufacture Patanjali ayurvedic medicines and consumer food products. The company is also scouting for a site in Bengal to set up a rice-based food products plant. ""I plan to set up six plants as we cannot meet demands from our mother plant at Haridwar. In the east, I have identified Guwahati for an ayurvedic plant. I am also looking to set up a plant in Bengal to produce rice-based fast moving consumer goods, rice bran oil, packaged rice and more,"" Ramdev told The Telegraph. Ramdev claims that the Patanjali brand will have a turnover of about Rs 10,000 crore by the end of this fiscal and grow into a Rs 50,000-crore business empire in the next five years. The saffron-robed yoga guru has zeroed in on Guwahati, Jammu, Indore, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh for the plants. ""Till now, we have funded our own expansion. We are a zero-debt operation. Now, we will take loan from banks,"" he said. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, founded by Ramdev and his friend Acharya Balkrishna on the outskirts of Haridwar in 2006, has become one of the country's fastest-growing companies, producing a host of ayurvedic drugs as well as fast-moving consumer goods, including flour, rice, honey and children's health drink. It sells over 800 products. The Patanjali group, which has been witnessing frenzied sales, has started hiring business professionals from multinationals. Rivals such as HLL, ITC and advertising giant Mudra have been tapped for talent. ""Many nationalist-minded people working for MNCs want to join us,"" Ramdev said. He said the plant in Bengal would be set up to produce rice products and rice bran oil. ""We will be setting up units to produce refined oil without a chemical process. We will use the old process (kachi ghani) to refine oil. Processing of refined oil using chemicals, which MNCs do, is very harmful and can lead to ailments,"" Ramdev said. The plant in Assam will manufacture FMCG products to cater to the demand from the east and the Northeast. Patanjali Ayurved has reported a Rs 5,000-crore turnover in March 2016, up from Rs 450 crore in 2012, an eleven-fold growth in less than four years. ""We are building a chain of factories to support our network. We are also investing significantly in research and will run the whole gamut of stringent testing to check the safety of our products,"" said Ramdev. The impressive growth has come on the back of a well-knit team. Overhead costs have been kept low. Also, free-air time has helped to push sales. According to a research by Edelweiss, Patanjali's strength lies in pricing and low ad-spend. Its products are priced at about 15-30 per cent discount to competition, while its ad spend in the initial years were negligible compared with 12-18 per cent of sales for rivals. However, in the second phase of market penetration, Patanjali has seen a massive surge in print and points of sales advertisements, which analysts estimate to be worth about Rs 300 crore annually. Edelweiss said the company's growth was being driven by its largest-selling products, such as cow ghee (about Rs 1,200 crore in 2015-16), followed by toothpaste Dant Kanti and hair oil Kesh Kanti. Besides Patanjali noodles, it plans to introduce products such as Dant Kanti Advance, sugar-free chyawanprash, PowerVita, Seabuck thorn dietary supplement and powdered hair dye."

58ff14667be9e0420db2c52d,'There's a real sort of vibe & buzz about Calcutta',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160919/jsp/calcutta/story_108960.jsp,2016-09-19,"BRUCE BUCKNELL is here as the new British deputy high commissioner. He spoke to Chandreyee Chatterjee of Metro about Calcutta, cricket, culture and... cows! Welcome to Calcutta. Have you ever been to Calcutta before? Not before I arrived two months ago. I have been to India though. I did the usual British tourist thing. I went to Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Udaipur with my wife and sister. That was just over 18 months ago actually. And here I am back again. Did you know then that you would be coming to Calcutta? Nope, I had no idea. We have a system within our foreign service of bidding for jobs and I bid for this job well over a year ago, but after I had been to India. I wanted to come to India. Did you talk to anyone before you came over to Calcutta? I spoke to my predecessor (Scott Furssedonn-Wood) and my predecessor's predecessor (Sanjay Wadhwani). Sanjay and I were in the same school many years ago. Sanjay was very enthusiastic about his time here and Scott was enthusiastic as well. I had a good chat about various aspects, about what to expect and the delights of being in Calcutta and then also the fact that I cover quite a big part of India, so there is a lot of variety. What have been your first impressions of Calcutta? Well I have been here for a couple of months but I haven't been in Calcutta the whole time. We have a very interesting induction programme in which I have spent a week in UP and a slightly shorter time in Mumbai, which can't be more different from covering Calcutta and 13 states and one Union Territory. But I think it is really useful to see the other parts of India, to provide some sort of baseline for assessing Bengal with the other states. I've met lots of people so far. The point of the job of course is that we are supposed to get out there. This is our mentality, and this is a phrase that we've been using a lot - 'Global Britain'. But in the first instance it is getting out and seeing and looking and talking to people. The point about India of course is that it is very voluble. There are a lot of people you've got to listen to. There are some impressions (about Calcutta), but I want to take my time. I don't want to jump to conclusions. Your blog says that the British embassy in Belarus, when your were ambassador, was on Karl Marx Street. What was your reaction when you found out that your Calcutta address would be Ho Chi Minh Sarani? My reaction? Well what can I say?! Have you been to Vietnam? You should go to Vietnam. Vietnam is fascinating. This is a country that until about 20 years ago couldn't feed itself. But now it is one of the major rice exporters of South East Asia. Which just shows what can be done in transforming a country. All that is a long time after Ho Chi Minh but he was obviously a national leader in Vietnam. But of course the reason why this street was named Ho Chi Minh was I can see a little bit of political point scoring by the then regional government but we should take these with a touch of humour. You've also said in your blog that the contrast between Belarus and Calcutta couldn't be starker. Can you highlight some of them for us? That was partly seasons, I left in the middle of winter, I've arrived in the middle of monsoon. But the starkness is in just the sheer number of people. This is a tropical country as opposed to a continental one. There are so many differences. People in that part of the world, the Belarusians, are not particularly expressive, here, particularly in Bengal, they are very expressive, which is a very different culture to deal with. London and Calcutta share a lot of similarities, an extensive riverfront, architecture.... Any similarities that you've noticed? Good question, but I find it a little bit early to say. What I would say is London is one of the greatest cities of the world. Calcutta is a great city.... This is a place that clearly has had better times but it is very dynamic in terms of its intellectual capital and the people and the vibrant culture, all the talk and chatter and that Bengali thing, which is part of the reason why I am happy to be here. There is a real sort of vibe and buzz about the place. But the thing that you clearly have to do is to channel that. All these creative people, what are they doing? It is just that Calcutta seems to have lost its drive. India is developing, as I have just seen in Mumbai, I think the trick for Calcutta is to get that sense of identity and focus and to use the talents. Next year will be the India-UK year of culture coinciding with India's 70 years of Independence and one of things we'll be looking at is the Puja to think for inspiration for next year. What will be your main focus as the deputy high commissioner in the city and Eastern India? Well the first focus will be to get to know the region. I cover a large swathe of area and I'll soon be travelling to some of the other states. So that's a key priority. I don't want to rush into setting out priorities but there will be two particular aspects I'd like to talk about. First of all is this sense of collaboration and partnership. We have this history, we have a lot of common interests, and we have a lot of affinities. I hope to go and look at Eden Gardens and enjoy the cricket tour that's coming up. I'd like to find out how the Indians enjoy beating the English at cricket (laughs). There is sport and cricket, but there is more than that. I want to look at the broader aspects of this partnership. We are very open for collaboration.... We have all sorts of scholarship programmes, fellowship programmes like Chevening. We also have research links with India through the Newton Bhabha programme. I would definitely be looking forward to talking to young people and going to universities. One of the areas is perhaps the fact that there is great heritage in the city but there aren't that many visitors. So it is not just Jaipur and Agra, it is also Bengal and Calcutta. There are lots of jewels that I didn't know like the Victoria monument. There are all sorts of aspects that we could actually do more of in the future. How does UK industry perceive the business climate in Bengal today? Bengal hasn't always had a positive image.... You are absolutely right. I think that is a bit of an issue but that's an issue not just for me but for everybody who lives and works in this part of India. As I said earlier, it's the perception. There is always a lag with perception isn't there? You think the perception is foggy London, it's the one I was constantly coming against in Belarus, well actually that was from the 1950s due to the burning coal, London used to be terribly foggy. I think there is that sort of perception back here. Some British companies are invested here - British Telecom, who have taken advantage of outsourcing here. So yes, there is a challenge. Yes there may not be as much obvious interest but Calcutta is a centre/entry point and if there is a bit more investment in infrastructure there is a great possibility to improve the connectivity with and through Bangladesh and beyond. But these aren't things that will happen overnight. But in the mean time, just to see the development of places like Salt Lake, New Town and Sector V... that is changing. Obviously a key focus for my organisation is to promote trade between Britain and India. It is no secret, we are here to sell to India, Indians want to sell to us. It is a two-way flow. And exactly the same with investments. We'll be looking to support that as much as possible. Our mutual prosperity is obviously of great interest to both sides. Coming to your Twitter bio... you've said one of your interest areas is cricket.... Your favourite all-time and current English cricketers? Well I grew up, I was left-handed, when David Gower was playing. He was effortless, very stylish. I don't intend to fly planes like he did but I used to think I was like David Gower! I could hardly hit the ball off the square, but that was me. He was great to watch, he was graceful. I will put my foot in it completely now by saying that of the Indian batsman I've watched, it was Sunil Gavaskar. I mean I grew up seeing him bat. He was just very neat and tidy for such a small man and he played those West Indian bowlers. He was great. Of this generation, I think Rahul Dravid. He was so elegant. He got the elbow up and played so neatly. Right now I think Virat Kohli is the player. There are two of them actually. Kohli and Joe Root. Then there is young Kane Williamson. I haven't actually seen Williamson but Root and Kohli, they play, it's not slog cricket. Kohli's scored more fours on the ground playing 20:20, he doesn't hit sixes, he hits fours. That's what it is. I am somewhat traditionalist in that respect. While on Kohli vs Williamson, will you be watching the India-Zealand Test match at Eden Gardens from September 30? Well I am not in town on September 30 but I will try and catch a bit of the match later if can slip out of office for a bit. Team England is going to Bangladesh in October. Will you be hopping over for it? Well I would like to but the issue would be just time. I mean it is my first three months. If I can take leave I will go. But, you know, I have to do my job (shrugs and laughs). Don't you follow football? I love football. I love a lot of sports. I am slightly amazed by how much interest there is in English football here. I think this season in going to be fascinating. Leicester City winning last year, that was fantastic.... I would have loved to have gone to a Calcutta Derby (East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan). Unfortunately their games are mid-week and mid-afternoon. There is ISL. Atletico de Kolkata.... We gave the world football and when was the last time we won a trophy? Everybody seems happy and that's fine! Which is your team? Well my team... well, I am again a traditionalist. I was born just outside a town called Redding in Southern England and it has had three seasons in the Premier League. It has done very well, partly because of the wealth of the town. I don't have one set team. I'd say I'd prefer Leicester to win again, of course. The other interest area you've mentioned in your Twitter bio is cows... have you caught the irony of being in a country where cow politics is at its peak? I know. You know I wrote that before cow politics came to the fore. That's purely because I'm a farmer's son. I grew up with cows. My father was a farmer, my grandfather was a farmer, my great-grandfather was a farmer. So I grew up with cows. It's just a part of my past. I have gone to extent that I can even tell you roughly what the cow population is in India and what it is in Britain. I think it is one cow for 10 people, roughly in India, and one for every 50 in Britain. I'll write about cows in the future. I am going to discover how much milk you get from cows in India as compared to Britain! What are you looking forward to doing here when you are not being the deputy high commissioner? Well I need to get fit, so I am trying to lose weight. I am definitely going to travel around. We have lots of things to visit. I have got to go and touch the turf at Eden Gardens and cross-examine the groundsman I hope! I am going I hope very soon to Bhubaneswar and I am looking forward to seeing the temples there. There are lots of things; it is so big, so vast, and so diverse. Then there is the Northeast which is another world of places to visit. It is a pretty full agenda really and I am delighted to be here. What is your message for Bruce Bucknell? Tell [email protected]"

Department will now initiate proceedings under the income tax Act under which penalty and taxes will be levied on the firm.A few days back, the income tax department tracked black money worth Rs 6.5 crore from one of the Ludhiana-based garment manufacturers on Bahadurke Road and Veer Nagar. According to sources, the I-T department had found evidence of more evasion by these firms."
590493be7be9e04154df8b97,Record grain output should boost efforts to extend farm insurance and electronic trading platforms,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/record-grain-output-should-boost-efforts-to-extend-farm-insurance-and-electronic-trading-platforms/,2016-09-23,"The record production of 135 million tons of food grains in the kharif season, which is 11 million tons higher than in the previous year, is a major relief that will give a big boost to the rural economy and stimulate overall demand in the economy. The good Southwest monsoons this year is expected to boost production of most crops above last years levels. Given that food crops account for around two thirds of the agriculture output, and that kharif grain contributed around half the total annual grain output, it is a good breakthrough for the agriculture sector where growth has slumped from a high of 4.2% in 2013-14 to a negative 0.2% in 2014-15 and a meagre 1.1% in 2015-16.Improved supply of food grains will also help soften food prices which has been one of the bugbears that has rankled policy makers, especially the central bank which has had a tough time trying to hold down inflation rates. This is especially because rice output has gone up to record highs. The higher coarse grain output, primed mainly by the record output of maize, will also help bring down prices of an important product consumed by low income groups.Especially reassuring for the government is the surge in output of pulses by more than half to 8.7 million tons mainly boosted by the significant improvement in area and productivity of tur and urad dal. This would help bring down pulse prices, which has hit the roof for some time now, and help cool down food prices substantially.Among other major crops oilseeds have also registered a boom in output this year. However, sugarcane production is expected to be hit in the current year. However, the surprise is the increase in cotton output despite the fall in cropped area, mainly due to the increase in productivity. Overall the first advance estimates of crop production in the middle of fiscal year will be a major boost to consumer and investor confidence in the coming months.Given the optimism on the farm front this is the ripe time for the government to push forward with its efforts to extend important schemes like the extension of farm insurance and e-marketing to a majority of the farm households. Though the number of farmers benefiting from the national agriculture insurance scheme has gone up in recent times only about a fifth of the farmers has been covered in the last kharif crop. Numbers show that crop insurance covers at least half the farmers in only two states: Maharashtra and Rajasthan. However, in states like Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh less than a tenth of the farmers are covered by crop insurance.The other important intervention of the NDA government has been on extending ecommerce facilities to farmers. The idea is to extend electronic trading facilities in 585 regulated wholesale markets by 2018 so that farmers can trade the produce across the nation without any hurdles. Though the plan was to link up 200 markets by September this year and another 200 markets by March 2017 the government has been able to link up only about 23 wholesaled regulated markets in 8 states to the national portal.This not only points to the lackadaisical approach of the states government to freeing the farmers from the clutches of the middlemen but also the strong political links of the trader cartel which not only deprive the farmers of the gains of any increase in food prices but also cause supply bottlenecks to crash prices. Extending the reach of the farm markets should now get the top priority of the government and push it to roll out the program to meet deadlines."

They will march out at 8:30 am today to plant 2,000 saplings of over 50 varieties near KR Puram Railway Station.The trees will grow 10 times faster and density will be 30 times thicker, according to SayTrees, an NGO that believes in planting trees for better living. The objective is to grow a 100-year-old forest in 10 years.How will this happen? Durgesh Agrahari, head of partnerships and projects at SayTrees Environmental Trust, says, We are going to implement Miyawaki method of planting trees. It was introduced in Japan and it became super popular, but it did not catch on in India. This method of growing forest is going to be tried for the first time in the city, Durgesh said.The method was introduced by Akira Miyawaki, a Japanese botanist, by planting deciduous trees close to each other in a small pit. Akira Miyawaki, now 88-years-old, also plants trees in coastal areas in Japan to combat tsunamis.In 2014, an NGO in Coimbatore, Siruthuli, had tried this in a small way. They had covered 2,000 sqft but in Bengaluru, it will be an acre. The Bangaloreans will also further the project by keeping in mind the evaporation process of the soil.The idea originated while brainstorming and the NGO sought permission from the railway authorities for afforestation of a barricaded land near the KR Puram Railway Station. They got the permission and added facilities such irrigation.""We are encouraging NGOs and alters to plant as many trees as possible for a greener Bengaluru. In fact various organisation and even our department have planted over 80,000 trees in last two months. We plan to plant that amount in next one month,"" said Sanjiv Agarwal, Division Railway Manager of Bangalore.The land was de-weeded ten days ago and the soil is dug three and a half feet deep to insert the saplings.The dug-out soil is mixed with rice shaft, cow dung and dry coconut powder in the right proportion which will make the soil nutritious and porous, says Durgesh. The saplings will be planted strategically.Regular watering will be needed and rice straws will be scattered over the ground to avoid evaporation.The saplings have been procured from villages in and around Hyderabad and contains varieties such as banyan, guava, peepal, tamarind and Indian almond.Since regular de-weeding will be necessary, the NGO has employed 15 people to look after the forest and two workers will be permanently employed, says Durgesh.The urgency to grow a forest comes from a fear that we are running out of time. It is said the World War III will be for survival and the time is now to save what we have in the planet. People are buying oxygen bottles now and we believe natural resources should be free of cost. Responsibilities to preserve resources should be now before we run out of time, said Durgesh.The Miyawaki initiative is a CSR project of Mercedes-Benz in collaboration with SayTrees. Personalities such as violinist Aneesh Vidyashankar and actor Vasishta Simha are expected to be there but confirmation is pending.The event was originally planned to be held on September 17 but the Cauvery issue postponed it to today"

Everywhere is the thrumming of sewing machines, the hum of fans, the faint burning smell of steam irons. On narrow tables that run between the machines, half-assembled Marks & Spencer miniskirts are thrust forward by fistfuls. The tailors, absorbed in the task of finishing 100 pieces per hour, for once turn their heads to look.The new girls smell of the village. They have sprinklings of pimples. They woke well before dawn to prepare themselves for their first day of work, leaning over one another's faces in silence to shape the edges of each eyebrow with a razor blade. Their braids bounce to their hips, tight and glossy, as if woven by a surgeon. On their ankles are silver chains hung with bells, so when they walk in a group, they jingle.But it is impossible to hear this sound over the racket on the factory floor. The tailors glance up for only a moment, long enough to take in an experiment. The new workers  teenagers, most of them  have been recruited from remote villages to help factories like this one meet the global demand for cheap garments. But there is also social engineering going on.A government program has drawn the trainees from the vast population of rural Indian women who spend their lives doing chores. In 2012, the last time the government surveyed its citizens about their occupation, an astonishing 205 million women between the ages of 15 and 60 responded ""attending to domestic duties.""Economists, with increasing urgency, say India will not fulfill its potential if it cannot put them to work in the economy. They say that if female employment were brought on par with male employment in India, the nation's gross domestic product would expand by as much as 27 percent.Experiments like the one in Bangalore run against deep currents in India, whose guiding voice, Mohandas K. Gandhi, envisioned a socialist future built on the small-scale economy of the village. They also collide spectacularly with an old way of life, in which girls are kept in seclusion until they can be transferred to another family through arranged marriage.Bangalore is the first city the 37 trainee tailors have seen. They are dazzled by the different kinds of light. Picking their way through the alleys around the factory, a column of virgins from the countryside, they stare up at an apartment building that towers over the neighborhood and wish their mothers could see it.Among them are two sisters, Prabhati and Shashi Das. They have come from a village at the end of a road, a place so conservative that the single time they went to a movie theater, their male cousins and uncles created a human chain around them, their big hands linked, to protect them from any contact with outside men. They are, as far as they know, the first unmarried women who have ever migrated from the village to work.Neighbors in the village are waiting to see what happens. The nasty ones say, with obvious relish, it will end badly. They whisper about migrant workers whose eyes were removed by organ traders while they slept. They say Prabhati and Shashi will be ""used this way and that.""Still, they go. Prabhati, at 21, is stubborn and able, and Shashi, two years her junior, pretty and fizzing with suppressed laughter. The two sisters hook pinkies when they walk down the lane that leads to the factory.""All the flirts and ruffians in the whole world must have been born on this lane,"" Shashi grumbles, but she is laughing. Attention is like water to her.The sisters are waiting, too, to see what will happen to them. They are both at the age when they could be summoned at any moment to be displayed to a family of strangers as a potential daughter-in-law. And each of them wants something else, something impossible.It is late May, the first day of their factory summer  of love letters folded into squares and dropped onto work stations; of fevers sweated out on the floor of a bare hostel room; of supervisors shouting in a language they do not understand, a couple of words  ""work"" and ""faster""  gradually becoming clear; of capitalism, of men and of a bit of freedom.It all started in March, in the drippy jungle of rural Odisha, when two distant relatives happened to meet on the roadside.One of the men had found employment as a ""mobilizer"" for Gram Tarang, a for-profit agency contracted by India's government to recruit and train workers. He mentioned that Gram Tarang was offering a cash incentive  roughly 450 rupees, or about $6.75, a head  to mobilizers who identified young women willing to enroll in a training program for garment factory jobs.The second man, Hemant Das, perked up, sensing the approach of a change of career. Hemant had an underfed look and teeth rimmed with tobacco stains. Among the first college graduates from his family, he had tried his hand at laying bricks, tutoring schoolchildren, programming computers, setting up wedding tents and waiting tables before finally falling back on the only job widely available to men here, working as a field hand for 200 rupees a day.Hemant was from a village called Ishwarpur, and as it happened, idle young women were something Ishwarpur had in great quantity. That they could be monetized came as good news.On its economic merits alone, Hemant figured, the government scheme would prove tempting: After two months of training, their daughters would be placed in a factory in the industrial center of Bangalore, where they would earn the legal minimum wage, 7,187 rupees per month, or about $108, which is more than most of their fathers make. Six months after arriving in Bangalore, they would be free to return home if they wished.Hemant set out the next day with a fistful of pamphlets and an uncharacteristically sunny disposition. But as he made his rounds of local families  30 of them, at least  they shook their heads. No.""Letting go of female children is dishonorable, in itself,"" explained Pramanand Das, who presides over an informal family council.Minati Das, the mother of a 19-year-old, got to the point quicker.""Not everyone wants a daughter-in-law who is a working woman,"" she said. ""They think she has lost her chastity.""Hemant would have been completely out of luck if he had not thought to try Karuna Das, who had two daughters of marriageable age  Prabhati and Shashi.Karuna was a sinewy day laborer, and he had roamed far from the village in his younger days to work in iron foundries in Chennai and Hyderabad. The gossip was that Karuna agreed to enroll his eldest daughters because he was unable to scrape together 100,000 rupees for dowries. That was undoubtedly the case.""They were reluctant to go anywhere because they were a bit scared,"" he said. ""I told them being scared is OK. OK, you're scared. Now you have to move on.""Prabhati has never seen a train, much less ridden in one, and on the 33-hour journey to Bangalore the earth seems to heave under her. As miles of paddy fields slide by, she vomits. Thatch roofs are replaced by peaked roofs, and she vomits. When they reach south India, rain begins to hit the window in fat spatters.It had come as news to Prabhati that the training program involved traveling 900 miles. But some intention had hardened within her. She wanted to prove the neighbors wrong. She did not care about her marriage prospects because, after examining the marriages that surrounded her in Ishwarpur, she had decided she does not want to marry at all.""I will go to Bangalore,"" she told her parents. ""If I come back, then you can get me married. If I don't come back, you can't get me married.""Shashi sits beside her retching sister and strokes her back. She had not wanted to come. Happy enough with a future as a housewife, she had focused her energy on making mischief. Among friends, she introduced herself as ""45 kilograms of hotness."" Out of the corner of her mouth came a stream of dirty jokes, and she made the other girls dissolve in helpless laughter by comparing breast sizes to vegetables (including, mournfully, a kernel of corn).Working on an assembly line was not Shashi's idea of fun. But Prabhati plunged forward, and, as usual, Shashi cruised along in her wake.The sisters, lugging a bag of clothes, sit with 35 other girls from Odisha who are making the same journey.They have all dressed in baggy purple-and-gray uniforms, with ID cards swinging from their necks. Their parents had made last-minute attempts to keep them from leaving, which had to be repelled with sustained tantrums. A girl called Baby, who is 18 and bespectacled, said that she had secured her mother's permission only by refusing to eat for two days.""They wanted me to come home,"" she says. ""I'm not going home.""The sun has not yet risen when they arrive at the hostel that will be their new home for the next six months: 137 women in 15 unfurnished rooms, every inch covered with girlish flotsam, underwear and bras drying on the window grates, sentimental verses penciled on the walls.Prabhati and Shashi's room is being painted, so on the first night 25 of them crowd into two rooms, so tight that one of their roommates stretches out on the kitchen counter.For the first few weeks, everything is new. Stepping out of the hostel, the trainees are surrounded by men: Men on balconies, men on scooters, men lounging in doorways, staring. The road is plastered with signs saying ""tailors wanted,"" and one girl gives a yelp of alarm, mistaking them for wanted posters.In rural Odisha they like to say that ""a girl's shyness is her jewelry."" But here, there is no space for the newcomers unless they make space for themselves. To cross the street  a throbbing two-lane road coursing with auto rickshaws, clattering cargo trucks, scooters carrying whole families  requires stepping in front of the slower-moving vehicles, if necessary stopping them with their bodies. The girls waver, and then they plunge.When they are introduced to a factory supervisor and dive to touch her feet, a traditional gesture of respect toward elders, the supervisor jumps back as if she has been stuck with a hot poker. She then assumes a slight crouch, as if preparing to defend herself from further reverence.Back in their bedrooms, the girls laugh hysterically at this. From childhood, they have been told that it is disrespectful for a girl to laugh out loud in the presence of elders. In the event of irrepressible laughter, girls must cover their mouths with anything at hand: the corner of a dupatta, a hand, a washcloth. This lesson, too, flies out the window. In the hostel they laugh like tractors. They laugh so loud they spit their water out.""I'm giving you 25 seconds to thread this needle,"" the supervisor says in Hindi. The recruits, whose native language is Oriya, barely understand. Thirty-seven tailors bend their heads, trying to guide frayed threads through a maze of eight loops.At the K. Mohan & Co. Exports Private Ltd., the girls have entered a world of machines: massive industrial extractors, laser cutters, a rapid-response protocol that kicks in when a needle tip breaks off.And yet, incredibly, garments worn in the West are still made by humans  nearly all of them women, working exhausting hours, with few legal protections and little chance of advancement, for some of the lowest wages in the global supply chain.As the trainees practice sewing straight lines on pieces of scrap fabric, supervisors pace the aisle, hoping to spot one with machine-like dexterity and speed. One of them slows, and then stops, beside a girl called Cuddles, the daughter of a truck driver. The supervisor blinks, looks again. This is  there is no other word for it  talent. She has covered the fabric with seams as straight as the lines on ruled notebook paper.Cuddles is among the first in the group to be integrated into an assembly line, bent over, eyes straining. Her task is to stitch together three small tags for the Marks & Spencer stretch corduroy skirt: one that identifies the brand, one that gives washing instructions and one the size, a scrap so tiny that it is nearly impossible to hold straight between finger and thumb. If she allows a tag to slip to the floor, or fly away in the gusts from the ceiling fan, her salary will be docked. She will be under pressure to complete this task 100 times per hour for eight hours, with one half-hour break for lunch, for a base daily wage of around $2.A man with a loft of dyed black hair steps out of his office to greet the group. This is N. Manjunath, the assistant general manager for human resources at the factory. He is recruiting rural workers through the government program because he is desperate: City-dwellers are no longer interested in factory jobs like these, with their low pay and punishing conditions, and attrition rates are high. Migrant women are more docile. This is what Manjunath is hoping.Manjunath thinks of himself as a kind man. But the complications of employing village girls have strained his last nerve: the weepy petitions for leave to return to the village for essential functions, like a father having a hemorrhoid removed; the domestic squabbles, which on one occasion ended in the consumption of toilet cleaner; and the ""love cases,"" in which a tailor, upon forming a romantic attachment in the factory, is summarily ordered home.Lately, when the girls come to him with complaints, he listens skeptically, with a sardonic smile. He assesses this latest batch of recruits, the second from Odisha, as ""lackadaisical."" He believes they have come here for an adventure, and will gravitate back to the village as soon as their parents tell them to come home.He is right to worry. After six months on the job, when the government incentives are paid out, around half the trainees brought in by Gram Tarang return to their villages. Only 40 percent stay longer than a year.It comes down to this: If the village has a plan for the girls, so does the factory. Leading them through the rows of machines, Manjunath wags his finger.""Don't get married too soon,"" he warns them.Within two weeks of their arrival, one of the sisters' roommates has eloped straight from the factory gates, not even stopping by the hostel to pick up her clothes. Those who remain spill their secrets to one another. Tanushree Behera sleeps entangled with a girl she calls her wife. Jayasmita Behera is divorced, having left her husband less than two weeks after the wedding.""If I had stayed,"" she says, ""my life would have been destroyed.""Sitting cross-legged on the floor, they compare notes on evasive maneuvers they use to avoid being shown to prospective in-laws, like Roadrunner slipping away from Wile E. Coyote. Shradhanjali Mallick, the beauty among them, says she used to have success with bouts of hysterical crying, but that moving to Bangalore has been more effective.""How can they marry me off if I am not physically present?"" she asks innocently, and Prabhati laughs. ""Let them hold a wedding of mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law,"" she says. ""Because that's the only kind of wedding they will be able to pull off.""This is not something Prabhati can laugh about at home. Her views on marriage were set in stone several years back, when a young wife in her village was set on fire in a domestic dispute. Prabhati has been arguing for years that she should be allowed to remain single, that her parents should proceed to fixing a marriage for Shashi, who is pretty and will get better offers.""I will become a nun,"" she says. But her parents flick away her comment, casually, as if it were a fly. So she thinks of escape.This is a subject she cannot discuss with her sister. Three years ago, Prabhati came across a mobile phone that a secret boyfriend gave Shashi as a way of keeping in touch, rigged, as if for espionage, with no audible sound or light, to be switched on at times when they have agreed to speak. Prabhati snatched the phone away and informed her father. Shashi screamed at her father that day  don't break that phone!  but she never saw it again. For months, she could not look him in the eye.The sisters were never as close again. When it comes to the future, Prabhati and Shashi keep their own counsel.By the first week of June, the new girls are praying for Sunday to arrive. Their joints hurt. Their backs hurt. They come home from the factory with fingers punctured by needles or sliced by industrial clippers. Sitting still for eight hours is strange and new, and at times, the boredom is maddening. They sing to their machines. They pull hairs out of their chins. Baby amuses herself by giving herself little scratches on the wrist.They are locked into the hostel except for ""out passes"" on alternate Sundays, which are granted by the factory human resources staff. A Gram Tarang ""life skills"" instructor makes the rounds inside the hostel, selling them 600-rupee jars of an Herbalife energy drink, which she tells them will help them keep up with the pace of work in the factory. It does give them energy  it includes caffeine and maltodextrin  but it also gives them diarrhea and eats up their remaining cash. This is no small problem, because they are running out of money for food.They count the days until June 10, when they will be paid for their first two weeks of work. Prabhati and Shashi, who had left home with 5,000 rupees, or about $75, find themselves with 100 rupees between them.""If there's no salary today, it's going to be a problem,"" Prabhati says.On June 10, they are not paid. Three more days pass, and they still are not paid. Outside the factory window the sky has turned black and the air is churning; a curtain of monsoon rain is about to sweep in.About 15 girls walk into Manjunath's office, hearts pounding, to demand their pay. He looks up from his desk, annoyed. The usual genial expression has vanished from his face. He explains that he cannot solve their problem: The company has opened bank accounts for them, but the bank has not delivered their ATM cards. Anyway, he dismisses the suggestion that the girls are running out of money. And who, he wonders, has given them the idea that they can make demands? He surveys the group in search of its leader.""My clear understanding is that if you have a basket of fruits and only one is not good, it will spoil the other fruit,"" he explains. ""You have to take one out.""When Jayasmita steps forward to say they have not eaten since yesterday, he swivels his head in her direction. He does not speak Oriya. ""What did she say?"" he asks a caseworker.The girls are promised an advance for rice and are ordered to leave his office. They shuffle out. They had been planning to stop working unless they were paid immediately, but their strike has lasted less than 5 minutes. Jayasmita slumps against a wall, and vows never to try anything like that again.""When you come to a new city,"" she says, ""you have to learn to care for yourself, and not bother with others.""The money for the first two weeks' work comes through three or four days later  after withholdings for pension, health insurance, lodging, food and kitchen furnishings, a grand total of 1,874 rupees, or roughly $28. This sum must last them for the next month. In the hostel room where Prabhati and Shashi stay, the amount of the paycheck is not relevant. They have never earned money before, only asked their fathers for it. A wave of happiness washes over all of them. They do not feel like girls, they say: They feel like boys.They transfer credit  30 rupees, 50 rupees  to the cellphones of their mothers, brothers, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and boyfriends, as if they were distributing sweets to celebrate some windfall.Shashi dances down the stairs and most of the way home. The money sends a wild thrill through her, so that she wishes she could fast-forward through the next month, and the month after that, and after that. So that life is a long string of paydays.The two sisters make a pact: They will stay in Bangalore at least a year. They spend much of their paychecks on nose rings for each other, tiny specks of 22-carat gold. They place them on each other in front of their roommates, beaming, their faces so close together that they could be kissing.Then Prabhati lies down on her stomach, full length, cheek to the cool linoleum. She is not feeling well.It is strange that one of the first girls to falter is Prabhati, who was the most resolute about staying in Bangalore.She has contracted a fever that comes and goes for two weeks. She stops eating and then stops talking; her eyes are so hollow that you could place a handful of rice in them. Shashi stays home, combing her sister's hair and forcing her to bathe. But then she must return to work, and Prabhati is left shivering on the floor.""In city life,"" Prabhati says, ""even if you are dead, people will just get dressed and go to the factory without being bothered ...(Continued on next page) .""Minati Mahji, who has lived in the hostel for six years, observes them wearily. Of 130 women who arrived at the same time, only she and her four roommates have stuck it out. She tried switching to another factory, but it was no better, and she wound up back in the hostel. Her pay has crept up to 9,800 rupees, or $146 per month.She has seen wave after wave of young women arrive from the countryside, freshly hatched, and she knows how it usually ends  with the girl's disappearance into that old world as a daughter-in-law.""Whatever they are planning, it doesn't happen like that,"" she says.Even through her fever, Prabhati knows she wants to stay. She tries to keep her illness from her family, handing her crisp new 500-rupee bills to a street-corner doctor who seems to give all his injections in the buttocks. It is Shashi who tells their father that her sister is sick. Her father calls the Gram Tarang training center, demanding that Prabhati be sent home, and the training center calls the factory.On the day she is to board a train to return to Ishwarpur, Prabhati stands at the edge of the roof, tears streaming down her face, and watches her younger sister walk down the lane toward the factory. The mood in the hostel sags.""The day she left, she told me: 'I told you I would stay a year. And I couldn't even stay for two months,'"" Jayasmita recounts.Minati doubts Prabhati will return. The family, having violated custom once by letting the daughters go, is not likely to do it twice.""People mean to come back,"" Minati says. ""But they don't come back.""It turns out factory life agrees with Shashi. She has been absorbed into an assembly line expected to produce 100 pairs of khaki chinos an hour. In the morning she takes her seat among hillocks of pants, and spends the next 8 1/2 hours in a work-trance, punctuated by the shouting of supervisors and a half-hour break for lunch. A whiteboard lists the per-hour target. They are always behind.Behind her in the assembly line, a potbellied man in his late 30s peppers her with the gustatory queries that pass for small talk in south India. Have you eaten today? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat more? She swivels in her chair to ask him, ""Would you like me to shove these pants down your throat?""Shashi finds it interesting that she, the screw-up in the family, is the one becoming a city person. She examines her face in the mirror for signs that she is becoming paler. She tells the family that Prabhati should not return, and that she cannot send money home this month. Instead, Shashi arranges for a meeting with Sunil, a boy from a neighboring village whom she wants to marry.Six years ago, when Sunil first asked Shashi to meet him in person, she was escorted by a female cousin and was too shy to look at Sunil's face. When he sat on the chair, she would go to the bed. When he went to the bed, she would go to the chair. Finally he told her to stop and listen. She sat still. Whatever it was he said to her, it made her feel that he was her own.""I love him, you know?"" she says. ""I do not know whether he is good or bad.""Now that her sister is gone, it is no longer necessary for Shashi to keep this a secret. It is a blessed relief, like taking off a shoe that is cutting into a tender part of your foot.On the August day when her third paycheck comes in, Shashi doesn't tell anyone what she has planned. Leaving the hostel means breaking curfew, but she persuades her friends to go with her. The small group threads its way along the darkening street, past rotting cauliflower and coconut shells. The girls are headed to a bright shop where smartphones are displayed in glass cases.The shopkeeper is about 25, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a glint of gold chain. He has seen many girls like these, provincials, fishing out coins at the vegetable market. He does not hide his disdain. But when Shashi announces that she wants to buy a 4,000-rupee Lava A59 smartphone, he is suddenly wide awake, respectful.Shashi's face is a mask of concentration as she repeatedly counts the bills and arranges them into a fan to show the shopkeeper. The girls around her are hushed. The amount is more than half her month's pay. It is the weightiest decision she has ever made.When they step back onto the street, something flickers across Shashi's face  triumph  and she pumps her fist. Back at the hostel, she drops her new purchase into the hands of her roommates, who immediately go through it, looking for WhatsApp, which they discovered the week before.Sunil will be calling soon. He has been badgering Shashi to make this purchase so she can send pictures over the internet. She disappears into the bathroom to splash cold water on her face. She is gone a long time. She lies for a moment on the floor, staring at the ceiling. Then she dials a number in the village.""Elder sister,"" she says. ""I got my phone!""September has arrived, and every day there is a new reason Prabhati cannot return to Bangalore. Her mother has stomach cramps. Her younger siblings' tuition bills are due. No adult male is available to accompany her on the train journey. Prabhati mentally reviews the cost of the ticket: 1,350 rupees for the train, 300 more for the auto rickshaw from Majestic Station. She jokes, a little nervously, that she should steal the money. A voice in her head tells her that if she doesn't go now, she never will.And yet that voice is becoming fainter. She can feel the village's drowsy peace overtaking her. Her mother says, in an offhand way, that it is time to start finding a groom. This is not how it was supposed to go. Shashi ensconced in the city, and Prabhati stuck in Ishwarpur.""Before, I was at home, and I didn't know anything, and it was OK,"" she says, dully. ""Now I know something, and it's not OK.""Back in Bangalore, the factory girls' fathers have begun to call. They expect them to come home on leave in December, after the six-month factory stint is up. Jayasmita's father says a marriage proposal has come from a man in Cattuck.""I tell them I'm not going anywhere,"" she says. ""The moment I heard talk about marriage, I hung up.""Shradhanjali says she will return, and plans to wriggle out of yet another proposal. ""If possible, I'll fight it off,"" she says, but sounds uncertain.""You know where you'll find her in a year?"" Jayasmita says, teasingly. ""At her in-laws.""The factory girls seem less afraid every month.Shashi sees her boyfriend, Sunil, as planned. He takes the overnight train in from Kerala , where he has migrated for work. They meet at a nearby gas station and walk in a park for most of the day, holding hands. At 4 p.m., he returns to the train station and boards another overnight train back to Kerala. She uses Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with him, as if the internet were two tin cans attached by a piece of twine. Every time they get into a fight, she uninstalls the apps.Her smartphone has become an appendage. She presses it to her ear while she is walking down the lane, striding over rats flattened into the pavement. Waking in the night, she rolls over and checks it for new messages. A group of her friends are toying with the idea of leaving the hostel, seeking higher-paid work at another factory.She is amazed at how far she has come.That's another thing: Shashi and her friends are not the new girls anymore. The new girls are arriving from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand . Their braids are tight and glossy. Dropping their bags in their rooms, they climb up to the roof to gaze at the 22-story building, which is the most amazing thing they have ever seen.Their eyes widen at the girls from Odisha, in their jeans and T-shirts. The girls from Odisha regard them with friendly condescension. They invite them into their rooms, as if they've been here forever."
590494fc7be9e04154df8d6f,Even the modak is going mod!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/75266/,2016-09-27,"It is the tenth day of the festival at my friends house and as she bustles around the house, she occasionally wipes away a tear. Surrounded by family and friends, there is frenetic activity as rituals are performed. For ten days now, there has been a constant flow of family and friends coming to give offerings of fruits, flowers, and sweets, all for the venerated guest at home who is about to leave their house. As the time comes to bid farewell to this guest, she feels an overwhelming sense of sadness.The guest the family is bidding adieu to is the elephant god, Ganesha and the festival is Ganesh Chaturthi. The end of the official monsoon season brings around one of Maharashtras best known and most beloved festivals. Celebrated by devotees as the birthday of Ganpati, Ganesh Chaturthi also marks the beginning of a feasting time for gourmands. This is the famous modak season, the dumpling that has been Maharashtras favorite sweet for centuries. Popularly known as ukdiche (steamed) modak, these rice flour dumplings are traditionally stuffed with coconut and jaggery and eaten warm with pure ghee.An interesting nugget my maternal grandmother used to tell us as kids is that shape of a modak is very similar to that of a coconut. As she would roll out the dough amidst a sea of interested grandchildren, she would tell us modak tales and enthrall us by showing us how the shape was in the form of folded palms for Namaskar: a sign of benediction for the god who would visit our house during the season. As we used to roll up the rice flour to stuff the ingredients inside, all of us would vie to make the best namaskar possible to atone for perceived misdemeanors.While the traditional modaks are stuffed with coconut and jaggery mix, the modak, in keeping with the times, has gone through numerous hybrids. So during the season, there are enough variations to whet even the sternest appetite. From modaks stuffed with dry fruits to those infused with strawberry or chocolate mixes, there is a modak for every palate. I have seen modaks steamed with fragrant turmeric leaves, others stuffed with mawa/khoya sugar and cardamom powder and still others stuffed with dried sweet mango. I have even seen modak flour made from dried fruit pulp and rolled out diligently and carefully before being stuffed with desiccated almonds!The festivities and sweets make ones diet go for a toss. But there is a way to ramp up on these delicacies and not worry about the numbers on your weighing scale. For the health-conscious among us, there are baked modak and sugar-free ones. The stuffings too have become less stuffy over the years. From grated beetroots, diced carrots mixed with coconut, oats, and fruit fillings, the modak season in the past few years has given itself a healthy twist.In all this excitement about the modaks, what is often times taken for granted is the little known and often overlooked delicacy called Nivagrya or nivagria. Typically made during the ten days of Ganesh Chaturthi, nivagrya are little savoury, steamed patties made from leftover ukad (rice flour dough) that was made for the modak casing. The leftover dough is kneaded together with fresh coriander, cumin seed powder, coarse green chilly paste, a bit of oil and salt, flattened, and steamed. The little patties are eaten with plain curd or a bit of peanut oil and are absolutely wholesome and delicious.Barely has the Ganpati festival got over and the monsoons gave a firm send-off, when a host of festivals come chattering around the corner, starting with the nine-day Navratri Fest. And for epicureans, this means a nine-day food fest despite the fasting that most people do during the period. As I prepare for a dandiya-ras deluge to hit the city, I am looking forward to savoring delicacies like aaloo mewawale, kacche kele ki chaat, singhaade ke pakode, singhaade ka halwa, kuttu ki puri, and fried arbi ki sabzi.But thats a blog for another day!"
58ff319b7be9e0420db2e504,Sushil dubs policy wrong,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160928/jsp/bihar/story_110627.jsp,2016-09-28,"The BJP on Tuesday attacked the Nitish Kumar government for withdrawing various subsidies for private investors, claming its wrong industrial policy is leading to growing unemployment. Senior leader Sushil Kumar Modi said: ""The government has abolished subsidies for investors. Incentives on land/shed for small and micro units at 50 per cent of the cost of investment and 28 per cent for large, medium and mega projects have been done away in the new industrial policy."" The cabinet gave nod to the new industrial policy this August and some of the other provisions that have been cut in the new policy include captive power generation subsidy, project report incentive, VAT and entry tax. His attack at the government on the sidelines of his janata durbar in Patna follows chief minister Nitish Kumar's demand for an all-inclusive central development policy to provide ""special help"" for growth of poor and less developed states. Speaking at the 72nd annual function of Bihar Industries Association on Monday, Nitish had maintained that the Centre's support was needed for the state's development. He asked industrialists to keep demanding special status tag for Bihar. ""Under the capital subsidy, potential investors used to get 20 per cent subsidy on plant and machinery according to the state's industrial policy 2011-16,"" Modi, once Nitish's deputy, said. ""But in the new industrial policy, all such subsidies have been abolished."" The BJP leader claimed that as Bihar is an agrarian society, maximum subsidies are given in agro industries. In the food processing sector, he claimed, industries used to get 35 per cent subsidy of which 60 per cent was provided before setting up the industries and the rest after. But all that has been done away with. Owing to 35 per cent subsidy given to the food processing industry, there was substantial investment in rice mills, pulse mills and cold storage. But the new industrial policy will put a full stop to new investment and investors have to claim subsidy on land after they pay for it. Echoing Modi's views, industrialist Satyajit Singh said: ""In the old industrial policy, it was easy for an investor to set up a factory as he used to get 35 per cent subsidy from the government and the bank would give 40 per cent of the amount as loan. But, now all such subsides have been abolished and the government is following a post-production reimbursement model (claiming subsidy after payment)."""

The Institute of Microbial Technology (Imtech) has sequenced the megagenomic data of microbes coexisting with basmati rice. With this, scientists have opened a big window of opportunity in this tiny white speck. They say that with access to such a data, there can be huge possibilities of new research to increase rice plant output and quality Megagenomics imply large-scale genetic data and sequencing of bacteria. One bacteria has around 5,000 genes and scientists at Imtech have sequenced genomes of 100 such bacteria. Imtech is one of 37 laboratories of Council of Scientific and Industrial Re search (CSIR) in Chandigarh.""The new data can also lead to research in using lesser resources like water and land to grow rice -a staple for almost half the world's population,"" said Prabhu B Patil , lead author of the study.In India, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh , Delhi, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are major basmati cultivating states. India's export of basmati rice fetches between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore annually.""The data can be a boon for farmers if it can identify those microbes of the grain which makes the crop drought, disease and shattering (during harvesting 1015% of the grains fall off) resistant,"" said Rameshwar Singh, project director, Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Delhi.It is believed that with the chemical and artificial treatment of rice, the original or native bacteria that coexisted with the plant had been suppressed. Exploitation of this genomic data might restore the native bacterial consortium as was in millions of years ago.Plants are host to numerous microbes that co-evolved over millions of years. These natural microbes in turn aid development and protection of plants in diverse climatic conditions. ""Analysis of bioinformatics by an expert can become valuable source for further research. Imtech has shown a new direction to the world. It is a breakthrough when the world is talking about food security,"" said Girish Sahni, director general CSIR.Patil's group at Imtech has published the `The rice microbiome' in Frontiers in Microbiology. It is the first megagenome database of seed microbiome of any plant. ""We have sequenced genome of bacteria found in basmati seeds. These bacteria would be contributing to boost rice's immunity to fight against diseases and other stressful conditions like less water etc,"" said Patil.While genome data of many plants is available, the microbial megagenomic resource of only a plant weed -Arabidopsis thaliana was sequenced earlier. The data generated by Patil's group is the first megagenomic information of microbes associated with an economically important plant.Samriti, who is the first author of the megagenomic study , along with Kanika Bansal, both PhD scholars associated with Patil at Imtech, is carrying forward this work."

But when it comes to producing rice, it has fallen behind the national average despite the area under paddy cultivation being more than other states.Over the last decade the all-India average of rice production stands at more than 2,000 kg/hectare (kg/ha). In the same period Odisha has steadily increased its production from 1,554 kg/ha in 2005-06 to 2,361 in 2012-13. But over the past few years the number has started declining. In 2013-14 the yield was 1,821 kg/ha while in 2015-16 it had dipped to 1,491 kg/ha from 1,989 in 2014-15.Explaining the change, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said in a written reply in the assembly recently: ""Odisha faces natural calamities like drought, cyclone, flood and untimely rain almost every year. Despite all odds, there was a gradual growth in rice production every year due to a number of steps taken by the state government. Effort is on to match the national average.""The reason for the sharp decline in production in 2015-16 was attributed to drought-like situation in as many as 27 of the 30 districts, official figures revealed. Over 200 farmers allegedly committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden though the state government claimed that most of the deaths were due to other reasons.Asked about the low yield despite paddy being cultivated in two-thirds of the total cultivable land, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor of OUAT S N Pasupalak said: ""Factors like low mechanization, poor nutrient management, structure of land and low irrigation potential are responsible for low production of rice in the state.""Among all districts, Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, stands at the top in producing highest amount of rice constantly for past 10 years. Other districts like Boudh, Dhenkanal, Nabarangapur, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur and Sundargarh have been recording high production of rice for past two years.Despite drought in 2015-16, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak produced 2,571 kg/ha and 2,505 kg/ha, respectively, among the highest in the country.""For increase in productivity, Odisha has been promoting modern methods like system of rice intensification (SRI), practice of multiple crops, soil testing, supplying quality seeds and augmenting irrigation potential,"" said an officer in the agriculture department.A number of centrally-sponsored schemes like National Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India, National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana are being implemented in the state to increase the agriculture productivity.Odisha has been winning successive krishi karman awards among category-II states for record foodgrain production.According to sources in the directorate of economics and statistics, states like West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are ahead of Odisha in rice production.."

Farmers, doctors, scientists and environmentalists in at least 150 locations across the nation questioned the safety clearance given to GM Mustard by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee 's (GEAC) technical subcommittee.Adding star power to the cause were filmmaker Vetrimaran and actor Rohini, aside from soil biologist Sultan Ismail, Supreme Court special appointee for TN food security Dr V Suresh and state traders union president Vellaiyan. The regulatory process of approval for GM Mustard is secretive, non-participatory, and unscientific, claimed scientists.City-based Newton Science Club founder P Ilangovan Subramanian explained, ""People need to understand the ill-effects of genetically-modified seeds. If you want greater yield, we create hybrid varieties. In the case of genetic modification, greater yield is achieved by crossing a mustard seed gene with an herbicide gene.""""The farmer will have no choice but to buy new seeds every year. The biotech companies are guaranteed large profits at the expense of poor farmers' food security."" Said Ilangovan.The protestors expressed alarm that the Centre is processing a GM application that chose not to reveal the fact that the genetically-modified organisms in question are herbicide-tolerant crops. ""This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from their employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food,"" said Ismail, adding that data from data from field trials of the GM crop has not been made public.Given that mustard is widely used in all cuisines across India, the protesters objected to moves by the Centre to approve transgenic mustard in the name of yield improvements. Alternatives to GM Mustard exist for yield improvements such as non-GM hybrids available in the market, in addition to agronomic innovations like System of Mustard Intensification (like System of Rice Intensification).Vetrimaran expressed his support to organic farming and voiced his opposition to GM foods entering the country. Rohini said, ""When Bt brinjal was approved, a people's movement broke out and the government was forced to ban the transgenic brinjals. The case of GM Mustard must be taken up the same way."""

Now, the state government and agriculture experts are keeping their fingers crossed over the impact the deficit will have on crops.The absence of a revival that was expected at the fag end of south-west monsoon has heightened possibilities of drought in the state, where paddy cultivation is at various stages. Fears of power deficit and increased pest and disease attacks on crops are also forming among all.Speaking to Express, S Sudevan, Director of India Meteorological Department, Thiruvanthapuram, said, Monsoon deficit in the state, when the south-west monsoon drew to a close on Friday, was about 33.7 per cent. Chances of any major rain spells are bleak at best for the next two weeks.He, however, said the north-east monsoon, which constitutes around 30 per cent of total annual rainfall of Kerala, was expected to be normal (90% -100% of the long period average, or LPA).IMD data said that while monsoon deficit was about 34 per cent at present, some critical areas in the state were already facing drought-like situations. As per the data, Wayanad was reeling under a 59 per cent monsoon deficit, while Thrissur was facing nearly 45 per cent deficit. The fact that half the states districts are reeling under almost 33-40 per cent monsoon deficit has further aggravated the agrarian sector. However, coming to their rescue is the Kerala Agriculture University (KAU), which is expected to come up with remedial measures on October 7 to tackle the impending drought-like situation in the state, in case another dry spell is experienced during north-east monsoon period. KAU had previously held a pre-rabi interface with researchers and extension experts to formulate steps to solve issues that may affect crops and plants in view of the anticipated water scarcity and rise in temperature. Said KAU Vice-chancellor Dr P Rajendran, A 35-40 per cent rain deficit may cause several issues of plant health management and crop production. However, farmers can withstand these adverse effects by ensuring crop rotation and adopting shorter-duration crop varieties and drought, pest and disease-resistant varieties during the season.Besides, farmers, agriculture scientists and government officials should be pro-active in tackling the situation, he added.Experts say the water scarcity may lead to metal toxicity, soil acidity, nutrient deficiencies, severe weed infestation and infestation from pests like rice bug, blue beetle and rice case worm, besides other diseases. For coconut farmers, who are already under great pressure following infestation of Red palm weevil and Richnocerous beetle that reduced the yield significantly, deficit rains would cause soil-related problems and deficiency of nutrients as well as white fly attack, they said, adding,"

She kept her promise and returned the land to the protesting farmers of Singur. Ironically, with that, Mamata celebrated the defeat of her own state government!On September 14, a fortnight after the Supreme Court found the acquisition process at Singur in 2006 done without due process of law, and ordered that the land be returned to farmers, Mamata  Didi to her followers and well-wishers  organised a meet at the hamlet in Hooghly district.Supposed to be an administrative event, it turned into a victory rally of her party. She declared that she kept her promises and handed out land deeds and compensation cheques to the farmers.Even though the defeat is to be counted on the columns of the erstwhile Left Front administration, in effect, Mamata was celebrating the defeat of the government she leads. And she could not be happier. What seemed impossible even a month ago is now a reality and she has been able to keep her most difficult promise. For her and for her party, life has come a full circle.This does not make Mamatas job any easier. Even though she managed to keep her word, when the land was acquired, she was in the Opposition. Later, the challenge was to stop Singur from happening and prevent the Left from acquiring the land. After this, the challenge was to wrest power.Now, the scenario has changed. She is the chief minister and cannot claim any unfriendliness with the industry. And with every passing day till January next, when Mamata has her annual Biswa Bangla business summit, things will get harder.With the annual ball in mind  where she invites and pampers captains of industry from India and abroad  her team has been working hard. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the states nodal agency, formed a committee six months ago and top officials have been travelling around the globe, seeking commitments of attendance. Mamata herself had recently been to Europe, meeting honchos from BMW and other companies to ensure the summit is well-attended.The challenge before her is to prove the summit is not just another gathering, but that there will be some serious commitments from the industry.It was keeping these aspects in mind that she announced from the stage at Singur on September 14 about the available land and invited Tata Motors, BMW or anybody else to set up an automobile factory. Insiders say she knows BMW is not likely to come calling, and that her invite was more for the sake of Tata.With her vote bank in mind, she kept at her policy of no forcible land acquisition and announced a number of sops, including state support to set up farming infrastructure once again, from one-time grants to easily available loans.At the same time, instead of ordering officials to demolish the factory shed at Singur, she put the process on hold, urging Tatas to take care of their belongings.This is in sharp contrast to her days of Singur movement, when she inspired supporters to break down the factory wall.Now, the administration has put up posters to prevent the same acts that became the hallmark of her movement back in 2006. Insiders also whisper of the back channels that she has opened up through state Finance Minister Amit Mitra, a former FICCI head.If getting industry is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, she also needs to deal with a number of undercurrents at Singur. At some of the villages in Singur, most residents are share-croppers and landless workers who formed the most militant faction of her agitation.Since they were the least to gain from the factory coming up, they were the most invested in the movement. Under the changed scenario, they dont yet know how long the states monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and Rs 2 per kg rice will continue. They also dont know what will happen after the dust settles since Mamata had nothing much on offer for them.Uncultivable landIn 2006, when the acquisition process started, the most eager section included absentee landlords, who formed nearly 70% of land-holders. Their eagerness stemmed from the fact that share-croppers and landless workers, till then backed by the Lefts farming organisation, Krishak Sabha, held an upper hand over the landlords.Added to this is the realisation that the land might not retain its earlier fertility. Of the total 997 acres acquired for the project, 300 acres have been used to build the shed, roads, drainage and other infrastructure inside the abandoned premises.Uncertainty has cropped up on whether these areas can ever be cultivable again. This has made a large section of land owners consider selling their holdings, now that they have got it back.Land prices plummeted once the Tatas left and even though there are willing sellers, prices remain uncertain. Then there is the local youth, who have seen the worst aspects of the movement and were witness to a changing economic scene. These youngsters coming from the middle class and agrarian families have lost it all to the political upheaval which hit their growing years at every step. And most of them want a factory to come up at Singur.The circle that came full over a decade has led Mamata into yet another circle. A decade ago, as a firebrand Opposition leader on the brink of ignominy, with hardly any political capital to show, things looked much different for her. The landscape, however, looks altered when she stares down from the chief ministers office.Mamata might get her name etched on pages of history but that will not help her get investment, while keeping her rural, agrarian vote bank pacified. In the end, a hard-earned victory could turn into a Greek tragedy, where the heros fate is sealed because of a weak heel."

But India is continuing cooperation on connectivity and economic issues all the SAARC members who are also part of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) that will be invited to the BRICS (Bangladesh Russia India China South Africa) Summit as part of the outreach program.Asked what steps are being taken that Afghanistan is not left out of the economic connectivity in the region, Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs Amar Sinha said: Chahbahar (port in Iran) is our way forward. President Ashraf Ghani talked about the air corridor we wish to establish through Kabul and Qandahar.The Secretary without naming Pakistan added that in terms of isolation a country that has closed its borders with two neighbors is the one isolated in the region. . in terms of isolation, you have to see who is isolated because ultimately isolation is not just geographic it is also a mentality. If any country decides to shut its only two borders it has with both the neighbors, I think that country is the most isolated, Sinha said. Pakistan has refused to allow passage to Indian rice to land-locked Afghanistan. Recently Pakistan also refused transit to Afghanistans horticulture products.Besides economic connectivity, the issue of terrorism will be at the forefront of the BRICS Summit on October 16 to be attended by all the Heads of the States. Even though India will not be taking the issue of Chinas blocking Indias attempt to get Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) Chief Masood Azhar blacklisted with President Xi Jinping bilaterally, the supply of arms and ammunition to terrorist will be the focus. ""At NSA-level meet (of BRICS countries), we have also actually shifted the goalpost a little by talking about not only sources of finances but also sources from where they (terrorists) get arms and ammunition. These will be reflected in the BRICS discussions,"" Sinha added.Strong statements from the member countries can be expected at the end of the summit on ending the differential policy towards good and bad terrorist. He added that ""there would be very strong paragraphs (in the BRICS outcome document) on terrorism including how to deal with countries that provide sanctuaries and safe havens and how to cut down the financing."

Despite enjoying a full five-year term in office, despite overseeing a major and defining shift in economic policy, despite effecting innovations in foreign policy such as the Look East strategy, Narasimha Rao had thus far not got his due from scholars and commentators on Indian politics. There were two reasons for this. One was his conspicuous failure to prevent the destruction of the Babri Masjid and the communal riots that followed, a failure that in the eyes of many nullified his other achievements.Read: PM Modi pays tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur ShastriA second and perhaps more important reason for the neglect of Rao was that he had fallen foul of Sonia Gandhi. After she became Congress president in 1998, Mrs Gandhi systematically erased Rao from the memory of the party and its members. To be sure, this was part of a wider effort to define the Congress as the property of a single family. While the achievements (real and imagined) of Nehru, Indira and Rajiv were magnified and broadcast, those of other Congress leaders were underplayed. In this rebranding the reputations of many remarkable Congressmen (and Congresswomen) suffered, but Raos perhaps most of all.The attention now belatedly paid to Rao is welcome. But the time has also come to revisit the legacy of a prime minister even more considerable than Rao, likewise a lifelong Congressman, who too has been largely erased from his partys history by the family that has come to dominate it.This is Lal Bahadur Shastri. Not long after Shastri became prime minister, he stopped in Karachi, then the capital of Pakistan, while on his way home from Cairo. He was met at the airport by President Ayub Khan, who, noticing his tiny frame and 26-inch chest, wondered how such a little man could rule such a large nation. It is said that this sight of Shastri in the flesh convinced Ayub (himself an Army General) that the time was ripe for a fresh incursion into Kashmir. He was convinced that the new leader of India would not be able to effectively defend his country when war came.Read: 1965 war: We got air superiority over Pak in three daysAyub was mistaken. For, with his outstanding defence minister, YB Chavan, Shastri had already overseen the long overdue modernisation of our armed forces. In August 1965 Pakistan sent infiltrators into Kashmir, following this in early September with a major armed offensive. The Indian Army fought bravely, but the pressure on them was intense. In an inspired move, the prime minister ordered a fresh front to be opened in the Punjab, which immediately put the Pakistanis back on the defensive. Under Shastris leadership, the armed forces acquitted themselves extremely well in the war of 1965, thus erasing memories of their ignominious defeat at the hands of China three years previously.The slogan most associated with Shastri was jai jawan, jai kisan. For Nehrus successor keenly understood the link between self-sufficiency in food and self-reliance in politics. It was Shastri who, along with another remarkable cabinet minister, C Subramaniam, laid the foundations of the Green Revolution, although it was Indira Gandhi who came to claim the credit, since the gains from the new strains of wheat and rice took a decade to fructify, by which time Shastri, sadly, was dead.There are many reasons to remember Shastri now, when the agrarian sector is urgently in need of renewal, and when tensions with our always difficult neighbour are once more on the rise. Shastri was a self-effacing man, who wished to be remembered by his actions rather than his words. But when he did speak, he chose his words very wisely, never more so than in a speech he delivered at Delhis Ram Lila Maidan in late September 1965, shortly after a cease-fire had been brokered by the United Nations.The BBC had described the conflict that had just ended as a war between Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. In his speech in the Ram Lila Maidan, Shastri refuted this pernicious allegation. The meeting was chaired by a veteran nationalist who happened to be a Muslim by birth. The speaker before Shastri was a Anglo-Indian lawyer who had been a prominent member of the Constituent Assembly. When it came to his turn to speak, the prime minister drew the crowds attention to the company he was then proudly keeping. So Shastri said: Mir Mushtaq who is presiding over this meeting is a Muslim. Mr Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics . This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims itself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose [and] worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.Read: City Cong pays tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, ShastriThe attention recently paid to PV Narasimha Rao was because this year marks the 25th anniversary of the liberalisation of the Indian economy. However, the speech of Shastri I have just quoted is not just timely, but also timeless. It inevitably comes to mind when there are troubles with Pakistan. Yet it remains compellingly relevant in times of peace too. If India is to survive and thrive, religion must never be a factor in the political life of the Republic.Ramachandra Guhas most recent book is Gandhi Before IndiaTwitter: @Ram_GuhaThe views expressed are personal"

There is a nexus between rice shellers, officials of procurement agencies and Arthiyas (commission agents), who are operating in several mandis and denying the full MSP of paddy to growers on the pretext of high moisture content, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Haryana) president Gurnam Singh said on Wednesday.He claimed that on an average, farmers were being paid at least Rs 100 per quintal lesser than the MSP of the crop.The Centre has fixed MSP of paddy at Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety and for Grade A variety it is Rs 1,510 per quintal.Moisture contentHe said rice shellers have deployed their own men to determine the moisture content in the mandis and usually showed the moisture in the crop beyond the limit of 17 per cent and then imposed arbitrary cuts on MSP.We even observed in one of the mandis in Haryana that despite the moisture content in paddy was 14 per cent, some farmers were paid Rs 1,300 per quintal, he said adding the situation was bad in mandis of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal and Yamunanagar.This loot of farmers came even as the Manohar Lal Khattar government had given relief to growers few days back by way of procuring paddy with up to 22 per cent of moisture content by adjusting the weight in accordance with the moisture content, he further said.The situation in poll-bound Punjab with regard to procurement is also similar with farmers in neighbouring State also claiming lesser prices of paddy in the ongoing procurement season and even resorting to protest in some parts of the State. Farmers are being harassed in mandis. They are not being given MSP of their crop, claimed BKU (Ugrahan) General Secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan.There is an anomaly in the meters of moisture content.When government agencies official check paddy, the content remains under the specified limit.

There is a nexus between rice shellers, officials of procurement agencies and Arthiyas (commission agents), who are operating in several mandis and denying the full MSP of paddy to growers on the pretext of high moisture content, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Haryana) president Gurnam Singh said on Wednesday.He claimed that on an average, farmers were being paid at least Rs 100 per quintal lesser than the MSP of the crop.The Centre has fixed MSP of paddy at Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety and for Grade A variety it is Rs 1,510 per quintal.Moisture contentHe said rice shellers have deployed their own men to determine the moisture content in the mandis and usually showed the moisture in the crop beyond the limit of 17 per cent and then imposed arbitrary cuts on MSP.We even observed in one of the mandis in Haryana that despite the moisture content in paddy was 14 per cent, some farmers were paid Rs 1,300 per quintal, he said adding the situation was bad in mandis of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal and Yamunanagar.This loot of farmers came even as the Manohar Lal Khattar government had given relief to growers few days back by way of procuring paddy with up to 22 per cent of moisture content by adjusting the weight in accordance with the moisture content, he further said.The situation in poll-bound Punjab with regard to procurement is also similar with farmers in neighbouring State also claiming lesser prices of paddy in the ongoing procurement season and even resorting to protest in some parts of the State.- PTI"
58f4ba8860de4776e3694129,Soft rice grown in Assam in line for GI tag,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161014/jsp/northeast/story_113365.jsp,2016-10-14,"Boka saul Jorhat, Oct. 13: A paddy variety from Assam, on which Ahom soldiers subsisted during the Mughal era, is in the race to get a geographical indication (GI) tag. A GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities that are unique to that origin. Two organisations - Lotus Progressive Centre, Nalbari, and Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Guwahati - recently submitted additional documents to the Intellectual Property India (IPI) office in Chennai to get a GI tag for boka saul, a soft variety of rice. The two organisations had applied for the GI tag last year. Tapan Baishya, secretary of Lotus Progressive Centre, said they recently submitted additional information on the paddy's historical background, area were it is grown and logo, among others, with the assistance of Assam Science, Technology and Environment Council (ASTEC). Baishya said his centre was a registered society working for the conservation and preservation of native rice varieties and that they represented the interests of farmers growing boka saul. In response to a query from the IPI office, the organisations said boka saul was a special class of quality rice famous for its value-addition properties like instant preparation of Continental delicacies and regular dishes and zero-fuel cooking requirement. The rice can be eaten after soaking it in water for 45 minutes or in lukewarm water for 15 minutes. "" Boka saul is different from other parboiled varieties of rice since there is no need of fuel for cooking. It can be made even more delicious with the addition of curd or milk, jaggery, sugar or bananas,"" Baishya said. There are two varieties of boka saul - Santi Boka and Ronga Boka. These are sown in the third to fourth week of June and harvested in November-December. Regarding the historical background, the applicants gave detailed literature dating back to Mughal era when it was recorded how Ahom soldiers subsisted on a variety of rice which was soaked in water and eaten without cooking. Other accounts included records by British officials in The Agriculture Ledger 1910 No. 1, Literature on the Races of Rices in India, Office of the Reporter on Economic Products in Government of India, Agrarian System of Medieval Assam by Jahnabi Gogoi Nath and A Statistical Account of Assam by W.W. Hunters and other literature, including poems. On the area of growth, the organisations submitted a map and details of the places after accessing data from the Assam Remote Sensing Centre. It was certified by the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Shillongani in Nagaon district. The RARS comes under Jorhat-based Assam Agricultural University. The paddy, which is sali or winter crop, is grown in Nalbari, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Goalpara, Dhubri and Barpeta in lower Assam, Sivasagar in Upper Assam and Darrang and Lakhimpur in central Assam. The information was submitted to P.K.S. Bhairapannavar, examiner of trademark and geographical indications, in Chennai. The organisations said a logo had been created for boka saul and a committee would be formed to act as an internal watchdog to ensure that the quality of the product was retained. The committee members will include a senior scientist from RARS, Shillongani, programme coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nalbari, an official of Patent Information Centre, ASTEC, regional coordinator, CEE, and project director, Lotus Progressive Centre."

Akhilesh was in Siddharth Nagar to announce projects worth Rs 370 crore, including Siddhartha University.Speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of the programme, Akhilesh said: ""Netaji is the most experienced leader in the state and in the country today and he must have spoken in his wisdom.""Akhilesh claimed that Samajwadi Party would return to power in the 2017 assembly elections as the party's development agenda has been acknowledged and appreciated by the people of the state and outside also.During his address at Siddhartha University, Akhilesh alleged that the Narendra Modi government has betrayed the people after promising them ""achhe din"" (good days), and claimed that the schemes launched by the Samajwadi Party government were better than those started by the Centre.""BJP promised people acchhe din, but when will they come? It betrayed the people and came to power,"" Akhilesh said. ""I'm happy that I laid the foundation stone of the university and I also inaugurated it.

58ff2f5e7be9e0420db2e1dc,Cong UP hope: bread-butter issues,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161021/jsp/nation/story_114707.jsp,2016-10-21,"New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Congress is praying for a normal election in Uttar Pradesh without any unwarranted ""surgical"" intervention from the BJP's spin doctors. Aware that the BJP had found a ""talking point"" with last month's surgical strikes - the anti-terror army action across the Line of Control - the leadership is working on shifting the focus to everyday issues like rural distress and unemployment. Party leaders realise that the mix of religiosity and patriotism by re-igniting the Ram temple hope along with the anti-Pakistan hysteria could curtail the impact of Rahul Gandhi's recent kisan yatra in the poll-bound heartland state. They also know that the party's nuanced approach on nationalism and religion would evaporate in the heat of raw jingoism; hence the prayer for a normal bread-and-butter discourse. Yesterday, the party's communications chief, Randeep Surjewala, dwelt on issues like alarming economic indicators and job losses in a series of tweets. Among the questions he asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the promise of two crore jobs a year when the unemployment rate was at a five-year peak, the manufacturing sector's performance being the worst in five years, industrial growth, soaring prices of eatables and the grim outlook for bank credit. A couple of days ago he had held an elaborate briefing on the BJP government's refusal to pay even the minimum support price (MSP) for rice in Haryana. ""We don't want Pakistan or a Ram temple to dominate the political discourse. We see them as artificial diversions as the Modi government has failed to deliver on the lofty promises made during the last parliamentary elections,"" a senior leader from Uttar Pradesh told The Telegraph. ""The BJP knows that issues like cow slaughter, love jihad and minority appeasement have lost their efficacy, so the same agenda is being presented in a new packaging."" Another leader said: ""We are going to villages as part of the Rahul Sandesh Yatra. When we explain to farmers Rahul Gandhi's promise to write off loans and halve electricity bills, the only question we face is, 'Won't betray us like Modi did, will you?' This clearly reflects that the farmers are angry with Modi for not fulfilling his promise of giving MSP plus 50 per cent profit. That created a huge opening for us."" This leader claimed the loan-waiver promise had created a wave and farmers, cutting across caste lines, were itching to punish the BJP. ""Other issues that angered the ordinary people were prices of pulses and vegetables, lack of employment and the general perception about the (BJP's 2014 promise of) achchhe din (good days) ahead being a hoax. We got unexpected support throughout the state. But suddenly this diversion has come in the form of chest-thumping about the surgical strikes,"" he said. The Congress has been focusing on farmer-related issues and Modi's failure to deliver on his promises. While party vice-president Rahul did it during his kisan yatra, other leaders are pursuing it in the ongoing Sandesh Yatra. From November 1, a "" vidhan sabha yatra"" is scheduled to begin to spread the same message. The Congress hopes to bolster its campaign next month with the entry of Priyanka Gandhi who too, party sources said, would focus on Modi's ""false promises"". Assembly elections are due early next year in Uttar Pradesh. Party leaders, who didn't have many tears to shed for former Uttar Pradesh unit chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi who defected to the BJP today, saw her reference to Rahul's "" khoon ki dalali"" statement as a reflection of a carefully crafted strategy. Rahul had earlier this month accused Modi of indulging in political exploitation of the sacrifices of soldiers. Sources said Bahuguna was feeding the ""war hysteria"" by referring to the Congress's stand on the surgical strikes as the reason for switching camps, when the primary reason was the trust deficit the Nehru-Gandhi family had developed after her brother Vijay Bahuguna tried to dislodge the Uttarakhand government. Raj Babbar, who heads the state Congress, said the ""BJP is making an army of traitors"" who were attacking Rahul because he was trying to demolish the little fiefs within the party."

58ff37e17be9e0420db2e927,BJP rains yellow rice to pull crowds,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/nation/story_114986.jsp,2016-10-22,"Narendra Modi Lucknow, Oct. 21: If the surgical strikes cannot pull the crowds to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Mahoba, the BJP is hoping its ""cereal strike"" will. BJP workers are distributing packets of yellow rice among Hindu households in the Bundelkhand region's Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, Chitrakoot, Lalitpur, Jhansi and Jalaun districts to encourage people to make Monday's rally a success. Yellow rice - rice dipped in a solution of turmeric and dried - is considered auspicious and is an essential ingredient of pujas. In north India, yellow rice is often offered to women when they set off on a journey. ""We realised that many people were not too excited about the surgical strikes (last month's anti-terrorist action by the army across the Line of Control),"" a senior BJP politician in Lucknow said, asking not to be named. ""But we have succeeded in striking an instant chord with people by distributing the yellow rice."" Led by Om Prakash Tiwari, chief of the BJP's Mahoba unit, over a dozen party activists visited the town's Kadipur, Narupur, Gandhi Nagar, Sattipur and Dal Bangla neighbourhoods yesterday, carrying the yellow rice door to door. They were accompanied by a band playing drums and trumpets. Party sources said they had skipped the Muslim-dominated Chahasiyapur, Mataniyapur and Fatipura localities. ""We tell the people about the Modi government's achievements, including the surgical strikes, and then offer them the yellow rice, which is our way of inviting them,"" local media reports quoted Tiwari as saying. The senior Lucknow-based BJP politician who spoke to this newspaper said the decision to distribute yellow rice was taken two days ago at a meeting presided over by state BJP general secretary Swatantra Dev Singh. ""It was decided that yellow rice would be a good bet to ensure the success of the rally, which will kick off the 2017 Assembly election campaign,"" said the politician, who has been asked to camp in Mahoba and monitor the door-to-door contact programme. He said similar contact programmes were going on in other districts of the region. ""We are also holding public meetings at temples in every neighbourhood. Swatantra Dev Singh addressed one such meeting in the Hanuman temple at Srinagar village in Mahoba on Wednesday,"" he added. Singh also performed a bhumi pujan (earth worship) at the venue of Modi's rally. The BJP has little presence in Bundelkhand and won just one of the region's 19 Assembly seats in the 2012 elections. The Congress won four thanks to a focused campaign by Rahul Gandhi. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have seven seats each from the region. Uttar Pradesh is due to vote early next year."
58f6a9b1a3d24b0b70c2df48,Texts read off the road,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Texts-read-off-the-road/article15732460.ece,2016-10-23,"A few days had passed since thousands of Buddhist monks took to the streets in Myanmar in September 2007 to protest against economic and political stagnation when an English couple walked into the Bad Monkey in Dali. They came into the bar, in Chinas Yunnan province, with tales from the Ayeyarwady region, the rice bowl of Myanmar, where life hadnt changed much since the days of George Orwell. The Myanmar they saw, from Rangoon to Mandalay, along poor delta backwaters to colonial hill stations, was aided by a book by Emma Larkin. Finding George Orwell in Burma tells the tale of Myanmar through the experiences of Orwell. The political travelogue brings together Burmese Days , Animal Farm and 1984 as a trilogy that offers the most accurate reading of the dictatorship of Myanmar, one that the country is still struggling to shake off.Living the present by revisiting the past is a theme I encountered time and again in my four years on the road. In Chinas Guangxi province, in a wonder of a village called Yangshuo, I met a Swedish biker who was travelling with a China guide from the 1960s that he picked up in Tehran. Facebook had exploded in the West in a big way and he was keen to disentangle himself from technological vortex. So he picked a time, a place he wanted to be, and let literature be his compass.We travel to seek new experiences but we travel expecting a glimpse of a past we idealise. Perhaps that is why so many of the books you pick up on the road are second-hand. The Beat Bums, my bookshop/coffee shop that I ran for a couple of seasons, tucked away in Old Manali and later in Hampi, was stocked largely with second-hand books picked up from the street vendors at South Bombays Flora Fountain. Old books crystallise a part of travel, its impermanence, and the fact that everything is transient. And, in the days after the Bob Dylan Nobel, it is worth recalling how much the Road in India is informed by his poetic expressions.The high hills of ManaliIts a long climb to the top of Old Manali. Travellers wander past stores selling mystical stones, apple wine, and trance music CDs, lugging massive backpacks up the slope while stealing glimpses at the Himalayas. Nestled amidst the many stores is a small caf called Dylans Roasted and Toasted Coffee House. The faade of Dylans lends itself to a mural of Bob Dylan in psychedelic colours. Dylans is more often than not the first stop for the weary traveller, a place that buzzes with energy, where the gathered jam to sounds of the country musician, their voices rising with the smoke from their joints.Bob Dylan of the 1960s, the icon of an age of protest, and his words and music, are the soundtrack to the Road in India. Dylans lyrics, of revolt against convention and hierarchy, follow you across India  from the barren plains of Leh to the beaches of Anjuna where travellers recite his poetry. They strum on their guitars in 300-rupee guesthouses, around bonfires in the boulders of Hampi and along the banks of the Ganga in Rishikesh. Dylans classics unite strangers, lessening the distance between foreign languages and alien customs. His lyrics are etched on the walls of Noahs Arc guest house in Arambol, asking the traveller, taunting the traveller: How does it feel/ To be on your own/ With no direction home/ A complete unknown/ Like a rolling stone?Dylan presides over as a patriarch, a prophet. The bond forged by travellers traipsing all around India for months on end is furthered strengthened by the ideas of the road and idealism associated with it. For many cling on to the values of the 1950s and 1960s counterculture, they quote Jack Kerouac and recite the words of Allen Ginsberg. It is their howl we hear at late night jam sessions that the local police and forestry department officials so desperately try to silence.No longer a lonely planetThe traveller comes searching for a romanticised version of India: of hippies and hash, of enlightenment and 20-rupee meals. Instead they are confronted with an industry that has rapidly developed, with touts on every corner, where a chain of Dylans Roasted and Toasted has opened in multiple locations on the path well trodden. This taints the organic experience. Now it feels like the first bite of a McDonalds burger in a foreign country, sounds like the reassuring ring that accompanies the sliding door at a 7-Eleven. The traveller in mystical India has been transformed into a tourist in Incredible India and the industry pulls at the most predictable strings.But the lonesome traveller isnt willing to let go, is protesting and resisting the Lonely Planetisation and gentrification of the road. Communities come together and create new enclaves to retreat into. Some have acquired lives of their own such as the one on the shore of Paradise Beach where long-haired hippies trek along a winding path and into secret coves. They set up camp on the idyllic harbours every year, living in the most threadbare conditions and dance naked to the sound of the guitar on the beach. Others, such as Sadhana Forest, have piggybacked on older communes such as Auroville and use its legitimacy to bring people together for outlandish projects such as the creation of a forest.An older compactBut the global nomad isnt relenting. Just like the original hippies of Arambol, who have camped in the jungles, have called the banyan trees home for decades and resisted the pressure to leave. They arent giving in to the stereotypical image of the selfie-wielding tourist travelling to document his or her journey on Instagram. Instead they have formed cliques and this year they meet in the forest of Uttarakhand, far away from tentacles of the tourist industry for a month-long love-in.They gather away from the eyes of officials, secure in their isolation, and sing: Come gather round people/ Wherever you roam/ And admit that the waters/ Around you have grown. But they refuse to accept that the times they are a changin.AliaAllana is a Mumbai-based journalist who writes for Fountain Ink.Dylans lyrics, of revolt against convention and hierarchy, follow you across India  from the barren plains of Leh to the beaches of Anjuna where travellers recite his poetry"

Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra) Farmers in Punjab and Haryana say the bulk of burning happens in the first week of November. Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)On one side of National Highway 1, a heap of dry leaves is up in flames. A few kilometres ahead, farmers in fields are burning the refuse left behind after threshing the paddy crop. The air is thick with smoke along parts of the highway in Haryana.Delhis annual pollution crisis has started  and it will only get worse. The large-scale burning of agricultural remains  the stalks left in the ground after the crop is harvested  is expected to begin in earnest in the first week of November. Farmers say the bulk of burning happens in the first two weeks of November, as the entire paddy crop has not been harvested yet. This is bad news for the air quality in Delhi.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne only needs to visit some villages in Sonepat and Panipat near National Highway 1 to realise the extent of the problem posed by burning of agricultural stubble. And to understand why farmers do it.When we used manual labour for harvesting, the stubble was easier to deal with. We would just till the farm again and the stubble would be mixed into soil. Now that we have started using machines to harvest, 8 -10 inches of stalks are left behind and these are difficult to deal with. Getting manual labourers  mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh  is expensive, time consuming and difficult, so everyone does it by machine, said Kherati Lal, 65, a farmer in Haryanas Panchi Gujra village near Murthal.The easiest thing in such a situation, he says, is to set fire to his farms to clear the stubble. Except, this is banned by the government.We would put 2 litres of kerosene and set fire to the whole thing. End of story. Now we have to bring in machines to turn the soil and cut and bury the stubble. We have to water this and run a tractor over it thrice to make sure it decays properly. The government has started keeping a strict check on fires now, so we burn only the stalks that come out along with the rice crop. Its a small quantity, he said.But even small quantities being burnt on each farm make for an air pollution disaster.As per officials at the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), 60,000 acres of land in Punjab is under cultivation of paddy. In Haryana, paddy is cultivated on around 30,000 acres. This produces 32 million tonnes of paddy straw.According to the first source apportionment study of Delhis air pollution by IIT Kanpur, about 30 per cent of pollution in Delhi is because of biomass burning, which includes agricultural, leaf and garbage burning.Several studies since have confirmed this. A recent study by scientists at the National Environment Engineering Research Institute said that 60 per cent of Delhis particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is contributed by neighbouring states. Of this 60 per cent, half is contributed by Punjab and Haryana.Despite efforts to curb such fires, farms in Haryana and Punjab have been going up in flames for the last two weeks, according to NASAs fire mapper. The map also shows that Punjab is seeing more fires, especially near Amritsar, as compared to Haryana.The effect on air quality is already visible. According to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, the air quality has dipped since September 25  something that can partly be attributed to a dip in wind speed and partly to the beginning of the harvest season.An analysis of the air quality on the National Air Quality Index shows that this October is, on average, more polluted than the last. Between October 6 and October 20, at R K Puram station, the average air quality was poor during both years. But this year, the value was 261 as opposed to 257 last year, the data shows.Meanwhile, with the Supreme Court, the Delhi High Court and the National Green Tribunal banning all such agricultural fires, state governments have started feeling the heat.The Haryana government has already issued almost 700 challans and collected lakhs in fines for farm fires this year. The progress in Punjab has been slower, with some officials suggesting this could have something to do with the upcoming assembly elections.But leader of Opposition in Haryana assembly and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala has criticised the decision of the BJP government in Haryana to impose a fine on farmers, and demanded that they be reimbursed.Removal of stubble from fields is expensive. A farmer cannot afford to pay Rs 10,000 per acre from his pocket for this. In several countries, machines are available using which stubble can be cut, tied up and sent to factories for use. The Haryana government has three such machines lying defunct, he claimed.Ram Niwas Gautam, 60, a resident of Manana Village near Panipat, said, I have a 4-acre farm. A farmer cant afford to buy a machine to get rid of the waste and hiring manual labour is out of question as they are rarely available and charge a lot of money. Labour contractors charge aroundRs 20,000; where do we get that kind of money? Only the big farmers can afford it.According to experts, the governments need a mix of prosecution and incentives to deal with the problem. In Punjab, for example, farmers are selling the straw to waste-to-energy plants for power generation, and a small amount is being sold to mushroom farms to use as substrate.Farmers should be paid Rs 1,000 per acre under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana so they can shun the practice of burning paddy straw. They should be given subsidies for buying Rotavator machines that help cut and mix agricultural stubble with soil. We need to understand why the farmers burn stubble and then deal with the basic problem, said Centre for Science and Environment director general Sunita Narain.*Many orders, little changeNov 2012Supreme Court mandated panel, Environment Pollution Control Authority, directs Punjab, Haryana to ensure complete ban on burning of agricultural stubble by 2014. States asked to promote alternate uses of paddy straw, such as power generation.Feb 2014NGT tells Ministry of Agriculture to hold meeting with Punjab, Haryana, Central Pollution Control Board, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and prepare guidelines to control pollution from burning of agricultural remnants in fields.Dec 2015NGT orders fine for burning stubble. Its order states:*Land holders with less than 2 acres to payRs 2,500/- per incident*Rs 5,000 for land holders with 2 and 5 acres*Rs 15,000 for land holders with area more than 5 acres of land*Oct 2016Delhi HC issues orders to governments of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to prevent burning of agricultural stubble in their states. On October 4, Delhi government writes to environment ministers of some neighbouring states in this regard.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The Centre had appealed to the traders not to sell Chinese crackers, citing safety reasons and pollution.Following the Centres appeal, the vendors are procuring locally made crackers from places like Nalabanta in Ganjam, Padampur in Cuttack and Raipur in Chhattisgarh. The expect sales of Rs 1.5 crore this time. We would request everyone not to use any Chinese crackers and instead of Chinese rice lights, people should decorate their homes with clay lamps, Gouda said.As many as 46 vendors are licensed to sell crackers in the market through 80 stalls. Last year, the administration had decided to restrict sale of firecrackers to the market to reduce the risk of fire accidents in the crowded city. The administration has requested the city residents not to buy crackers and fireworks from any other outlet. The administration has decided to be strict on unlicensed fireworks sellers who open shops in streets.Earlier this week, the Fire Department officials made a detailed survey of fire safety measures at the shops in the market. A fire brigade vehicle will be stationed in the market from Saturday, informed Bhabagrahi Ghadei, Fire Officer (southern region).Meanwhile, police have started cracking the whip on illegal cracker manufacturing and selling units in Berhampur and nearby areas. Police raided three unlicensed cracker shops in Badabazaar and seized crackers. Last week, Aska Additional Tehsildar Sangram Keshari Jena and IIC Baleswar Gidhi had conducted raids in the village and seized a large quantity of illegally prepared crackers.Even the huts erected for the preparation of crackers were set ablaze by the officers. Crackers are also manufactured illegally in Ankuspur under Sadar police limits."

""It's just how I live,"" he says, shrugging. ""Go home, take my shoes off, take my clothes off.""Then he starts cooking - experimenting with ingredients he has picked up on his way back to his flat in the trendy Williamsburg area of New York, spending two hours a night chopping and blending. Which sounds a little like dicing with danger, when done in the altogether.""I've been cooking naked with knives for the longest time, so I feel pretty comfortable chopping,"" he says.Now he is making a career of it. Noriega, 27, has been widely dubbed ""the world's hottest chef"", while more than 200,000 followers digest his delectable daily dishes on Instagram. His most recent post on his YouTube channel, Franco Cooks, has been viewed over 70,000 times in the five days since he sat down, in his very skimpy boxers, to teach us how to cook chia seed pudding.The former model - catapulted to stardom when fellow Peruvian, photographer Mario Testino, recommended him to Dolce & Gabbana - is riding a viral publicity wave: having opened Baby Brasa in Manhattan's Lower East Side earlier this year, he will open his second restaurant in the West Village in January, quickly followed by a third in his own neighbourhood.Is there not a risk that, by using his chiselled abs to promote his culinary concoctions, he'll be seen as nothing more than a gimmick?""It is a risk,"" he concedes, perched on a stool outside his Peruvian rotisserie. The pocket-sized restaurant specialises in organic free-range chicken with Peruvian spices, but also serves up quinoa salads, jasmine rice with Peruvian corn, and yucca fries.""But life is full of risk - and that's what makes it interesting.""Noriega is savvy enough to realise that, were a woman to promote her restaurant in a bikini, she'd be pilloried for it. ""It's not like I'm posing for this,"" he insists, of his impossibly chiselled photo feed.""I live like that. I swam for Peru when I was younger, so was always almost naked - in my Speedos, anyway. And Peru is a hot country, so you wear fewer clothes.""For him, the whole ""naked"" USP is just good business sense: using the God-given tools at his disposal.""Can you tell me who this Jamie Oliver guy is?"" he asks, having never heard of his British namesake until he was mentioned in an article comparing the two. ""Did he cook naked?""No, no, I say, he used ""naked"" ingredients - stripped-down, simple food. No fuss. But now he's built an empire, married a model, lives in a huge house in London and has made a fortune from cookbooks and saucepans and things.Noriega's eyes light up and he nods, keenly - clearly taking mental notes.Inside the open-plan kitchen, Noriega - now modestly clad in a T-shirt and denim apron - shows me how to whip up his special chicken and lentil superfood salad. He laughs at my massacring of an avocado as I try to concentrate on his CV - and not get blinded by his biceps, or lose a finger - while wielding a massive knife.It was when he moved to New York a decade ago that he was introduced to Testino, through a family friend. ""I was very fortunate, because thanks to Mario I could go straight to the top,"" he says. ""I didn't have to hustle. Immediately I was doing D&G, Burberry, Calvin Klein.""But I wasn't using my brain. And I saw very quickly that it's different for women - they have much more creative control, and then they can become muses and creative directors as they get older. There are so many successful female models. But I bet you can't name more than five men. We have to do something else.""Besides, the restaurant business was in his blood. When he was a child growing up in Lima, his parents ran a successful chain of them and were always in search of new ventures. Food was a huge part of his life: ingredients such as avocado, quinoa, and ceviche - now considered superfoods in fashionable quarters on both sides of the Atlantic - were simply daily staples there.Enrolling in New York's International Culinary Center, he sweated for a year in the kitchens to learn his craft. He worked alongside the celebrated French chef Daniel Boulud, owner of the Michelin-starred Daniel and dozens of restaurants in New York and around the world. He grafted at a Peruvian restaurant in Queens, Pio Pio - determined that, when it came to opening his own place, he'd be on top of his game.He was also determined not to spoil those abs. Ah yes, those abs. As a former professional swimmer (he qualified for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but was injured before they began) and model (something he still does on the side), he's well versed in the importance of healthy eating. ""But not just salad. I didn't want to lose weight - just be good to my body.""Nowadays he keeps fit in the gym, by skateboarding across the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan, and riding his bike around town. Many of his clients, he says, are men who come in after the gym and want a filling, healthy meal.His organic, free-range chicken is three times more expensive wholesale than battery-farmed chicken - but he believes it's worth it. Half a bird costs $13 - more than fast-food joints, but still very affordable for New York.""I don't understand how you can work out and then go and scoff a $10 Thai meal - full of sodium and MSG,"" he says. ""People come here who care about what they eat.""Not surprisingly, he is perfectly happy to strip off for the Telegraph's photographer - despite winter having arrived in New York this week. Endearingly helpful and friendly, he happily flashes the Blue Steel when handed a knife to strike a pose - before breaking back into an easy grin, and putting his T-shirt on again.And he insists he is still single (though, like many a pin-up before him, swerves the question of whether he's straight). Women do make up the majority of customers, laughs Milan Kelez, his business partner and another Peruvian former model, as two women in their twenties ask to have their photo with him. They make quite a pair.""People think we're brothers or gay,"" Kelez says. ""But we're just really good friends.""He hands Noriega a new dish to try - patacones, a traditional South American plantain cake, with avocado toppings. They chew on it, intently. ""More seasoning,"" they conclude.The new restaurants will be much bigger, with around 80 covers in both the West Village and Williamsburg locations. And Noriega has more in store. His YouTube channel may be in his mother tongue - one of the few printable comments under a recent video says: ""Watching to improve my Spanish. Honest"" - but he is thinking about an English version, and is in talks for a possible television show.This week he was in Peru, speaking to financiers about more projects. His hope is to have a Baby Brasa - the name comes from ""pollo a la brasa"", a Peruvian roast chicken dish - in every major city in the US. Perhaps even the UK, I ask, imagining the queue.""I know that people might come into the restaurant for the first time because of my Instagram,"" he said. ""But when they come back, it's because of the food."""
58ff38d87be9e0420db2ea67,A day at the harbour,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161103/jsp/opinion/story_117017.jsp,2016-11-03,"Cinema, writing and photography come together, sometimes, to create for us the mysterious power of particular human faces. Through the experience of a face viewed, read about, shared and remembered, we may confront certain powerful emotions within ourselves - fears and desires that we could have scarcely managed, or dared, to put in words had the work not been done for us by others. For me, this has been the case with the faces of two extraordinary actors: Monica Vitti and Isabelle Huppert. Especially Vitti, as she appears in the early black-and-white films of Michelangelo Antonioni: L'avventura, La Notte, L'eclisse (The Adventure, The Night, The Eclipse, the Italian and English words attaching themselves somewhat differently to her face in each film), and then his journey into colour, The Red Desert (Il Deserto Rosso), all made in the early Sixties. On the one hand, there are the films - transcendently in the past, yet repeatedly watched (even stalked), fully or in fragments, in the vanished cinema-halls of my student years and now in the privacy of my home, thanks to YouTube and torrents. On the other hand, these films have haunted some of the writers and artists I follow: Coetzee (in Youth), Roni Horn and Anne Carson have made with Vitti's face, words and actions their own bodies of visual, fictional and poetic work, Horn having blurred the lines between image-making and writing with both Vitti and Huppert. Add to this what we, as viewers, readers and communicators, do with these primary and secondary materials, working them into our own and our friends' memories with our phones and laptops, making screenshots, putting clips and images on Instagram and Facebook, or as WhatsApp profile pictures, where they get interlaced with other images, usually photographs of 'real' people and places, or pages from books we happen to be reading, so that these faces become dramatis personae in our private image-repertoires and visual diaries. This is how their faces become our faces, their films become our films, our films become our friends' films, and how memory and art perform their secret ministries, through viewing and grabbing and thieving and sharing, and the subtitles and lines of poetry become parts of this work, as the faces pass into our fantasies and waking dreams, and, in turn, into other people's dreams and memories, into their perceptions of us. What a journey this is from the objectivity of photography towards the making of subjectivity and of complex emotions! This, for me, is the endless work of modernity, of our being both in time and out of time, the illicit and illegal devouring power of our eyes and our gadgets, and the transforming power of our minds and memories, at once acquisitive and generous, possessive and promiscuous, scrupulous and unscrupulous, restless, prodigious, and compulsively, compellingly and vitally useless. In her capacity for metaphysical boredom, what is Monica Vitti, as Antonioni captures her in these films, but the muse and presiding deity of the pointlessness of life itself, confounding the beautiful and the sublime, which Edmund Burke had wanted to keep so carefully apart? Three things were happening simultaneously in my life over the last weekend. I was watching Red Desert on my laptop, watching and making notes in preparation for a lecture on industrial photography. This was interrupted by a day trip I made by car with my friend and her daughter to Diamond Harbour, where, as a friend of my mother used to put it in her inimitable manner, the domestic help elopes with the driver, with tragic consequences. I was constantly making photographs, too, out of these two experiences and sharing them on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp with friends and quasi-friends. And because of how these things were all happening in the interstices of one another, I woke up the next morning with this piece of writing going round and round in my head like an unforgettable dream. So I wrote it up, convinced that in the writing of it I would be able to grasp, if only for myself, the meaning of the life of certain images in the making of our selves in time. Once, on her way back home from a journalistic assignment, my friend had stopped briefly at a resort on Diamond Harbour. It was dusk, the place was deserted and the river was magical in the setting sun. So, that memory compelled her to take her daughter and me back to this resort for lunch on Saturday. We set out in her car in the morning, and by the time we reached, our nerves were wracked by the menace of the narrow road on which speeding buses and trucks kept coming at us as if with an intent to crush and kill. Children are free of the fear of death: her daughter first slept in the car and then played games on her mother's phone, unaware of the panic building up in us. We got there around noon. The sun was strong, the river dazzling and wide, but the people at the reception were unwelcoming towards visitors who came in small cars for the day and wouldn't let us walk or the child play on their lawns by the river. We tried the state-run tourist lodge next door. It looked desolate and sleazy, and was equally unwelcoming on hearing that we were not going to check in. We moved along to a hotel further down the road, where they were nicer at the desk with two dead clocks showing the time in London and New York. Their dining hall was walled off from any sort of view, so we persuaded them to lay a table for us in a passage with windows looking out on the lawn and a swimming pool at the back. We ate an overpriced and unremarkable lunch as the breeze blew in the stench of the fisheries nearby. The child quickly worked through her sandwiches and ran out to swing and slide. The hotel seemed deserted, but the light outside had turned golden, the rice was settling inside us, and the river shimmered just out of sight. We could have been in one of those silent towns in L'avventura, into which Vitti and her friend-turning-into-lover might have strayed flatly for a non-conversation and nothing else to do, a town through which empty trains pass from time to time. I took a picture on my phone of a bird with a long forked tail sitting absolutely still on a bare tree in the middle of a paddy field beyond the pool and whatsapped the photo to a friend in Milwaukee. She wrote back saying that it filled her with a yearning for the green-and-gold stillness of the afternoons of her childhood forty years ago, when they would stop at Diamond Harbour on the way to their ancestral village. At that time, there was just a dusty road, the river and the government lodge, then glittering and spruce. They would buy fish from the fishermen. On our way back, we were menaced again by the traffic and collapsed on our beds to sleep off the trauma of the journey and the anticlimax of the destination. After a strong cup of tea in the evening, I looked at the photograph of the bird again, and it reminded me of the villages in the illustrated Bengali books of my early years. It was always afternoon in those picture-book villages. My nerves were still a bit frayed, but already around that whatsapped and instagrammed image of the bird on the tree in the paddy field another memory of our day out had begun to form, at once cinema and photograph, fiction and truth - private, but made and relived with a number of other people. I sat down to watch Red Desert on my bed from where I had left off before setting out for Diamond Harbour. Monica Vitti is inside a shack on another harbour, suspended between land and sea, with her shallow friends, her cold and caring husband, and that tender-eyed visitor with his half-Italian and half-German name, played by Richard Harris. They are eating quail eggs, talking about aphrodisiacs, and trying to be lecherous. In the margins of the room, Vitti and Harris are quietly attracted to each other, held in an afternoon swirling with fog, into which a strange ship enters, sending out poops of alarm because of some medical emergency happening inside the vessel. That freezing red room, the people in which seem to be nervously on the brink of a stylish orgy, is also smouldering with an intricate web of wordless feeling. Antonioni makes us observe Vitti, her husband and their friends slowly and closely. But we are made to look at everything through Vitti's watchful and listless eyes as well. The camera records not only what is going on inside the room, but also an unspeakable story building up inside a supposedly sick woman's head. The director is pushing her friends, and us, towards a certain impatience with his heroine. We feel that we know what is wrong with this woman, but this knowledge keeps getting lost in the fog that gathers around her. She wants to be loved, to be desired, we tell ourselves, she wants attention - as her little boy does later in the film, when he pretends not to be able to use his legs to stand up and walk. He is his mother's rival in attention-seeking, and wants her to tell him a story. And the story that she does tell him becomes the lushly beautiful film within the film, about a girl on an island who spots a mysterious ship that seems to come towards her and then leaves her alone on her island. The child's malingering and his mother's storytelling - the film colludes with both to give us two opaque and interlocking accounts of what can only be shown and felt but never fully explained and understood, or diagnosed and cured. Perhaps Antonioni is showing us that we are all, sometimes beautifully but more often unregarded, caught between wanting everything and wishing not to want anything at all; caught, that is, between tutti and niente, two words that are used over and over again in the film. So we often end up doing to others what we fear would be done to us, pre-empting abandonment with abandonment. Harris and Vitti sense these twinned reflexes in each other inside the shack on the harbour, as the ships appear and disappear in the fog. The sickness of her fear of being left with nothing finds its mirror-image in his never-changing heart to leave without anything. As I watched Red Desert for the umpteenth time, I kept taking screen-shots and jotting down some of the subtitles. It occurred to me that some of the subtitles could make up a poem, which I called ""Foghorn"" at first, and then decided to call ""Via Alighieri"", after the poet, and the street in the film on which Vitti wants vaguely to set up a shop. Nothing in that poem was my own, of course: White forest/ In the red desert/ Nothing/ Everything/ Even the ashtrays./ Am I leaving you/ Or are you leaving me?/ I can't decide./ I never get enough./ Why do I always need other people?/ I don't know what to sell./ Does this ship take passengers?/ Will you be the same when I return?/ Will you be there when I return?/ I can never look for long at the sea/ And not lose interest in what happens on land."

On the occasion, we decided to visit six states and see what had changed; we did not really decide on any subject. The idea was to report on deeper processes shaping India. The first state we visited was Mizoram. There I reported on political corruption, education, healthcare, financial viability, the issues confronting the minority communities and how South Korean soft power was affecting the state.Esha Roy (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Esha Roy (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Esha Roy, The Indian Express: For her report on Haollenphai, the village on the Indo-Myanmar border thats preparing to be a Smart City. There was talk about smart cities all over the country. In Manipur, all development was seen to have taken place only in Imphal. So now the idea was to take it to the border. This village (Haollenphai) is in the Moreh area on the Indo-Myanmar border and I went to see it. Imphal Valley is dominated by Meities (Manipuri Hindus) and this particular area is dominated by the Kuki tribe. I talked to people as well as a few members of the Kuki underground insurgent group. I then realised that the whole controversy regarding the Smart City was basically a turf war between two insurgent groups  Kuki Insurgent Group and Valley Insurgent Group. The Kukis were not allowing any government official to come or any development to happen in that area. It was all about area domination. They (Kukis) felt that if they allowed a project backed by the Manipur government in Imphal to come there, then the people from Imphal would take over the area. The insecurities of the different tribes was leading to conflict as well as hampering development in the area.(BROADCAST)Subhajit Sengupta (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Subhajit Sengupta (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Subhajit Sengupta, CNN-IBN: For his documentary, Killing Fields of Assam, on Adivasi killings in Bodoland. In the Northeast, both politics and conflict are centered on identity and ethnicity. The struggle for a separate Bodoland follows a similar pattern. In the documentary, I tried to go beyond the questions of who killed whom, and instead decided to concentrate on the why. What triggered the clash, who gains once the victims flee, and most importantly, is a greed for land behind the ethnic strife? These were some of the issues I focussed on.Hindi Journalism(PRINT)Santosh Kumar (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Santosh Kumar (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Santosh Kumar, India Today: For his report on the BJPs Mahasampark Abhiyaan. The BJP claimed to have enrolled 11 crore members through its Mahasampark Abhiyaan through a missed call process. The whole process of registration, however, was to be complete only after BJP workers visited the houses and got users of the subscribed mobile numbers to give another missed call to a new designated number.

There was a new government at the Centre and we wanted to see if a concept like Ramrajya was achievable. So we travelled to eight countries, examined some of their policies, and analysed if it could be adapted in India. For the 10-episode documentary, we visited Cuba, which has the best public health services, even better than the US. We also visited Finland, which boasts of one of the best public-funded education systems. Then there was Denmark, which had managed to make governance free of all corruption.Syeda Afifa Khatoon (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Syeda Afifa Khatoon (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Syeda Afifa Khatoon, News 24: For her series on MCD schools that were being run only on paper, with no students. I had heard of one school in Old Delhi, where the building had been recently renovated but there were no students. When we visited the school, we found that the guard and his family had been living in the building, and teachers would come every 15 days, sign the attendance sheet and leave. We then went on to trace at least 6-7other such schools in North Delhi, where the teachers were drawing salaries but the schools had remained shut for years.Regional languages(PRINT)Firos Khan M (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Firos Khan M (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Firos Khan M, Madhyamam Daily: For his reports on the travails faced by Indian expats in the Gulf.

In Karnatakas Chitradurga and Tumakuru districts, hundreds of people were falling ill due to the high fluoride content in the water drawn from borewells. Several complaints of water contamination were lodged with the district administration. When we visited the districts, we realised that the contamination was a result of people digging extremely deep borewells  the deeper you go, the higher the chances of contamination. The sheer scale of the people affected also led to several socio-economic problems in the regions.Environmental Reporting(PRINT)Pritha Chatterjee and Aniruddha Ghosal (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Pritha Chatterjee and Aniruddha Ghosal (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Pritha Chatterjee and Aniruddha Ghosal, The Indian Express: For their series Death by Breath on what led to Delhi becoming one of the most polluted cities in the world. We conducted detailed interviews with academics, politicians and several other stakeholders, to understand the reasons that led to this development. In the end, the revelations pointed to one thing, that despite red flags being raised at various levels, consecutive governments and the administration failed to respond, says Chatterjee. During our month-long investigation, we tried to identify the moment when Delhis CNG gains were lost. What we found was that even though a number of academic studies and research papers, some funded by the government, had been published on the issue, the government had largely ignored it, says Ghosal.(BROADCAST)Sushil C Bahuguna, NDTV India: For his investigative reports on how hydro-power projects were further damaging the eco-system of Uttarakhand, a state ravaged by the 2013 floods. The floods and landslides in Kedarnath in 2013 was a natural disaster, but hydro-power projects caused further damage. They obstructed the flow of rivers and left a lot of muck on the river banks. I also visited Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal district in Uttarakhand with a team of scientists. The team found evidence of weakening of mountains due to excessive construction.Uncovering India Invisible(PRINT)Ashwaq Masoodi (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Ashwaq Masoodi (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Ashwaq Masoodi, Mint: For her series on those breaking the caste barrier  from businesswomen to wrestlers. When we thought about the series, we broadly wanted to focus on the aspirations of India and examine a cross-section of all barriers, including caste, religion and gender. I had been writing on Dalits for a while now  going to their conferences, meeting NGOs which work for them and meeting people at DICCI (Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry). Thats when I got to know about some people attempting to break the caste barrier by not being embarrassed of their Dalit identity, asserting it in a way that would help them move ahead in life. After the series, a lot of the discourse revolved around aspiration, at least on social media, as far as I could see. I remember people emailing me and telling me how they thought it was their story, except that the characters were different. The urban elite do not define India, these stories from villages in Haryana and Bihar do, and that is why people connected with them.(BROADCAST)Sarada Lahangir (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Sarada Lahangir (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Sarada Lahangir, Kalinga TV: For multiple reports on Odishas farmer suicides, starvation deaths in tribal communities and women in conflict zones. I did a five-part series titled, Many Tales, Many Agonies, on a gamut of issues that were specific to the region, though not known to the world outside. I worked on tribal bidi workers and the difficult conditions they worked in. I also followed up on my story on deaths due to starvation in the tribal communities.Business and Economics Journalism(PRINT)Khushboo Narayan (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Khushboo Narayan (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Khushboo Narayan, The Indian Express: For a series of reports that probed top corporates who are loan defaulters. In April 2015, (then RBI governor) Raghuram Rajan wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on the top companies that had defrauded the bank. So that was the genesis of it. While people wrote about how he (Rajan) had written to the PM about Non Performing Assets (NPAs), no one had written about what had happened in those companies. After discussing it with my editor, I decided to write about the top five defaulters. I started working on it in August. It took three months and was published in December. In all the cases, there was forensic auditing being done, there were agencies who were investigating. I had numerous meetings with regulators, RTI activists who had filed applications asking for replies from the bank, and also met bankers and figured out what happened in each company. I also reached out to some of the investors of the companies who were carrying out private investigations.Rajeev Dubey, Business Today: For his report on Indias burgeoning corporate debt. When we were meeting representatives of companies, we got the sense that a crisis was building because companies had piled up debts and were not able to service them. Besides, our sources in banks had been complaining that companies were not being able to service their debts because of interest payouts etc. We put two and two together and figured that there was a crisis on the corporate as well as on the banking side. We realised that there was almost Rs 12 lakh crore in bad debt, almost one-fifth of the Rs 60 lakh crore in loan amount that banks had given to companies. A lot of things happened after our story  the 5:25 rule that was put out, the RBI getting after companies to sort out their balance sheets and so on.(BROADCAST)Archana Shukla (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Archana Shukla (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Archana Shukla, CNBC TV18: For her series, Whats Ailing Rural India, which reflected on the gap between government projects and their delivery. I think we often forget to discuss the rural economy, which contributes to the GDP of the country in a big way. Through the series, we wanted to study the consumption patterns and understand the reasons for rural spending not picking up, which again is linked to the entire agrarian crisis. For the report, we covered the agrarian crisis in Marathwada and the drought in Bundelkhand. In two villages of Banda district of Bundelkhand, which we had reported about, the district administration distributed 50 kg of rice to every family, put up two hand pumps in the village and even started MGNREGA work.Reporting on Politics and Government(PRINT)Ashutosh Bhardwaj, The Indian Express: For his report on the leaked Chhattisgarh tapes that suggested financial foulplay before a bypoll. There was talk about unfair dealings in the Antagarh bypolls. I chased the clues for over a year until I stumbled upon these audio tapes. Antagarh is a reserved constituency for tribals in Maoist-hit Bastar. The involvement of both the national political parties, the BJP and Congress, in these dealings underline their failure to address tribal unrest. The story was scattered across several players and dates, so it was difficult to thread them together.(BROADCAST)Halimabi Abdul Kureshi, IBN Lokmat: For capturing the impact of the beef ban on society and industry in Maharashtra. I belong to the Qureshi community. I have seen people who work as butchers as it is their traditional occupation. They had little education but were happy as long as they had money coming their way. When the Maharashtra government passed the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, even bullocks were brought under it. Most of the people in the meat industry, 80 per cent of them people who follow their traditional occupation, were the worst sufferers. People removed children from school. When vehicles carrying animals would be caught, there was sadness and grief. The community believed it could not raise its voice as there were no politicians etc from the community who would take their side. Then, a Qureshi boy committed suicide. After all this, people contacted me as nobody was ready to be their voice. No media house was covering this side of the story. When I was visiting the cattle market, I met a Christian who said there are people who have been eating beef for generations and the ban was a human rights violation. Due to the ban, the leather industry went down, there were families who couldnt get their girls married. My father, who was the inspiration for this report, passed away, but I started working on the report on the twelfth day after his death. So this report was something emotional also. I felt the other side of the story had to come out. After all, it is about traditional occupations.Sports Journalism(PRINT)Devendra Pandey (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Devendra Pandey (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Devendra Pandey, The Indian Express: For his report on irregularities in the IPL. It was during a casual chat with someone that I first heard about a breach of the code of conduct by franchises of the Indian Premier League. IPL is so glamorous that most people dont know whats happening behind the scenes in this shortest and most attractive form of cricket. It was difficult to verify and get confirmation of small details, but I somehow managed to get copies of confidential documents that showed certain irregularities.(BROADCAST)Sanjeeb Mukherjea (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Sanjeeb Mukherjea (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Sanjeeb Mukherjea, CNN-IBN: For uncovering IPL spot-fixing tapes involving Rajasthan Royals players. When I joined sports journalism, I never thought I would be covering what is happening outside the stadium rather than the match inside. From 2009-2010, there were a lot of things happening around IPL. In 2013, when the scandal happened, there were a few administrators who were in a hurry to get away from where they were and I got information from my sources in the Mumbai Police and Delhi Police. This is what has changed about sports journalism, that you now have to also deal with the police and the judicial and legal aspects. When I came upon the tapes, I was startled because what had come out in reports until then was not even bits or pieces. It took eight to 10 months to listen to all the tapes, work with the transcripts, and match them with the voice samples and edit. This story was basically about investigating what was wrong with cricket, the most famous sport in India.On-the-spot Reporting(PRINT)Nayantara Narayanan (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Nayantara Narayanan (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Nayantara Narayanan, Scroll.in: For her reports on the Chennai floods and the aftermath. The floods took Chennai out but we also found that places outside the city had been very badly affected. So I spoke to my editor and we all got the sense that we should really be looking beyond Chennai, which took me to places such as Kanchipuram and Cuddalore that had been flooded for a month, but from where very little news was coming out.One of the stories was on a village in Cuddalore, a Dalit settlement, ignored in whatever relief work was going on. An NGO had alerted us about this village. Within days of the story being published, I got a call from the NGO saying that individuals had come in with relief material and when she asked them how they had heard about the village, they showed the story we had published.(BROADCAST)Aamir Rafiq Peerzada (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Aamir Rafiq Peerzada (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Aamir Rafiq Peerzada & Rakesh Solanky, NDTV: For extensive reports on the damage caused at the Everest base camp, due to avalanches triggered by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. I remember being trapped for close to two days due to a heavy avalanche. At the time, at least 16 people were dead and many were injured. All our equipment was destroyed and we had been wearing the same clothes for days. We put together the reports through phone calls to the office, says Peerzada. Solanky, the videojournalist on the assignment, says, I had gone to the Everest base camp to film the expedition to the worlds highest peak. However, the earthquake triggered an avalanche, which nearly wiped out the camp, killing 22 people.

The story was about an RTI investigation into how politicians had been writing to PSUs, seeking favours such as funds for their organisations, for NGOs etc. They usually had their own interests behind such requests. So it was essentially a misuse of public money, says Pai. From the replies for the RTIs Sandeep filed, we started picking out names in which there was a direct conflict of interest. After the story, some PSUs issued internal circulars, saying we dont need to unnecessarily release funds and that we can take a call on this, says Pande.(BROADCAST)Ganesh Suratchand Thakur, ABP News: For investigating the alleged abduction and detention of girls by the Sanatan Sanstha.

Malli wasnt a difficult choice: a man from a humble, nomadic, tribal background, a first generation literate who went on to study at IIT-Kharagpur and IIM-Calcutta, and one who gave up a corporate career for the mountains. I first got to know about Malli from a small report in The Telegraph some years ago. In 2015, his name returned tragically to the papers. After going missing for days at a 22,000-feet Andes peak, Malli returned to his Nellore village in Andhra Pradesh in a coffin. Strapping young, gone at 40. I picked up his trail, travelling back to his childhood village in Nellore, standing at the foot of the small hill that first dented the boy Mallis imagination. I then travelled to Tirupati, Visakhapatnam and finally to Sikkims Yuksom, the base camp of his dream. From that small hill in Andhra Pradesh, Malli went on to climb the seven highest summits in each continent, a pioneering Indian feat.Sreedevi T V (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Sreedevi T V (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Sreedevi T V, Malayala Manorama: For her profile of a 94-year-old nature conservationist. During one of our evening meetings, our co-ordinating editor asked me to meet a woman who had dug a pond all by herself at Haripad in Alappuzha district. Thats how I met Bhavani Amma at her house where she lived with her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Before I started, I asked her how old she was and she said 94. I was dumbstruck. As she spoke about the well she had dug, the trees she had planted and the saplings waiting to be planted, I realised Bhavani Amma was a true Gandhian. Now that I have won this coveted award, I believe its she who is being honoured.Foreign Correspondent Covering IndiaVictor Mallet, Financial Times: For his ground report on pollution in the Ganga. Im delighted the win this award for two reasons. First, it was for a story about the Ganga and the importance of saving the river from pollution and over-extraction of water. When I was doing my research, I was disappointed to find how little has been achieved in the past three years, even though Narendra Modi had made it a priority when he stood in Varanasi and won the general election in 2014. Second, I found The Indian Express to be by far the best of Indias English-language newspapers during my four years based in Delhi covering South Asia.Commentary and Interpretative WritingAnna M M Vetticad, BLink: For her piece on the stereotypical portrayal of women professionals in TV and films. The July 2015 instalment of Film Fatale, my column in The Business Lines BLink, under the headline, The Rape of Avanthika, was about the misogyny and romanticised sexual violence in the Telugu blockbuster Bahubali. Despite furious fan responses, it was gratifying to see the piece play a part in at least marginally steering discussions away from the movie marketing hype and towards its illiberal content. This is the goal of Film Fatale, which was conceived as a commentary on the intersection of cinema, politics and society. In 2015, the column also covered the ageism actresses face worldwide, the representation of marginalised communities in Indian cinema and other concerns. This award for the collection of Film Fatales I wrote last year is a validation of my conviction that all cinema is political and even seemingly mindless.Pramit Bhattacharya (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Pramit Bhattacharya (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Pramit Bhattacharya, Mint: For story that exposed how micro-finance may not always be as inclusive as is perceived. I started the Economics Express column a little over two years ago in an attempt to look at issues of everyday life, as well as public policy. The idea was to use the lens of economics and borrow insights from the world of academic research to help shed light on some of these issues. From cows to riots to marriage to micro-finance to climate change, the column has attempted to examine each issue fairly and rigorously by considering the relevant published research on each topic. The Economics Express column written in June 2015  after the micro-finance industry saw a sharp recovery in fiscal 2015  tried to bust the myth that micro-finance was a powerful antidote to poverty.Another column, written earlier that year, explained how economic considerations, rather than religious ones, influenced peoples decision to purchase cows in India, and featured both contemporary and historical debates on the role of religion and economics in influencing such investments.Prakash Kardaley Memorial Award for Civic Journalism(PRINT)Christin Mathew Philip (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Christin Mathew Philip (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Christin Mathew Philip, The Times of India: For his reports on the use of substandard construction material in building roads in Chennai.

Mr. Gandhi should perhaps be reminded of the days of the Emergency. No Congressperson has the moral right to lecture anyone else on the virtues of democracy and speak against the abuse of power before denouncing the Emergency. This might be a big challenge for the party but its high time for them to do this in order to sound more credible.C.G. Kuriakose,Kothamangalam, KeralaThe Congress party seems eager to erase the general perception that the old guard was loathe to have the straight-speaking Rahul Gandhi at the helm (Congress asks Rahul to steer the party ship, Nov. 8). Mr. Gandhi, who has a significant following among the youth in the party, has to cash in on his image of being pro-poor, secular, and not hungry for power. Though tags such as ineffectual communicator and non-assertive politician may haunt him, he has the opportunity to change for the better the partys prospects. Many Pradesh Congress Committees are in disarray and Mr. Gandhi has to groom able leaders at the State level. He also has to expand the partys youth base and ponder why the youth in the country have shifted their allegiance to the BJP. The onerous task of making the party more lively, bringing in accountability, and fixing responsibilities cannot be stressed more. Sonia Gandhis strength was her ability to carry the non-BJP parties along with her and stitch alliances. Mr. Gandhi should learn from his mother.Ganapathi Bhat,AkolaThe Congress has been lying low in practically every State due to lack of leadership and loss of confidence. Rahul Gandhis proposed elevation as president may bring cheer to his supporters but may not change the partys fortunes in the immediate future. In fact, Mr. Gandhi has squandered too many chances to rebuild and rejuvenate the party. Nevertheless, if made party president, he should first revamp the party at the grass-roots level. He should induct new blood while elevating dedicated workers in each State. Otherwise his elevation will be futile.K.R. Srinivasan,SecunderabadAfter the smogIn order to improve the quality of air in any city, the first thing that is required is a change in peoples behaviour and mindset (Solutions after the smog, Nov. 8). Pollution and garbage disposal are often related to peoples livelihoods. While people think of their livelihoods as their own, the pollution or waste that is generated from the same is seen as the governments headache. People criticise the government for its ineffectiveness in checking poor air quality and pollution while forgetting that they themselves are part of this menace. If we take examples from highly polluted cities in other countries, we see that the governments and the people undertook joint efforts to control pollution. The Indian government should frame polices that require the active participation of citizens in controlling pollution.Mudit Katiyar,LucknowDelhi alone does not have polluted air, the whole of India does. The introduction of CNG-run vehicles, which emit nanocarbon according to some studies, and relentless afforestation have been some of the causes of pollution in the capital. The present scenario calls for more sustainable initiatives with short- and long-term perspectives. Bolstering the public transportation network is an immediately plausible solution. People should carpool, follow the odd-even scheme, use cycles as a mode of travel (for which roads, pavements and general infrastructure need to improve), and so on. The burning of crops can be checked only through administrative intervention involving farmer-support measures. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which is aimed at providing clean fuel, are laudable.Anjali B.,ThiruvananthapuramA Bihar-like allianceThere is no harm in contemplating a Bihar-like grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh. But the SP should not forget that parties like the JD(S), JD(U), RLD and RJD have nothing much to offer to it in the U.P. battlefield (Chasing a grand alliance, Nov. 8). The main reason for the Bihar victory was that both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad buried their differences and consolidated anti-BJP votes to hand out a shocking defeat to the BJP. If the SP wants a similar story in U.P., party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav must first approach Mayawati. This is the only way he can hope to win this election, especially after the Yadav family feud, because the Congress is still a fringe player.Bal Govind,NoidaStunt gone wrongThat two Kannada stunt actors Anil and Uday drowned in a lake after jumping off a helicopter during a fighting sequence for a film made for sad reading (Stunt goes off script during Kannada movie shoot, Nov. 8). It is made even more tragic by the fact that Anil said just before the stunt that he barely knew how to swim! The incident smacks of sheer madness and irresponsibility on the part of the film producer, director and the whole crew. That a boat was not nearby to haul them up after the rescue makes it all the more bizarre.S. Ramakrishnasayee,RanipetFood and nutritionAlthough the public distribution system has provided poor households across the nation accessibility to regular and subsidised food grains, it fails to fulfil nutrition standards. Hidden hunger in India is created due to paucity of essential micronutrients in the body even if a large amount of food is consumed (Linking food and nutrition security, Nov. 8). The rice that is distributed is polished and lacks nutrition-rich barn. Diversification of food distributed in the PDS is the need of the hour. Cereals fulfil our carbohydrates requirement, but protein is required for overall physical and mental development. It is time to increase pulse production and distribution through the PDS. The most important step is biofortification, a process through which the nutritional quality of crops is improved through biotechnology or selective breeding.Gagan Pratap Singh,NoidaD-Day in the U.S.The U.S. presidential election has been one of the most debated events in recent times as the future President will not only impact the lives of Americans but of people across the world (America goes to polls today, Nov. 8). Even if the U.S.s hegemony has come under challenge, whether due to rising anti-Americanism in West Asia or due to what Fareed Zakaria calls the rise of the rest, the election is still important.With the global economy still not fully healthy, the EU facing a crisis, the Middle East in a state of chaos, and with threats from the Islamic State, who becomes President will determine how these issues are tackled.Abhilash Thimmaiah,New Delhi"
5909e87a7be9e033b96e959d,The arhar solution to pollution,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-pollution-arhar-pulses-demand-supply-gap-burning-of-paddy-4364802/,2016-11-09,"(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The inferno of environmental pollution that the nations capital and its surroundings have been witnessing has many causes, including weather conditions (thermal inversion) that facilitate the settling of particulate matter and other pollution, dust on the streets generated in part from construction activity, and vehicle-related emissions. Particularly critical is the burning of paddy after the kharif harvest which happens every year.Multiple causes will require a broad-based response but one of the permanent solutions to the pollution problem must address paddy burning. This is where pulses come in. In the Subramanian Committee report on pulses that was submitted last month to the ministers of finance, agriculture and consumer affairs, the possibilities created by a new variety of arhar (pigeon pea) developed by K.V. Prabhu and his colleagues at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) were discussed.This variety (Pusa Arhar16) has the potential to be grown in the paddy-growing regions of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and eventually in all of India. Its yield (about 2000 kg/hectare) will be significantly greater than those of the existing varieties and because its size will be uniform, it will be amenable to mechanical harvesting, an attractive feature for farmers in northern India who currently use this technology for paddy.Most important, arhar straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content, which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case of arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the left-over straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast. All this is difficult with left-over paddy stalks that cannot be easily salvaged or ploughed back (it is very firm). Farmers, therefore, choose the easiest option of simply burning it.But replacing paddy with pulses (in over half million hectares or more eventually) will have other social benefits. Our calculations suggest that pulses will use less fertiliser, less water, and fewer emissions, and in addition will replenish the soil with nitrogen unlike paddy which depletes the soil (see table). Together, pulses production would provide social benefits that we estimated at Rs 13,240 per hectare. On this basis, we had suggested an MSP for pulses over the medium term of close to Rs 9,000 per quintal so that it could become competitive with paddy. This would also preserve the incomes of farmers.But, of course, we had understated the social benefits of growing pulses. In the report, we had highlighted that there would be additional benefits: Specifically, the reduced environmental pollution because less paddy would be burnt. But we were unable to quantify these benefits for lack of data. This needs to be rectified immediately to make public and transparent the consequences of current policies.The broader policy lessons outlined in the pulses report have acquired new salience in the light of the pollution problem. These lessons bear emphasis.First, the future of sustainable agriculture must be based on encouraging agricultural science and research especially where Indias scientists have done the hard and creative work. Agricultural research institutions must be free from political interference, must be accorded autonomy, and must reward proven talent.Second, making the fruits of science commercially viable will require price incentives to be re-evaluated. In the case of pulses and paddy, a complicating factor that determines the relative incentives is risk. Because of guaranteed MSPs in paddy, it is less risky to grow than pulses. The Subramanian Committee estimated that pulses production was about six times riskier than paddy production. To compensate this, the required MSP for pulses would have to be about Rs1100 per ton greater than otherwise.Third, pricing in India must increasingly take account of externalities, positive and negative. In the case of agriculture, that means adapting the current methodology of setting MSPs used by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) that focuses exclusively on private costs and benefits. This tends to encourage socially wasteful production and specialisation such as excessive paddy production in north India with all the attendant consequences to which we are grim witnesses. As argued by Professor Ramesh Chand of Niti Aayog and recommended by the Subramanian Committee report, MSP setting must incorporate social costs and benefits.The burning of rice stalks affords an opportunity to implement a major shift in policy that can reduce pollution while also promoting indigenous research and science, incentivising pulses production, and rationalising pricing more broadly. Converting crises into opportunities is the hallmark of good public policy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58e4d9dba3d24b1c91ee03e7,Straws in the wind,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Straws-in-the-wind/article16275518.ece,2016-11-10,"NO option:Studies show that even though farmers are aware that the burning of straw is harmful to health, they do not have alternatives for utilising them effectively. A farmer in Punjab.Photo: AFPDelhi has registered its worst air quality in recent times. This has prompted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to call it a gas chamber. Pollution in different parts of the capital has touched hazardous levels with potentially serious health effects on the rich and poor alike, especially on children, the elderly and physically vulnerable people. Leaving aside the politics, the Central and Delhi governments should take urgent measures to prevent air pollution in order to stem the current impact as well as the future cost of healthcare.It is often pointed out that paddy stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab is a major reason for affecting air quality in Delhi during the onset of winter. Stubble burning is a common practice followed by farmers in these States to prepare the field for sowing of wheat in November as there is little time left between the harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat. Since this practice is followed every year despite some efforts by the State governments to prevent it, the problem of air quality getting affected in Delhi during October-November will recur. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and address the fundamental problems that force the farmers to burn the paddy straw on the field and not utilise it for any productive purpose. It may appear that paddy straw has no economic value for farmers in these States.The rice-wheat rotationHistorically, rice was not a major crop grown in Punjab and Haryana. In Punjab, rice accounted for only 7.6 per cent of the total cropped area during 1970-1973, which increased to a whopping 36 per cent during 2011-13. Similarly, in Haryana, paddy area increased from 5.6 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period. Extensive development of irrigation, assured price (minimum support price) and secured market (government procurement) have induced farmers to grow paddy and expand the area of cultivation considerably over time. Consequently, farmers in this traditionally wheat-growing belt started cultivating rice and wheat in rotation year after year. Various studies have shown that the rice-wheat rotation has put land and other resources under severe strain, resulting in depletion of soil nutrients, decline in water table, build-up of pests and diseases, and micronutrient deficiency. The State governments initiatives to push crop diversification as a strategy to overcome these problems have not convinced farmers to break the rice-wheat rotation. Crop diversification with vegetables and fruits hit a roadblock due to marketing problems.Being agriculturally progressive States, almost all farmers in Punjab and Haryana grow high-yield varieties of rice and wheat. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average rice yield was as high was four tonnes per hectare in Punjab and 3.2 tonnes in Haryana. These States have also experienced a high level of mechanisation of agricultural operations including harvesting. In fact, combine harvesters have been extensively used for harvesting of paddy and wheat due to non-availability of labour at the time of harvesting and increase in labour cost. A rough estimate based on the grain to straw ratio showed that Punjab with an average rice production of 11.1 million tonnes during 2011-13 generated about 16.6 million tonnes of paddy straw. Similarly, in Haryana, the average rice output was 1.3 lakh tonnes and it produced about 1.9 lakh tonnes of straw.Use of machines for harvesting has serious implications for crop residue management at the farm level. The combine harvester cuts the crop well above the ground, leaving behind substantial amount of stubble on the field. The machine leaves the residues in such a state that it is difficult to collect them manually. However, the farmers found ways to collect the wheat residue (bhusa) as it is a highly valuable animal feed and is even traded across districts. Given its economic use, the farmers run a chaff combine (reaper) after combine harvesting to collect straws, cut stubbles and make into chaff for feeding to animals directly or mixed with green fodder. So the burning of wheat residue is not necessary for the farmers because of the availability of technology and its higher economic value as dry fodder. Rice straw, however, is not used as fodder as it is found to be non-palatable to animals due to its high silica content. Because of its little economic value as animal feed and other general uses, farmers are prompted to burn it on the field instead of incurring a high cost on collecting it. In fact, field studies show that even though farmers are aware that the burning of straw is harmful to health, they do not have alternatives for utilising them effectively. Therefore, blaming only the farmers may not solve the problem of air pollution and there is a need to find sustainable technological solutions that can help farmers and simultaneously allow everyone to breathe clean air.Looking through the hazeBiomass provides safe and reliable energy. The available paddy straw can be effectively used for power generation, which will go a long way towards overcoming the problem of disposal of crop residues and power deficit in the region. According to data from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Punjab and Haryana have not made much progress in creating biomass-based power generation plants as compared to States such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Thus, there is great potential for making investments in paddy straw-based power plants which can help avoid stubble burning to a large extent and also create employment opportunities.Incorporation of crop residues in the soil can improve soil moisture and help activate the growth of soil microorganisms for better plant growth. However, suitable machinery for collection, chopping and in situ incorporation of straw is required. Further, initiatives can also be made to convert the removed residues into enriched organic manure through composting.Presently, a limited quantity of paddy straw is used for cardboard making and in packing industries and paper mills. However, new opportunities for industrial use  such as extraction of yeast protein  can be explored through scientific research.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality. Use of such dual-purpose rice varieties will help to maintain food security, farm income and improve environmental sustainability.Elumalai Kannan is Associate Professor at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality"

""Farmers need to be told about new and innovative agronomic practices for increasing yield as well as income,"" he said. He also wanted the ICAR to come up with technologies to predict the locations of rainfall.Calling for large scale mechanization as lack of labour poses a major threat to agriculture, he said there is a huge shortage even in machines that are hired out.Stressing on the need to provide advice to the farmers, he said mechanisms should be invented such that the farmer need not travel more than 2 or 3 kms to get information.Trilochan Mohapatra, director general of ICAR said farmers should quit the traditional method of farming and adopt new technology and go for value addition, in view of water limitations. K Ramasamy, Vice Chancellor, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University emphasized the need for earmarked areas for producing agricultural crops in the country. Expressing concern over the shrinkage in area under agriculture, reduction in the contribution of Agriculture to GDP, low investments in agriculture and lack of intelligent marketing facilities for the farm produce, he stressed the need for empowering the agricultural graduates as they are the biggest strength for improving the NARS of the country.The zone VIII covers 82 Krishi Vigyan Kendras in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, Puducherry and Laksadweep. Around 150 delegates including vice-chancellors, directors of research and ICAR institutes, extension education and deans of various state agricultural universities along with officials from government departments of agriculture, forests, animal husbandry and fisheries took part in the event. The meeting serves as a platforms for establishing better linkages between the NARS (National Agricultural Research System) and the state departments. They also identify research gaps by State Agricultural Universities/ICAR institutes and constraints in transfer of agricultural technology by extension agencies."

Health-conscious Indians are choosing oats over rice and wheat due to their superior nutrient profile.Indians can't go to bed without carbs  we may have had plates of finger foods like tikkas or chaat but until we have rice or roti, we can't fall asleep. This may be fast changing as the health-conscious are switching to oats for dinner.Oats are a coarse grain, traditionally fed to horses, but new wisdom on nutrition has elevated it to a super grain. It is pushing soft rotis and fragrant rice out of the thali. And it helps that they cook fast.Saurabh Gupta grew up eating rotis but for the past two years, this Delhi-based communications professional, has switched to oats khichdi for dinner. ""I cook regular oats with vegetables and onions and garnish with jeera tadka. I have it thrice a week,"" says Gupta.Oats are not cultivated in India but they have been popular as a breakfast cereal for more than a decade with various brands selling processed oats that can be consumed like a porridge with milk.PIPPING WHEAT AND RICEIn recent years, both rice and wheat have suffered blows to their reputation as the fitness gurus popularised low or no-carb diets. Development of conclusive tests to diagnose Celiac disease made a villain out of gluten, a protein abundant in wheat. People with Celiac disease are allergic to gluten, which is also responsible for poor gut health So what does one have for a meal? Oats, recommend nutritionists and health experts. Compared to rice and wheat, oats have an impressive nutrient profile and the unique distinction of having a high concentration of beta-glucan, a fibre that lowers LDL or bad cholesterol. Consuming 70g of oats a day can provide you the required daily amount of 3g of this magic ingredient.Oats enthusiasts can dig into oats recipes flooding the internet. From poha to porridge and from dosa to dhokla, there is a way to include oats in a variety of Indian preparations.Rahul Mehta, a communications professional in Delhi, adds oats to multigrain atta to amp up the health quotient of rotis and also makes poha with it. ""Oats are pretty filling and you tend to eat less,"" says Mehta adding that he avoids instant, ready-to-eat oats which are not has healthy as the steel-cut variety.""Instant oats have a higher glycemic index,"" explains Dr Shweta Rastogi, chief dietician, Guru Nanak Hospital, Mumbai. However, most consumers may not know the difference and believe all oats are healthy.MARKET FOR HEALTHRecently, Future Group launched oats atta, which can be used to prepare bread, roti, idli, dhokla and sweets. ""It can be integrated into daily food as well as also in all regional cuisines so that everyone can eat healthier meals all day long "" says Devendra Chawla, group president food brands and FMCG, Future Group.Saffola launched ready-to-eat masala oats five years ago and the product now enjoys a CAGR of 50% and a household penetration of 6-8% in major metros, says Anuradha Aggarwal, chief marketing officer, Marico. Aditya Bagri, vice-president, Bagrry's, reports a 40% increase in the sales of the brand's oats in the past year.Despite the buzz around this 'third grain', its market in India is just Rs 350 crore, or around 26% of the entire breakfast market that stands at Rs 1,300 crore. ""In contrast the instant noodles market is much bigger at around Rs 3,500 crore. So in 15 years oats has not really taken off as it's not a part of local everyday cuisine which is where we want to work and there's immense potential for growth,"" Chawla points out.However, replacing a traditional balanced Indian meal comprising carbohydrates, protein, fibre and micronutrients with just a bowl of oats does not make sense to everyone. Well-known nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar argues, ""The human body maintains good health when the food is diverse. This remains the corner stone of maintaining gut bacteria diversity too. Diverse diets are achieved by eating fresh, local and cooking by using regional or time-tested recipes. This works well for small farmers too as they don't have either the budget, reach or vocabulary to influence the influencers."" She explains that patronising local food also means generating a smaller carbon footprint. ""My free advice to food companies is use your massive distribution network, which allows us to have colas, instant noodles and oats on mountain tops and sunny beaches, to collect the garbage that the packaging creates. If nothing, use that profit to reduce the ecological damage,"" she says. ""The idli won't leave behind plastic but oats will.""Oats market in IndiaRs 350 crBreakfast market in IndiaRs 1,300 crShare of oats26%"

Picture by Rajesh Shrivastava Nov. 12: Villagers allegedly looted a ration shop in Madhya Pradesh after its owner refused to accept 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, as people's patience seemed to wear thin at many places in the country after four days of the cash crisis spawned by demonetisation. Munnilal Ahirwar says he watched helplessly last evening as over 100 villagers, many of them women, looted bags of wheat, rice and sugar from his store at Bardua in Chhattarpur district. Ahirwar was allegedly roughed up each time he raised his voice or tried to physically stop the looters. ""I recognised most of the faces, but will the police act?"" he asked today. Police from the nearest outpost, 6km away, arrived this morning and registered a case of looting against unknown people. Long queues were seen at bank branches for the third consecutive day throughout Madhya Pradesh, while most ATMs remained non-functional for the fourth day, adding to the popular frustration. For the past three days, most rural areas have received no cash from big cities like Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which are battling their own cash problems. A video clip went viral on the social media, purportedly showing the police thrashing people who had lost their cool after waiting hours outside a bank in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh today. The cops are seen beating the people with canes and belts outside the State Bank of India branch in Porsa. The customers had tried to barge into the branch around 3pm, apparently angered by a policeman on duty allowing some people in through the backdoor, an eyewitness said. ""No one has approached us with a complaint yet, but I'm going to look into the incident and if the policemen are found guilty, they will be punished,"" superintendent of police Vineet Khanna said. In Chhattarpur's Motwan mohalla, Mathura Prasad Ahirwar was able to perform the last rites of his wife Raj Bai only after neighbours pooled the necessary money. His granddaughter Anuradha said the cost of the necessary materials such as milk, yoghurt, honey, ghee, wood and sandalwood came to more than Rs 2,200 but the shopkeeper refused to accept the demonetised notes. Eventually, the funeral was performed after sunset, which is not the preferred time according to local custom. In Sagar district, retired BSNL official Vinod Kumar Pande, 69, suddenly collapsed and died after standing in queue for an hour at a Union Bank branch. He was carrying Rs 4,000 in large currency in his pocket that he had wanted to exchange. Customers ran wild when a bank at Sujdu Chungi in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, delayed the exchange of the demonetised currency yesterday saying it lacked 100 and 50-rupee notes. Some people damaged the cash counter and stoned the police when they arrived. The mob also damaged a government bus and two private cars on the street outside. Later, the police carried out a baton-charge that left Khatiza Begum, 30, and Ayesha, a two-year-old girl, injured. Some people claimed the police had also fired in the air outside the bank. During the vandalism, a few customers chanted "" Mera desh bigad raha hai (My country is deteriorating)"" - a take-off of the slogan ""Mera desh badal raha hai (My country is changing)"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted after completing two years in office in May. Eyewitnesses said the problem began at 11am when an iron net attached to the teller's window, which some customers had grabbed as they jostled to get closer to the counter, came off under their collective weight. Someone then smashed the glass pane at the counter, prompting nervous bank officials to call the police. ""The bus driver and the bank manager have lodgedcases against unidentified people,"" circle police officer Tejveer Singh said. ""We are trying to identify and arrest them."" He said the bank received cash after an hour. Some 200 angry customers waiting outside a State Bank of Travancore branch in Kerala's Kollam district allegedly broke a glass door today after the bank decided to down shutters because of the heavy rush. The police are questioning several people. Long queues formed outside bank branches across Kerala for the third day, amid complaints that the ATMs were running out of cash. An elderly man had collapsed and died while queuing to deposit cash yesterday at Haripad in Alappuzha district, while another man fell to his death from a building housing a bank branch in Kannur. People clashed with bank officials at several places in Gujarat, prompting police baton-charges and detention. Customers complained that several ATMs were closed and that banks were exchanging the demonetised notes with coins and very small-denomination currencies. ""Even hospitals are refusing to accept the larger notes,"" Ramesh Agarwal said. ""Bank officials said they had run out of the new 2,000-rupee notes and only had coins,"" said Bipin Patel. ""They have given me coins for Rs 4,000, which is very difficult to carry."" Rajesh Shah, a senior citizen, said: ""We stood in queues for two days.... We have Rs 3 lakh in our bank account but can't buy essentials. Modi should have made proper arrangements for cash."" The police caned customers who had clashed with bank officials when they refused to dispense money at a branch at Shihori in Banaskantha district. A similar incident was reported from Abdasa in Kutch. A senior assistant of the Kolhapur zilla parishad in Maharashtra was arrested on the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs 35,000 that contained 17 newly introduced Rs 2,000 currency notes, officials said. Chandrakant Sawardekar, 45, had allegedly promised to help the complainant secure a promotion as a principal in a zilla parishad-run school."

Thats how we have Moplah Food Festival happening at Aish, The Park which will be on till November 20.So what exactly is the new fetish about Moplah food? Its a region of North Kerala dominated by Muslim population who trace their roots to the Arabs as the latter came to the region for the trade of spices and silk. Talk about spices and the same reflects in the cuisine. Chef Abida Rasheed speaks amiably dropping abundant portions on our plates asking the stewards to bring more warm food. There was not command in her tone but affection that reflects in the dishes she so lovingly cooks. We enjoyed eating Mutton Ishtew that had the desired consistency, neither gooey nor sticky  just the right thickness that you can relish with Kerala Parota. The potatoes were succulent and dissolved with the curry, the mutton pieces were juicy and soft. The green coriander leaves just added the ghar ka khana bit. Food needs to be cooked in clay pots as the same give breathing space to your food which keeps your food fresh for a longer time, said the chef.Its not just clay pots that do the wonder, the use of ghee gives the food its own deliciously different taste thats how the mutton biryani she cooked turned out to be really different from what we eat in Hyderabad, Calcutta or Lucknow. The rice used wasnt the long-grained biryani rice, instead the grains were smaller and better known as Khaima rice. She describes, Earlier this rice used to grow in valleys and as the wind blew the crop became more fragrant. It cooks really well giving the biryani its unique texture.We relished Kozhi Nirachathu, pot roasted chicken with deep-fried onion gravy that had that subtle sweet flavour. Begum Abida added, We use spring chickens that dont weigh more than 400 gms. The bones of these chickens give that special flavour and taste to the curry.And not just these dishes there are a variety to be relished such as: Meen Porichattu, Vada with thenga manga chutney, Kadala Kari, Parupu Kari and more. It was the dessert which amazed us. The egg yolk and white had been separated and cooked differently. The egg white was steamed with sugar, while the yolk was whisked and dropped in loops in hot boiling sugar syrup which gave it noodle like shape and consistency. It was topped on the sweet steamed white. Any guesses for the name? Its that famous Mutta Mala people associated Moplah cuisine with.Price: `999 all inclusive for lunch and `1,495 all inclusive for dinner."

Rice, coconut, pepper, cashew and rubber form the backbone of Keralas rural economy and most of the small scale/marginal farmers in these sectors transact in cash.Even the workers of these rural economy section are paid their wages in cash. While the consumption pattern of common men is likely to get affected because of the cash crunch, the traders will also hesitate to buy crops - at least in the next quarter. As per the available statistics (2015), the production of rubber in Kerala was 6,48,220 tonnes, coconut -5921 and rice 564325.We used to buy coconut from farmers and they are paid after one to three months after getting the sales returns from the primary and value added products. But after the demonetisation drive, sales figures have started to dip. For instance, under the Palakkad Coconut Producers Company, there are 40 outlets across the state which sell primary products of coconut and value added products like Neera. Before demonetisation, our sales were `50,000 per day. For the last four days, the average sales per day was only `10,000. The demand for coconut oil too has dwindled. Under the prevailing circumstances, we will not be able to procure coconuts from the farmers, said Vinod Kumar P, CEO, Palakkad Coconut Producers Company.Agricultural Department of Kerala officials said paddy cultivation was showing a downward curve but they were expecting nearly 5 per cent growth in rubber and coconut production. Demonetisation has scuttled the progress, they said. Many of these farmers buy seeds, fertilisers and farm equipment in cash. They also pay their workers in cash and both sections will feel the heat."

Owners like Ganga Prasad Shao, whose outlet is at Bistupur market, has been accepting old currency notes from his loyal customers. But, his supplier, a wholesaler, refuses extend that courtesy to him. Subhas Mondal's worry is on the same lines. His problem is that the wholesaler he buys from isn't chasing him for payments, fearing he will be dumped with old currency. ""But where will I generate cash to pay our wholesalers, especially when we are accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from regular customers,"" he asked. There are hundreds of retailers who are facing the same predicament as Shao and Mondal after the demonetisation of high-value currency was announced a week ago. Mondal said he wasn't sure if he would be able to stock up food-grain and edible oil at his shop next month. ""As we are dependent on cash transactions, both with our customers as well as wholesalers, we cannot suddenly switch over to doing business in cheques. Moreover, we have to look after the interest of our regular customers too. Hence, we are left with no option but to accept banned currencies,"" he said. Several other retailers claimed that wholesalers had stopped supplies. ""I had gone to bring 10 tins of mustard oil, but returned with only two as the wholesaler refused to give me the stuff on credit. I had no other option but to pay cash,"" said Murlidhar Agrawal, a grocer of Sakchi market. Deepak Bhalotia, a rice trader with an office and godown at Krishi Bazaar Samiti at Parsudih, confirmed that wholesalers like him had stopped supplies and weren't accepting payments in old notes. ""We do our business with rice traders in Bengal, Odisha and Chhatisgarh in cheque. We also pay our traders in cash, but when the government has banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, why should we accept them from the retailers,"" he asked, adding that they were following this practice since the morning of November 9, the day after the demonetisation was announced. Bhalotia said the government was in the process of releasing new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. ""Let retailers come with these notes and we will resume our business. But we will not accept banned currency,"" he said."

58d80aa4a3d24b75f2772581,"Delhi wakes up, others smug to smog",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/City-wakes-up-others-smug-to-smog/articleshow/55464915.cms,2016-11-17,"New Delhi: Around a week after the National Green Tribunal defined the parameters of 'severe' pollution and a more debilitating 'environmental emergency' and ordered Delhi and four others states to put in place certain measures to deal with the degradation in air quality, the states are responding slowly. Only Delhi, naturally for the city most affected, has reacted with some degree of urgency.A severe pollution level, as defined by NGT, meant a PM2.5 level of 251 microgram/cubic metre and PM10 level of 431 microgram/cubic metre (the standard safe levels for these categories are 60 and 100, respectively). When these levels reached 300 and 500 respectively, an 'environmental emergency' was in the offing. In such conditions, NGT said on November 10, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan were to consider measures such as curbing crop stubble burning, raining water from the air to sink polluting particles, suspending construction and demolition activities and ordering cessation of carbon producing activities like brick making and thermal energy generationWith crop burning a major factor, NGT had ordered states to provide alternatives to the incineration of the post-harvest rice plant stalks. The two states most liable for this, Punjab and Haryana, reported some action. In both the states, the governments have provided funds to equip farmers with happy seeders, or devices that can be used to plant wheat without the need for the field to be cleared of the paddy stubble. In Punjab, the government distributed 280 happy seeders, while Haryana has promised farmers a 50% subsidy for the purchase of these implements.In accordance with the previous NGT directions, the agriculture department in Punjab has prepared plans to provide farmers with straw management equipment costing Rs 1,602 crore and has approached the centre for funds. Haryana has similarly decided to install straw balers in each block there next year.To stop the burning of field residue, Haryana booked 1,600 farmers for violating the ban and recovered Rs 16 lakh from them as fine in the past 20 days. Delhi too has clamped down on the open burning of leaves and waste, with violators coughing up Rs 63.7 lakh as fines till last week. In addition, the municipal corporations have pulled up other offenders, among them 476 in South Delhi alone.The government in Rajasthan ordered the temporary closure of stone crushing units and brick kilns, while remaining alert to the burning of agriculture residue, garbage and dry leaves. Sanitation workers have been directed to clean the streets only at night, and all construction activities are to be carried out with proper dust management systems in place.Delhi has temporarily closed the Badarpur thermal power plant and stalled construction and demolition activities for 10 days. A committee, which included the chief secretary and environment secretary, will discuss the issue of water spraying with the centre. An official said, ""Since Pawan Hans helicopters do not have the desired capacity, we approached the centre about harnessing Indian Air Force choppers. But the union environment and forests ministry told us it could not help us. Meanwhile, PWD is spraying water along major roads through hose pipes.""Like Rajasthan, Haryana too has stopped stone crushers and suspended brick kiln work for a few days. S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board , said the state was amenable to water sprinkling too. ""In urgent circumstances, we may follow this measure,"" Narayanan said.Directed to start vacuum cleaning of roads in Delhi, PWD had expected tenders for mechanical sweepers to be decided by November 10, but no one put in a bid, mainly due to the uncertainty caused by the demonetisation of high-value currency notes. The tendering process has been extended for some time. The transport department has deregistered 1.91 lakh diesel vehicles, deemed to over 15 years old and polluting, and officials said the list of such vehicles were sent to the traffic police last Friday, with instructions to impound them immediately.Members of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board , which met on November 15, admit that compliance of NGT orders would be tough given the state's geographical area. A senior official said that coordinating with the various government departments concerned would take time. However, the state is indeed thinking of means to reduce carbon pollution, including contemplating asking industries to use high-end boilers and process heaters.The UP government is willing to comply with the National Green Tribunal's orders to control air pollution, senior government officials in Lucknow said. SC Yadav, member, UP Pollution Control Board , said that the state sub-committee on the matter would discuss the draft plan, methodology and procedure that UP would follow to control air pollution on November 24.A meeting of the central monitoring committee has been summoned in New Delhi on November 17, where the states will further discuss NGT's directives."

Archive photo The court suggested that the government issue an advisory regarding high air pollution levels and its dangers. Archive photoTWO DAYS before the Delhi Half Marathon, the High Court on Friday suggested that the Delhi government issue an advisory regarding the high air pollution levels and its dangers to the public.You should warn everyone that pollution levels are high. Anyone with respiratory or cardiac problems may collapse because of exhaustion. You should not be running in this (marathon), said a bench of Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Justice Jayant Nath. The bench added, If someone can run in Delhi, they can run anywhere.The observation came after the court noted that on November 17, the Air Quality Index had shown that PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels were approximately four times more than the prescribed safe standard.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe court also directed the Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan governments to phase out diesel-run taxis and introduce CNG taxis in the NCR. The All India Taxi Permits granted by these states for taxis to ply inter-state should be streamlined, said the bench. It was informed that of the 1.9 lakh taxis in Delhi, 80,000 run on diesel, while 35,000 inter-state permit cabs violate the 2001 Supreme Court order  which states that all commercial vehicles in Delhi must run on CNG.Why cant Punjab, Haryana and UP stop giving permits to diesel-run cabs? Their polluting vehicles are also coming to Delhi, observed the bench. The bench added that ban on diesel taxis could be extended to inter-state buses as well.What are you going to do to prevent the burning of paddy straw, and what is your plan of action for All India Permit taxis to move towards CNG? asked the court.Refusing to accept the argument that CNG pumps are not available in the other states, the bench has asked for a clear-cut plan with timelines for introducing CNG stations and phasing out diesel-run taxis from the four NCR states within three weeks.On the issue of crop stubble burning in Punjab, the bench once again pulled up the state government for not taking steps to stop the practice. Punjab alone generates 17 million tonnes of rice paddy straw every year, of which only a small percentage is used by cardboard and paper factories. More than 13 million tonnes is being burned. Do we know how much pollution that causes? asked the bench. The court has also asked the Central Pollution Control Board to conduct a study on the amount of pollutants released from the burning of crop residue and submit a report.With the recent spike in pollution due to lighting of firecrackers on Diwali, the court suggested that the government could consider giving fewer firecracker licences and designate certain areas for fireworks display.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""If the availability of cash doesn't improve in December, we will extend the credit facility till the end of the year,"" food and civil supplies minister U.T. Khader said today. He said PDS beneficiaries would be able to avail themselves of the facility from tomorrow. Chief minister P.C. Siddaramiah had earlier asked his ministers to keep a watch on developments following the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. ""The urban poor may not be that badly hit as some of them have cash in hand. But it's the villagers and people living in highlands and the fringes of forests who have been badly affected by the demonetisation,"" Khader said. ""Things would have been better had co-operative banks been allowed to accept old notes as they have a good presence in rural areas,"" he added. The minister said labourers in tea and coffee estates and the agriculture sector were also facing difficulties. ""Their employers don't have cash to pay wages,"" Khader said. Those who will buy grain and oil on credit will have to pay the due amount when they purchase rations in January. Their accounts in the computerised public distribution system will reflect the outstanding amount. ""I hope cash will be easily available by January,"" the minister said. The state offers Above Poverty Line (APL) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) ration cards, depending on the annual income of the beneficiary. APL card-holders get 5kg of rice and an equal amount of wheatfor Rs 15 and Rs 10, respectively, a month. BPL card-holders get 30kg of free rice, besides subsidised sugar and edible oil. Villagers with no cooking gas get kerosene as well. Both APL and BPL card-holders will get the credit facility. Khader said the credit facility would not burden the government. ""Once the card-holders pay back the dues, ration shop owners will have to deposit the amount to the government,"" he said. The government spends Rs 42 crore a month to provide rations to APL and BPL card-holders through a network of more than 20,000 ration shops. Karnataka has so far issued around 35 lakh APL card and nearly a crore BPL cards. Ration shops are gearing up to meet the likely rush of customers once the facility kicks in tomorrow. Manjunath, who works in a ration shop in the east Bangalore neighbourhood of Doopanahalli, said he was aware of the credit facility and would adhere to the government order. Nagrathnamma, who ekes out a living by selling snacks near a slum in Ulsoor, just a few kilometres from the upmarket MG Road, can't believe she can buy rations on credit. ""Let me get it first,"" the mother of two said. ""I am yet to purchase my rations this month as I don't have enough money after paying my son's school fees,"" she said, adding her daily earnings had dropped from over Rs 300 a day to Rs 60 yesterday as the cash crunch as hit street vendors as well."

Maharajakumar of Vizianagaram, who was popularly known as Vizzy, was a most colourful character in Indian cricket.As Virat Kohli battles Alastair Cook at Vizag, the long shadow of crickets princely history falls on Indias newest Test venue. Sriram Veera takes a small jaunt away from the ongoing Test to recount the fascinating tale and intrigue of Indian crickets grand old fiddler Maharajakumar of Vizianagaram aka Vizzy.Its not known whether Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe had spicy chicken curry rice at Vizianagaram in 1931 but they should have sampled it. Its yummy. Long before Alastair Cook or even Geoffrey Boycott came to India, one of the best opening pairs in cricketing history were in this region. The man responsible for bringing Hobbs and Sutcliffe was Maharajakumar of Vizianagaram, popularly known as Vizzy  a most colourful character in Indian cricket. His is a tale that has everything  personal ambition, tussle among princes, fights with commoner cricketers, loads of cash, patronage for cricket. A minor royal who dreamed big.Vizianagaram is a historic town 50 kms north east of Vizag, famous in the 1700s for its battles between the kings of Vizianagaram and Bobilli, which also played out as proxy wars between the British and French. Its well connected to the cricket stadium where incidentally the pavilion, the first structure to go up on the ground that used to be filled with fly-ash in the days gone by, is named after Dr. Vizzy. It could well have been Sir Vizzy for he was knighted by the Queen in the 30s but relinquished it after India became a free country. Vizzy wasnt even the crown prince, he was the second son of the king and his brother ascended the throne, but he was a man with great ambition, and tagged himself with the unique title Maharajakumar, son of Maharaja.The old fort of Vizianagaram of Vizzys ancestors still stands, an 8-rupee shared-auto ride from the bus stand. Eateries abound here and there with delectable local fare. There isnt much to see but the old man guarding the gate tells you to go around the fort, from outside, to see narrow holes in the grounds. It used to be a moat filled with crocodiles to keep the enemies at bay. A trust MANAS runs a school inside the dilapidated fort now, and a small book-fair  books from Peter Drucker to Amitav Ghosh are spread out on a few tables  is currently being held on the eve of the Test. Schoolgirls form a disciplined queue and walk towards the books.About 10 kms from the fort, stands a Sainik school, which once used to be Vizzys palace with a tree-ringed cricket ground. Hobbs and Sutcliffe must have passed the fort to get to this palace where they not only stayed but also batted a bit. It was in Benaras in Uttar Pradesh where Vizzy moved after the death of his father into a palace owned by Vizianagaram royal family that Hobbs hit his first hundred in India. The bat with which he scored those runs is now on display at the Lords museum in London. On it, Hobbs has scribbled, I used this bat in my last Test match versus Australia at the Oval August 1930, also while scoring my first century in India at Benaras, November, 1930.Not only did he get the English openers but Vizzy also drafted in the West Indian all-rounder Learie Constantine to come play in India. Those were the days Vizzy was waging cricket wars with his arch rival the prince of Patiala Bhupinder Singh, and Constantine found himself in the thick of battle in 1933 during the final of Moin-ud-Dowlah tournament between the teams owned by the two princes. Vizzy didnt play that game but he sent a telegram to Constantine, offering to ply with pounds for runs and wickets taken. Vizzys side lost the game by three runs but his battle with Patiala prince over Indian cricket had just begun.*******Vizzy was up against a man incredibly richer than him. Bhupinder Singh was a prince with a lifestyle that can astonish even those who are used to reading about decadent lives of rich and famous. The writer Khushwant Singh had once waded into the prince on print. He was a headstrong bully, a debauch, drunkard, womanizer and philanderer. A proud owner of the famous Patiala necklace as it came to be called that he specially commissioned the Parisian jeweller Cartier and took three years in making  it had 2930 diamonds, weighed 962.25 carats, and included the 7th largest diamond in the world, a 234-carat De Beers. He was the first Indian to own an airplane, had a fleet of Rolls Royce, and the state of Patiala already had Indias first automobile, a French made De Dion Bouton imported in 1892. Also suffice here to say that his sex-tales are mind-boggling, and he reportedly had over 300 concubines.Its not known whether Bhupinder indulged in a traditional ritual but the authors of Freedom at Midnight record that his father certainly did  The Maharaja of Patiala would walk out annually, clad just in a diamond breastplate. People would cheer and greet the nude king, a custom that was supposed to ward off evil spirits from the kingdom. Unlike Vizzy, Bhupinder Singh could play pretty decent cricket, and had set his eyes on taking control over the game in the country. But Vizzy could never be accused of being chicken-hearted and was ready to take on the Patiala prince.Without the patronage of these princes, Indian cricket would have been a non-starter for it was they who ploughed money into the game. The princes sponsored tours from visiting teams, also allowed India to go on foreign tours, and the money helped cricketers and cricket to grow.Vizzy vs Bhupinder battle started much before Indias first Test tour of England. The Patiala prince had fallen out with Lord Willingdon, the viceroy of India and the patron of Indian cricket board, and Vizzy moved up as the challenger. The cricket historian Mihir Bose put Vizzy in perspective. In a land where titles were important, Maharajakumar, meaning the son of a king suggested someone connected with royalty but never likely to rule. In English terms he was, at best, a member of the landed gentry. But what he lacked in princely clout he made up in tenacity and an unrivalled capacity for intrigue.In 1931, the cancellation of MCC tour of India due to the political situation allowed Vizzy to step in. He organised cricket tours in India and Ceylon, and it was during this time when he somehow managed to convince Hobbs, who has refused several such Indian tours before, and Sutcliffe. Prominent Indian cricketers like CK Nayudu, Indian crickets first superstar who used to feature in adverts and whose name was used to promote movies, DB Deodhar and Mushtaq Ali too were part of the team. Incidentally, the current Indian and England team bus rolls past a statue of Nayudu thats near the entrance to the Vizag stadium every day. Inexplicably, though, the wondrous hitter, who hit three sixes even at the age of 61 in his last Ranji game for Andhra, is caught in a pose as if he is leaving the ball.*******It was this tour that had Hobbs, Sutcliffe and Nayudu, that Boria Majumdar who has written several tomes on the Indian cricket history especially covering the early battles in the cricket board and the tussles of these princely patrons, notes as the turning point in Vizzys career. Vizzy also cosied up to Willingdon and offered 50,000 rupees to the Indian cricket board  40,000 was proposed for Indias tour of England in 1932.But Bhupinder wasnt done yet. He not only financed the trials for the tour at the Bardari Palace ground in Patiala but also offered to sponsor Indias month-long tour in England. That tilted the scales back in his favour, and he won the first round, as he was named the captain of the touring party. The vice-captaincy was given to a prince Ghanyshyamsinhji of Limbdi and Vizzy was made the deputy vice-captain. Vizzy promptly withdrew from the tour, citing health reasons, and as it turned out, so did Bhupinder. Thus it came to pass that Maharaja of Porbandar was made the captain but luckily, for India, he realised he was the worst cricketer in the camp, and asked CK Nayudu to captain the team.However, Bhupinder lost his hold on the cricketing powers by 1933, perhaps due to Lord Willingdon, and in his book, Bose mentions a 1933 meeting where the members of the board had turned against him. The prince though wouldnt be dissuaded, and threw in the money to win back the hearts. In 1934, during a MCC tour of India, he arranged hunts and shoots for the English, and reportedly won the favour of the captain Douglas Jardine. However Jardine also ended up boosting the profile of Vizzy on that tour praising his captaincy after MCCs solitary loss of the tour came against Vizzys team.The prince and the Maharajakumar made another valiant effort to seize control over Indian cricket. Patiala donated the trophy for the domestic tournament and decided it would be named after Jamsaheb of Nawanagar, Ranjitsinghji, the famous Indian prince who played for England and had died a year before.Not to be outdone, Vizzy too donated a trophy, gold plated and made in London, for the same domestic tournament and in an attempt to ingratiate himself further with the viceroy, said it should be named after Willingdon. Vizzy suggested that Ranji hadnt done much for Indian cricket, and Indias premier tournament shouldnt be named after him. It was around this time that the teams of Vizzy and Patiala met in the final of Moin-ud-dowlah where even the presence of Constantine couldnt help Vizzys team win as Lala Amarnath came up with a counter-attacking hundred that sealed the game. The domestic tournament also rapidly progressed towards its finale  nameless and without much interest from people who were still hooked on to Pentagular tournaments then. The trophy was to be given away by Willingdon himself but Vizzy had to suffer the ignominy of watching the viceroy hand out the trophy donated by Patiala, and the tournament also named after Ranji.*******Vizzy wasnt the one to be dissuaded by such small episodes though. Even as Patiala was in London for the silver jubilee celebrations for King George V, Vizzy was busy in India, organising a tournament to honour the King. His team, that included CK Nayudu, defeated Patialas team and this time around, the viceroy handed out the original Willingdon trophy to Vizzy. His team also had Captain Jack Brittain-Jones who would later become the manager of Indian team that toured England in 1936.Patiala tried to repeat the same ploy he did before the 32 tour- offering to host the trials and sponsor the tour but by now Vizzy had moved ahead in the game. He went around the country, canvassing for votes, and managed to secure the captaincy for himself. And unlike the maharaja of Porbandar, he didnt allow CK Nayudu to captain, and played himself in all the three Tests. This was the tour that also saw Vizzy send back Lala Amarnath on disciplinary grounds.Vizzy averaged 16.21, his captaincy came under fire, and he cut a sorry figure on the field: a plumpish, rather hunched figure, perpetually standing in the slips and peering through spectacles at a game he did not seem to understand.It wasnt just Amarnath, CK Nayudu faced Vizzys wrath, too. Vizzy had Baqa Jilani abuse Nayudu at the breakfast table, and rewarded Jilani by giving a Test cap. On that tour, he also asked Syed Mushtaq Ali to run out Vijay Merchant but Ali duly informed Merchant when he joined him at the crease.For all the criticism, though, Vizzy had achieved his dreams. Not only did he manage to captain India in Tests, but he also got knighted on the tour. The once minor royal who couldnt become the king of Vizianagaram had come a long way.Meanwhile, his once-arch rival Bhupinder not only lost control of cricket but also was fast losing his virility. He tried various concoctions from Indian doctors and even tried radium therapy from the French doctors, but in vain.However, Collins and Lapierre nail the issue of his death in their book. It was not a lack of virility that afflicted the jaded and sated prince. His was a malady that plagued not a few of his surfeited fellow rulers. It was boredom. He died of it.In later years, Vizzy became a commentator, selector, board president, and a politician. His commentary too was reportedly dull, captured best by a story told by his fellow commentator Dicky Rutnagur, featuring the West Indian batsman Rohan Kanhai. Tired of Vizzy yakking on about his numerous tiger hunts, Kanhai, supposedly asked him, How do you kill them?I shoot them.. And Kanhai let it rip: Really? I thought you just left a transistor radio on when you were commentating and bored them to death.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
58e52d057be9e05a951f512b,Indus farmers grew rice independently of China ,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161121/jsp/nation/story_120452.jsp,2016-11-21,"Archaeologists excavate pits to look for crop residues at sites of the Indus civilisation in Haryana. Picture by Cameron Petrie New Delhi, Nov. 20: Farmers in the Indus civilisation had independently domesticated rice and grown it as an annual summer crop long before rice from China spawned the crops cultivation across the Gangetic plains, new archaeological excavations have established. These excavations, at three sites in Haryana, provide strong scientific evidence for a longstanding but muchdebated idea that the domestication of rice had occurred independently in China and South Asia, archaeologists involved in the excavations said today. The new research, published today in the journals Antiquity and the Journal of Archaeological Science, also suggests that the Indus people were the first to exploit complex, multicropping strategies, planting crops across both seasons. While earlier excavations had revealed rice grains at Lahuradewa, Uttar Pradesh, dated to about 6000 BC, sections of archaeologists had argued they represented the exploitation of wild rice and not real domestication, which they said began only after rice from China arrived about 2000 BC. Now archaeologists from Indias Banaras Hindu University and the University of Cambridge in the UK have discovered evidence indicating a progressive increase in the proportion of domestic types of rice and a decrease in wild types between 2430 BC and 2140 BC. This would imply rice domestication in India about 400 years earlier than presumed. Weve found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process in ancient South Asia, likely based around the wild species Oryza nivara, Jennifer Bates, an archaeobotanist at Cambridge who specialises in South Asian archaeology, said. The archaeologists examined crop material from two sites Masudpur in Hissar district and Bahola in Karnal districtand found what they say is a pattern of slow development of rice exploitation from wild foraging to farming with full cultivation. Until now, many had argued that the Indus people had not routinely cultivated rice, Ravindra Nath Singh, the team member at BHU, told The Telegraph. Our findings suggest that rice domestication had already occurred in South Asia before the arrival of Oryza japonica (the Chinese variety). The analysis of weed residues from the sites suggests that the Indus civilisation farmers had introduced multicrop farming that is practised even today, growing rice, millets and beans during summer and wheat, barley and pulses in winter. Some of the Indus civilisation sites received both summer and winter rain, which may have encouraged multicropping practices, the scientists said. We found evidence for yearlong farming that predates its appearance in other river valley civilisations, said Cameron Petrie, the third team member. Most contemporary civilisations used either summer or winter crops, he said. Mesopotamia, for instance, grew wheat and barley during winter, while China produced rice and millets during summer. The study, supported by the Archaeological Survey of India and funded by the UKIndia Education Research Initiative and other agencies, has also yielded the first absolute radiocarbon dates for Indus crops 2890 BC to 2630 BC for millets and winter pulses, 2580 BC to 2460 BC for horsegram, and 2430 BC to 2140 BC for rice. Weve had earlier evidence for rice suggesting independent domestication from Lahuradewa and other sites in the Gangetic plains, said Rakesh Tiwari, director general of the ASI, who was not associated with the Cambridge BHU study. The dates ranged from about 6000 BC to about 3000 BC. However, until now, some archaeologists had viewed rice residues from a site called Mahagara in Uttar Pradesh as the earliest evidence of full domestication. Some had attributed the earlier rice residues as exploitation of wild rice. Another archaeologist, Dorian Fuller from the University College, London, had in earlier research papers argued that there was no evidence for rice agriculture until about 2000 BC, by which time the Chinese variety had been brought into India."

Indias goods trade deficit with China has ballooned from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16.Beetle fearChina is the worlds largest rice importer. However, Beijing had so far not granted market access to Indias non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its apprehensions included the possibility of the Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) pest getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.Official sources said after numerous requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials visited India in September to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. To export to nations including China, it is mandatory that Indian rice exporters are registered with NPPO, the Indian government agency for inspecting the mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO assisted its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection for pest-risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian Commerce Ministry was also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.They said the Indian embassy in Beijing informed the Commerce Ministry that Chinese authorities, last week, cleared 17 of these 19 mills for rice exports to China. The Commerce Ministry has forwarded the list to APEDA and asked it to inform rice exporters to soon find customers in China."
58d8380ba3d24b75f2774eb5,Paddy procurement hangs in balance,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Paddy-procurement-hangs-in-balance/articleshow/55591504.cms,2016-11-24,"KOLKATA: Despite bumper paddy production in Bengal this year, the process of procurement of paddy by the government hangs in balance because of the current liquidity crunch . Bengal is the biggest paddy-producing state in the country.The government is still undecided on holding 330 procurement camps at different blocks for the Rabi season. ""Demonetisation has dealt a body blow to the state's agrarian economy . If this uncertainty continues, there will be disaster,"" said state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick . He has convened an emergency meeting on November 26 to decide whether the camps should be cancelled.Agriculture experts say if the situation persists, there will be an unnatural price jump with supply going haywire. According to agriculture department sources, the state has recorded a bumper crop of 1.75 crore tonne paddy this year, but much of this is yet to be reaped. With no cash in hand, around 80% of the farmers have not been able to engage labourers for harvesting. Within a few days, the seeds will drop from the shrubs and it will become extremely difficult to retrieve them, explained an officer from the agriculture department.Ironically, the bumper production had earlier led the food department to upwardly revise its paddy procurement target to 52 lakh tonne in 2016-17 from last year's 40 lakh tonne.""The situation is very grave. Over 80% of the paddy has not been reaped. The liquidity crunch has become severe because of the complete collapse of co-operative banks,"" said agriculture minister Purnendu Bose.Given the situation, it would be futile to hold the procurement camps, the food minister said. ""Each camp runs up a cost of Rs 4,500 per day. The total cost for the first round of procurement runs into Rs 12 crore. If paddy cannot reach the camps, the entire exercise will be futile,"" he said.In Burdwan, the rice bowl of Bengal and the highest paddy-producing district of India, paddy has not been harvested in 60% of the land. ""In Burdwan, 4.20 lakh hectare is devoted to paddy cultivation. But harvesting is very low this year,"" said Burdwan district magistrate Soumitra Mohan.This year, the state has fixed the minimum support price of paddy at Rs 1,470 per quintal (1tonne = 10 quintal). Besides, it is also offering farmers Rs 20 per quintal as encouragement grant. The government is also maintaining transparency by transferring funds through the RTGS system directly to the farmers' bank accounts."

This means the profit margin for the next two times will be higher as the input costs involved will be much lower,"" Rai said.He said that many others in his village were keen to use some part of their land for growing various medicinal herbs which have good commercial value.The traditional grain-growing farmer, however, did put in a few hours of training to master the cultivation process of Shalaparni.Rai took part in a special training programme conducted by Dabur India Ltd, as part of its Environment Sustainability strategy.The Head of Bioresources group at the Dabur Research and Development Centre, Sarvepalli Badri Narayan, said the initiative involves both farmers and tribals and would benefit around 2,500 households spread across eight states.""We focus only on marginal farmers and tribal communities and encourage them to grow medicinal herbs on only a part of their land. We give them technical assistance as well,"" Narayan told IANS.""It engages them to a large extent, providing them visible economic opportunities while helping the conservation of the natural resources in wide ranging eco-systems,"" the official said.This IANS correspondent visited the fully automated state-of-the-art greenhouse in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, dedicated exclusively for medicinal plants, including Akarakala, Ativisha, Taxus, Shalaparni and many others.The facility caters to the supply of ""elite"" planting material to the farmers enabling them to cultivate and supply well-standardised medicinal plants on a large scale.""We create artificial environment -- of the Himalayas to that of the Thar -- in this facility to grow different kinds of plants that have different requirements,"" he said.After initial germination stages, the saplings are shipped to different parts of India and given to farmers for further phases of their cultivation.On harvest, they are bought back on mutually agreed terms. Dabur has grown and distributed close to 7.5 lakh saplings of rare medicinal herbs to farmers in 2015-16 from its greenhouse.""This continuous engagement with the community has helped revive a host of endangered plant species and established a sustainable source of livelihood for the farming and forest-based communities,"" Narayan said.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 80 per cent population in developing countries is dependent on traditional systems of medicine, which are mostly plant-based.""We have identified around 100 rare and critical medicinal herbs. Today, we are cultivating 23 of these herbs and have drawn up a road map to initiate cultivation of another 27,"" Narayan added.Dabur has embarked on a journey to become the largest bulk grower of rare medicinal herbs, with 2,700 acres of land currently under cultivation of these rare medicinal plants. Their strategy would be to increase the number to 3,800 by the end of the 2016-17 financial year.Narayan said that the company is also establishing herbal gardens across ayurvedic colleges and universities in India. ""These would make available rare ayurvedic medicinal plants for the coming generations,"" he said."
58e50ac1a3d24b4437c4a825,The centralising instinct,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-centralising-instinct/article16712866.ece,2016-11-28,"The shock and awe of demonetisation has left no one in India untouched. Equally no one has been left with any doubt as to the fact that the policy originates with the Prime Minister, and that they are being asked to bear with short-term inconvenience in order to advance the longer-term national interest.Reams of newsprint have been devoted to the economics of demonetisation. Here I take stock of the questions raised by demonetisation for the direction of Centre-State relations.Unmediated by the StatesAs a policy initiative of the Central government, demonetisation is unique in recent times for reaching everyone in the country directly, unmediated by the filter of State governments. State governments do not appear to have been consulted ahead of the announcement, and in many cases demonetisation has directly undermined the routine administration of policies under their purview. Many have expressed frustration that they are powerless to address hardships faced by people unable to pay for treatment in private hospitals or of farmers unable to access loans from, or make repayments at, cooperative banks.Unsurprisingly, a number of States have complained that the way in which the policy was enacted violates the spirit of cooperative federalism about which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken so often.Furthermore, the design of the new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India include new national symbols that challenge regional sensibilities. For the first time, the new banknotes include Devanagari numerals, threatening to reignite old settled compromises over the national language within Indias federal union. The use of Devanagari numerals is already the subject of a PIL in the Madras High Court.The back-side of the new banknotes also carry the logo of the Union government policy, Swachh Bharat.All of this is in line with broader attempts to refocus political debates around national questions since 2014. Mr. Modi has consistently called for the strengthening of cooperative federalism, recognising that he is reliant on the cooperation of State governments to achieve national policy goals.A matter of identificationFor decades as Indias polity and economy became more decentralised and the States became the centre-ground of political life, they have been the primary level of political identity for most voters.In a situation where voters found it difficult to correctly identify which level of government was responsible for any given policy and chains of electoral accountability became quite opaque, State governments became adept at claiming the credit for Central government initiatives. Voters frequently give the credit for programmes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) or the National Rural Health Mission to their State governments rather than to the Central government.In the post-poll National Election Study conducted by Lokniti, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) during the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 42 per cent of voters who had benefited from MGNREGA gave the credit for the programme to their State government and only 27 per cent to the Central government. This looks vastly different to the situation in Brazils federal setting, for instance, where over 80 per cent of voters in 2010 attributed the countrys flagship social programme, Bolsa Familia, to the President.Mr. Modis election victory in 2014 challenged, although it has not displaced, the idea that the States serve as the primary unit of political affiliation. It was an election campaign that had a more national character and Mr. Modis candidacy and populist leadership style extended the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to farther-flung parts of the country.Once in office, Brand Modi has involved the projection of the Prime Ministers presence and authority across areas of government activity. Programmes have been carefully rebranded in an effort to better enable the Central government to claim credit for them and to limit the ability of the States to do so.Mamata Banerjees challengeStates have had different reactions to this. The most outspoken critic of Mr. Modis style of government at a regional level has been West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation. Just a day earlier she had raised objections to the fact that the Central government now makes MGNREGA payments directly into workers bank accounts. She has also railed against the naming of Central programmes after the Prime Minister, for which State governments are required to provide matched funding.In August, her counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, explained that his State was right to drag its heels over the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme). He called for the scheme to be renamed the PM-CM farmer insurance scheme, or  Kendra-Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana ( Centre-State Crop Insurance Scheme) if the States were expected to bear half the financial burden.Last month, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav distributed ration cards along with bags of wheat and rice  under the National Food Security Act  that carried pictures of him. The BJPs State spokesperson complained bitterly that the State government was playing politics by trying to claim credit for a policy of the Central government.There has not, however, so far been a resounding critique of the Modi governments version of cooperative federalism from most States. Demonetisation itself has been welcomed by Chief Ministers of both BJP and non-BJP ruled States alike, including Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha and Telangana, although some have criticised elements of its execution and potential to hit State revenues.For those critical of the centralising instincts of the Modi government, demonetisation presents an opportunity to refocus debates on Centre-State relations. Yet at the moment, many regional parties seem more intent on continuing a pattern of Centre-region bargaining rather than building new cross-State alliances that would act as a counterweight to the Central government.Even in the absence of a coordinated inter-State opposition alliance, for the Central government there is the risk that the centralisation of credit claiming for government policies could start to reduce the political incentives of opposition-ruled States to cooperate with the Central government in achieving national goals or implementing Centrally designed policies. This matters since State governments remain crucial for policy implementation. It is even more significant after the enhanced fiscal devolution to States following the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which gives States greater flexibility to decide priorities for government expenditure.A deeper debate neededThe time is right to engage in a deeper debate about Centre-State relations and the operation of federalism. There are major constitutional innovations in the offing such as the GST Council, designed to realise a more cooperative model of federalism in which the Central government and the States pool their sovereignty in order to pursue national economic goals. The counterpart to this platform of cooperation should be a deeper discussion about Centre-State relations and a focus on enhancing the incentives for States to cooperate with the Centre while preserving their autonomy.Louise Tillin is Senior Lecturer in Politics at the Kings India Institute, Kings College, London.An outspoken critic at a regional level has been Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation"

Many banks and ATMs are not dispensing enough small value notes in villages.The crop which was ready for harvesting turned yellow. Without thinking about the requirements of the agrarian sector during harvesting season, the government is talking about Rabi crop. How can we invest for the next crop when there is no cash in our hands, said a farmer M. Trimurthulu of Kaikalur mandal.During every Kharif season, we panic due to depressions and cyclones. But this year a super cyclone that came on November 8 in the form of cancellation of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes and shattered our hopes, he added.Labourers have no work and are starving. With the Centres decision we are suffering a lot, said Trimurthulu, who raised paddy in four acres.Agriculture labourers are facing untold hardship. Crop is ready for harvesting, water is ready for the next crop but there is no work for us. Due to shortage of Rs.100, Rs.50, Rs.20 and Rs.10 notes, farmers are not engaging labour for work. Many labourers are migrating to cities to feed their families, said another agriculture labourer B. Papa Rao of Razole.Normally we engage about 10 labourers for harvesting one acre. For men we have to pay Rs. 400 per head per day and women Rs. 350. We have to pay for breakfast and snacks for the labourers. But we are finding it difficult to arrange small denomination notes, said a paddy farmer Yatam Yedukondalu of Narsapuram in West Godavari district.Save farmersRyots are unable to get small notes for harvesting, grading the produce, weighing paddy bags, transporting it to the mill and for unloading. For one acre we have to spend Rs. 5000 to Rs. 7000, said Mutyam Mahalakshmi, a farmer.Paddy crop came for harvest in Amalapuram, Ravulapalem, Kalidindi, Bhimavaram, Palakol, Mudinepalli, Gudivada, Kothapeta, Akiveedu, Kankipadu and other mandals in East and West Godavari and Krishna districts this year, and the produce was good. As usual farmers have big plans on Kharif yield and Rabi sowing. But the sudden decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the big notes dashed our hopes, said another farmer B. Yesu Babu of Gudivada.Due to shortage of small notes, rice mill owners are procuring the stocks but are not giving money immediately. The Government should take measures for rotation of cash and rescue the farmers, said a farmer D. Venkat Rao."

He has exhausted the three Rs 500 notes he had the day the government scrapped two high-value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.The daily wage earner could not get them exchanged at the nearest bank, which is 7 km away in Bithoor, because of the heavy rush but a merchant in Hingupur agreed to pay him Rs 400 for one note.The scene is no different in cities and towns across the country after the November 8 shock announcement took out 86% of the currency out of circulation. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and ATMs across the country, as the first payday since the recall of the high-value banknotes raised fears of more chaos amid the severe cash crunch.Most government and private sector employees get their salaries credited to their accounts on the last day of the month and millions of people were expected to withdraw cash to meet their immediate needs  such as school and medical fees, newspaper bills, and other sundry purchases. In India, 78% of consumer payments are made in cash, which the government is attempting to change.A penniless Lal, however, has a way out. As he has now decided to do what almost everyone in his village has been doing for a week now - barter grains for goods.He offered the village merchant Pooran Gupta a sack full of wheat, weighing 100 kg, in exchange for vegetables, spices, wheat flour, rice and oil. He has another one at his house that he plans to trade sometime later. The owner of the field they had worked on had given them the wheat in exchange for their labour.This is the only way I can make sure my family has food and lentils with their meals. The children dont understand the problem, we cant make them understand either. They want food and we have to arrange (for food), Lal said.Money is no longer available to us. God knows when we will have work.The daughter-in-law of one of his dead brothers, Meena, is worried about arranging for the wedding of her eldest daughter. Sumans wedding has been fixed to be held on December 20 and the family doesnt have much cash to spend on the ceremonies.Meenas husband has a broken hand and her three children are too young to work. However, unlike Lal, this family has one bigha of land and rice  in abundance after the autumn harvest  would be the medium for exchange. As will be wheat for potatoes, flour, vegetables, cooking oil, spices and even for salt.Families like Meenas have been dealing in rice and wheat as currency in the countryside.I will have to trade the rice even for clothes. How will my daughter live in her sasural (in laws house) if we fail to provide right hospitality to the baratis (guests from the grooms family)? She will be teased for any folly of ours. I cannot jeopardise her dignity, we will do the best we can to arrange funds, Meena said.She has struck a deal with a farmer who would give her ghee or clarified butter, vegetables and flour for the wedding feast. In turn, he will keep one-quarter of the wheat crop the family would sow.To earn some cash, she has started working in households in Kalyanpur, 15 km away from Ghazipur, and will barter the paddy for the clothes from local shops.Gupta, the merchant who has struck some goods deals with the villagers, set a reminder. He said the barter system will not work as the villagers are bound to run out of things to exchange.Cash squeeze has begun hurting me. The number of people for barter is increasing by the day and how long I can barter is the question before me? he asked."

The organisers, with their experience of previous sammelans, expected around 7,000 delegates and around 30,000 visitors each day and made arrangements accordingly. To their surprise, the event attracted a 1.25-lakh crowd on the first day and between 80,000 and 1,00,000 on the last two days. However, the organisers somehow managed to provide food for almost all of them and avoided possible chaos at the food court. Police personnel worked day and night for managing crowds, controlling traffic, and dealing with security issues.It was one of the best organised sahitya sammelans where the food section was neatly managed despite huge crowds thronging the venue at the eleventh hour, B. Rajendra, a teacher from Shivamogga, who is also a winner of the national award for teachers, said. He has attended at least 10 sammelans in the past.Secondly, people with different linguistic backgrounds came together and played a crucial role in making the event a success. Deputy Commissioner S. Sasikanth Senthil, who led the reception committee and its 33 sub-committees involved in organising the event, is a Tamil. Superintendent of Police Chetan Singh Rathor, who maintained law and order, controlled traffic, and ensured safety of VIPs and other guests leading a posse of around 2,000 police personnel, is a Hindi speaker from Uttar Pradesh. Raichur Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer M. Kurma Rao, who supervised many sub-committees involved in organising the event, is a Telugu. N.S. Boseraju, MLA, and working president of the event, is also a Telugu.Deputy commissioners are the chief conveners of sahitya sammelans. Mr. Senthil, however, made a difference. For the first time in my experience I have seen a non-Kannadiga Deputy Commissioner passionately involving himself so much and relentlessly working day and night make the sammelan a success, Mahantesh Maski, writer and sahitya parishat functionary, told The Hindu . The functioning of the district sahitya parishat, he added, appeared to be dull in comparison with the rigorous work of the officer.Other non-Kannadigas too involved themselves at various levels for the success of the event. S.R. Reddy, MLA for Narayanpet in Telangana, and Vishnukantha Budada, who jointly provided food for delegates, were of Telugu and Rajasthani origin. Many in the Raichur Rice Millers Association that provided food to lakhs of people, including A. Papareddy, former MLA, are of Telugu origin.The huge venues, book stalls, food court, exhibition centres and other temporary structures for the sammelan were built by Tamils. The food for lakhs of public was prepared by a team of Gujaratis led by Babulal Jain, a Pakistani refugee. Besides, many Rajasthani speaking Marwaris and Urdu-speaking Muslims sponsored and served water, cool drinks, butter milk, snacks and other refreshment to artists and the people during the six-km long colourful procession on the first day.Mr. Senthil is leaving Raichur with fond memories and satisfaction as he is transferred to Bengaluru to the Department of Mines and Geology. His transfer order issued a month ago was withheld till the completion of the sammelan."

They came from a bus stand on the fringe of an SC colony, camouflaged by a giant cutout of the departed leader and temporarily converted to a mourning centre. Inside, three elderly women held a microphone and sang paeans to Jayalalithaas populist schemes as a group of younger women huddled together on the floor, wailing.It was quiet, almost as if the highway had fallen silent to mourn the death of Amma  the only traffic was that of cars and SUVs carrying AIADMK flags, ferrying party cadre to Chennai, 180 km away.At villages along the highway, temporary shelters had appeared overnight to pay tributes to Jayalalithaa.

The bigger leaders were not interested in funding this since Amma is gone and there is no one really to impress in Chennai now, said Shekhar.The death of Amma is a big loss for all sections of society, especially for us. With our meagre earnings, we could not have afforded many of the things that she gave us through her schemes.

It is also true that we remain inactive during those nine days and, at the end of it, make offerings to our ancestors so that we are all safe, says the 70-year-old at his home in Sakhuapani, a village 500 metres from the Hindalco Groups Gurdari bauxite mine in Gumla district of Jharkhand.WATCH VIDEO: The Earliest Known Ramleela In Chitrakoot Preserved In Its Original FormOn February 24, after reading from a pamphlet purportedly distributed in Jawaharlal Nehru University, which, the minister said, had depicted Durga in poor light and Mahishasur as the victim, Irani had said, What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it.As he speaks about his traditions and way of life, Chamru is almost passive  not apologetic, not defensive, not angry, not seeking answers.Chamru is an Asur, a particularly vulnerable tribal group that dominates Sakhuapanis population of about 2,000 and lives in villages spread over a radius of 10 to 20 km. Besides Jharkhand, members of the tribe live in pockets of Bihar, West Bengal and a few other states. The 2011 Census put the number of Asurs at 22,459 in Jharkhand and 4,129 in Bihar.Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur.

Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)The Asurs claim to be descendants of Mahishasur, the buffalo-demon whom Goddess Durga kills after a spirited fight lasting nine nights. Its this mythology in mainstream Hinduism thats celebrated in the form of the nine-day-long Durga Puja, but observed as Mahishasur Dasain among the Asurs, who hold a period of mourning during which they largely stay indoors.Chamru says that even when he was a child, though people had their beliefs and biases, nobody attacked them for it, they merely thought they were different. Those were the days of zamindari. The zamindar of Bishunpur (now the local police station) would ask us to get wood and collect leaves for making pattals for the puja. We would go there, give the zamindar all this and also give him some of our tools. We would then return home before the celebrations began and offer prayers seeking protection from our own ancestors, says Chamru.WATCH VIDEO: Dussehra Celebration At Red FortNow as these cultures are seen as offending, Chamru says these are just beliefs. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you. I cant tell you how our descendants settled down in this part of the country and so on, he says.***Sushma Asur, a tribal activist in Sakhuapani, says the community also celebrates Sohrai, which coincides with Diwali, by applying koronj (or karanja in Hindi) oil on their navel, chest and nose, and eat cucumber. The symbolism here is that when our ancestor Mahishasur was killed, he had blood oozing from his navel, nose and chest. Applying oil on those parts depicts the same. Eating cucumber is a symbol that we are avenging his death by eating the kaleja (liver) of the killer, Sushma explains.In her 20s, Sushma says she has studied up to Class XII and is working with tribal activists to revive our lost traditions, songs and skills. Over the years, she says, there are several of these traditions that have given way to modern practices of the outsiders.Asurs, she says, were once iron smelters, but now the village doesnt have a smelting unit. Chamru says he used to make small weapons, but I have forgotten all that now. According to one of the theories, the Magadh Empire benefited a lot from the weapons the Asurs made. Their iron does not catch rust. And we know there are many Ashokan-era edicts on iron that havent rusted, says Ashwani Kumar Pankaj, a tribal activist in Ranchi.Traditionally, Asurs dont drink cow milk. We want the calf to have all the milk and grow up strong so that it can be used in the fields, says Anil Asur, Sushmas brother. Villagers still dont drink much milk or tea, happy instead to down a glass of rice beer.***Carron tea estate in West Bengals Jalpaiguri district is hundreds of kilometres away from Jharkhands Sakhuapani village. Its here, down a hillock carpeted with emerald-green tea bushes, that Bargi Asur, 83, lives with his family. Reading a Hindi newspaper in the courtyard of his house, Bargi introduces himself as the oldest resident of Asur Line, a colony of about 100 mud and bamboo huts in the tea estate. Bargi says he isnt surprised that the minister said what she did in Parliament. She is not the first person to say our beliefs are wrong. For centuries, we have been afraid to talk about them openly. Now we carry out our rituals almost apologetically, says Bargi, whose son and grandchildren converted to Christianity a few years ago.At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta) At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Bargi himself chose not to convert because he wouldnt be able to adjust to a new way of life. My two sons and my grandchildren work as tea pickers at the estate. Thats what I have done all my life too. I couldnt give them a better life, maybe a new faith will bring some light in their lives, he says.Bargi belongs to a group of about 1,000 Asurs, who moved from Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh in the early 20th Century and work and live near the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. My father moved here in 1914 to work for a British tea planter. We have lived here ever since. Its been more than a century now, he says.Jagannath Singh, 67, a social worker who used to work as a primary school teacher at the Carron tea estate school, says the story of the Asurs is like that of most other particularly vulnerable tribal groups of the country, but with a cruel twist. Apart from abject poverty, they also have to deal with social stigma. The Asurs in Jalpaiguri were recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in 2014, after years of struggle, says Singh.He says that of the 101 Asur families living in Carron tea estate, more than 90 have converted to Christianity. They have little choice. They feel this new identity will give them a better life, he says.Yet, some find ways to keep both their new and old identities. We observe Asur puja twice a year, once during the month of Phagun (March-April) and once during Dusshera. The puja can be performed only by men, and women later participate in a traditional asura dance, says Etwari Asur, 75.Lalita Asur, 38, who works in the estate and had converted to Christianity about five years ago, says life has taught her to be careful about revealing her true identity. Why should I claim to be Mahishasurs descendant? Am I mad? she laughs. A lot of us have taken on different surnames such as Topo and Kajur, says Lalita.Over the years, the Asurs, both of Jalpaiguri and of Sakhuapani in Jharkhand, have migrated to cities in search of jobs, most youngsters dont speak the Asuri language any more and their worries are as mainstream as any other. The only thing they hold on to are memories  of stories told by their parents, of childhood fears and anxieties.Back in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand, Sushma recalls how over the years she began getting acutely aware of the fact that the asurs or demons were always depicted as ugly and were primarily painted black. All demons are dark-skinned, ugly and evil. Now, we trace our lineage to them. Tell me, do we look like anything like that? she asks.

(Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)Expert column: Struggle for survival, not of faithThe term tribal defies any universal definition. Between the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia and the Indigenous People of North America, there is a shared historical fact. They were all there before the colonial powers pushed them to margins. This is not so in the case of all tribal communities in India.Some of the Indian tribes such as the Onges and the Jarawas of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been entirely indigenous. Some others like the Banjaras in Western and Central India and the Gujjars in the Himalayas have been nomadic. And, some, such as several sub-groups of Bhills, have migrated in various historical phases to their present geographical locations. The stories of migration of such communities are found in their oral traditions. The diverse histories of tribes in India are seen among the Particularly Vulnerable Groups as well. The term primitive used for them at one time has fortunately been declared as pejorative.

58e538837be9e05a951f5da9,Here's why your roti is acting pricey,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161210/jsp/jharkhand/story_123873.jsp,2016-12-10,"Prices of staple food like wheat flour and rice have gone up in Jamshedpur. Picture by Animesh Sengupta Jamshedpur, Dec. 9: Noticed or unnoticed, the demon of demonetisation is now creeping into your kitchen. Prices of staple food, which are normally stable, have climbed in the steel city over the past week with dreams of a cashless economy miles away from wholesome reality. The retail rate of rice has marginally increased by 3 to 5 per cent, but that of wheat products such as atta (flour), maida (refined and bleached flour) and suji (semolina) have leaped by 10 per cent. If a 5kg packet of branded wheat flour was available at Rs 155 even last month, the same is being sold at no less than Rs 170. Refined wheat flour, bought at Rs 27 a kilo a week ago, is now available for Rs 30. Similarly, semolina flaunts a price tag of Rs 32 a kg instead of the earlier Rs 30. As if in consolation, the price of rice has gone up by Re 1 to Rs 1.50 per kg, depending on quality and brand. Govind Agrawal, a Bistupur grocer, conceded that he was charging his customers more. ""Our stocks come from wholesalers in Jugsalai. They have jacked up food grain prices, leaving us no choice but to shift the burden on customers partially,"" he said. Another grocer in Bistupur, on the condition of anonymity, said the impact of demonetisation on the wholesale market could not be ruled out. ""As wholesale traders are buying rice, wheat and wheat products at higher prices, we retailers have to follow suit,"" he added. Customer Marshal Tigga said he had barely seen such a sharp rise in flour rates in his life. ""If there is a Rs 3 per kilo increase in maida price, a family of four that needs at least 5kg a month has to fork out Rs 15 extra. It disturbs your monthly kitchen budget. More so when the grocer won't tell you why he is charging more for staple food when there is no agricultural setback,"" said the Sonari resident. Tigga added that he could see no other reason behind the hike in prices except for demonetisation, which inevitably means that the rates wouldn't come down in the near future. Nirmal Sharma, a resident of Sakchi and an employee of a private insurance company, stressed that the increased food prices were definitely the result of demonetisation. ""Apart from rice and wheat, the price of pasteurised milk (Sudha Dairy) has gone up by Rs 2 per litre, prompting the roadside chaiwala to demand an extra buck for every cup of tea. Members of the working class, many of whom eat lunch at small eateries, are also paying more for the humble chapatti,"" Sharma rued. Suresh Sonthalia, president of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry, admitted the problem. ""As (wholesale) traders are buying wheat at a higher price from suppliers in Bihar and Punjab, the cost of the flour and other wheat products has gone up considerably. But, we have to probe if the hike in prices is directly linked to demonetisation,"" he said."

As a result, it was not taken up since the formation of the State.When the cards were finally printed and ready for distribution, the Centre dropped a bombshell. It took objection to printing of the pictures of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Civil Supplies Minister Etala Rajender on the cards like in some other States. The pictures were traditionally printed on the cards by every government. The Centres grouse is that it has propriety on the ration cards, now called the Food Security cards, because it supplies subsidised rice to the States under the Food Security Act. It took particular exception to the photos of leaders on cards in Uttar Pradesh which is going to polls shortly.The Telangana government was forced to hold back distribution of cards and await the Centres response to a letter.Collectors high-handednessGovernment staff in one of the newly created districts in Telangana are upset over its Collectors high-handedness. Word has it that the Collector insists that all staff live in the district headquarters, even though many have conveyed difficulties in moving from the parent district. Insiders say the official also takes liberty in admonishing senior staff, which has led to discontent. Irrespective of their designations, even leave applications have to be sent to the Collector. Employees rue the working conditions in the new district, stating that its creation and subsequent appointment of the officer may have been an ill-thought move.For more accountabilityThe Telangana State governments recent decision to introduce biometric attendance system in the institutions of higher learning has no doubt brought cheers to parents, but the move has raised many an eyebrow.The decision comes in the light of complaints relating to a section of private colleges submitting false reports relating to attendance of students and teachers alike to garner benefits like fee reimbursement. There are allegations that some colleges were taking advantage of the existing system to cover up their failures like maintenance of student-teacher ratio and other key aspects and this was causing a drain on the exchequer.Coming in this background, the decision is expected to streamline the functioning of these educational institutions on whom the government pins high hopes of generating qualified and trained human resources, a key element in ensuring the accelerated growth of the State.Being in power after retirementVery few civil servants get an opportunity to hold key positions even after retirement and Rajiv Sharma, who hanged up his boots as the Chief Secretary to the Government of Telangana on November 30, seems to be among the top of such list. Not only was he made Chief Advisor to the State government on the day of his retirement, but Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao made no bones of his importance as he announced during the farewell function to Dr. Sharma that although he had retired as Chief Secretary, his position as the Chief Advisor would be nothing short of it. Immediately, he has been provided a chambers in the Chief Ministers Office itself. Besides, orders followed making Dr. Sharma the Chairman of Telangana State Pollution Control Board. He has also been made Advisor to the Cabinet Sub-Committee set up to formulate guidelines on allowing the establishment of private universities in the State.- Reporting by N. Rahul, Rohit P.S., M.

5904711e7be9e04154df6cc6,Wheat imports will help improve supply and restrain any sharp surge in prices,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/wheat-imports-will-help-improve-supply-and-restrain-any-sharp-surge-in-prices/,2016-12-12,"The government move to sharply reduce the import duty on wheat from 25% to zero at the end of the last week has set off howls of protest from farmer lobbies and other assorted groups. The argument has been that such free imports would dampen domestic wheat prices and hurt Indian farmers while it would help traders and large multinationals who largely dominate wheat trade.On the face of it the government move seem surprising. Its decision to boost minimum support price of wheat by Rs 75 to Rs 1525 per quintal, one of the largest increases in recent years, have helped boost the sowing of wheat in the rabi season. Total sown area under the wheat crop has gone up by around 10% to 226 lakh hectare by 9th December.And the crop has not been too bad in recent years. Wheat output has picked up from a low of 86.5 million tons in 2014-15 to 94 million tons in 2015-16 which is close to target set for the year. However, the fact remains that both wheat and rice production has largely stagnated since the turn of the current decade.But what makes the current scenario especially worse in the case of wheat is that the buffer stocks have whittled down rather sharply in recent months. Wheat stocks with the government which peaked at 32.6 million tons in June 2016, soon after the rabi market season, has been halved to 16.4 million tons by December 2016.This is a precarious situation as the stocks were never so low in recent years. In fact despite a bad crop the wheat stocks with the government were 26.8 million tons in December 2015 and as much as 31 million tons in December 2014. And the demand for wheat is likely to be buoyant especially given the need for meeting the demand for grains from the PDS under the food security act.And the signals from the price front has been ominous. Wholesale wheat prices which had fallen in the first three months of the last year has seen prices shoot up by more than 5% in the early months of the current year. In fact wheat prices has shot up double digits a few months back. Though it has climbed down to the 6% plus range in the most recent month the stage is now all set for a further rise given the depleted wheat stocks with the government.And this is not the first time that the government has used customs duty to reduce the gap between demand and supply. In fact the first UPA government reduced import duties on wheat from 50% to zero in 2006 after two years of bad wheat crops. And this time it is especially bad because though the rabi wheat crop sown in the current year is now excess of the norm the sown area has fallen in important states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. By allowing for free import of wheat the government has made the best out of a bad situation without waiting for the crisis to get out of hand and reach alarming proportions"

Under this, the salt was to be sold at subsidised rates. The districts which had been selected at that stage were based on high incidence of cases of anemia among children below 5 years of age. Now the scheme will be extended to other districts of UP. The process is expected to begin by the end of this month,"" said Agra district civil supplies officer B K Shukla.Low sodium and anemia are a result of inadequate intake of dietary salt. 'Samajwadi Namak' will be available at subsidised rates at fair price shops to those below the poverty line (BPL) and holders of Antyodaya cards, according to officials. This is in addition to subsidized wheat, rice and sugar which are already available at ration shops across the state.Under the scheme, the rate of salt for above poverty line (APL) card holders will be Rs 6 per kg, while BPL and Antyodaya card holders will get the salt at Rs 3 per kg."

The unit, located on the premises of Udyogiri at Gandamunda area, is equipped with eight motor-enabled oil extraction machines.Earlier, a Kachi ghani mustard oil unit existed at the same location which was destroyed in the super cyclone of 1999. With financial assistance from the State Government, the OKVIB took an initiative to revive the unit at a cost of `10 lakh. The cold pressed machines which can extract upto 60 litres of mustard oil per day, have been procured from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, OKVIB Chairman Tejeswar Parida said.Procurement of mustard seeds to run the plant will be done from remote districts of the State where farmers are victims of distress sale. Raw material will be purchased at market price from farmers through Odisha Consumer Cooperative Federation - Bhanjaprabha from all districts. This will eliminate the scope of farmers getting exploited by middlemen, Parida added.Inaugurating the processing unit, MSME Minister Jogendra Behera exhorted consumers to purchase mustard oil from OKVIB to support small farmers. The products are 100 per cent adulteration free and more such units are required to imbibe financial independence of people in remote areas, he added.The Board will soon install a honey processing plant with capacity of 100 kg of honey per day at the same facility. The honey processing plant will be procured from Pune. Once the facility is fully operational, the Board expects to supply more processed honey inside and outside State.On the occasion, sanction letters of village industries were distributed to 26 entrepreneurs from six districts. Projects like rice mill, paper cup and plate production, beauty parlour, automobile servicing, ready-made garment manufacturing, cement products and carpentry were approved for assistance by the MSME Department."

Jharkhands people, mostly women, suffer from iron deficiency. The DFS salt will help fight against anemia, said food and public distribution minister Saryu Rai.Colour of the salt will be pale yellow, he said.Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh governments too earlier launched the similar double fortified salt.Jharkhand has the highest number of women having iron deficiency in the country with 70% females between the age group of 15 and 49 are anemic, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-III).Head of gynecology department of Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) Dr Pratibha Rai said, Anaemia has been a bane for Jharkhand women. 90% of women visiting PMCH are anaemic. Anaemia causes low productivity in adults, slow development among children, severe anaemia also leads to low birth weight and child mortality.She said state health department took several initiatives such as distribution of iron pills to control anaemia. Lack of awareness among people is proving to be a major hindrance in the success of the programmes. Rural women do not take iron pills regularly. We hope DFS salt could bring some result in controlling anaemia, Rai said.Disbursement of the salt will be made through biometric system like other PDS items sold through the fair price shops. Under the system consumers require to give thumb impressions to get a link to their biometric data recorded under their Aadhaar number to collect the PDS items, said Sanjay Kundu, state general secretary of the Fair Price Dealers Association.He said earlier iodized salt was given to the ration card holders, which was a huge hit among consumers.Distribution of double fortified salt is the second big PDS programme undertaken by the state government. From October last year it started distributing 5 kg of rice and wheat per household for Rs 1 under the National Food Security Act. The scheme covered more than 2.63 crore people out of the states total population of 3.29 crore."

Rethinavelu has said that the Department of Science and Industrial Research, Government of India, has recognised the TNFMY as a scientific and industrial research organisation.Speaking to The Hindu on Sunday, he said the recognition would enable the TNFMY, a special purpose vehicle established under PPP model, to undertake research works for identifying several innovative and nutritious value-added products.The TNFMY, was set up at Sikkandarchavadi over a 30-acre site at an investment of Rs. 40 crore, with the support of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.Mr. Rethinavelu said the recognition would go a long way in helping not only agro producers, but also those engaged in food processing, traders and exporters. The all-under-one-roof facility had a scientifically built warehouse, cold storage unit, individual marketing-cum-storage depots in the southern districts.The research and development lab, he said, would help in analysing the quality of products manufactured or dealt with by food processors and traders. Recently, a research in causes for variation in milling breakage in Basmati rice grown in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was undertaken here. The inference arrived at was to carry out standardised parboiling techniques, which would reduce breakage of rice. Today, many rice mills, which processed Basmati rice, had converted the suggestion into action, he added.Mr. Rethinavelu said the TNFMY had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology, Thanjavur, for carrying out research works. Students and research scholars working in the field of food processing and other allied areas might use the research and development facility.Currently, they were studying the non-chemical jaggery on a commercial level adoption to position it in the global market. Yet another area of research was paddy analysis  physical quality analysis, cooking analysis and sensory evaluation  to bridge the gap between the farmers and millers. This would enable the farmers to get a remunerative price for their crop, he said."

Poverty was gnawing at his dream and the self-trained powerlifter left his home at Ladpur village in Bulandshahr district. Robin came to Delhi and left his CV at several staffing agencies. One of them found him a job as a security executive at The Lalit Resort & Spa at Bekal. Powerlifting is not an Olympic sport but championships are conducted regularly by federations. It is a strength sport in which contestants attempt three types of lift - squat, bench press and dead lift - in a set sequence.Born to a farmer couple - Lalita and Subhas Singh Poonia - Robin was taken to bodybuilding when he was in Class VIII in 2008. There was no sportsperson or bodybuilders in the family and my parents were baffled at my choice, he said. He converted a shed in his house into a gym, made weights out of his mothers chakki (stone grinder) and upholstered a plank with rexine for his bench press. In 2012, he drifted to powerlifting through Youtube and signed up for a trial for North Zone championship at Mathura. I sat through the tournament watching others lifting weight, learning the techniques, he said.At the NZ championship at Patiala, Robin won the gold in the 93kg category. Since then there was no looking back. I go to tournaments to learn techniques. I speak to referees for guidance, then train at home, he said. But without a proper trainer, it was just a matter of time before he herniated his spinal discs. In 2015, I had bulge in L4, L5 and S1 discs, he said. Doctors asked him to quit the sport.But after six months of rest, he returned to the ring. But the first resistance came from his home. Every day Robin drank four to five litres of milk and ate 60 almonds. His parents cultivated wheat, mustard and rice in their 1.5 acres of farmland but the income was too meagre to sustain Robins schedule. He has two younger brothers too. Luckily, my mother reared two cows and three buffaloes, he said.The frequent crop failure due to drought and rain also made his going tough. But his exploits at the Subrata Classic changed his familys perception. The villagers gave me a rousing welcome upon my return. My parents said they would support me. But I know it was tough for them. Perhaps, my dream was too big, he said. On the brighter side, Ladpur started warming up to the sport. Youngsters started approaching Robin who threw open his gym for them. But after five months, Robin left home in search of a job."
