58e5423a7be9e05a951f6a3c,$200m aid for agri project,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170102/jsp/northeast/story_128037.jsp,2017-01-02,"A farmer works in a paddy field on the outskirts of Guwahati. (AFP) Guwahati, Jan. 1: The World Bank is expected to clear $200 million for a new agri project in Assam by March. The Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project will give impetus to establish new small and medium agri enterprises, facilitate agribusiness investments through inclusive business models that provide opportunities to small holder farmers to actively participate in the value chains. Official sources said the estimated date for the bank board approval is March 9. The total project cost is $250 million of which the bank would provide $200 million and rest will be borne by the state government. The bank said the recently-concluded Assam Agricultural Competitiveness Project has been instrumental in increasing on-farm productivity and diversification of agriculture in the state. The project laid the foundation for the transformation of Assam agriculture by shifting the focus from rice production towards diversification into high-value agriculture production. ""Diversification to high-value commodities (vegetables, spices, fish and dairy) opens up significant opportunities for the farming communities of Assam, along with associated challenges for this transformation. There is a need to reorient policies and institutions to support a shift from production targets to income growth through diversification to high-value agriculture, higher productivity of crops and livestock through technology and innovation,"" the bank said. The World Bank said for the proposed project to be a success, Assam needs to: Promote greater infusion of technology, good supply chain practices and market intelligence to enhance efficiency Harmonise agriculture marketing regime and support development of alternative marketing options for farmers Facilitate development of organised micro, small and medium enterprises, both for value addition and job creation Address the growing food safety concern that is exposing consumers and producers, to food safety and human health risks. Assam has recently launched a transformative agricultural development strategy - Chief Minister's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana - which aims to double the farm income in the state, thus transforming the sector into a stable source of growth and broad-based economic development. The strategy of the proposed project primarily focuses on specific agriculture and allied sectors, including high-value agriculture, livestock, fish, silk, food processing and logistics. The project is the nucleus of a much larger government agribusiness and rural transformation programme. The project will be implemented in 16 districts of the state and will support identification and development of enterprise and production clusters. It will have four components enabling agri enterprise development, facilitating agro cluster development, fostering market-led production and resilience enhancement and project management, monitoring and learning. Three World Bank global practices - agriculture, trade and competitiveness and finance and market - will aid the Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project to ensure that the Assam benefits from innovations and global knowledge. During implementation, these practices will be further strengthened to support the state government initiatives on creating an enabling investment climate for agribusinesses and other enterprises. The management and co-ordination of the new project will be done by the Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agriculture Services Society, an existing state-level registered autonomous body, which has completed two World Bank-financed projects."

(Source: Reuters) Former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. (Source: Reuters)Last month, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari did something that no man with a conscience could have thought of doing: He gave his word to Amir Jamaat-e-Islami Siraj ul Haq that the Sindh Assembly will strike down a recently passed law meant to protect non-Muslim girls from being forcibly converted to Islam. Hindu and Christian girls have been forced to convert, so that Muslim men can take them as wives. The law would have addressed the abuse of Muslim law which forbids forcible conversion.The Movement for Solidarity and Peace, which campaigns against religious violence in Pakistan, says, 100 Christian girls and at least 300 Hindu girls (in Sindh) suffer such conversions every year and has presented its case at the US Congress too. The law passed by the Sindh Assembly laid down that change of religion will not be recognised until the person reaches 18 years of age; otherwise perpetrators will get five years in jail.Secretary general of the Jamaat-e- Islami, Liaquat Baloch, attacked the law: The provincial assembly passed the bill in haste to please foreign lobbies. We will not let it sail through and will challenge it in the Council for Islamic Ideology and the Federal Shariat Court. The Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill, 2015 was tabled by minority members Nand Kumar and Khatumal Jeewan. They must feel cheated by the ruling party using the issue as a pawn in the political battle at the national level.Hindutva may turn out to be less terminal in its destructive spread than sharia, but the seduction of religion is there in South Asia. In the Sindh district of Ghotki, there is the Sant Satram Das temple from where Hindu girls have been picked up and converted before being forcibly married to Muslim men. Near the temple, there is also the infamous Bharchundi Sharif shrine whose patrons once became famous in India for convertingnon-Muslims. But the shrine is not without its blots today, its custodians backing conversions as divine inspiration. Every April, there is the death anniversary of Bhagat Kanwar Ram, a popular Sufi poet and singer,killed in the communal riots of 1939, allegedly by the then-custodians of the Bharchundi Sharif shrine.In the past, this northern Sindh region generally abjured violence and treated Hindus well on the basis of their Sindhi identity. In southeast Sindh, in Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot and Sanghar, they suffer maltreatment. But in 2012, upper Sindh too experienced an anti-Hindu trend after madrassas from South Punjab spread their tentacles into Sindh. This trend was emphasised after Deobandi Islams Taliban affiliation gave it impunity.In the past, Hindus were the dominant class  some of their dominance is still in evidence. One local observation goes like this: In Ghotki, the cotton ginning factories are owned by Hindus. In Sukkur, half the trade in rice, grains and dates is conducted by Hindus. In Khairpur, Hindus have a big role in the date trade (which goes mostly to India). In Jacobabad and Kashmore, rice milling and trading are Hindu domains. In Larkana, Hindus have a big role in the rice trade. All of this makes them a target.Hindu girls are in fact the target and this persuaded the two Hindu members of the Sindh Assembly to table the bill about conversions. A member of the Sukkur Hindu Panchayat stated in a 2012 report by journalist Cyril Almeida: Periodically kidnapping Hindus, entering our homes, picking up our children, its all meant to prevent the community from growing, to keep us under psychological pressure. Like the Hindus of Bangladesh  whose constitution is secular  the Hindus of Sindh have tried to migrate to India. Now, if the upper Sindh leader Asif Ali Zardari decides to rescind the law that protects the Hindu community, Pakistan will sink further into chaos.The police are lax. Converted Hindu girls are often raped or beaten and, when the family complains to the police, they let the case drop when the abductors report conversion. In Islam, inward conversion is welcomed, but outward conversion attracts the death penalty, so far not enshrined in law, but all known away-convertees have been killed. Religion is not turning South Asia into paradise. Anand Teltumbde wrote in the Economic and Political Weekly (January 3, 2015): On 8 December, 57 families (nearly 350 persons) in Ved Nagar in Agra were converted to Hinduism by Dharma Jagran Samanvaya Vibhag and Bajrang Dal activists, both RSS outfits.Amarnath Motumal, the vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), reports: About 1,000 non-Muslim girls are converted to Islam each year in Pakistan. Every month, an estimated 20 or more Hindu girls are abducted and converted, although exact figures are impossible to gather.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""
58f5febc7be9e031f13acaf0,Lack of digital avenues compounds farmers’ woes in cashless times,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/lack-of-digital-avenues-compounds-farmers-woes-in-cashless-times/articleshow/56408148.cms,2017-01-09,"Although it has been two months since the Centre's sudden and dramatic decision to withdraw the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from circulation, there appears to be no end to the troubles of the agrarian community in the state. Cash deficit, coupled with lack of adequate infrastructure to conduct cashless transactions, threw life of farmers in Karnataka into disarray; more than 60 days after demonetization was announced, the farming community is still struggling to come to grips with the altered circumstances.Eshwaraiah Toragalmath, 48, owns four acres in Devanagav village in Sindagi taluk, Vijayapura district. Two weeks ago, he sold 25 quintals of red gram (thogaribele) at the Afzalpur market in Kalaburagi, and received an advance for his produce, in cheque. However, he has not been able to encash his cheque.This is because Toragalmath has his account in a cooperative bank that is also facing a problem of cash shortage. Restrictions imposed on district cooperative banks  they are not allowed to exchange or accept the scrapped notes  by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has affected farmers the most, since most of them have their accounts in these banks, and also take out loans from the same.Kenchappa, a farmer in Nagamangala in Mandya, opined that the RBI should focus on printing more Rs 500 notes. ""It is very hard to transact with the new Rs 2,000 note,"" he added.Besides adversely impacting transactions at wholesale markets, shortage of cash has made it hard for farmers to pay wages to labourers. ""It's become very difficult to maintain workers on the farm,"" said Revanna, a farmer from Hebya village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru.On the other hand, those farmers, who succeeded in reaping a good harvest despite the failure of the monsoon, have also been left in the lurch. ""Despite the drought, I was able to grow 800 quintals of onion. But, the prices crashed after demonetization was announced. I took a huge risk, but I did not get my due,""said Nagaraj, a farmerfrom Jagalur taluk in Davanagere district.The script is not dissimilar in the coastal district of Dakshina Kannada, where farmers focus largely on horticultural crops such as cashew, rubber and coconut.The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Limited (Campco), which boasts 1.26 lakh arecanut growers among its members, has imposed a cap on daily purchase. ""Since we are not receiving money from the point of sale, we have restricted purchase of arecanut to one quintal per day. As a result, in December, the procurement was 30% to 38% lesser in comparison to what was purchased in the same period in 2015,"" said Suresh Bhandary, managing director, Campco.Demonetization only compounded the woes of the coffee cultivators, who were already reeling under the consequences of a second consecutive drought in 2016. Besides, demonetization coincided with the coffee picking season. The crippling cash shortage has made it really hard for cultivators in Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Hassan to hire labourers for harvesting the crop.Agents and merchants, however, are capitalising on the farmers' distress. Farmers alleged that merchants refused to lift their harvested crops, which consequently forced the ryots to sell their produce at throwaway prices. ""They complain that the cap on daily withdrawal hampers their activities,"" the farmers added.However, the e-mandi facility available at the APMC yards has helped some of the farmers cope with demonetization. Joint director of APMC, Mysuru, Mahesh said, ""We have seen more business this year. During November and December 2015, we saw transactions worth Rs 15 crore, while the figure for the same period in 2016 was Rs 22 crore.""Money In Account, Not In handKariyappa, 48, is a paddy farmer at Genekehal village in Kurugod, Ballari district. ""I sold one portion of my harvest to pay the labourers, and to make some purchases, such as buying pesticide. Although the local grameena bank gave me a cheque, I have not been able to encash it for the past 60 days,"" said Kariyappa.Thippeswamy, 32, who is involved in the cultivation of chillies in Kolur, Ballari district said, ""At the market, I sold three quintals of my crop. But I had to furnish my Aadhar Card, voter ID and bank account details before the money was transferred to my account. But, owing to cash shortage at my bank, I was not able to draw money. I cannot stand in a long queue the entire day waiting to get cash. I was forced to take out a loan to celebrate the village festival, which is commemorated once every four years.""Double jeopardy for the ryotsPrime Minister Narendra Modi's sudden decision to scrap two high denomination notes couldn't have come at a worse time for farmers. The timing of his move coincided with the harvest of the kharif crops, and the sowing period of the rabi crops. Moreover, after two successive droughts, agriculture was showing signs of recovery, following intermittent showers in December - a consequence of the cyclone, Vardah.Sowing for the rabi crop starts in the last week of October, and lasts till December. The target set by the state agriculture department for sowing during this rabi season was 2.4 lakh hectares. However, data provided by the department shows that sowing has taken place in just 34,000 hectares.Inadequate processing and storage facilities has only added to the problems of fruit and vegetable cultivators. Those involved in the cultivation and sale of these perishable commodities have been hit the hardest as a result of demonetization.Although there has been a drastic drop in the wholesale price of vegetables, the retail prices have skyrocketed, largely because farmers appear to have stopped cultivating them in the past one month. ""We expect vegetable prices to go up further in the next two months, particularly in Bengaluru,"" said Ravikanth, a wholesale vegetable trader.Fish industry in M'luru hitThe price of fish has nosedived in the aftermath of demonetization. Mohan Bengre, president of Mangaluru Purse-Siener Boat Owners Association, said, ""Demonetization, coupled with the hike in diesel prices, has really affected our business. The price of fish, which is sourced by meal companies, has gone down from Rs 20/kg to Rs 9/kg. Nearly 90% of the trawlers have not ventured into the sea lately.""Old habits die hardFarmers are largely accustomed to cash transactions, and they do not readily accept cheques, even if they may have bank accounts. Old habits die hardGanesh Shetty | rice miller in GangavathiBanks refusing to give our moneyCooperative banks have been the lifeline of the farming sector.

However an average Rs 20-30 drop has been observed in dal prices.Whole sale dealers and vendors say that inflow of daal into the state from Andhra Pradhesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradhes and Uttar Pradesh has increased causing a crash in price. The price has already decreased by over Rs 20 among all dal varieties. Were expecting the price to drop even further as the market is also getting weaker, said Rama Murugan, a wholesale dealer.At retail outlets, one kg of toor dal that was sold at around Rs 120 now sells for Rs 90-100, green dal faces a similar drop. Urad and dal and Bengal which sold at around Rs 140 has come down to Rs 120.Rice price, on the other hand, has seen an overall increase as the availability within the state is receding. The rice that is circulated within the state is the one that comes from Kancheepuram as the farmers had a failed crop. This has particularly increased the price of idly rice that grows there, said the owner of a rice mandy in Red Hills. The availability of rice is so low that we are bringing rice from Kolkotta, he added.Ponni rice that was sold between Rs 48 and Rs 50 now sells between Rs 54 and 56. Sona rice that was sold at around Rs 48 is being sold at around Rs 52. Idly rice which was sold at Rs 30 on average has now shot up to Rs 36 and Rs 38. The rice dealers are expecting the price to shoot up even further as Pongal comes closer."

The state government also announced that more than 140 farmers took their lives between October and December 2016 because of crop failure. The agrarian crisis in the state is a fallout of a weather vagary that hasnt received much notice. The northeast monsoon  critical to the southern peninsula, particularly Tamil Nadu  has been a failure, with overall rainfall between October and December 45.2 per cent below normal. This is the worst since the 48.3 per cent deficit recorded in 2011. In October 2016, 22 districts of Karnataka were declared drought hit. As 2016 drew to a close, South Indias combined reservoir levels were 22 percentage points less than the average water availability over the past 10 years. The situation has serious implications for crops like paddy and coconut and will impact milk and sugar production, especially in Karnataka.The poor northeast monsoon, this year, is a double blow for the southern states. Tamil Nadu, Kerala and south interior Karnataka and coastal Karnataka had already reported respective shortfalls of 19 per cent, 34 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per cent during the southwest monsoon (June-September). The corresponding deficits of 62 per cent, 61 per cent, 70 per cent and 63 per cent reported for the northeast season makes matters worse for these regions.The deficit in the northeast monsoon is likely to have implications for the economy. It may also accentuate inter-state river disputes, especially the sharing of Cauvery waters. While it is too early to predict the exact shortfalls in crop production, sowing figures from South India do not portend well. Tamil Nadu, for example, had targeted 14.5 lakh hectares under rice in 2016-17, according to the agriculture ministry. But barely seven lakh hectares was under the plough by January 5. This is 33 per cent less than the five-year sowing average of 10.68 lakh hectares. The shortfall will also impact livelihoods and have repercussions on the mechanisms to deal with crop failure. So far, less than a third of the drought hit areas in Karnataka have been covered by the Pradhan Mantri Gram Fasal Bima Yojana. The northeast monsoon is considered a fringe player in the agro-climate story. But imperatives of the economy and the needs to secure peoples livelihoods require a rethinking on that front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The PB commission had quoted Achuthanandan saying that he had brought these violations to the notice of the then general secretary Prakash Karat, but to no avail.The state committee also discussed the protest measures to be taken up by the party in the issues of rationing through PDS, demonetisation and agrarian crisis.The LDF will organise evening dharnas in all panchayats, municipalities and corporation centres demanding a judicious public distribution system.The protest with a demand to reintroduce statutory rationing system will also seek to reinstate the quota of rice the state was eligible before the food security act came into force.Though the CC asked the state committee to probe allegations of nepotism against E P Jayarajan and P K Sreemathy, there were no hints about the state committee assigning a committee for the purpose.It is more likely that the state secretary himself will conduct the probe and submit the report to the CC before its next meeting."

R. Bindu, a teacher who heads the Agricultural club at the school.Members of the Malayalam club at BRMHS Ilavattam have used the seeds and farming tips given from their school to cultivate plants in their own homes. Spinach or Cheera, in particular, is cultivated in all their homes, with the programme being given the moniker Cheeragramam.The vegetables they grow, while not sufficient to meet the needs of the household, is much tastier than the store-bought items, says Abhirami, a member of the club.True to the spirits of organic farming, these young farmers follow the mantra of no waste, no chemicals.While at GHSS Venganoor, it was the plastic bottles and other containers collected during a cleaning drive that were used as pots for plants, at BRMHS Ilavattom, the wooden stands and PVC pipes left behind after painting jobs, and broken boxes from fish outlets have been used for cultivation.

The warmth of the Lohri bonfire, the blessings of til laddoos and the fragrant aroma of sweet pongal rice could not have come at a better time.Friday ushers a series of winter harvest festivals beginning with Lohri January 13 and going on to Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Maghi Bihu January 14. Each of these acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the sun god for his sustenance.Housing societies particularly in Sion Koliwada, GTB Nagar, Bandra, Khar and Andheri will light the Lohri bonfire Friday night. ""People circumambulate the fire and make harvest offerings like revdi and popcorn as well as coconut. Lohri is not a religious festival but one that the entire Punjabi community celebrates,"" said Sardar Himmat Singh, secretary of the Dashmesh Darbar Gurdwara in GTB Nagar.The festival of Makar Sankranti marks Uttarayan or the entry of the sun into Capricorn. ""Maharashtrians prepare brown hard til laddoos with jaggery. We Sindhis make soft malleable laddoos with white sesame, gulkand, rose petals, raisins and pistachio nuts,"" said Andheri housewife Bhagwanti Rai.She purchased a half kg box for Rs 140 on Thursday. Sindhis traditionally offer a meal of sweet saffron rice, sai bhaji, radish, carrot and til sweets to a group of little girls this day.This year the favourite motif on Sankranti kites features PM Modi amid a cache of demonetised currency as well as the new Rs 2,000 notes. ""But business is bad. I hope the promise of achhe din does not turn out to be an exercise in kite flying,"" laughed Sharad Sane who sells kites near Crawford Market.Saturday morning, Tamilian households will cook the delectable pongal rice using rice, milk, sugarcane, jaggery and cardamom. The women of Dharavi line up scores of pots on the lengthy strip of road to prepare a collective feast."

""It is a time of nostalgia and since I am interested in organic farming I have been volunteering on farms. This time I went to a site near Avadi to try my hand at harvesting with a sickle,"" says Deepa, who often gets her 10-year-old son to accompany her on her farmers' day out. The weekend she says is a time for celebration at another friend's farm.theThough Pongal marks the end of harvest season, members of Valam Community Farm , which was formed a few weeks ago, will mark this weekend as the beginning of their farming initiative.""We are a group of 25, mostly IT professionals, with an interest in farming. We have leased a 5.2-acre farm near Chengalpet and plan to organically grow a traditional variety of paddy,"" says Gopinath Jayaraja, one of the founding members of the group. This Sunday, the group will be crushing eggshells, mixing them with dry fish scales and fruit peels to make an organic nutrient for the soil to prepare the soil for the coming season.""This initiative is not to earn money but for people to learn farming,"" says Jayaraj.While it will take a while for Jayaraj and his team to reap the fruits of their labour, Pongal came early for Jaya Hepzibah , who cultivated her first crop in December from her 2-acre farm near Ranipet, 100km from the city. ""I have always wanted to try organic farming. Last July, I managed to convince my husband to buy a plot of land where I could grow paddy,"" says the 43-year-old homemaker, who then contacted Chennai Green Commune. With a little help from the organic farming group, Hepzibah set out to turn her land into a patch of organic green among farms that practised chemical farming.""I was told by farmers to go back and not try to bring ideas to the village that are unprofitable,"" she says. ""But I was persistent and at the end of 120 days I had 1,400kg of native samba variety rice. A sweet pongal for me I would say, as some dealers also offered to buy my crop,"" says Hepzibah, who cannot wait to start working for the next season and plans to convert another 2-acre land into a poultry farm with a vegetable patch."
58f4fcb1a3d24b0b70c1bda9,Surviving the drought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Surviving-the-drought/article17031553.ece,2017-01-13,"Tamil Nadus move to declare a drought, ironically on the eve of the harvest festival of Pongal, is an important step to address the agrarian distress that is sweeping the State following poor rainfall during the northeast monsoon. Even with relatively better governance structures, desperation among farmers has resulted in a spate of suicides, particularly in the Cauvery delta rice belt that has received little water from Karnataka in recent times. An official declaration of drought brings relief: postponement of loan recovery, waiver of land tax and alternative employment through schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The challenge now is to infuse confidence among farmers that the government is fully behind them. As agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan has pointed out, there is a need to look ahead and institute reforms in drought management for effective distress mitigation. These should be founded on a participatory approach, one that intensively engages the farm community year-round. A monsoon management centre drawing upon the expertise of multiple departments would, for instance, help use scarce resources conservatively during a drought, and maximise their potential in good times. It is also crucial to preserve the health of cattle and other livestock, as they tend to suffer irreparable harm during drought, with cascading effects on their future productivity. The Centre should provide all support to achieve this under the National Disaster Response Fund and the Prime Ministers crop insurance scheme.The importance of welfare support for small and marginal farmers cannot be overstated, given the vagaries of the monsoon. More than a decade ago, the National Commission on Farmers pointed out that successive droughts, illness, high expenditure on social obligations and asset loss push farmers to the brink. Yet, not much has changed in the management of drought from the low-budget practices of the colonial era, as the Swaraj Abhiyan case in the Supreme Court last year revealed. No more time can be lost in making the administrative system for agriculture responsive to todays needs. The Centre has to ensure that the Drought Management Manual is updated to reflect farmers concerns, chiefly, giving weightage to the amount of rainfall deficit and declaring a drought without delay. In Tamil Nadu, excessive reliance on water-intensive rice cultivation, and lower priority for hardy millets have raised the risk for many farmers. Active recharging of groundwater and harvesting of surface water are vital to meet the challenges."

Puspuni, known as the second most important agrarian festival of the region after Nuakhai, has special significance for the people of the region as majority of the population depend on agriculture. While Nuakhai is celebrated after flowering of paddy, Puspuni is observed to celebrate the harvest of the crop.It is celebrated on the day of Pausa Purnima (full moon day in Odia month of Pausa) after harvesting of kharif paddy. The festival provides the much-needed break after the tiring agricultural work. It also marks the end of work contract between landowners and agricultural labourers and beginning of a new one. While it is associated with fun and merry making, there is no ritual or worshiping of deities during the festival. Emphasis is given on food, especially traditional and non-vegetarian, for its celebration.This apart, children were seen moving from door-to-door singing the song Chher Chhera and collecting food materials, including rice and vegetable or cash. The entire exercise is aimed at poking fun at the older women of a household, strengthening bond between the two generations and seeking blessings from them. However, the festival is celebrated a day later in Bargarh town to mark killing of demon King Kansa during Dhanu Yatra."

The fourth accused is untraceable.The girl, who stayed with her parents in the shanties of Azad Nagar , had gone missing while playing outside her home on Monday evening. Her body was found half-buried in a drain at an isolated spot behind the Golden Nest Complex in Bhayander on Thursday.Around 8pm on Monday, the 24-year-old main accused, who used to load goods in the tempo of the victim's father, purchased a bar of chocolate from a grocery store and used it to lure the girl. One she agreed to come, he carried her in his arms towards an open ground behind the Azad Nagar slums. The three other accused - aged 38, 34 and 33- were waiting there and all four took turns to brutalize the minor.""As she began crying, the main accused hit her on the head with a stone. The impact killed her instantly.

A police team was formed to investigate and 24 men from the locality were detained for questioning. The shopkeeper who sold the chocolate to the main accused gave the police his description. Residents recalled having seen the child with the main accused, after which the cops arrested him. ""He used to visit the victim's home and often give her chocolates,"" the police official added.The autopsy conducted at JJ Hospital confirmed that the child was sexually abused and the assault had fractured her skull.

For three hours a day, he also works at another bakery. Express Photo by Arul Horizon Ansari at work at his bakery near the Pune Railway Station. For three hours a day, he also works at another bakery. Express Photo by Arul HorizonHe was 11 when he ran away from home in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh along with his elder brother. The year must have been 1997 or 1998, he doesnt remember exactly. The siblings came to Pune and found employment at Imperial Bakery  one of the biggest bakers in the city at the time  and started working as helps at a salary of Rs 300 a month.It was a novelty for me this whole bakery business. I had never seen the inside of a bakery before. This one was huge. They used to process 300 gunny bags full of flour everyday. I found to my surprise that I had a talent for baking, for handling the dough. And from the second month itself, my salary increased to Rs 350. The owner, Parsee, was impressed, says Tabaraq Ansari, around 32 and a father of four.Ansari is a khameer baker  he makes pav, doughnuts, breads, buns, and toasts. I dont know anything about biscuits or cookies. We have another cook for them, he adds.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAs per an estimate of those in the business, Pune and its outskirts have over 1,500 bakeries. Almost all those working as cooks and helpers here are migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and areas around Delhi. Ansari estimates that he has worked in over a dozen bakeries in Pune since landing here two decades ago.On December 30, six people suffocated to death at Punes Bakes N Cakes bakery in Kondhwa as the two exits were locked from outside. All six, who were in their 20s and all from Uttar Pradesh, were sleeping in the loft. Of them, one was visiting his brother employed at the factory.Ansari says that almost all bakeries, depending on their size, employ four to eight people who, without exception, stay and sleep on the premises.While its the responsibility of the Labour Commissioner, which grants operating licences to business establishments, to check the working conditions, Ansari cant recall a single instance when any official  from the Labour or any other department  visited any of the bakeries where he has worked. Even after the Kondhwa incident, no checks have been announced.The bakery that currently employs Ansari, for Rs 240 per day, is among the busiest in the area if not the biggest. As its close to the Pune Railway Station, its open for business day and night. The shop is on the ground floor while baking is done on the first floor. The space in the large kitchen is almost completely occupied by stacks of greasy black baking trays, and imposing bakery equipment such as moulders, mixers and ovens.Its in between these trays, or on the kitchen platform, even on the exhaust hood, that Ansari and the seven other workers sleep. Those sleeping on the floor use mattresses, others blankets or bedsheets. We use whatever is provided by the owner, says a young worker.As the staff work in shifts, at any given time, half of them sleep as the other half work around them. Two others and I work from 11 in the night till dawn, and go to sleep around 7 am. Another cook takes over in the morning, says Ansari.His day begins around 10.30 am, when he gets up and freshens himself in the dingy toilet on the ground floor that the bakery staff share with workers of a neighbouring hotel, which is also run by the bakery owner. There is no power in the toilet and bathroom block  a kuchcha structure and dark even at noon  and no water. The staff carry water in buckets from outside.The workers of the hotel sleep not far from the toilet. They dont mind the darkness, they say; it helps them sleep after their late-night hours.After freshening up, Ansari and the others who have worked at night head for tea and breakfast to a hawker outside. The lunch and dinner they cook themselves, in the hotels kitchen.Ansaris first shift lasts from 11 am to 3 pm, when the manager gives him a list of the items that need to be replenished in the shop below, and he starts work on them.After lunch, around 4 pm, Ansari cleans himself up and steps across the road to another, much smaller, bakery. He works there for the next three hours, earning Rs 150. Given the low wages, he says, he needs every penny.Ansari says his employer doesnt object. Most of us work at other bakeries. The owners dont say anything as they can silence us whenever we complain with, But we let you work at the other place too.After returning, Ansari has the food, mostly rice and daal, which is cooked by the bakery staff in turns. He lies down now in a corner of the bakery to catch some sleep.Its at 11 pm that his main work shift begins. For the next six hours, he makes buns, bread and other products to make sure there is enough maal (consignment) for sale till the next evening. He has to meet the demand slip that he got from the manager earlier in the day.Ansaris village lies about 50 km north of Gorakhpur. He and his brother, two years older, left home after some trouble in the family, he says. Neither had ever been to a school; with six children, their farm labourer father struggled to keep the family afloat. Few children in the village ever studied, Ansari adds, with most boys just waiting it out till it was time for them to leave for Pune or Mumbai to earn a living like the elders.By the time Ansari and his brother made their first visit back to the village 17 months after leaving it, Pune was home.This is how it is for most of us from UP who work here, be it in the bakery or the catering line, Ansari says. If you are unmarried, you visit once in 16-18 months. If you are married, you go once in four months.On his second visit home, when he was 16, Ansari got married. He was earning Rs 600 a month at the time. Humaare yehan shaadi jaldi hoti hai. Tab bhi, aur abhi bhi (Marriages happen early among us. It was the same then, and now), says Ansari.His brother worked with him at a bakery for the first two years. After that, he returned home and sat around doing nothing. Later, he left for Saudi Arabia and started working there, Ansari says.The 32-year-old fears there is no future for bakers like him who dont know modern baking techniques or about the exotic breads and cakes that have captured the market. He also feels bakeries now rely more and more on machines than on men with knowledge.I get Rs 240 a day despite my experience. Also, theres no job security. As long as the owner likes the taste, its alright. If I go wrong somewhere, he will sack me, and the next day Ill be on the road, he says.He also complains that the youth now are not willing to learn. They work for a month, collect their salaries, and the next day, disappear. The manager has to then go hunting for fresh boys, says Ansari, who has to train the new staff at his bakery.Ansari often visits his village, where his four children and wife stay with his elder brothers family. While his eldest child is 16 years old, the youngest is nine. Whenever I get bored, I go home and stay there as long as I want, says Ansari.He is determined though to ensure that all his children study, he says. I want my daughter and three sons to have a proper education. As a parent, that is my responsibility. Although we cant control what they will get in life  its destiny  its our duty to try help them secure a good future.His family has never been to Pune, and he has never thought of bringing them here. Its beyond my capacity. If I stay alone, I can do some adjustment, live in cheap places, save as much as I can and send home. If I bring them here, I will have to borrow money just to meet the daily needs, he says.The December fire that killed six bakery workers doesnt worry him too much, Ansari adds. It was a one-off incident, and death can catch you anywhere, he shrugs. That was their fate. If you are destined to die, you can die walking on the road or sitting in an AC office. I havent seen many accidents in my 20 years in this business.Since their bakery is open round the clock, it is never locked, unlike in the case of the six who died.Well past midnight, half the bakery staff start preparing to retire for the day. As the trays bang around them, the dough moulders thunder on, the staff still at work shout over the machine hum, and in a corner, a dough lump is slammed against a stone top, the tired workers dont stir.No burn marks were found on the six who died in the bakery fire, police found. They suffocated to death, in sleep.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f4fdbfa3d24b0b70c1be9a,Focussing on the marginal farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Focussing-on-the-marginal-farmer/article17057550.ece,2017-01-19,"The sluice gate on the Bhakra main line canal in Khanauri-Kalan village in Sangrur district, Punjab, has become infamous. According to reports, it is a suicide point for farmers and their families. Typically, 30-45 corpses are found in the canal on average every month. Farmers suicide in Punjab is a major worry: over 2,632 farmers are reported to have committed suicide between 1995 and 2015,in the land famed for its Green Revolution, according to State government records. Mansa district alone accounts for 1,334 suicides. Adding farm labourers raises the total to 4,687 reported suicides. The reasons for this vary: cotton crop has been whittled by whiteflies, basmatis market price has declined, the local moneylender has hiked up rates to 20 per cent. The farmer ekes his way to penury.Farmer suicides are not a new trend. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 2,195 marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in 2015 (of which 834 were in Maharashtra), while 3,618 small farmers undertook such drastic steps, with Maharashtra alone seeing 1,285. More curiously, a larger number of small farmers rather than marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in States like Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. Somehow, small farmers are also bedevilled by the agricultural crisis, and this is not the case in just the traditional drought-stricken States.On input costsAgriculture in States like Punjab is typically a monoculture of wheat and paddy. When input costs associated with fertilizers, crop-protection chemicals and seeds rose, along with fixed costs associated with agricultural equipment such as tractors and submersible pumps, agriculture became economically unviable. Prices have risen  of arhar seeds and staple crops like paddy and sugarcane, of fertilizers and plain barley. The old days of farmers handing seeds as family heirlooms to their sons are long gone. Hiring labourers and animals is expensive. With an increase in application of crop-protection chemicals, soya bean has seen a massive jump in pesticide cost. Given a jump in input costs, cultivation costs have gone up in multiples. The total cost of cultivation for wheat rose three times from 2004-05 to 2012-13.While traditionally the blame is cast on the usurious local moneylender, NCRB data highlight that 2,474 of the 3,000 farmers who were reported to have committed suicide in 2015 had loans from local banks, while those who had loans from moneylenders were just 9.8 per cent of the total. Maharashtra reported 1,293 such suicides for indebtedness, while Karnataka had 946. Meanwhile, farmers in Punjab are estimated to have an outstanding debt of Rs. 69,355 crore. Somehow, the traditional moneylender is seemingly more flexible than local banks.Retailoring agricultureSolving this crisis requires an inclusive approach. Our policies should encourage integrated pest management, an approach that focusses on combining biological, chemical, mechanical and physical means to combat pests with a long-term emphasis on eliminating or significantly reducing the need for pesticides. In Vietnam, over 2 million of the Mekong Deltas rice farmers adopted a no spray early rule, curbing insecticide applications within the first 40 days of rice planting. Predatory beetles that commonly prey on rice pests were sustained, encouraging the crop while cutting pesticide use by over 50 per cent.The local fertilizer industry needs support  timely delivery of subsidies would improve working capital requirements, enabling them to manage costs through internal sources rather than external loans. Delayed payments can cause an interest outgo of Rs. 3,500 crore for fertilizer firms annually. State seed policies should focus on encouraging contract farming, along with identification of new genotypes for treating pest and disease syndromes, as well as adverse weather conditions. Precision-farming techniques like Systematic Rice Intensification can help increase seed production in this regard.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment and implements that are currently imported. Subsidies should be rerouted to ensure lower collateral requirements, longer moratoriums and payback periods for farmers seeking to buy equipment and entrepreneurs seeking to setup Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) for agricultural equipment. Companies with a corporate social responsibility focus on agriculture can be further encouraged to invest in capacity-building initiatives, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.We need to ensure that institutional financing is available and accessible and benefit provision is simplified while disbursed funds are effectively monitored. States should seek to establish early warning signals, monitoring farmers who go past set limits and seek unsustainable loans. Village-wise lists of deeply indebted farmers must be prepared annually to identify farmers on the flight path to penury and potential suicide. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, along with the local administration, should be tasked with analysing such lists for macro and local policy interventions, along with devising timely loan restructuring initiatives, insurance claim settlements and better counselling.Finally, such individuals must be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Given the hard struggle of making a living in agriculture these days, such farmers face big odds for sustaining their families and educating their children. Travelling through the by-lanes of suicide-stricken villages in Bijnor, Bahraich, Kheri, Allahabad, Aligarh and Moradabad is a humbling and disconcerting experience. Even distributing Rs.50,000 per distraught marginal farmer family has had little impact; so deep is the scale of agrarian distress. Our efforts in crowdfunding have been a palliative for over 3,000 farmers, but only systemic change can transform their situation. The marginal farmer requires more than just hope now.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency for the BJP.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment that is currently imported"

He again hit controversy when he got a gigantic statute of the legendary wrestler Mahabali Vir Lorik Ahir installed on the premises of his official bungalow in Patna.Dadan is now in the news because the Bank of India (BoI) has attached the landed assets as well as defunct rice mill belonging to him and his son Kartar Singh, for defaulting on the repayment of a loan taken by son Kartar in which father Dadan was the guarantor.The MLAs son had taken loan from the bank for setting up the rice mill.The properties seized included the rice mill at Dumraon (Buxar) and one and a half katha of land at Saguna Mor in Danapur, which will be auctioned by the bank soon.The loan amount with interest accrued on it has gone up to Rs 1.5 crore.The Dumraon MLA, while confirming the seizure of land assets at Buxar and Danapur by the bank, was unable to recall the date and year of the loan his son had taken.I being the guarantor and my son defaulter in the case, it was natural for the bank to seize the property, said Pehalwan.Once a wrestler, who taught wrestling in Varanasi in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Dadan plunged into politics and won as an Independent from Dumraon in 2000 Assembly poll. He was soon made commercial taxes minister in the Rabri Devi cabinet.Dadan set up the Prajatantrik Lok Ekta Dal before the 2010 Assembly polls. But he merged his outfit with HD Deve Gowdas JD (S) later. He subsequently joined forces with Mayawati after losing the poll.He contested the August 2014 Lok Sabha poll on BSP ticket but lost again.He was once the Bihar unit president of Samajwadi Party before being expelled from the party."

The demand for Chutkas variety of manjha  the abrasive string used in kite-flying contests  has skyrocketed for the first time in years.The reason? A number of prohibitions placed on nylon strings made by the competition, the most recent being an interim ban by the National Green Tribunal, has come as a godsend for Chutka and others like him in the locality.The demand for Bareilly ka manjha has increased since last year, when these bans came into effect, and we hope the NGT action boosts it further, says Inam Ali, a kite trader in the old city area, adding that he doesnt use any prohibited ingredient  nylon, glass or metal powder  to make his product.The String Story Manjha manufacturers date back to over two centuriesAt least 30,000 people are involved in the manufacture and trade of manjha in the cityMost of the families involved in the business dont have any other source of incomeThe trade has an annual turnover of around Rs 50-60 croreBareillys manjha is crafted through a relatively natural processThe morning ritual of most manjha manufacturers in Bareilly is boiling pots of coarse rice into thick pasteThe end-product is a sturdy manjha capable of holding its own against rivals in tough kite-flying competitionsThe nylon manjha  made with synthetic materials  is banned in several states, including Gujarat, Maharastra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It is also called the Chinese manjha, presumably because it was first introduced in the Indian market by traders from the neighbouring country.The nylon manjha was banned in Maharashtra in 2014. So, from 2015, we began coming here to buy our wares, remarks Dheeraj Sahu, a manjha trader from Nagpur.Sahu is not the only one. Over 200 of my biggest clients are from places outside Uttar Pradesh, says Ali.Read | Child killed by manjha couldnt even shout, died in fathers lapThe Bareilly ka manjha, on the other hand, is crafted through a relatively natural process. The morning ritual of most Muslim households near Hussainebagh  a major manjha production area in Bareilly  comprises boiling pots of coarse rice into thick paste. The grain is then kneaded with psyllium husk, stone powder, surma (kohl), colour and a few herbs into luddi (dough). In the next step, the luddi is smeared over cotton strings tied between two wooden poles and then left to dry for a few hours.The end-product is a sturdy manjha capable of holding its own against rivals in tough kite-flying competitions.There was a time when powdered glass was included in the luddi, but not anymore, says Asib. Now, powdered marble or ceramic fragments are used instead.So, how are the cotton strings coated with marble? First, the hard stone is crushed into miniscule grains by hand, using a mortar and pestle. It is then sieved to obtain even finer pieces. These fragments are then re-ground using mechanical or electric machinery until a smooth powder is produced. This is sold to manjha manufacturers, who use it to strengthen the string.A labourer works at a manufacturing unit in Bareilly. (Sachin Saini/Hindustan Times)Though Bareilly ka manjha is what traders from other states covet the most, the nylon version is also in high demand. It has dominated the local market ever since its introduction in 2009. While one gitta (yarn) of nylon manjha costs Rs 200, the price of the same amount of Bareilly manjha comes up to Rs 600. This is why people prefer to buy the nylon version, says Haji Puttan, a trader from Kila area.There is another reason why the nylon manjha continues to be a hit with kite flyers. According to Kamaal Asib, president of the Manjha Majdur Hath Karigar Samiti, it has fared much better than its Bareilly counterpart in lab tests as far as strength is concerned. When experts at the North India Textile Research Association laboratory rubbed a strand of Bareilly manjha with a standard string, it broke after 96 smooth cuts. The nylon manjha took 18,000 cuts to break, he says.Read | Killer manjha: Delhi govt bans kite-flying thread after 3 deaths in two daysHowever, this very strength is also why the nylon string is considered dangerous by the authorities. The rise in its popularity was accompanied by an increase in manjha-related mishaps, with over 30 such instances being recorded in Bareilly alone. Finally, the Allahabad high court issued a ban on the sale of nylon manjha in November 2015.However, due to the authorities laxity in implementing the ban, nylon manjha continues to be sold openly. Two children were killed in neighbouring Delhi last August, when their throats were slit by strings of kites being flown as part of a competition.We have our limitations what will be eat if we do not sell these strings?Traders say they cant stop selling the nylon manjha just because of the ban. Majboori hai, nahi bechenge tho khayenge kya? Agar sarkar me himmat hai to ye manjha bane wali company ko band karwa de (We have our limitations what will be eat if we do not sell these strings? If the government has the courage, it must ban the firms that produce nylon manjha), remarks Ali.One can see the logic in his statement; the bans talk only of selling nylon manjha, not their manufacture. In fact, Karnataka  which banned the sale of the product in July 2016  happens to be its manufacturing hub. The biggest synthetic manjha maker  Mono Kite  is based in state capital Bengaluru.Mono Kite general manager Yogesh Saxena admits that Uttar Pradesh is their biggest market, but denies reports that their product is dangerous. Our manjha is completely biodegradable. We care for nature as well as our customers, Saxena tells HT over the phone, adding that their nylon string is manufactured with machines imported from Germany in adherence to strict research and development guidelines.Though sales have taken a hit after the bans, the company still produces six to eight tonnes of nylon manjha every month. The ban is on the sale of manjha, not its production, he says.Read | When manjha was just about kite-flying"

Sudheeran has said that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should relinquish the Home portfolio as he has become a total failure in handling the department effectively.Addressing the media after an executive meeting of the KPCC here on Saturday, Mr. Sudheeran said the politics of violence indulged in by the CPI(M) and the BJP had turned the State into a war zone, with political killings and blood-shedding becoming the norm of the day. The police had not been intervening effectively to end this violence and the Home Department headed by Mr. Vijayan had lost its control over the police. People should be given back their right to live in peace and both the CPI(M) and the BJP should take the lead to end violence, he said.The KPCC executive had decided to present a united front against the anti-people policies of both the Central and State governments and to organise strong agitations against such policies. The Congress party would stand united and the partys activities at all levels would be strengthened and agitations carried forward.Mr. Sudheeran said the State governments inertia had led to the collapse of the public distribution system and the government had not even managed to convince the Centre about its food requirements. Immediate steps were needed to check the steep hike in the price of rice in the open market. Traditional sectors such as coir, cashew and handloom were in the doldrums and the crisis in the agrarian sector needed to be resolved immediately.The KPCC executive would meet again on February 22 and the focus would be on strengthening organisational activities. Between February 1 and 28, all booth committees of the Congress would be reconstituted ."

The price of the popular brand, which was Rs. 32 a kg last month, has touched Rs. 42 a kg in the retail markets.Crop failure of this paddy variety has been blamed for the shortage and the next crop is due for harvest only in April.The commodity mainly arrives from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana though Tamil Nadu and Karnataka partly meet the demand.The crop has failed in the latter two states too following drought. This could compel merchants in the southern districts to depend on rice varieties from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, which are not popular among consumers.Varieties from Uttar Pradesh sell around Rs. 32 a kg and that from Punjab Rs. 33 a kg in the retail markets. Andhra rice, which was earlier used only in Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and parts of Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts, is now gaining popularity in Ernakulam and Thrissur too.Rice merchants here said on average three trains carrying 30,000 sacks of Andhra Pradesh rice used to reach Kollam a week. Now, only two trains have come in the past two weeks.Retail merchants, who source rice from wholesalers, said since the past two or three days they were unable to get the required quantity. Wholesalers said they had to meet the demand of their clients and there was a shortage of stock.There is also uncertainty over the stock position of the Jaya variety rice in Andhra Pradesh. There are concerns that the rice variety may go out of stock in the wholesale market if a train carrying the commodity fails to arrive this week.Dealers said the situation was critical. Such a shortage of Andhra rice in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram was witnessed last in April 2008, the wholesalers said."

In an interview with TOI, he claimed that the way Congress and Shiromani Akali dal (SAD) had been training their guns on his party, it was a sign of their desperation over AAP's rise as a political entity.It is party to a political conspiracy to vitiate peace in the state. I have demanded that there should be action against SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, as there could be more trouble. Political rallies are usually safe. The reports we are getting about sophisticated explosives being used points to a conspiracy.It has to be understood what is happening. Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh have become desperate due to AAP's popularity. Captain has declared that the 35,000 NRIs coming down to Punjab for campaigning are terrorists. They (NRIs) are sons of the soil. When we bump into a Punjabi boy or girl at a showroom in Canada or Amsterdam, we feel proud of them. Have they become terrorists for supporting AAP? At the same time, Badal's business interests and the conflict of interest with governance is at the root of most problems in the state.That's rubbish. In Delhi, we had said that we will take action against any state leader or minister if found guilty of financial misappropriation. In case of Chhotepur, we adopted the same policy of zero tolerance. He was our own-state level leader and we ourselves took action on realizing that he accepted money. The party leadership cannot ignore such things.Badal's own people are going to constituencies and saying if you don't want to vote for SAD, vote for Congress and not AAP. They don't want to let people think independently. It is a clear sign of their being hand in glove. Captain has foreign bank accounts and everyone knows Badal cannot take action against him.In my opinion, it will be a repeat of Delhi. AAP will win with an overwhelming majority. I can feel a positive energy when I meet people in markets and suburbs. I was in Jagraon today as the local candidate revived her campaigning. Before that in Ludhiana, I went for a morning walk and a person rushed home to gift me a ""Gita"" and said we need to get rid of evil forces in the state.We have changed the course of political discussion. The industry in the state has been deliberately killed so that Badal family's own businesses prosper. The policies for the common traders are such that they can never comply and no one can dare to question those in power. AAP will bring in industry-friendly policies for Punjab. Badals should have focused on running the government, not their businesses. It can be done when out of government. The family that decides transport policy also has its own fleet of private buses. Meeting traders from the state has been a very overwhelming experience for me. They told me: ""Bahar taale, andar jaale (locks on the outside, cobwebs inside)."" That sums up the state of industry here. Rice millers from Abohar were equally disillusioned.My statement was misinterpreted. The party works on an agenda and feels that the reforms in education and healthcare that have been implemented in Delhi will be replicated in Punjab if AAP forms the government."

In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much.

58fef7497be9e0429666bfbf,Modi's 'achhe din' reality check: Pressure builds to deliver on election promise,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-the-achhe-din-ask-those-who-voted-for-modi/story-zSkharcZSfHdLRtDtwd5UJ.html,2017-02-05,"Rocking the youngest of his five children in his arms, street vendor Daata Ram watches his wife tend to two sick cows whose milk once supplemented their meagre income.The 66-year-olds family of seven survives on what he now makes by selling small quantities of puffed rice in Pandra Sikanpur, a one-street, hardscrabble town of 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh.I took a loan of Rs 30,000 to buy those cows but I think they are no good now, says Ram, who uses a fourth of his monthly earnings of Rs5000-6000 to repay the local moneylender.Across the street from Rams thatched hut is the sprawling house of Neeraj Kumar Singh, a well-off sugarcane farmer who lost multiple crops to back-to-back droughts three years ago, and then suffered when farm prices crashed last year.It takes two harvesting seasons to recover the loss of one, says Singh who wants his sons to find jobs outside farming so that their lives wouldnt be held ransom to the vagaries of nature.But his four children have found no jobs, and the 60-year-old farmer is angry that he must now divide his 10 acres of cropland to secure their future.Daata Ram and Singh sit on different points on the countrys income spectrum but, in their collective discontent, the two symbolise the rising pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver on his emotive election vow to bring achhe din, or good times, to Indians.The Feb. 1 budget was a chance for Modi to unveil measures that would fulfil his 2014 guarantee of growth and more jobs, a task made all the more tough by his abrupt decision to drain out 86% of all cash in the economy in his fight against illicit wealth.Its also a challenge that is urgent, given that Modi has already crossed the halfway point of his tenure.Read | Budget 2017: Akhilesh says BJP could not fulfil promise of achhe dinTo his admirers, though, Modi has already made great strides  from reinvigorating the ossified hand of a government system that hobbled progress to biting the bullet on tough decisions needed to pull Indias economy out of a dangerous morass.Many of his moves on inclusive, accountable governance and a freer hand to bureaucracy have resonated well with Indians tired of a rudderless government mired in corruption scandals and whose indecisiveness had left more than 700 major industry projects in limbo.Rambir Rathi , a Uttar Pradesh farmer at home (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Growing economySome of that good work is showing.The countrys annualised retail inflation is below the mid-point of the central banks target; public finances are better than before with higher income from taxes, monsoon-sown grain production is the highest in at least 14 years and the economy is more open to business than it has ever been. In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much.

590467297be9e04154df660f,Untested Sasikala to take over as chief minister of Tamil Nadu at a point when the job description just got tougher,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/untested-sasikala-to-take-over-as-chief-minister-of-tamil-nadu-at-a-point-when-the-job-description-just-got-tougher/,2017-02-07,"Mass protests in January to express unhappiness over a Supreme Court verdict which ended jallikattu was Tamil Nadus most defining moment in recent times. The protests, which were catalysed by improbable groups using social media for mobilisation, defies categorisation. But it does show there is deep-seated public resentment against the states prevailing political culture.In this backdrop, VK Sasikalas ascent to the chief ministers office is incongruous. The events which led to her election as legislature party leader of AIADMK represent a political culture which runs counter to what protesters seemed to want. Unsurprisingly, it led to a flurry of unflattering jokes on social media. Sasikala, who has never won an election, will take over the administration when both the state and she face significant challenges.The disproportionate assets case is likely to resurface this month as a division bench of the Supreme Court is expected to pronounce a verdict soon. The events which led to the case remain in public memory and they will make it difficult for Sasikala to quickly earn wide public support.Beyond the personal challenge, as chief minister she has to lead a state that faces social and economic problems. Tamil Nadu is in the grip of a terrible drought and some speeches at the jallikattu protests reflected the attendant anguish. This is not a one-off issue as recent weather patterns and water scarcity have made farming a highly risky venture. In 2012-13, agricultural output in Tamil Nadu contracted by a little more than 10% on account of water scarcity.Both AIADMK under Jayalalithaa and DMK have used enhanced welfare spending to blunt the edge of erratic weather patterns on the agrarian economy and job insecurity in urban areas. Sasikala will presumably do the same but will face tougher challenges compared to her predecessors. Tamil Nadu has a problem with its tax collections even if it does not have a debt problem like Punjab.On some crucial indicators such as the ratio of interest paid on debt to the annual revenue, it does fairly well. But going ahead the space to manoeuvre is shrinking just when social problems have begun to show up. O Panneerselvam, in his role last year as finance minister, complained that growth in commercial taxes was low. The problem isnt new and there dont seem to be cogent ideas to deal with it. Sasikala, as a CM without experience at this time, presages a long and frustrating summer for the people.She represents a phase of Tamil Nadus political trajectory which saw institutions being hollowed out alongside harsh suppression of dissent. It may have worked for a while as this phase was also accompanied by an expansion of welfare architecture, best represented by free rice distributed through PDS. But the environment is far more challenging now and the next chief ministers stock response for everything has been Amma.Neither Jayalalithaa nor M Karunanidhi had a response for the social fault lines which crisscross rural Tamil Nadu. The state has an unfortunate reputation for honour killings, particularly on the heels of inter-caste marriages. The Dravidian parties have sidestepped the issue as their politics has increasingly become devoid of substance. It is difficult to see how the person set to become CM of Tamil Nadu is going to deal with the issue. It is not just an issue of local caste conflicts. The problem also comes from caste-based political mobilisation which tries to frame economic challenges as identity issues. An inevitable fallout is friction, which sometimes takes violent forms.Not only has Sasikala plenty of internal problems to confront, there are also inter-state issues. All through the tortuous negotiations to bring about GST, Tamil Nadu has been a reluctant participant. Neither AIADMK nor DMK have been comfortable with it. But with GST almost through, the state needs its leadership to protect its interests. Also, the Cauvery issue will resurface soon enough and needs deft handling. It is anybodys guess if Sasikala will have the inclination to network and thereby secure a good deal for the state.Given the magnitude of challenges Tamil Nadu faces now, Sasikalas ascent represents inability of the political culture to adapt to change. This may not be the best of times for Tamil Nadu."
58f4d2cd60de470aa339c436,Cong sees a hill handle,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170208/jsp/nation/story_134679.jsp,2017-02-08,"New Delhi, Feb. 7: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's note-recall logic that a surgery is done best on a healthy body drew a retort from Rahul Gandhi: "" Neem hakim khatra-e-jaan (A doctor with little knowledge imperils life."" Rahul, who picked the famous Urdu saying to get back at Modi, was not present in the Lok Sabha when the Prime Minister gave the speech in which he defended the demonetisation drive and criticised the Congress governments and the Nehru-Gandhi family. The Congress vice-president was in Meerut to address a campaign rally with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. After tweeting the saying, Rahul took to the social networking site again to say: ""PM mocks the tragedy of Uttarakhand and insults freedom struggle but has no answers to the opposition questions."" The Prime Minister had referred to last night's tremor in Uttarakhand to heap scorn on Rahul for saying earlier that there would be an earthquake if he spoke on his allegation of personal corruption against Modi. ""The earthquake finally reached Delhi. If someone sees service in SCAM, even mother earth gets angry,"" Modi had said. The Congress sought to turn the tables on Modi by alleging he had been insensitive to the people of Uttarakhand. Harish Rawat, the chief minister of the election-bound state, said: ""The Prime Minister should be ashamed for making fun of the earthquake in Uttarakhand. Despicable statement."" Turning Modi's comments into a poll plank, the Congress posted several messages on its official Twitter handle. ""Modi using natural calamity like earthquake to make a political point shows the depths to which he will descend to. The Prime Minister thinks even Parliament is an election platform. Has no respect for parliamentary dignity,"" a tweet said. The party held a media conference where spokesperson Gaurav Gogoi said: ""Our prayers and sympathy are with the people of Uttarakhand, who are still recovering from the shock of the earthquake. The people will feel hurt and humiliated by the Prime Minister's tone of humour and mockery."" Gogoi lamented that the Prime Minister had not expressed any sympathy for those who lost their lives because of the demonetisation. Many Congress MPs alleged Modi had ""failed miserably"" to defend the demonetisation. Rahul posted five questions for the Prime Minister: ""Amount of black money recovered after November 8, 2016? Economic losses to the nation and number of jobs lost? How many people died due to demonetisation and has compensation been paid? Who all did the PM consult on demonetisation; why were experts, economists, RBI not consulted? Who all deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in bank accounts in six months preceding November 8?"" Congress members kept interrupting the Prime Minister during his speech, asking questions on alleged corruption involving the BJP like the Vyapam scam, the Vijay Mallya default and escape, the mining scam in Rajasthan and the graft over rice distribution in Chhattisgarh."

As Pusa Institute is situated in Delhi, there has been continuous development of agriculture in the adjoining States like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Two more agricultural research institutes, in Assam and Jharkhand, have been opened for the holistic development of agriculture nationwide, he said.Because of the adoption of crop varieties developed by Pusa Institute, meaningful and multiple changes had come about, he said. Earlier, we depended on other countries for grain, but now we are helping other countries by providing [them] food security. With the cultivation on 10 million hectares of wheat varieties developed by the IARI, 50 million tonnes of wheat was being produced. Basmati rice accounts for Rs. 22,000 crore in the agricultural exports totalling Rs. 1 lakh crore, and of this, the Basmati varieties developed by Pusa Institute account for 90%, he said.A state-of-the-art automated phenomics facility, established by the IARI, would be useful in studying the environmental stress. This facility will be used for developing plants that yield more by consuming less water and fertilizer, he said.Mr. Singh said the ICAR-IARI had developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective technology for making waste water pollution-free and useful for irrigation."

Their single-storey residence in Wategaon, a village in Maharashtras Sangli district, is named after him: Lakshya. So is the motorcycle thats parked at the entrance. Inside, his framed photos and trophies adorn the living room. He hasnt lost a single race, and he must have run in over 400. He is the Usain Bolt of bulls, says 55-year-old Uttam Chavan, with a note of pride in his voice.Grey, with white patches, a strong built and big horns painted a celebratory blue, Lakshya stands out among the cattle at the Chavans farm. His handlers  he needs half-a-dozen strong men to rein him in when he isnt tied  scuttle around in reverential unease around him. He charges if I come close or try to pet him, rues Chavans 29-year-old son Hanumant, But he fears my father and eats only if my wife feeds him. Although Lakshya spends at least nine of the 12 months at the Chavans farm, this isnt his permanent residence. Lakshyas owner, Kiran Raut, lives 50 km from Mumbai, in Badlapur, but city weather doesnt suit Lakshya. He loses appetite over there, says Chavan, who sold Lakshya to Raut eight years ago when he was 13 months old.Today, in rural Maharashtra, especially among those who follow the now-banned sport of bullock-cart races, Lakshya is something of a celebrity. Pictures of the bull and videos of his races are widely shared on WhatsApp. A 15-minute documentary, Racing Bull Lakshya, chronicling his accolades, was recently made by a fan. There are many strong bulls around, but none like Lakshya. He injured himself a year ago and had to undergo a surgery on his foreleg, but that hasnt hampered his speed one bit, says Hanumant.Racing Bull Lakshya (Express Photo) Racing Bull Lakshya (Express Photo)However, its now been two years since Lakshya ran a race. The ban on bullock cart races came into effect in 2014 alongside the controversial Jallikattu. While the ban on the latter was lifted by passing a draft ordinance late last month, Maharashtra still prohibits the use of bulls for sport or exhibition. This has caused great displeasure among the states agrarian community, which has held a number of protests over the last year. On January 28 and 29, over 15,000 people came together in Khed to demand a lifting of the ban. The bullock cart races are part of a 300-year-old tradition and an integral part of our jatras (annual village fairs). If the practice is banned forever, it will not only wipe out a tradition but also affect the local economy that revolves around the jatras. Besides, Jallikattu may involve animal cruelty, but the races dont, points out Ram Krishna Takalkar of the Akhil Bharatiya Bailgada Sharyat Sanghatna, the key petitioner demanding the lifting of ban on sports involving the bull.From 300 ft to 3 km, the track lengths for the bullock-cart races vary as do the number of bulls that race together. However, the Sanghatna is batting for the sports revival chiefly on the basis of the format practised in western Maharashtra. Called bailgada, it has the bulls running with a small unmanned cart across a track between 350-450 ft long. A team or cart has four bulls tied together and only one team can run across the track at a time. The set of bulls with the best time wins. It takes them between 10 and 15 seconds to run the distance and the carts arent even manned, so there is no point of animal cruelty, as People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) claims, asserts Takalkar.PETA begs to differ. Poorva Joshipura, India CEO, categorically states: There is no debate. No amount of regulation can eliminate the cruelty inherent in racing bulls, as the Supreme Court has found.Takalkar says, We accept there is five per cent cruelty towards the animal. If the government objects to the distance the bull runs in certain formats, we are willing to cut down to 500 ft. We will even reach out to farmers who organise races where the carts are manned and get them to stop. But a blanket ban isnt a solution. Former MLA and party member of NCP, Dilip Walse Patil, goes a step further: The solution isnt the passing of ordinance by Maharashtra government. That can be challenged in the apex court. Ideally, the ordinance should be signed by the President, or an amendment be made to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, removing bulls from the list, he says.The anger against PETA, a foreign organisation with no understanding of Indian agrarian culture, is palpable in most villages. Those people sit in air-conditioned rooms and make decisions about our lives, assuming that we are cruel. The bull is like a son to a farmer who may not eat himself, but will ensure that the bull gets his daily diet, says Mayur Wable, resident of Mancher village, Pune district, who rears bulls for racing. These bulls arent used for farm work and many farmers have air-conditioned cattle sheds for the summers. They are trained just to race, he says.The average daily expense for a bulls maintenance is between Rs 300 and Rs 500. Lakshyas caretakers spend up to Rs 2,500 feeding him  apart from the usual fare of hay, carrots, groundnuts, grains  a mixture of jaggery, cashews, pistachios, almonds and rice oil, a kilo in the morning and another for dinner. A bull will participate in up to 20 races in a year, with at least a 10-day gap between each race. If it runs for 15 seconds in each, the bull runs for no more than 10 minutes a year. If I take care of my son all his life, do I not have the right to ask him to run for 10 minutes every year? says Chavan.A bull is at its prime for eight to nine years and lives up to 18 years. The rearers say they dont sell them off to the slaughterhouse once theyre old. We take care till their last day and when they die, we perform the last rites the way we would of a family member, says Wable.Agitated bull rearers in Narayangaon (Express Photo) Agitated bull rearers in Narayangaon (Express Photo)Locally bred, the bulls are chosen for their strength and speed when they are five or six months old. The ones that dont fare well in the test are employed for farm work. Most bulls are castrated to ensure their strength. While the association for bull cart racing uses the breeding argument to make a point about preserving local pedigree, it seems like an afterthought. Most of us own tractors. The use of bulls in farm work is declining. If we dont use them for races, the local breeds will die out, says Rahul Banker, a member of the Narayangaon association.The association is also keen to distance itself from the caste aspect (Jallikattu excludes Dalit participation). We have members from all communities participating, be it Dalits or Mohammadens, says Banker. But as political analyst Anand Teltumbde points out, How many Dalit farmers can afford to rear a bull at that cost?In the village of Wadgaon Kashimbeg, there are murmurs of a race at 3 pm on the sly. Its not an uncommon occurrence in the jatra season, between January and May. The word will spread among the bull owners, and those from nearby villages will assemble with their animals on race day. These races are attended by a smaller crowd in order to avoid attention. But at 4 pm, the venue wears a deserted look. It was cancelled as the cops seemed to have found out, one farmer reveals. To make up for the loss, an impromptu demo race is organised nearby. A crowd lines up on both sides of the 350-ft track. Soon, two bulls are dragged to the starting point by half-a-dozen men. The bigger of the two, Raju, is fastened to the cart, locally known as gada, but Arjun is defiant. In a moment of confusion, the men let go of the reins and before anyone realises, Arjun has pushed his handler to the ground, scaled the fencing wall and run off into the wild. There is pandemonium in the crowd. However, before they can leave, the handlers are back with Arjun. He is still defiant but this time, another pair of hands are employed in fastening him to the cart. He is then let loose. The crowd bursts into a roaring applause as the two bulls take flight, leaving behind a cloud of dust.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The SP has this time promised laptops to meritorious students and smart phones for all.BJP and Congress, which is fighting the polls in alliance with SP, besides parties like Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have all promised free wi-fi internet services in all colleges and universities, apparently to cash in on the 'Digital India' wave.Like in the past, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), however, has stayed clear of coming out with a manifesto this elections, with its supremo Mayawati stressing that her party does not believe in making promises but ""acting"" on them.Congress has promised to provide free school education for every girl child and give free bicycles to girl students from Class IX to XII. BJP, on the other hand, has announced free school education to all students and extending it till graduation for the meritorious ones.Notably, to instill a technical approach and scientific attitude among the students who passed class XII the state government had launched a scheme to provide a laptop to them.In 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, Rs 3,43,009.91 crore were spent and 14,82,093 students covered in the scheme.

But now, I think I found my Valentine. The Vellore Culinary Trail organised by KeyTerns and curated by Foodie From Madras took 20 enthusiastic foodies (and some self-confessed non-foodies) on a trip to Arcot and Vellorevia Kanchipuram.The trip began with a battle between biryani and thayir sadam  two comfort foods by which you can judge a person! But at the end of the trail we knew who would win. The team of 20 including youngsters and the young-at-heart, bonded over food within the first 30 minutes of the journey. We knew who liked or disliked what.Kanchipuram idli, biryani, makkanpeda and filter kaapiFirst stop was on a road side. No, not shop, but literally, the side of the road. Our organisers wanted us to experience the traditional Kanchipuram idli, due to time constraints we had to eat inside the bus. Nevertheless, that did not stop us from enjoying the kovil idli.While this is circular and cut into semi-circular pieces, the common somewhat-cylindrical idlis are called tumbler idlis.A tumbler is coated with ghee and the fermented dough with pepper and curry leaves are mixed together and steamed. The ghee is to ensure that the idli comes out in shape, explained Gowrishanker Siva aka GS, the Foodie From Madras.Like every Tam-bram, I like my breakfast with a steaming hot cup of filter kaapi. Only coffee to the rescue! The shop, as the name suggests, was started in Madhuranthagam, and the franchise on the Kanchipuram highway serves more than just coffee. Served in a brass davara-tumbler, the coffee, took me back to my Coimbatore days, where every other day I would take time out to have a cuppa at the famous Annapoorna Hotel, which too serves similarly.Breakfast done. Nap taken, we reach Arcot at noon. We stop the bus on the narrow road, much to the ire of the lorry and two-wheeler drivers. We were standing outside a small shop that claimed to have introduced the Nawabi sweet, Makkan Peda to the public. Made with 11 ingredients, it is a meal in itself! This shop is 185 years old and five generations of our family has been running this, beamed Sundaram Chettiar.Legend has it that his great-great grandfather, Govinda Chettiar was close to the Nawab of Arcot. When the Nawab invited him for lunch, he was served this sweet. He tried to replicate the sweet based on what he saw, because he couldnt decipher it based on taste. Initially, we added palkhova, dalda, raisins, and a few nuts, he shared.The 20 of us loved the sweet, forgetting for a moment that biryani was awaiting us.The non-vegetarians were surprised when Sundaram Chettiar announced that he had specially packed authentic Star biryani.The hotel opens at around 10 am and you get their biryani only if you are lucky, told Srinivasan from KeyTerns. And our group was lucky or what! Packed in Mandhara elai, the fragrance of the biryani stayed intact and two people were asked to share one packet as wait for it, this was round one!The real deal was set up at The Vellore Kitchen. I get turned off by the pungent masala smell from biryanis. But this was mild. Thats the specialty of Vellore biryani. People here like it mild, so we make them that way, said P Gokul Raj, proprietor of the hotel. The rice is half cooked and the dum (vegetables and spices) is added and then cooked for a while. The rice used here is Seeraga samba, which is heavier than the normal rice.Suddenly, the trail turned into a sweet walk. We roamed the streets of Vellore looking for the oldest hotels and shops selling sweets and biscuits. Imagine finding an authentic Rajasthani hotel in a place in South India, which was ruled by Nawabs. Talk about cultural diversity!Dilip Rawals family served the North Indian doctors from Christian Medical College, Vellore. Over years, they have been famous for their lassi.Double Malai Lassi, Badam Pista Lassi and Badam kheer are famous here. Students from VIT come here just to have that and it is filling, he said, and yes he was right. The lassi was thick and filled with malai that it was even hard for two people to complete a glass. After a short walk, we reached Delhi Sweets, which has been doing business for 70 years.A spoon full of their fruit halwa, (another version of the kasi halwa) and a bite of khova jangri is enough to give you a sugar rush.As the trail ended, we made a wise decision to stop at Ratnagiri temple, only to go up and down the 150 stairs to digest what we had eaten over the day.(For details about food trails, visit their page on FB, FoodieFromMadras)"
5923bd457be9e01fcef058f8,Our language crisis,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596592/our-language-crisis.html,2017-02-15,"Our language crisisBy Vikas Kumar, Feb 16, 2017, 0:12 ISTThe post-colonial elite of India favoured English in the educational and economic spheres, while the state and politicians were nominally committed to Indian languages. As a result, more than seven decades after independence, the question of the medium of instruction in educational institutions remains unresolved. And, we continue to struggle with poor learning outcomes, high drop-out rates, and the lack of inclusion of the masses in higher education because of, among other things, our inability to provide quality education through mother tongues.The association of English with material success in the popular imagination and the neglect of intellectual activity in Indian languages have not only allowed the former to thrive at the expense of our languages, it has also made millions believe that our languages (as well as the knowledge ingrained in them) are worthless. I am reminded of a young student leader, whom I met in a remote town of Nagaland. Without any prompting, he told me that his grandparents were backward because they did not know English (I asked him if Europeans should be considered backward because they do not know Naga languages).Nagaland was the first state to adopt English as its official language and the medium of instruction in schools. However, five decades after Nagaland aligned its state policy with the elite preference, a majority of its people are not proficient in English even as their own languages remain neglected. The condition of other states, where private institutions took the lead in introducing English in schools, is not better.In fact, irrespective of their states language policy, people have been going out of their way to learn English. An acquaintance of mine in Etawah (Uttar Pradesh) approached a chemistry teacher, who was barely conversant with English. He was given to believe that the teacher, who could effortlessly pronounce names of chemical compounds, was best suited to help him pick up spoken English.Phas Gaye Re Obama, a 2010 Hindi film, takes us through the world of spoken English courses exemplified by Tyagi English Coaching Class. The photos of US presidents, sportsmen, entrepreneurs and film stars adorned the Coaching Class, whose tagline was English seekho amerikaa jaao (Learn English, go to America). The English teacher warned the students against using Hindi in the class in the following words: This English coaching, not a local language... You together thinking, English speaking like a rice plate eating. No. Never. Not. English speaking not a children play. English speaking like a undertaker play.I was reminded of this film while travelling through Jammu and Kashmir, where I found thousands of posters advertising English medium schools with names such as YES Dubai Grand School International, Ever Onn Public School, KLM International School, JK Montessorie British School, and DRS Kids.I came across only one advertisement listlessly calling attention to the existence of some Urdu academy that nobody seemed to care for and also a poster meekly inviting students to learn Arabic. Eighth Schedule languages such as Kashmiri and Dogri seemed to be entirely absent from the advertisement space.Chasing the mirageThe decline of non-English media schools and the growth of strangely-named English medium schools, is not restricted to Jammu and Kashmir though. Until the 1990s, there used to be good Hindi medium schools in Kanpur that ranked ahead of English medium schools. Today, none of them commands the same respect. They did not lose patrons because of a decline in teaching standards. They just failed to fulfil the demand for English.People are chasing the mirage of English because those who do not know the language are denied both voice and space in (urban) India. A recent Hindi film, English Vinglish (2012), poignantly captured this. In this film, the lack of acquaintance with English affected the standing of a housewife, both in the society and sadly even within her family. Her daughter, who studied at an English medium school, and husband treated her with contempt. She redeemed herself by learning English. The director could not imagine other means of redemption.The reel and real life characters mentioned above stand for millions who cannot speak English. Those who somehow manage to learn the language feel on cloud nine. Parents feel proud of their children, when they get better grades in English than in Indian languages. The children innocently proclaim that they hate Indian languages (qua subjects, I hope).However, even in the best case, most first generation English learners belatedly realise that they have picked up the wrong English, namely, British or Indian one, whereas the elite has moved on to American English. These people constitute a large and growing part of our society that is neither India nor Bharat.English, which was retained after independence to avoid linguistic conflict within the country, has introduced a new linguistic divide that is aligned with, and thus reinforces, the class divide. But, our self-absorbed Anglophone elite continue to be oblivious of the damage English has done to the society.A decade ago, then prime minister Manmohan Singh proudly informed his audience at the Oxford University: Of all the legacies of the Raj, none is more important than the English language Today, English in India is seen as just another Indian language. English is not just another language. It is, as Ram Manohar Lohia warned as early as the 1950s, a key marker as well as determinant of socio-economic privilege in post-colonial India.It is time we paid attention to the language problem, which is at the heart of our education system. An education system based on the neglect or hatred of ones own languages cannot promote the pursuit of knowledge. Unfortunately, instead of confronting the problem we have abandoned ourselves to market forces that are steering us into an ever tighter embrace of English and compounding the language crisis.(The writer teaches at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru)"

AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala began her four-year jail term on Wednesday evening in connection with the disproportionate assets case.

5922fee07be9e01fc0070d6e,The foul air we breathe,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-foul-air-we-breathe/article17309393.ece,2017-02-16,"A new international report has drawn attention to the deadly pollutants that pervade the air that people breathe in India, causing terrible illness and premature death. The State of Global Air 2017 study, conducted jointly by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, quantifies further what has been reported for some time now: that the concentration of the most significant inhalable pollutant, fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5), has been growing in India. The rise in average annual population-weighted PM2.5 levels indicates that the Centres initiatives to help States reduce the burning of agricultural biomass and coal in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi have failed. The directions of the National Green Tribunal to Delhi, which were reviewed last year, could not end open burning of garbage and straw, or curb the urban use of diesel-powered vehicles. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the weighted national PM2.5 level estimated in the international report rose from 60 micrograms per cubic metre in 1990 (the acceptable limit) to 74 in 2015, with a steady rise since 2011. Weak policy on pollution is leading to the premature death of an estimated 1.1 million Indians annually, and the number is growing, in contrast to Chinas record of reducing such mortality.Several studies show long-term evidence of a steady deterioration in air quality in many countries, and South Asia, dominated by India, is today among the worst places to live. Although the central role played by burning of crop residues in causing pollution is well-known, and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute proposed steps to convert the waste into useful products such as enriched fodder, biogas, biofuel, compost and so on, little progress has been made. Last year, helpless farmers in the northern States who wanted to quickly switch from rice to wheat burnt the waste in the fields, in some cases defying local prohibitory orders. The government has no one to blame but itself, since it has not been able to supply affordable seeder machinery in sufficient numbers to eliminate the need to remove the straw. In a country producing about 500 million tonnes of crop residues annually, the issue needs to be addressed in mission mode. Easy access to cheap solar cookers and biogas plants will also cut open burning, and help the rural economy. Yet, there is no reliable distribution mechanism for these. On the health front, it is a matter of concern that in the most polluted cities, even moderate physical activity could prove harmful, rather than be beneficial, as new research indicates. Indias clean-up priorities need to shift gear urgently, covering both farm and city."
58ff2ded7be9e04136163447,Will note ban  decide UP polls?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596742/will-note-ban-decide-up.html,2017-02-16,"Will note ban decide UP polls?By Geeta Pandey, Feb 17, 2017, 23:25 ISTIn November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by announcing that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were as good as garbage. Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections.Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, national parties  the Congress and the BJP  have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state.In the past few days, Ive travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban or notebandi (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue.The notebandi has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems theyve faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the BJPs betrayal.Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. Notebandi is the biggest issue here, says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers, runs the family hardware store. The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems.But there were lots of problems. Isnt he ashamed of lying? he asks angrily. Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed.Theres a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them. His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: Traders are very angry with Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money.Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many dont have bank accounts or credit cards. The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP.In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. Since November 8, theyve not been able to find work even for one day, he says. I ask him how they are managing. Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. Thats how we are managing.A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to poison for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. Normally we sell a kilo of rice for Rs 14, but this time we had to sell it for Rs 8 or Rs 9. We couldnt buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of the looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here.It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning, says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Modis announcement. Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially about 90% of the industry was affected since all their transactions happen in cash.Looms still shutWe had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.Varanasi has eight assembly constituencies, and Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. Why would anyone now vote for Modi? he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Hasims brothers loom, agrees. Hes the sole breadwinner for his family of eight.Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a major disaster. The ban, he says, couldnt have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year its been a wipe-out. A long-time BJP supporter, Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Modi will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state.Its an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the partys chances of winning at 101%. He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nations interest. We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.That, he says, is because people have faith in the man whos taking the decisions - the prime minister. On this count, hes right - Modis personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Modi because he is doing good work and that the note ban was a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term.Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Modi has not had much luck in state elections and hes desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Modi and his party.But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances? When the votes are counted on March 11, we will know whether it was a masterstroke or a miscalculation.International New York Times"

On Wednesday, when she arrived at the jail, she seemed to be in no mood to reconcile with the frugal life she was to have for the next four years. Having been on the lap of luxury for the last few years, she did not want to get into the police jeep like a pretty criminal and instead chose to walk herself to the prison premises A source told Mirror she made it clear to officials that she was ready to walk ""how much ever the distance it could be"".""I am not a petty thief. I will not sit in police jeep. I will sit in the jail cell, but I will not sit like a criminal in an open police jeep. I will walk any distance. Despite being instructed, she chose to walk the distance,"" a source at the spot told Mirror. The source says it was clear from her body language that was really disturbed, angry and frustrated.""Sasikala thought she would be given all the facilities she had got previously when she accompanied Jayalalithaa when they were convicted. Jaya was the CM of Tamil Nadu then. Since Jaya had health issues, she was given 'A' grade facilities and even Sasikala too got all the comforts. But, this time it's entirely different as the court rejected her request to be a VIP prisoner. Apparently, she was told that that she was no CM and she deserved no special treatment. That was a severe blow to her. All that must have been playing on her mind when she was asked to get into the police jeep. Police wanted her to take the jeep to avoid any kind of law-and-order issues. But Sasikala was quick to say 'no',"" the source said.HER FIRST DAY IN JAILAccording to a jail official, it was a quiet day/night for Sasikala in the jail and she didn't sleep the whole night. ""She was allotted 10/8 cell with a half-covered washroom. She was sharing room with her sister-in-law Elavarasi. Barring occasional conversations Elavarasi, she refused to speak to anyone. She did not even check with anyone about the news in Tamil Nadu,"" he added.Sources said she was given a small cot, given her health issues. She was provided a white saree, but ""she didn't wear it as she did not have a matching white blouse"". She was awake till the early hours of Thursday and slept for just few hours. In the morning, she had tamarind rice and coffee. She didn't even come out of the cell. ""Many people from her party here in Bengaluru and from Chennai tried speaking to her, but she didn't allow anyone to meet her,"" said another source."

Edappadi Palaniswami, sworn in as TN's CM on Thursday, is expected to visit Sasikala and seek her blessings at the Parappana Agrahara prison in Bengaluru on Friday.Sasikala arrived in the city on Wednesday to surrender before a special court set up at the Bengaluru Central Prison after the Supreme Court convicted her in the disproportionate assets case . ""Palaniswami wanted to meet Sasikala on Thursday, but there wasn't enough time as the oath-taking ceremony was scheduled in the evening.He'll meet her on Friday,"" said an AIADMK leader.Police said they've been informed informally of Palaniswami's possible visit to the prison. ""There's been no official communication about the visit. We'll be intimated by the Tamil Nadu government about the visit as per protocol,"" said M B Boralingaiah, DCP Bengaluru (Southeast).On Thursday , a team of lawyers accompanied by Sasikala's nephew Vivek Jayaraman met her. ""We discussed our course of action. We asked her about a few documents pertaining to the case,"" said lawyer Murthy Rao, who went there along with S Sendil and Ashokan, both lawyers too.Sasikala's husband M Natarajan is staying at a hotel in the city.Dismissing rumours of a threat to Sasikala's life, jail superintendent Krishna Kumar said, ""There is no threat. She is completely safe.""Sources said Sasikala did not feel like eating dinner on Wednesday. However, her niece and fellow inmate J Ilavarasi coaxed her and made sure she had some curd rice. The duo was reportedly heard talking till 11.30pm on Wednesday and Sasikala stayed awake till 1.45 am.Sasikala rose at 5.30 am on Thursday, did light exercise in the cell before sipping coffee an hour later. Jail authorities gave her puliyogare for breakfast and chapatti and a bowl of rice with curry for lunch."

Few would have cared for these elections but for the big surprise sprung by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Coming from nowhere, Prime Minister Narendra Modis party has won more than 190 seats, or 35%, of 538 seats that have so far polled, and the winning ratio keeps getting better with each round, according to unofficial results. If this trend continues, the BJP will end up winning more than 300 of the 854 zilla parishad seats  almost a 10-fold increase over the 36 seats the party won in 2012 when these elections were last held.It is a phenomenal feat for a party that has never been a force to reckon with in Odisha politics, which often revolved around two centrist parties  the Congress and the ruling Biju Janata Dal of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. That is why Modi was quick to react. He spoke about the results at a campaign rally in Uttar Pradesh and then tweeted to congratulate his party colleagues in Odisha for the good work done.Naveens BJD will still win the most number of seats, but it will have little to celebrate -- because the lead will be so narrow and the message from the voters so unnerving. Also, the effective opposition space in the state will now be taken by a party that rules at the Centre and sets the political agenda for the nation.

His lineage, his image of being not a run-of-the-mill politician and a bachelor with no temptation to hoard wealth made the people of Odisha swoon over him. He came on the political stage at a time when the Congress party, discredited by decades of misrule, had turned rudderless. The lack of an effective opposition meant Naveen had everything going for him to consolidate his power, both within and outside the party.Also, a good part of Naveens tenure overlapped with Indias economic rise and a mining boom in Odisha, which meant more money  by way of both higher central transfers and the states own revenues -- for vote-winning welfare programmes such as offering rice to the poor for Rs 2 per kg (later reduced to Re 1/kg) and building rural roads. In cities, the middle class was happy as the service sector was on an upswing. Information technology companies such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services set up large operations in the states capital, Bhubaneswar, creating lucrative jobs for the local educated youth  many of them have since risen through the ranks to take up US and Europe-based assignments for their employers. The expansion of the IT sector coupled with dodgy money from mining also fueled a realty boom that hugely benefited people living in the urbanizing landscape around the states capital and other cities.All of these kept reinforcing the image of Naveen Patnaik as a leader who stood for development and progress, even though his populist schemes came at the expense of longer-term welfare of the people. Critical sectors such as education and healthcare were neglected, as was investment in agriculture that provides livelihood to more than three-quarters of the states population.

Its ambitions have been helped by a steady disintegration of the Congress party, which has now been pushed to the margins of Odisha politics -- thanks to the lack of a leader who can steer the partys local unit.

(If, as work done by Akhilesh Yadav government shows, there is a 50% vacancy in teacher posts in UP, where will the children of the poor get education?)Fact: Modi is partially right.As many as 23% teacher posts in elementary grades (up to Class 8) and 50% posts in secondary schools ( Class 9 and Class 10) are vacant in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaSpend reported in December 2016.Of six million teaching positions in government schools nationwide, about 900,000 elementary school teaching positions and 100,000 in secondary schools  put together, a million  are vacant, according to data tabled on December 5, 2016 in the Lok Sabha.Teacher vacancy in UP is the second worst in India for secondary schools and sixth worst for elementary schools.States with most teacher vacanciesCLAIM 2:Hindustan mein sabse jyada..daliton par atyachaar agar kahin hote hai, to us pradesh ka naam hai Uttar Pradesh. (If there is a region in India where crimes against lower castes are the highest, it is Uttar Pradesh)Fact: Modis claim is wrong.Though crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) were the highest in UP at 8,358 cases, with 8,460 people affected in 2015, UPs crime rate, or crime per 100,000 SC population, was 20, less than Gujarat (26), Madhya Pradesh (37) and Goa (51), according to data from the National Crimes Records Bureau.As many as 11 states and a Union Territory registered worse crime rates against SCs than UP.Among the other large states, Rajasthan registered the highest crime rate against dalits: 57 crimes per 100,000 SC population, followed by Andhra Pradesh at 52, Bihar at 39, Chhattisgarh at 31 and Maharashtra at 14.While the crime rate in Gujarat has always been above 25 per 100,000 SC population, it has always been below 20 per 100,000 SC population in UP.The crime rate against dalits in UP consistently fell during the tenure of former chief minister Mayawati and gradually increased during the tenure of current chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.CLAIM 3:Uttar Pradesh mein kisano ki paidavar sirf 3% khareedi jaati hai (Government procures only 3% of the farm produce in UP).Fact: The figure quoted by Modi is right for wheat but wrong for rice.Government agencies, such as the Food Corporation of India and state government agencies, procured 2.5% of wheat produced in UP in 2014-15 and 10.5% of rice produced that year in the state. Most of the farm output was sold by farmers to traders and commission agents in agriculture produce markets (APMCs).In Chhattisgarh, procurement of 60% of farm produce is done by the government at the minimum support price (MSP). In Madhya Pradesh, too, 60% is bought by the government, while Haryana is at 70% and Rajasthan at 50%, Modi said.The figures are true for Chhattisgarh for rice, close to reality for Madhya Pradesh for wheat, and close for both rice and wheat in Haryana.Modi was wrong about Rajasthan. Rajasthan farmers sold 18% of their wheat to government procurement agencies in 2014-15, not 50% as the PM claimed.CLAIM 4:Humne aisi Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana laaye hai ki agar prakrutik karano se kisan buaai nahin kar paaya, to bhi usko bima milega. Aisi koi yojana dekhi hai? (We started such a crop insurance schemenamed Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme  where, even if natural reasons affect the crop at sowing, the farmer will be insured. Has anybody seen such a scheme before?).Fact: Modi stretched the truth.While the PM claimed that this is the first time crops are being insured against weather-related vagaries, an earlier insurance scheme had a sub-scheme named Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS), which was limited to some geographical regions but insured crops against drought, excess rains and even frost.The crop-insurance spending included three parts: National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS), Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) and WBCIS.The PM Fasal Bima Yojana amalgamates two old schemes, NAIS and MNAIS. WBCIS is still distinct from the PM Fasal Bima Yojana.The WBCIS component was piloted in 2003 for the summer crop and in 2008 for the winter crop. The Modi government spent more than Rs 1,000 crore in its first two years 2014-15 and 2015-16 on WBCIS even before Fasal Bima Yojana was rolled out.The government, under PM Modi, more than doubled the spending on crop insurance to Rs 13,200 crore  the highest everin 2016-17 (revised estimate), to cater to increased crop failures after consecutive drought years. The spending in 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 9,000 crore.CLAIM 5:Jahaan BJP ki sarkarein hai, chahe Gujarat ho, Maharashtra ho, Haryana ho, Rajasthan ho, Chhattisgarh ho, Jharkhand howahaan 60-70% kisanonka (fayda) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana se ho chuka hai..aur Uttar Pradesh..sirf teen percent kisanonka bima hua (In BJP-ruled states, about 60-70% farmers have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, while only 3% farmers in UP have benefitted).Fact: Modi is correct on the data for Maharashtra and Rajasthan, while he exaggerated the numbers for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. He is wrong about farmers who benefitted from the Fasal Bima Yojana in UP.In Modis home state of Gujarat  a state with one of the highest rain deficits in the largely normal monsoon of 2016, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016  a fourth of farmers have benefitted from the flagship crop-insurance scheme, not 60-70% as Modi claimed.Abhishek Waghmare is an analyst with IndiaSpend."

As many as 4,537 cardholders are likely to benefit from this move, officials said. Plans are also on to extend facilities in 1,250 ration shops across the district. According to data obtained, there are around 7.5 lakh ration card holders in Agra.The department has also been conducting awareness programmes to guide customers making payments via cell phones using the USSD. District supply officer B K Shukla said, ""Cardholders using digital payment methods will be provided ration on priority basis. Each fair price shop will make a separate queue of priority customers. Those who are still making cash payments will be sensitised about digital mode of paying.""In the digital payment system, the cardholders' mobile numbers are first registered with the banking services and payments are then channelized through USSD application using Mobile Money Identifier (MMID) code. It is not compulsory for the customers to have a smartphone to avail this service and they will only have to send a text message, said officials.Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) ration cardholders get food grains at subsidised rates. Every eligible person gets wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg up to a maximum quantity of 3.5 kg and 1.5 kg respectively."
58f4fd267be9e018510a1030,Kovind speech champions ban,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170224/jsp/bihar/story_137370.jsp,2017-02-24,"Governor Ram Nath Kovind addresses the joint budget session of the Assembly in Patna on Thursday. Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Patna, Feb. 23: Governor Ram Nath Kovind's speech on Thursday underlined the 10-month total prohibition as a panacea for many ills afflicting the state while highlighting the government's achievements in the past year and setting goals for the new fiscal (2017-18). Addressing both Houses of the state legislature, Kovind said: ""Total prohibition has empowered society. People have become healthy and disciplined. The prohibition's impact is manifesting progress in the state. Murder, loot, dacoity and kidnapping for ransom have gone down by 22 per cent, 18 per cent, 23 per cent and 42 per cent respectively between April 2016 (total prohibition was clamped on April 5, 2016) and January 2017. Domestic violence has diminished remarkably."" Prohibition occupied bigger space in the 17-page governor's speech drafted by the Nitish Kumar-led cabinet. It was dealt in two longish paragraphs. But the chief minister's saat nishchay (seven resolves) - his cardinal electoral promises - were dealt barely in one paragraph. ""The benefit of the seven resolves has been percolating down to one and all without differentiation. The government is working to ensure potable water, electricity, toilets, education in skill and self-reliance to youths and women between 2015 and 2020,"" said the governor, amid thumping of desks in Treasury Benches. Leader of Opposition in the Council, Sushil Kumar Modi, however, ridiculed the government's claim. ""The government has so far not released funds to the panchayats to carry forward the seven resolves. It is setting new priorities while relegating the old one into the background,"" Sushil said, talking to reporters in his Council chamber. Kovind dwelt at length on how Bihar gave a strong message for total prohibition through the 12,760km-long human chain 3.02 crore people joined on January 21. The governor also announced that the state government would pay Rs 11 lakh as compensation to martyrs, hailing from Bihar, in war or war-like situations anywhere in the country. He also said the government would pay Rs 51,000 for the marriage of granddaughters of freedom fighters and reserve two per cent seats for them in government jobs. Kovind said: ""The government has introduced the Right to Service Act to end corruption at the lower-level of bureaucracy and empower people. So far, the government has disposed of 14.92 crore applications received under the Right to Service Act."" Showing how the government was concerned for the Extremely Backward Classes (EBC), believed to be the Nitish-led JDU's core base of voters, the governor said: ""The government has reserved 21 per cent seats in judicial services for the EBCs against 12 per cent for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 16 per cent for the Scheduled Castes."" -OVERMATTER- Kovind, in his 70-minute speech, also enumerated steps taken for modernisation of the police force. ""The government has built as many as 151 police buildings, which include Banka police lines, Naxal police stations and tourism police stations. The government has also built 559 toilets for women police personnel across police stations and police lines in the state,"" he said. The governor said Bihar was ahead in national average in terms of production of paddy, wheat and maize. ""The state is estimated to produce 84.9 lakh metric tonnes of rice during 2016-17, which is a record of sorts,"" he said. Kovind also enumerated the work being done under the agriculture roadmap, mission human development, skill development mission and industrial promotion scheme. ""The government is working relentlessly for the all-round development of the state under its broader vision of nyay ke saath vikas (growth with justice),"" he said."
58fce3cd7be9e06c937109d2,NREGS fails to reach women with disabilities,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/feb/26/nregs-fails-to-reach-women-with-disabilities-1574918.html,2017-02-26,"BHUBANESWAR: Bharati Pradhan (name changed), a 46-year-old orthopaedically-challenged woman of Kanas block in Puri district, gets a monthly pension of Rs 300 under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana and a few kgs of rice from the State Government. The money just meets her medicine requirements. The youngest among five siblings, she was born with disability and could manage to study till Class V. Her parents, daily wagers by profession, could neither afford her treatment nor education. Though wheel-chair bound and unskilled, she is keen on being self-reliant but that is a dream.Securing livelihood has never been an easy task for women with disabilities like Bharati who live in rural areas of Odisha despite implementation of several government schemes including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). They continue to have limited access to livelihood opportunities, be it direct employment or self-employment.The MGNREGS was implemented to ensure 100 days of wage employment in unskilled manual work for people in rural pockets. According to the Panchayati Raj Department sources, only 5,362 different-abled persons worked under MGNREGS in 2016-17 financial year. Less than five per cent of this labour force constituted women with disabilities. Similarly, the total number of disabled people working under MGNREGS stood at 5,586 in 2015-16, 3,352 in 2014-15 and 3,587 in 2013-14. Although there are no reports on the number of women with disabilities employed in these three financial years, Project Directors of all the 30 District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) in the State, who are responsible for implementation of the scheme, admitted to low participation from this vulnerable group due to lack of awareness and a disabled-friendly environment.As per the 2011 Census, the total population of persons with disabilities in Odisha is 12,44,402 out of which, 6,74,775 are males and 5,69,627 are females. Sources said at least over two lakh women with disabilities, majority of them illiterate and residing in rural areas, are living below poverty line (BPL) and are in need of gainful employment. The Census points out that a majority of women with disabilities in Odisha suffer from movement-related disability, blindness and hearing impairment. Although their empowerment is only possible by economic independence, that has not been the case so far.Disability activist, Asha Hans said so many women with disabilities still living below the poverty line points to the fact that there is problem with implementation of employment schemes including the MGNREGS. Providing employment to these women becomes more necessary as almost 90 per cent of them are dependent on their family members for finances. Studies have shown that disabled women are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts in securing livelihood as they face gender discrimination, she said, adding that women with disabilities are still considered unfit to don the role of wage earner.Apparently, the MGNREG Act operational guidelines have a dedicated chapter on jobs outlined for differently-abled women. These include less stressful works like making drinking water arrangements at the work site, plantation, looking after children of workers, land levelling and sprinkling water on newly built walls. However, not many differently-abled women are coming forward to even take up these works, officials admit. The primary reason for this is lack of awareness and facilities. MGNREGS is considered labour intensive and no efforts are being made to bring them under the scheme or make them aware that they can do less strenuous work and earn the same wage that an abled person does, said former Odisha State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, Kasturi Mohapatra.She added that the entire approach towards women with disabilities in MGNREGS is a faulty one. While not many women are aware about the nature of work meant for them under MGNREGS, getting to the work site and security remain the other concern areas. Their family members cannot always accompany them to the work site, she added. The meagre number of women with disabilities, who are coming forward to work under MGNREGS, are mostly employed in plantation work during monsoon.Visibility of women with disabilities in the employment guarantee schemes is negligent in districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and some Western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Balangir and Nuapada.However, Joint Secretary in the Panchayati Raj Department, Bhumesh Behera said since MGNREGS is a demand driven programme, the department provides work to any differently-abled person including women who seek work. It always depends on their nature of disability. We have to also take into consideration that they cannot do all kinds of works, he said.Apparently, the Odisha Government does not yet have clear data on the number of women with disabilities getting 100 days' employment under the MGNREGS. The MIS (Management Information System) developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to keep a record of the workers does not include data on the number of such women taking part in the scheme, the Project Directors pointed out. Hence, it is difficult to find out if MGNREGS is actually helping women with disabilities or not, said an officer requesting anonymity.In fact, every livelihood programme being run by both Centre and State including the skill development and vocational training programmes, has no clarity or data on involvement of women with disabilities. Disability activists feel it is high time the government thinks of gender and disability audit in such schemes.In the absence of employment, women mostly depend on social security coverage. The State Government provides Rs 300 as pension to disabled people under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana but the amount is too meagre in todays time. To avail the pension, they have to produce disability certificates. Ironically, no differently-abled woman has been provided a disability certificate since 2014. According to reports of Department of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, of 5.6 lakh differently-abled women in the State, only 41,929 women have received disability certificates so far, thereby denying the rest facilities like education, employment, pension, concession and other benefits. Unlike States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, Odisha Government does not provide unemployment assistance to people with disabilities.Sanyas Behera, president of Odisha Association of Blind and a visually-challenged activist who has been demanding consideration of a differently-abled person as one separate family unit when job cards are issued under MGNREGS, said there is no clear notification yet by the Odisha Government on the nature of work that can be done by differently-abled men and women even as the Union Government had circulated an order in 2008 regarding work that can be allotted to this category of the labour force. When jobs are being issued to a household, a differently-abled person is overlooked and an abled person in the family is provided the work. Due to gender discrimination, differently-abled women are entirely left out from this scheme,"" he said.Under the Odisha Livelihood Mission, some district administrations have taken the initiative of bringing together women with disabilities and form self-help groups that can churn out things like phenyl, agarbati, jute bags and eatables. However, Sanyas alleged that the number of such SHGs is too less and funds sanctioned by the Centre for vocational training of such women are returned unutilised every year. ""Sometimes, the authorities give equipment to these SHGs to produce articles without training them properly in a bid to complete their official reports. As a result, such SHGs do not survive for a long time,"" Sanyas added."

Representatives of a consortium of 26 primary cooperatives formed by Consumerfed are currently holding negotiations with Food Corporation of India officers and rice mills in West Bengal, Surendran informed the Assembly on Tuesday.The negotiations are expected to conclude by Thursday. The consignments will arrive by March 10, he said. Consumerfed had difficulties in procuring rice from Andhra Pradesh as mill owners were reluctant to supply rice due to delay in payment in the past. The agency had run up massive dues, forcing mill owners and middlemen in Andhra Pradesh to cut off supply.The LDF Government has paid Rs 52 crore to 241 suppliers after assuming office. The ar rears now stand at Rs 157 crore and steps are being taken to clear the arrears, Surendran said. Also, the shortage in supply of Jaya and Surekha, the popular varieties in Kerala, prompted Consumerfed to knock at West Bengals doors.Even as rice prices were climbing past Rs 45 per kg, the minister informed the Assembly the hike in rice prices was a national phenomenon. In Andhra Pradesh, the prices ranged between Rs 46 and Rs 49 per kg, while in Gujarat it stood at Rs 30-34. The prices ranged between Rs 29 and Rs 32 in Uttar Pradesh. The price of Kuruva variety stood at Rs 29 to Rs 32 in Tamil Nadu and Rs 32 to Rs 36 in Andhra Pradesh, Surendran said.The price of Matta variety was between Rs 28 and Rs 33 in Karnataka, he said."

The district, which reported 32 farmer deaths in 2015-2016 kharif season, registered its first death of the year on Tuesday.One Khainu Bagarti (55) alias Hadu, who consumed pesticide in Kendpali village under Bargarh Sadar police limits on Monday night, succumbed at VIMSAR Medical on Tuesday.Irate villagers of Kendpali blocked National Highway-6 at Munigad with the body demanding compensation for kin of the deceased.The blockade, that began at 3 pm, continued till late in the evening with hundreds of heavy commercial vehicles stranded on the NH connecting Kolkata and Mumbai.Ananta Bagarti, son of Khainu, said irregular power supply and resultant failure of lift irrigation system had damaged their paddy crop cultivated over three acres of land. Although they owned a deep bore-well, they could not irrigate the crop due to frequent power failure.Water scarcity damaged their crop and having availed private loan of `40,000 for cultivation, Khainu was under severe mental stress over repayment. Finding no alternative to overcome debt burden, Khainu consumed poison, claimed Ananta.Peeved over the failure of WESCO to provide uninterrupted power supply to the village, the villagers blocked the highway demanding Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of the deceased.Bargarh Additional Tehsildar Manas Ranjan Swain and DSP Sk Mujibur Rehman rushed to the spot and tried to end the stalemate, but the villagers refused to budge from their stand. The impasse was resolved after Bargarh Sub- Collector Bhimsen Puinam Kant Ekka handed over financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to Khainus family and assured them to provide proper power supply to the village by March 5.Debt and drought have in the past forced farmers of the State, particularly Bargarh, to commit suicide. The Human Rights Commission too had taken note of the suicides and agrarian crisis that has been on the rise in the last few years.The anger of the farmers and neglect meted out to them had drawn the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had addressed a mega convention of farmers in the district while Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik too took a massive rally and announced sops for the farmers.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too had walked 7 km from Debahal to Attabira in the district and visited the bereaved family of a farmer. But nothing much has changed ever since. With yet another gruelling summer and subsequent drought knocking at the doors of farmers this year, the situation of the farmers is all set to worsen further."

5922f9377be9e01fc0070a54,Food on its own terms,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/food-on-its-own-terms/article17390696.ece,2017-03-02,"A picture, they say, is worth a hundred words. Two pictures related to Kerala, though separated by decades and differing in content, speak to us strongly of how we may secure its future. Thus, a photo in a leading Malayalam newspaper shows the Chief Minister of the State meeting the Prime Minister of India. An amiable Pinarayi Vijayan is seen extending flowers to Narendra Modi, who accepts it betraying no emotion. The power equation is astutely conveyed by the caption Ariyetra meaning How much rice in Malayalam. The Chief Minister was in the national capital in January seeking a greater allocation of rice to the State. Then there is a painting by Anjolie Ela Menon. Titled Malabar, it is a canvas smeared with green paint bearing no detail. Presumably it was the artists impression of the paddy-filled landscape of Kerala when she first encountered it decades ago. How is it possible that a State once identified by the wealth of its agriculture has been brought to the sorry state whereby its Chief Minister must travel to Delhi to ensure that his people are properly fed? It can only reflect the failure of public policy.Changed agrarian scenarioIn the early seventies, following the boom in the Arabian Gulf region, the State saw a new form of emigration. While Kerala had long witnessed the migration of the educated for want of opportunities domestically, for the first time there was a significant outflow of manual labour, some of it from agriculture. While it was only the men who migrated, the higher incomes transformed the households socially, and the women too withdrew from the labour market. This hit paddy cultivation most as, in an age-old sexual division of labour, women were disproportionately represented in the planting and harvesting of paddy. The sector began to face severe labour shortage. Naturally, the wage rose and the cultivation of paddy was no longer viable as cheaper rice came in from the rest of India.The rise in the wage may not have had the impact it did if the ownership of land was vested with the tiller. The temptations of migration overseas may have been held at bay had the tiller also owned the land. But the latter was not the case despite the much-vaunted land reforms of the State. In abolishing tenancy the land reforms had extinguished the traditional landlords but did not inevitably transfer land to those who actually laboured on the field. This is reflected in the current agitation for land by the Adivasi community.Stunted land reformsKerala is rare among the worlds economies, barring Zimbabwe, where agricultural production actually declined after land reforms. Land reforms in China after Mao led to a surge in food production, which in turn led to its rise to global prominence. In theory, one form of reorganisation possible even at this stage in Kerala is for those in ownership of land but not wishing to cultivate to lease it out. But leasing was made unlawful by the land reform Act.At the time of its legislation, tenancy had been a symbol of the exploitation of the peasantry who were held down by the possibility of eviction at will. But now, close to half a century later, when the economic position of owners of small parcels of land pales beside the owners of urban property in the State, to hold on to an archaic law for its symbolic value is mere sentimentality. It is unimaginative of a public policy to not remove all barriers to the leasing of land so that smaller portions can be pooled to form larger operational holdings and paddy production becomes viable again. It is interesting that the law discourages tenancy as unlawful but is sanguine about the alienation of agricultural land to other purposes. Actually, there is legislation meant to address this but its implementation is hostage to party politics at the village level, and the alienation of Keralas precious agricultural land continues.It is quite extraordinary that public policy in Kerala has not addressed the problem of a declining production of its staple food, a trend in evidence for nearly half a century by now. At the time of Mr. Vijayans trip to Delhi, an editorial in another leading Malayalam daily reported that the State produced only one-eighth of its consumption requirement. This figure needs to be vetted, but surely the situation may be judged to be critical if a region were unable to produce even half of it?A leaf out of Delhis bookAn obvious question emerging from the Chief Ministers much-publicised visit to Delhi is why Kerala cannot jettison its dependent status. At least here Keralas political leadership may take a leaf out of the record of the Central government. In the mid-sixties, smarting under Lyndon Johnsons directive that food be sent to India by the shipload so that she may be kept on a short leash, Indira Gandhi moved frenetically to increase food production in India. The Green Revolution followed and, despite its negative ecological fallout, India has never looked back. Earlier Nehru had cautioned his fellow citizens how India could not live permanently on handouts from the rich countries and needed to grow her own food. There is a lesson in this for those in charge of public policy in Kerala.If the State is to remain an autonomous entity, it must reduce all forms of one-way dependence, even vis--vis the Indian Union. A far firmer base of food production would be one aspect of this. In a world of creeping climate change, the global supply of food is set to shrink.There is a factor other than the legal architecture discouraging the leasing of land that works against agricultural prosperity. This is the natural environment, which in Kerala today is less hospitable to agriculture of any kind, let alone paddy cultivation. This has come about due to the depletion of groundwater and sand mining of the riverbeds to provide material for luxury house construction. There has also been the alienation of agricultural land already referred to. Land need not be turned into real estate to lose its fertility. Using fallow paddy fields as exhibition grounds or for shopping festivals, even when the structures made are temporary, could degrade the land permanently. Kerala needs a land use policy that conserves every bit of its natural capital. As part of this, the State could consider acquiring all unused paddy land and making it available to the Adivasis on long-term lease. This would ensure its preservation, saving Kerala from the hardship that is assured if the present situation of more plastic than grain clogging the rice paddies continues.Kerala needs a new politics if its economy is to adjust to the emerging scenario of rising food prices and a shrinking Gulf economy which is sure to impact livelihoods. Public policy is likely to adapt only if political parties are pressurised by a citizenry alerted to the limits to distributivism. An instance of how this can work is the return of paddy cultivation to vast tracts of the Aranmula Puncha, an iconic agricultural landscape in central Kerala, after citizen action prevented its diversion to build an airport. The regeneration has been made possible by active support from the government machinery. When such synergy is replicated across the State, its future Chief Ministers need not travel to Delhi seeking food.Pulapre Balakrishnan is Professor of Economics, Ashoka University, Sonipat and Senior Fellow, Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode"

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

590471017be9e04154df6c93,Nothing rogue about this Khmer cuisine!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/nothing-rogue-about-this-khmer-cuisine/,2017-03-06,"The setting is surreal. Deep in the heart of the Cambodian jungle at a temple called Banteay Samre, we are sitting for dinner against a backdrop of lush canopy and temple silhouettes. Thousands of diyas and fairy lights illuminate the pathways and doorways, throwing into relief beautiful sculptures adorning the temple walls. The mood is serene and the ambiance gentle as we feast on delicacies from the Land of Khmer Kampuchea under an expansive night sky dotted with millions of stars.The H and I are in Cambodia to celebrate the wedding anniversary of one of our friends and this dinner, set amidst historic ruins, is the highlight of the celebrations. It is exotic and phantasmagorical: the clink of cutlery mingles with the sound of the anklets of Apsara dancers as they weave among the tables, performing the ritualistic movements that perfectly complement the mystical atmosphere in the temple.However, Cambodia is not just about temples or its well documented bloody history during the infamous Khmer Rouge days. It goes beyond the heritage ruins of the world-famous Angkor Wat and the serenity of its people. The countrys food culture, while not on the world map, is a rich amalgamation of French and Chinese cuisine as well as that of its neighbors Thailand and Vietnam. In the Khmer diet, rice and freshwater fish play big roles because of the abundance of both in the country. Other culinary traditions include regional must-haves such as fish sauce, palm sugar, lime, coconut milk, lemon grass, galangal, kaffir lime and shallots.So here we are, sitting down to eat a five-course meal showcasing the finest elements of Khmer food. The exquisite plating using jute, banana leaves and locally crafted rustic crockery adds to the aesthetic appeal of the dishes. We begin our meal with a water lily and tofu salad served in a pineapple boat. Between courses, the palate cleanser is a basil seeds and coconut milk shake poured into a traditional bowl and plate, with an ice carving propping up the arrangement.And the main course is a popular Cambodian dish called Amok. Amok is a national dish made from fish, coconut milk and curry paste. Amok refers to the process of steam cooking a curry in banana leaves using thick coconut cream and galangal as the main ingredients. While the meat eaters are given a choice of fish amok or chicken amok served ingenuously in coconut shells, the vegetarians are served steamed cauliflower amok.Accompanying the amok is another Cambodian dish called Lok Lak. This is a traditional Khmer dish, which is basically stir-fried beef in a light brown sauce, served with fragrant jasmine rice and pepper sauce. The vegetarian option is pan-fried tofu with a chilli garlic sauce. And of course, perched on the matted jute plate are the ubiquitous green vegetable curry and stir fried vegetables as accompaniments. The end of the meal is signaled by a dessert symphony: a coconut ice cream tiramisu flanked by local fruits such as rambutan, watermelon and mango.But the cuisine of Cambodia goes beyond curries and rice and fish. For the faint-hearted, the site of some of the foods on sale at the Old Market in Siem Reap could lead to an esophageal eruption to rival the Old Faithful geyser. As I am wandering the French Quarter with my friends, we notice a man with a bicycle stall selling (warning: do not read ahead if you have just had a meal!) beetles, spiders, crickets and fried scorpions. Forget about snakes on a plane! He is merrily waving snakes-on-a-stick and urging us to try any of the deleeecacieesh for a dalla. As my friends and I stop to see him swallow a beetle and a spider, he beckons us over and holds out a few black bugs. One of our more adventurous friends tosses a cricket into the air and opens his mouth wide to swallow it whole. Tastes like barbeque, he says with a grin, completely unfazed by what has just popped into his mouth. The bicycle man then turns to me and hands me a small black cricket. Put een gullee, he encourages, pointing vigorously at his throat. I look at the insect, swear it is writhing and with a grimace toss it back on the cart.As I scurry off to the sound of my friends chortling, I am thinking that the only gully-cricket in my lexicon is the one which has a bat and ball attached to it!"

Chhoti jaat ke logon ke liye karma Mahabrahmin he karte hain (only a Mahabrahmin performs the rituals for the Dalits), says Das.For upper caste Hindus, a purohit  a superior Brahmin  can perform the rituals. But for the Dalits, only a Mahabrahmin can perform the rites.Mr. Sharma, a Mahabrahmin, points to a set of miniature temple-like structures, or pitra sthana (a place for ancestors). ""This is where the Dalits build their pitra sthanas, says the priest.Farther away, there is another set of pitra sthanas. ""Those belong to the upper caste Hindus,"" he says.Status of priestsSuch is the extent of marginalisation of the Dalits that the association of the Mahabrahmins with the Dalits has earned the priests a lower status in their own Brahmin community. The Mahabrahmins function at the temple with the permission of the head priest.Ashok Nath Bhardwaj, an office-bearer at the Ganga Ram Samaj  an association of Mahabrahmins in Haridwar  said: ""The taboo associated with the Dalits is so intense that it affects us too. We perform rituals for the Dalits, so we too are treated as Dalits by other Brahmins They [other Brahmins] perform prayers for the upper caste Hindus, so they are superior, but we perform rituals for the Dalits, so we are inferior.Question of equalityThe segregation, however, goes challenged. Rajendra Ghagat, a Dalit from Haridwars Valmiki community, said: ""The practice [within the temple] is so old it has gained acceptance in the name of tradition... but, there should be equality within the temple.""For now, it seems that a person's caste will follow them into their afterlife."

In September 2016, Express had reported that SayTrees had used the same technique to plant 2,000 saplings near K R Puram Railway station. This is the second time SayTrees has used this technique and also happens to be the highest number of saplings they have planted in a day.The 2,000 saplings planted earlier have recorded a stunning growth rate, according to Durgesh Agrahari, head of partnerships and projects at SayTrees Environmental Trust. He said, We were amazed to see that in five months the saplings had grown from 2-3 feet to 6-8 feet. The trees are being maintained by the trust and only treated sewage water is used to water them. In addition, such forests become self-sustainable in two years, as opposed to the six years it takes for naturally grown forests.Saplings of 48 species of trees were planted, including neem, banyan, peepal, jamun, mango, guava, sandalwood and gooseberry. The soil was tested and a microclimate was created by mixing it with rice husk, coconut powder and manure.SayTrees conducts several tree-planting initiatives during the monsoon across the country. In 2016, they planted a total of 35,000 saplings between June and September, of which 17,304 were in Bengaluru itself. The trust has finalised a plan to plant 50,000 saplings at Chintamani in Kolar district around July. The saplings for this initiative are being raised. A consulting firm, Afforestt, is making the Miyawaki technique popular in the country."

But it appears this has not stopped him from announcing populist programmes aimed at wooing both rural masses and the urban poor. He, however, belied the hopes of farmers as well as opposition parties on their demand to waive farm loans.He has also not announced any major infrastructure project, especially for Bengaluru.In his last full-fledged budget before Karnataka goes to polls in 2018, the chief minister has made it a point to continue to please the Ahinda community (Kannada acronym for backward classes, Dalits and minorities), considered to be his major vote bank.The total subsidy burden on the government in this budget goes up by Rs 6,000 crore, which is about 33% more than the current financial year.Siddaramaiah appears to have taken a cue from various states to unveil populist schemes: Saviruchi canteens from the Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu, free water supply and waiver of power bills from Delhi and free LPG connections from the Centre which became a big hit in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, he has increased the quantum of rice under his pet Anna Bhagya scheme to 7 kg from 5 kg per beneficiary and decided to give milk to government school students on five days a week instead of three days. Siddaramaiah brought cheer among moviegoers by announcing a cap of Rs 200 on entry ticket to all multiplexes. The chief minister has also proposed making it mandatory for all cinemas to screen Kannada and regional language movies during prime time.The CM has tried to appease over six lakh state government employees by setting up the seventh pay commission. He has also tried to please employees in the private sector by proposing to increase their retirement age to 60 from 58.Siddaramaiah also announced the formation of 49 new taluks. Though he has not imposed any major taxes keeping the 2018 election in view, he has proposed hiking the additional excise duty on Indian Made Foreign Liquor. This will make liquor dearer.High-end two-wheelers will also cost more with the motor vehicle tax being hiked.The additional resource mobilisation due to these two levies is estimated to fetch the state exchequer Rs 1,060 crore. The chief minister has set a moderate revenue target in the coming financial year in anticipation of the implementation of Goods and Services Tax.No farm loan waiverFinancial constraints, including a shortfall in state resources by Rs 1,624 crore, is said to have restrained Siddaramaiah from announcing a farm loan waiver.In his effort to present a please-all budget, with a total outlay of Rs 1,86,561 crore, Siddaramaiah has brought down revenue surplus position to an alarming Rs 136 crore. This has, in turn, taken a toll on capital expenditure, which is crucial for infrastructure development. Namma canteens will be launched in each of the 198 wards of BBMP where breakfast (Rs 5), lunch and dinner (Rs 10) will be provided.The chief minister has allocated Rs 100 crore for this scheme. At the district level, Saviruchi mobile canteens will be set up through zilla stree shakti okkutas.Subsidy of Rs 1,600 for LPG connections to five lakh eligible poor families not selected under the Centres Ujjwala scheme, free water supply up to 10,000 litres per month for slum dwellers living in 20x30 sites and waiving their pending bills are some of the other sops on the anvil."

The next one is expected to be a vote-on-account.He announced the setting up of Saviruchi mobile canteens in all 30 districts through the Stree Shakti self help groups, a mid-day meal scheme for 12 lakh pregnant women, milk supply to the over a crore school and anganwadi children five days a week and eggs to the malnutrition-hit anganwadi children twice a week.""Darkness will not cast on the future of the land where women and children are the focus of development.This is a simple truth which I have found out by experience,"" he said. There was much thumping among the treasury benches for the proposed laptops for 1.5 lakh students entering government and aided medical, engineering and degree colleges, but the loudest cheers were reserved for the announcement of 49 new taluk, welcomed with celebrations across the state.Siddaramaiah, however, did not announce the much-anticipated loan waiver for the drought-hit farmers, though he gave in to the demand to increase free rice under the flagship Anna Bhagya scheme from 5 to 7 kgs.""Let Yeddyurappa (state BJP chief) and Jagadish Shettar (opposition leader) fight for the state's rights at the Centre. I asked the PM (Narendra Modi) to waive 50% of commercial bank loans and said I would match it in cooperative loans.If they can waive farmers loans in Uttar Pradesh, why can't they do it here?"" he asked, in a combative post-budget press conference.He came down harshly on the PM's demonetisation drive. ""Any public policy, apart from the purpose of achieving the intended target, should also be very efficient in its execution.Demonetisation caused huge amount of distress to the public but the Union Government is yet to disclose what outcome has been achieved by it.""Siddaramaiah, who had earlier stated that black money constituted hardly 0.002% of the country's economy, said: ""While the need for demonetisation itself is debatable, I think that the Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India could have at least foreseen the exigencies and could have put in practical and robust systems in place to insulate the common man from these hardships.""He announced policies in line with the Centre's decision to implement the GST and do away with the distinction between plan and non-plan expenditure."

The chefs special biriyani arrives with a heap of golden onion ringlets on top of it and a tempting aroma starts wafting in the air.Its prepared with an extra hint of nutmeg and special masalas. Hence the unique scent, says chef Micheal of Hotel Keys, Housing Board Junction, where they are having a biriyani promotion till March end.We have introduced a mix of totally authentic biriyanis along with a couple of innovative ones. We use our own recipe for the house specials, he adds.Its one dish that has undergone umpteen makeovers, tasting different from place to place. Chef says its the quality of rice and the perfection in dum that basically defines the biriyani.In Kerala we like kaima rice, but there are people who insist on using basmati. Authentic Malabari biriyani is made with kaima only, but when it comes to North Indian biriyanis we go for the long and slender basmati. In our menu we have tried to focus more on South varieties using fried meat, he says.If you want to experiment with something other than the regular yellow biriyani, opt for the Nilgiri version. This one comes with a green tint, the result of a mint, coriander and palak blend. Its one biriyani totally different from what you have tasted so far. Each leaf used has its own unique flavour and the meat and rice gets covered in that green masala, explains the chef.If you are a seafood lover, give fish a miss this time. No, we are not referring to the yummy prawn biriyani but another signature dish - the spicy squid biriyani.Malayalis like hot and spicy food. Normally, the spice level in biriyani is moderate. But in squid biriyani its on the higher side. You can see how hot and flavourful it is by just looking at it, says the chef pointing to the slightly red dish.The menu has all the regular chicken, beef and veg variants as well and each biriyani is accompanied by a sweet mango-and-pineapple chutney, onion raita and pappad. Sometimes we serve slightly customised biriyanis taking into account what the customer likes, adds the chef.

This is more so where the traditional lifestyle associated with an agro-economy has remained unchanged. In Mysuru city, sparrows can still be found in places such as Santhepet, Nanjumalige, around Devaraja Market, and Agrahara besides in Bandipalya apart from the city outskirts in Bogadi, Yelwal, Hinkal, and Alanahalli where sparrows are quite common, according to Tanuja, an amateur ornithologist and an eco-educationist.Though these birds are still not considered endangered, they have become locally extinct in urban areas across India due to change in lifestyle and the emergence of modern architecture, she said.Sparrows thrive in areas where they find grain and in olden days sifting grain was a common activity in every household. Besides, the husk and the spill over rice used to be left behind for the sparrows to feed on and the sparrows had developed a commensal relationship with human habitations.But the growing preference for cleaned, polished and packed rice over the years obviated the need for de-husking and sifting and hence a major source of food supply to sparrows gradually declined, forcing them to retreat to more favourable areas. Hence they are found only where the traditional lifestyle has not changed, said Ms. Tanuja.Hence, large flocks of the adorable sparrows can also be sighted in the hinterland of H.D. Kote, Periyapatna, K.R. Nagar and so on with semi-urban characteristics. While their foraging habits hinged on human activity, shelter was also closely knit with the traditional architectural style like tiled roof with ample space between the wall and the roof separated by wooden beams.The emergence of modular architecture with its emphasis on use of glass, RCC and skylights for ventilation rung the death knell for the sparrows in urban areas, according to D. Rajkumar of Wildlife Conservation Foundation. Unlike pigeons, sparrows are short distance flyers and hence their survival hinges on availability of food and shelter.There are many places in Mysuru where people keep bird boxes at vantage points with adequate feed and water. But more than sparrows they tend to attract other species of birds, said Ms. Tanuja, which reinforce the decline of sparrows in urban areas."

The group keeps a record schedule in which students and other professionals come to help the farmers on a shift basis.Though the farmers still have not received any written assurance from the central government but somehow they are getting support and day to day help from the Delhi Tamil community.Hundreds of students from different university, working people, housewives, business persons and few Tamil actors such as Abhi Saravanan come together to support the farmers by raising fund, providing food, tablets, money daily needs of farmers.The farmers give food to us and I cant see them as beggars now, will not let them beg on the streets of Delhi.

The labourers and their families demonstrated in the Dooars garden, alleging that there were differences in the samples of rice shown to them and the actual stock provided to them. There had been complaints from a number of tea estates over the quality of rice. This is, however, the first time that the workers and their families resorted to demonstration and refused the rice from the ration shop on a tea estate. Bhagatpur Tea Estate has a total of 1,735 workers. Today, family members of the workers reached the ration shop run by Ramesh Sharma to take the rice provided under the state's Khadyasathi scheme - an extension of the National Food Security Scheme of the Centre. They found that mites and insects were crawling out of rice sacks. ""There were different types of mites in the rice. A foul smell was emanating from the sacks as they were opened and the rice weighed,"" Tanuja Majhi, a woman worker, said. As the labourers found that the rice was of inferior quality, they became agitated and demonstrated in the garden for around three hours. None of them took the rice from the shop and returned with empty bags. The workers have threatened to launch a movement if they are not provided with proper quality rice. Under the scheme, each tea garden worker's family is provided with 35kg rice a month at 45 paisa per kg. In Bhagatpur, the workers said they were provided with the entire quota of 35kg in two installments, that is, once in a fortnight. The ration dealer in the garden said he was just authorised to distribute rice. ""Rice is supplied from government godowns. We have nothing to say about it. We only distribute it among workers. I am in no position to comment on the quality,"" Sharma said. The protest has made the garden management react. Shyam Sundar Saha, a garden management representative, said: ""We will inform the district food and supplies department in writing about the issue. It is true that the workers did not take the rice today."" Tea garden trade union leaders have criticised the state government for the poor quality of rice. ""We have received a number of complaints in this regard. The state ministers, including the chief minister, had elaborately talked about inclusion of tea garden workers and their families in the rice distribution scheme. But now, things have become miserable for these people as they are being supplied with inferior quality of rice which none can consume,"" Ramlal Murmu, the vice-president of Citu-backed Cha Bagan Mazdoor Union, said. Mani Kumar Darnal, the joint general secretary of the National Union of Plantation Workers that is affiliated to Intuc, said: ""We have time and again informed officials of the food and supplies department about the inferior quality of the rice. But nothing has changed so far.

Both the leaders said if such complaints kept on coming, they would launch a movement. Officials of the district food and supplies department here said they were looking into the issue.

After all, India is pre-dominantly an agrarian society, and festivals associated with farming culture are many.Anita Shetye from Porvorim says: ""Gudhi Padawa is one of the most auspicious of occasions. It is not only a religious festival, but marks the commencement of spring. Neem leaves, a mango leaves and a garland of red flowers are tied to the tip of a long bamboo on which a copper pot is placed in the inverted position.""Some even tie a coconut on the threshold of their homes to protect to members of the family from evil spirits.There are also a number of traditions that deviate from the ordinary associated with the observance, of which shisharanni of Asali and Vaizawadi in Canacona is one that stands out.In this, rice is cooked in an earthen pot on a traditional three-stone fire stove, only here three heads substitute the stones! Shisharanni is held once every three years.Then there is the dinya zatra that is celebrated by unmarried tribal Velip youth. They dance around the Mallikarjun temple holding a staff fashion out of the dina (Leea indica) plant. In the community, participation in the dance is mandatory.There is also the bathing of the symbolic representation of the clan's ancestor, locally known as 'purush', which is followed in many parts of the state.Food is an important aspect of this festival too, and Shreya Kelkar of Latambarcem in Bicholim says, ""According to beliefs, whatever you prepare and eat on this day will set the tone for the upcoming year's culinary fare, which is why all Hindu families prepare a delicious spread.""Post the feasting, in some parts of Goa there is a custom of reading the annual almanac (panchang) in the evening. The villagers gather in the temple hall where the village priest reads out predictions related to the weather, eclipses, and shares information on auspicious times (muhurta)."

However, in Vaizawado of Shristhal, this ritual is observed on the occasion of Dinya zatra , while at the Mallikarjun temples of Goa's southernmost taluka, it is a part of the Shigmo festival.""Vaizawado's Dinya zatra is unique. The celebration involves the welcoming of the new year with folk dances and rituals in the most traditional etiquettes and behavioural patterns,"" says Devidas Gaonkar, a tribal researcher from Cotigao.The Vaizawado Velips along with the Mhala, Asalkar and Gulekar Velips are predominantly a tribal community that follow the agrarian way of life. They are devotees of the Mallikarjun temple of Shristhal.Prior to the festivities, the doors of every house in the hamlet are thrown open in welcome and guests are served a traditional vegetarian fare.For the celebration, young bachelors of the community worship a decorated stick of the Leea indica shrub, which is locally referred to as 'dinya' or 'jinea', thus explaining the etymology of the name 'Dinya zatra'. The stick is adorned with the 'husgi' (Calycopteris floribunda) flowers and tender leaves of the 'kosamb' (Schleichera oleosa) tree. The leaves and flowers are secured in place with the fibres of 'kevan' (Helicteres isora). Later the youth performs a dance in from of the shrine of Gharvai puris holding this stick in their hands. The music is played on the traditional instruments of 'dhol', 'taso' and 'zanghat'.After this, the group proceeds in procession to traditionally predesignated places to perform the dance. A type of local-martial-arts-cum-dance performance is also put up to the tune of folk music. In this, three people brandish wooden swords around their body as a symbolic depiction of their bravery. After repeating the act several times, the entire group moves to the site where the Shisharanni ritual is held.In the entire celebration, female participation is focused on pre-pubescent girls, who are supposed to light a 'divja' (lamp) made from cow dung and decorated with clam shells.At the site, which is a field, all the decorated sticks are driven into the ground and the Shisharanni ritual then follows.""Three men lie on the ground with their heads touching each other. An earthen pot with rice and water is balanced between their heads and a fire is lit beneath the pot. Once the rice is cooked, it is sprinkled in different directions by the villagers,"" says Milind Velip of Vaizawado.Folk researcher Pandurang Phaldesai explains that the ritualistic festival of Shisharanni is to recall the genocide of a Brahmin agriculture community, the Habbus, hundreds of years ago. ""The tradition may have been started in order to appease the spirits of those killed,"" he says."

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. This chicken tinga taco's filling has shredded chicken, slow roasted tomato salsa and chipotle chillies. These blazing hot chillies turn the predictable tacos into loaded, sizzling time bombs. Chipotle chillies are imported from Mexico. Since they come as dry chillies, they are first reconstituted to make a sauce, which is used in this spicy taco.Here's something for the vegetarians. This starter is a Vietnamese speciality of potatoes tossed with herbs and hot Sriracha chilli sauce. Sriracha chillies come from the coastal city of Si Racha, in Chonburi Province of eastern Thailand .

593aebc37be9e00e1ecd4969,Strain on 'buffalo power',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170403/jsp/nation/story_144240.jsp,2017-04-03,"INDIAN EXPORT SHRINKS, PAK SMELLS CHANCE Beef exporters like Priya Sud have started to chicken as meat shops were targeted in Uttar Pradesh in the past week after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to crack down on illegal abattoirs. ""There is unease within the industry... our local supplies have been cut off. Our importers want to know what is happening in this country,"" says Sud, a partner at Al-Noor Exports that prides itself as one of the oldest and largest exporters of frozen buffalo meat in the world. India accounts for nearly 56 per cent of the world's buffalo population and racked up exports worth Rs 26,685.44 crore in 2015-16. Exports of carabeef - the meat of the water buffalo - were 17.5 per cent higher than basmati rice exports of Rs 22,718.44 crore. In the first nine months of this year (April-December), carabeef exports topped Rs 20,000 crore, around 1.4 per cent of overall exports from the country. Uttar Pradesh is the epicentre of the country's $4-billion meat export business with 43 of the 79 central government-approved abattoir-cum-meat processing plants located in the most populous state, churning out nearly half of India-labelled meat sold abroad and a fifth of all meat produced in the country. The state has over 300 registered slaughterhouses and 41 export-oriented meat processing plants run by some of the top meat exporters in the country, including Allanasons, HMA, M.K. Overseas, AOV Exports, Al Kabeer, Mirha Exports and the Al-Noor Group. Despite their Arabic-sounding names, many of these companies are owned and operated by Hindus. A sense of fear hovers in the air and everyone involved in the meat business - farmers who rear cattle, middlemen, factory owners and transporters - is uncertain about the future of the industry itself as hotheads scout for targets and the state government comes under pressure to come good on its poll promise to close down the abattoirs. Sources say nine of the 41 export-oriented meat processing plants in Uttar Pradesh have closed down since the new government came to power in the state. The others are operating at barely 10 to 15 per cent of their capacity. The campaign against meat consumption has resonated in other areas with Gujarat tightening its law on Friday by prescribing life imprisonment for those found guilty of slaughtering cows, calves, bulls and bullocks. Although buffalo meat processing is not covered by the legislation, meat factory owners live in fear that they could become soft targets as rabid rhetoric finds violent expression in the northern parts of the country. Already, the Shiv Sena has enforced a ban on meat and fish consumption in Gurgaon, one of north India's largest industrial hubs and home to several technology and financial services giants. ""The crackdown on the meat retailers and the closure of several small units have forced exporters to adopt a wait-and-watch attitude. Nobody is taking fresh orders and many are weighing the option of shifting their units to other states like Punjab,"" said S.P. Sabharwal, secretary-general of the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters' Association. Punjab is emerging as a new centre for the meat trade after Uttar Pradesh and the Andhra-Telangana region. While India's largest meat exporter, the Cdr Satish Subberwal-run Al-Kabeer, is located in Medak in Telangana, Punjab's Derrabassi in Mohali district is fast turning into a new centre for meat processing with the earlier Akali government and the current Congress one supportive of the meat business. Most of Punjab's modern abattoirs are processing buffalo meat but the government is working on a pig meat processing plant with an eye on the market for pork, both within the country and abroad. ""India's Hindi-speaking, north Indian cattle belt is also the country's buffalo belt as well as sheep and goat belt, which is why most of the large, modern factories exporting meat are located in Uttar Pradesh, with a spillover in Haryana and Punjab. ""Direct cargo flights from Delhi to West Asia, which is an important market for us, is another reason why the meat processing industry is located here,"" said Vishal Johri, a merchant banker who advises exporters. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, along with Andhra and Telangana, have the largest livestock population in the country. The antipathy towards meat consumption in the north has coincided with the electoral fortunes of the BJP, sparking fears of a backlash against those who resist attempts to force people to adopt a lifestyle that doesn't offend Hindu sensibilities. ""The current mahol (atmosphere) against meat-eating is strange because 71 per cent of Indians are non-vegetarians,"" says Hafiz Mohammed Sahid, a Delhi-based meat trader and exporter, quoting a 2014 census of food habits in the country carried out by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner. Data show that Telangana has the highest number of non-vegetarians at almost 99 per cent, followed closely by Bengal (98.55 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (98.25 per cent), Odisha (97.35 per cent) and Kerala (97 per cent). But the rise of Hindu extremism has coincided with the gradual decline in meat exports and the fortunes of the industry as a whole. Meat exports have fallen by 15 per cent from $4.78 billion in 2014-15 to $4.07 billion in 2015-16. Data sourced from the Registrar of Companies show that the turnover of Al-Kabeer Exports declined to Rs 469.75 crore from Rs 761.76 crore in the previous year, largely the result of a decline in exports to Vietnam and Egypt. Net profits of the company also shrank. Indian buffalo meat is preferred because of its competitive cost. It is especially sought after in West Asia and regions with a high Muslim population since many factories use the halal or kosher techniques in their slaughterhouses, which religious Muslims and Jews prefer. While India accounts for 12 per cent of all halal or kosher meat exports worldwide, its next-door neighbour Pakistan accounts for 8 per cent. In the West Asian market, the two are keen rivals. ""Pakistan has always been our rival in the Middle East, but India has wider acceptance globally as a source of hygienically processed, quality meat,"" said Johri. However, Pakistan has been working to increase its livestock to compete. Between 1996 and 2006, it has managed to increase its buffalo population from 20.3 million to 27.3 million. India, of course, remains the bigger ""buffalo power"" with some 108 million buffaloes, up from 83 million in 1992. ""The so-called 'pink revolution' of meat processing and exports has been possible because of our ever-expanding livestock population, which again is a result of our white revolution. If we reduce our exports, competitors like Pakistan and Brazil will weigh in; that's natural,"" Johri said. Older buffaloes, which stop yielding milk, and male buffaloes are the ones that are sold to slaughterhouses as farmers primarily rear cattle, buffaloes as well as goats for milk in India. ""The meat industry is the byproduct of the dairy business. If there is a threat to the meat industry, the dairy trade will also collapse and farmers will be the biggest losers. India is at the top in the dairy business because it tops in meat production,"" said Fauzan Alavi of Allana Group. Alavi, who is also the general secretary of the All India Meat & Live Exporters' Association, said licenced slaughterhouses or export-oriented units have to comply with at least 21 permissions, both from the Centre and the state, to operate and that the government should not ignore the importance of the sector. The meat factories in Uttar Pradesh provide direct jobs to around 5 lakh people. If one plant closes down in the state, 1,500 jobs are at risk. Sources say the government has clarified that it is not against legal slaughterhouses but the word has yet to percolate down to lower-level officers. So, several plants have been shut on flimsy grounds. ""If some minor lacuna is found, the government should give the industry some time to resolve the matter,"" Alavi said."

Except for vegetables, no produce is arriving at the APMC yard. Similarly, transportation of vegetables from the yard to neighbouring states is unhindered.Supply of tur dal from Kalaburagi, Bidar and Gujarat, bengal gram from Madhya Pradesh, and rice from Raichur, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal has been stopped. In the same way, the transportation of horse gram from the yard to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other states has been stalled. There is no change in the supply of water, medicines, milk and vegetables. However, over 1,500 trucks have been parked at various places, including the truck terminal at Bandipalya, Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed and at the Old RMC yard.According to sources, the truck owners have refused to lift cement and fertilisers from the Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed, 230 loads each, which have arrived by goods trains on Saturday. Goods Shed Lorry Owners Association president Abdul Khader Sahid said, they have received requests to lift the loads, but the association has clarified that the loads cannot be lifted until the demands of reduction of insurance premium and RTO fees are fulfilled.Sources said, the supply of gas (LPG) will not be affected in the city. LPG is supplied to the city from Mangaluru through pipelines. So, the truck protest will not have any effect on the LPG supply, said the sources. However, Petroleum Distributors Association S K Dinesh said, the association is morally supporting the protest. If the governments do not fulfil the demands, petroleum tankers will also join the protest, he said.In-charge Deputy Director for Food and Civil Supplies C L Anand said, the stocks of provisions, slated for distribution in fair price shops to ration card holders, is sufficient for April month quota. The public distribution system of the department will not be affected by the strike, he said.The district administration is learnt to have made arrangements to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against the lorry owners and is awaiting the State governments directions, if the people are inconvenienced."

But officials of the district administration went to all the schools and anganwadi centres. In many schools, it was found that firewood is still being used as there is no LPG connection. Also, self-help groups are cooking food in many of the schools. We have decided to pursue the matter so that each such group gets an LPG connection in its name. It is also safe to use LPG,"" the district magistrate said. Ulganathan also instructed the authorities to put up a menu chart so that students and their guardians know about the food to be served on that day. In Cooch Behar, there are 3,223 schools, ranging from primary to higher secondary, including Madhyamik Siksha Kendras and Sishu Siksha Kendras. There are another 4,000 anganwadi centres. ""There were complaints about the quality of food served in these places. That it why it was decided that the administration would send officials to all these institutions,"" an official said. During the visits, the district magistrate went into the kitchens of all the schools. As he reached Kaljani Sahajuddin High School, he himself took the task of cooking chicken for the students. The cooks, teachers and students were visibly surprised and simultaneously elated to find Ulganathan preparing chicken for them. "" Chicken badia bana hain. Line pe lag jao (The chicken has been cooked nicely. Stand in queue),"" he was heard telling the students, as they curiously stood outside and peeped into the kitchen to see Ulganathan using the ""khunti"" (peg) with deft move. At Khagrabari Harendrachandra Vidyamandir, where today's menu was rice, egg curry and fried papad, Ulganathan walked up to the place where members of the self-help group were serving the students. He took the ladle and started serving them in helpings. ""DM saheb khete dilen. Jiggesh korlen khete kono osubidha hoy ki na. Darun laglo (the DM himself served me food. He asked me if I faced any problem in having food at the school. It was an amazing experience),"" said Shibani Das, a Class IV student. Ulganathan said he enjoyed the visit. ""It was nice seeing the children having food. We found most of the kitchens clean. The quality of food was also good. Nevertheless, we have asked all the school authorities to keep a steady watch. It was a different experience cooking and serving the children,"" he said."

We take Rs 10 as money for support (sahyog rashi). The entire cost to run the canteen is borne by Gorakhnath Temple, said Akhilesh Chowdhary, who has been looking after the canteen for the last three years.The Annapurna thali at Gorakhnath Hospital canteen has two chapaatis, pulses, 150 gram rice and two seasonal vegetables. (HT Photo)The canteen was set up for patients and their attendants visiting the hospital but it soon became popular with the poor, especially the labour class, who do not have the resources to buy costly food.Akhilesh said the food was cooked according to the tradition of the Nath sect and ingredients like garlic and onion were not used.Yogi Adityanath is of the view that low cost quality food should be the right of the poor. Before moving to Lucknow, he himself used to inspect the quality of food and took stock of cleanliness on a regular basis. He felt satisfaction by offering quality food to the needy, he said.Mithilesh Kumar, a rickshaw-puller said, Such facilities are a boon for us. Earlier, I used to pass my day on tea and samosa only and that too cost me Rs 20-30. I have been coming here for the last three years as I get good food for Rs 10 only.MD, Gorakhnath Hospital, Dr Mayank said the food provided at the canteen was nutritious and healthy."

Cooking is more than just putting together a few ingredients in a pan and stirring. Cooking is about taking whatever ingredients are available at that moment and create something totally new and inspirational.I was 19 years old when I began my culinary journey. I started my career with European Cuisine and continued to follow that passion for 3 years before switching to Indian cuisine. India is a culturally diverse country where you can find many traditions and many distinctive ingredients are available at every region of the country, yet exclusive to the rest of the world.Over a year ago, I went on a fishing expedition along the shores of Alibaug, Mumbai. Initially, it didnt go as well as I thought it would and I was a little upset that I couldnt catch any fish.So there I was, walking along the shore pondering over my inability to get a good catch when I noticed a local tribe group burning wood, or at least thats what I thought.. Upon nearing them I was astonished to find out that they were cooking POPTI in an enclosed Matka!Popti is essentially a smoked chicken dish that epitomizes bold and strong flavours. It is slow-cooked for a long period of time and then enriched with flavourful of spices and juices thereby giving the dish a unique rustic taste and feel.The meal was cooked for around 4 hours and served with a flourish as the matka was broken before the food was consumed. What you decide to eat this smoked chicken dish with depends on the taste of the individual and sometimes, the local tribes add rice along with the chicken in the matka and cook the meal.In this particular incident, the Popti, was prepared in an earthenware pot or the mud-pot (matka). The pot was first layered with leaves and then filled with marinated chicken before it was sealed and placed on the fire. This simplistic method of cooking the dish is what I found most interesting as it was very minimalistic and showcased a nutritious way of preparing food.I was inspired by this traditional way of cooking and was anxiously waiting to prepare the delicacy myself. After returning from the expedition, I shared my thoughts with my colleagues and started to re-create the delicacy using international herbs.I used the same earthenware and the same method but with a twist. I spiced-it up with many international herbs such as thyme, rosemary, basil and parsley to enhance the texture, fragrance and flavour of the chicken as well as the juices along with it. Authentically, the technique used to prepare Popti was slow-cooking method as it increases the vitality of the dish being prepared.This delicacy was then served to our guests and it was an instant hit! They were ecstatic to be served a dish that is so innately traditional and quintessentially Indian that they devoured it and was left licking their fingers.Anurudh Khanna, Executive Chef at Shangri-La Hotel"

They wait for the hour-long lunch break that day with keen anticipation.All 28 of them rise ten minutes before the clock strikes 1pm, go to their chambers for a quick change and then proceed towards the common dining hall where a delectable three-course meal awaits the lordships.The lip-smacking cuisine from a particular part of the country is not sourced from a restaurant or hotel, but is home-cooked.A sitting SC judge hosts the weekly common lunch. The dishes are part of the host judges home state, prepared at his residence.A minimum of five food items have to be served in the main course and paan  as per each judges choice  is a must to end the lunch. Sources said judges sometimes call cooks from their native place to prepare dishes with the right local flavour.On other working days judges eat lunch in their own chambers.This Wednesday the judges tucked into home-made traditional food from Madhya Pradesh that was cooked at Justice Arun Misras residence. Pumpkin soup, bharvan bhindi and baingan, malai-kofta and paneer lababdar were on the menu. More than the main course, the dessert was much appreciated. The roasted kheer, pineapple kesar halwa and maalpua were just to die for, a judge told HT.Last week Justice RK Agrawal from Uttar Pradesh was the host. Dry green peas, kadhai paneer and dum aloo flavoured with local spices were laid out at lunch time.THE JUSTICES ARE SERVED In a charming tradition, Supreme Court judges meet for lunch every week, with each of them taking turns to bring ghar ka khana from his or her home state 1 Jagdish Singh Khehar 2 Adarsh Kumar Goel 3 Deepak Gupta 4 N.V.

Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the delicacy that afternoon.And before that the judges had Rajasthani delicacies from Justice AK Sikris kitchen - bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi.Vegetables from Justice Kurien Josephs own kitchen garden were used to cook traditional dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, followed by neatly chopped pineapples. The unusually long ripe bananas from the state were served after the meal.Justice J Chelameswar, who stirred a controversy with his decision to skip collegium meetings, too was a good host when it was his turn. His lunch treat of spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi left the judges licking their fingers.An unwritten rule is strictly followed at these lunches  only vegetarian cuisine is served to respect the sentiments of those who do not eat non-vegetarian food. The host is selected according to the judges seniority.Justice AK Patnaik, who retired in June 2014, fondly remembers how the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had added a new rule not to convert the lunch into a competition between judges. He introduced a penalty for those who exceeded the number of dishes fixed by him, Justice Patnaik recalls.Behind every successful meal is a judges wife, a senior judge told HT. But not for Justice R Banumathi  the lone woman judge  who would have to supervise the lunch herself when her turn comes.The Wednesday lunch not only gives judges an opportunity to taste a variety of Indian cuisines, but also shows their bonhomie. Work is never discussed and judges leave their differences at the door. Food is the only topic of discussion with some of the judges boasting about their local cuisines.A senior judge is appointed as the marshall and he penalises any judge who breaks the rules. At present Justice Bobde is the marshall. An argument with the marshall can aggravate the penalty.A marshall is like a class monitor to whom a complaint is made if a judge is seen breaching the rules. He is also the one who announces the end of the dinner that follows a standing ovation for the host judge, a sitting judge told HT on condition of anonymity.Retired judge Justice Kuldeep Singh who suggested the idea of the weekly lunches in the early Nineties gets nostalgic when asked about what triggered the idea. Justice Ranganath Misra was the Chief Justice then and he agreed for the weekly lunch so that we could all get together. It gave a personal touch and became an exciting event which everyone looked forward to, Justice Singh said.It was an opportunity to unwind and relax over food. Therefore, the rule that work should never be discussed. When we left our gowns in the chambers, we also left our work behind. I always looked forward to meals from south, Justice Singh recollects.Justice GS Singvhi who retired three years ago also has fond memories to share. Those were the only moments when we never discussed work. The lunch ensured that we brushed up our knowledge related to food cooked in our houses he told HT.Nor can he forget the south Indian dishes he had at these lunches. Home-made paisam (dessert), rasam and brown rice of Kerala were my favourites. I never eat sweets due to my sugar problem, but I could not resist the home-made paisam served by a brother judge from the south, he says.Yes, it was difficult for judges to avoid home-cooked preparations, despite health issues. When it was my turn I got two types of dessert ready, which included a sugar-free dessert. To my surprise nobody touched the sugar-free sweet and I always thought that judges were too old, muses Justice Patnaik who enjoyed the variety of chutneys his brother judge from the South got for lunch.A judge recollects how Justice Aftab Alam in his farewell speech on April 18, 2013 described the Wednesday lunch as a congregation of mini India. He said the one thing he would miss post retirement would be the weekly lunch, the judge recalls.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha holds a similar view. The Supreme Court is a mini India. You have judges from all over the country. The lunch used to a gastronomical delight of regional cuisine, he told HT.Justice Lodha had served dal-bati when it was his turn to host the lunch. It was soaked in ghee and I remember that after the lunch session all the judges felt so sleepy. Justice Singhvi, who also got dal-bati, says his preparation was different from Justice Lodhas family recipe. Dal-bati is cooked differently in the Jodhpur region and in the Jaipur region of Rajasthan. That is the beauty of Indian food, he explains.The lunch is laid out on a large rectangular table presided by the CJI. The host sits on his right and gives a brief introduction about the dishes. The rest sit wherever they like.However, the seating arrangement keeps changing. During former CJI HL Dattus tenure, the judges used to sit around circular tables and places were decided as per the lucky draw. A judge recollects how the present CJI JS Khehar ended up sitting next to Justice Dattu thrice. And when the former CJI asked him what conspiracy he was up to, CJI Khehar said it was the lucky draws fault!"

The evergreen revolution involves the integration of ecological principles in technology development and dissemination."" He has made this observation in context with the 50 years of Green Revolution in the country in an article written by him that was published in the Elsevier Journal.The former director general (DG) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) had worked closely with noted American farm scientist Norman E Borlaug to introduce high yielding varieties (HYV) of wheat in Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh.""The major problems associated with the Green Revolution are related to environmental factors like depletion and pollution of groundwater, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. It is these deficiencies that can be remedied through the 'evergreen revolution' pathway developed by me over 30 years ago. Therefore 50 years later we should work for a transition from the green to an 'evergreen revolution', leading to an enhancement in productivity in perpetuity without ecological harm. The technology involves the mainstreaming of ecological factors in technology development and dissemination,"" Prof Swaminathan has mentioned in his article.He further stated that to achieve the goal of food security by ending hunger and to promote sustainable agriculture, it is important that in the field of social protection as well as the scientific measures needed for achieving food and nutrition security, we should move from the green to an 'evergreen revolution' approach.The 91-year-old plant geneticist, who also served the DG of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Manila, has stated, ""Also agriculture, nutrition and health should be brought together in terms of design and delivery systems relating to public health and agriculture production. Anticipatory research for climate change adaptation and mitigation, participatory research for integrating farmers' wisdom with modern technology and translational research to fill the gap between knowledge and its application are all important for global food security."""

What the stalls of the 1960s did, was take the migrant workers average meal and package it to go. And that just worked.

The pav is a legacy of the Portuguese; the potato and groundnut came to us from the Americas, also via the Portuguese. The garlic is localand the chickpea batter.Like any good Mumbaiite, the snack is supremely adaptable. Its many things to many people, often at the same time.In 2008, for instance, it became a political statement when the Shiv Sena launched more than 100 Shiv Vada Pav stalls across the city. As Sena legislator Anil Parab puts it, It is a part of Mumbais culture. Several people who had vada pav stalls were Shiv Sena supporters already, so the party felt it would do well for the business and the city to turn it into a brand.These stalls werent the snacks political debut either. Theres a theory that the vada pav has its very roots in the Senas battle to establish a Marathi identity as the basis of Mumbais melting-pot culture.In the 1960s, some Shiv Sena protest signs read Idli dosa bhagao [Stop idli and dosa], referencing the two iconic snack foods of Tamil Nadu, as Sainiks attacked South Indian Udipi restaurants because the party founder, Bal Thackeray, accused south Indians of taking jobs that rightly belonged to the Marathi manoos, says Harris Solomon, a professor of cultural anthropology at Americas Duke University, in a paper titled The Taste No Chef Can Give: Processing Street Food in Mumbai, published in 2015.It was then, as a counter to the increasingly popular idlis and dosas and as a way to promote entrepreneurship, that the party first encouraged Maharashtrians to start their own vada pav stalls.It was about encouraging the Marathi people to turn entrepreneurs instead of hunting for jobs, says Parab.#MumbaiMeriHai What does Mumbai mean to you?

The rest of the mill workers would pass their former colleagues on the streets selling vada pav, and buy from them, Solomon writes.Then came the post-liberalisation boom. In 2001, Dheeraj Gupta launched Jumbo King Vada Pav, with its first outlet outside Malad railway station.This was followed by trendy kiosk-style outlets with names such as Goli Vada Pav (2004) and Wow Vada Pav (2012).With their shiny clean interiors, quirky combinations and customisable toppings, they soon became popular.All three now have scores of outlets across the country  from Jharkhand to Uttarakhand and Hyderabad to Delhi.Somewhere in Ranchi, then, there is someone eating what started out as a mill workers snack, now available in local flavours  with chhole, for instance, or achari-flavoured.We think of the vada as the ultimate finger food, says Gupta. And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers. Weve made no changes and have no secret recipe. It just works, and has kept working.The many avatas of the Vada Pav DECONSTRUCTED At Farzi Caf (top) and SpiceKlub, you get potato mousse or patties accompanied by smears or pouches of chutneys, sprinkled with lasoon chutney, sev, fried chillies and curry leaves IN A BAO Casual fine-dine restaurants such as the popular Social chain put the patty in a soft Chinese bun called a bao. Accompaniments include a lehsun chutney mayonnaise. AS A SIZZLER At outlets of Bar Stock Exchange, the vadas come with a side of vegetables, cumin rice and kachumber, topped with AS A SALAD Dishkiyaoon in BKC serves the potato patty comes with salad leaves, pomegranate and a pinch of farsan.Smart casualWith the boom in disposable incomes and the mushrooming of stand-alone restaurants, the vada pav went smart casual.The changing economy changed the way people snacked too, says Mumbai columnist and city chronicler Smruti Koppikar. Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food. Like any true Mumbaiite, the vada pav is at its best under pressure and on the move."

And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers. Weve made no changes and have no secret recipe. It just works, and has kept working.The many avatas of the Vada Pav DECONSTRUCTED At Farzi Caf (top) and SpiceKlub, you get potato mousse or patties accompanied by smears or pouches of chutneys, sprinkled with lasoon chutney, sev, fried chillies and curry leaves IN A BAO Casual fine-dine restaurants such as the popular Social chain put the patty in a soft Chinese bun called a bao. Accompaniments include a lehsun chutney mayonnaise. AS A SIZZLER At outlets of Bar Stock Exchange, the vadas come with a side of vegetables, cumin rice and kachumber, topped with AS A SALAD Dishkiyaoon in BKC serves the potato patty comes with salad leaves, pomegranate and a pinch of farsan.Smart casualWith the boom in disposable incomes and the mushrooming of stand-alone restaurants, the vada pav went smart casual.The changing economy changed the way people snacked too, says Mumbai columnist and city chronicler Smruti Koppikar. Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food. Like any true Mumbaiite, the vada pav is at its best under pressure and on the move."

Since February last year, they have been getting rice under the National Food Security Scheme.Last month, workers of Bhagatpur tea estate in Nagrakata block had refused to accept rice from the ration dealer, alleging that its quality was bad."

The truth is there is no one secret, is there?Some make it here by doing what they do best. Others reinvent themselves every fortnight. Still others may find success elsewhere and return home to bask.So it is with one of the most abiding icons of our city.There are Irani cafs here that refuse to change a thing, and thrive. Even the paint on the walls is peeling at Britannia, and theres usually a pet cat at the cashier counter, but the tourists stream in with their guides all day and sit down to plates of berry pulao  that now cost more than Rs700 (yes, one thing changed).There are Irani cafs that have added cocktails, beer, palak paneer and aamras to their menus, and thrive.We have Chinese chop suey too. We changed our menu about 15 years ago, because we want to serve what the young ones like most, says Ardeshir Mazkoori, owner of the 98-year-old Caf Excelsior at Fort.No sitting for long; No asking directions; No arguing; No gambling; No discussing politics  the list of donts in an Irani caf is as endearingly grumpy as it is specific. (Shrikrishna Patkar)And then there are the foreign-returned  the Mumbai SodaBottleOpenerWala is actually the fifth.AD Singh launched the chain in Gurgaon in 2013. We were really worried about how it would do in the land where these cafs were born, he says, laughing. But they had done so well in Delhi, Noida and Bangalore too that we decided to open in Mumbai. Today, our Mumbai branch is doing the best and another branch is opening in Powai next week.No combing hairSo what makes a caf Irani? You dont have to be an Irani to open one, and you can have pretty much anything on the menu.But you cannot be an Irani caf if you do not have at least three of these: bun-maska, chai, marble-topped tables, bentwood chairs, glass jars full of stuff no one ever buys, and some really odd rules.No sitting for long; No asking directions; No arguing; No gambling; No discussing politics  the list of donts was as endearingly grumpy as it was specific.The owners didnt want to say these things directly to their customers; they didnt want to seem rude, says historian Rafique Baghdadi, chuckling. Hence the boards.As the world changed around them, the cafs and their quaint boards became icons of another time. No Irani caf worth its bun-maska would open without some version of the rules  not even the new ones in London (Dishoom, now a chain of five, was launched here in 2010) and Paris (which has an Irani caf called MG Road).Dishooms walls, in fact, are rather startlingly rude  Simon Go Back shouts one word cloud. A list of rules at the Kings Cross outlet declares: No Rowlatt Act, No Salt Tax, No Lathi Charging and also the more familiar No making mischief in Cabin and No cutting nails.All are welcome, whatever caste It was a famine in Persia in the 1890s that gave Mumbai its Irani cafs.* Desperate and starving, Iranis fled their homeland on foot, crossing mountains and travelling thousands of miles in search of refuge.* Many arrived in Mumbai with little more than the clothes on their backs and the stove-like sigdis that they had used to keep warm on their journey.* They used to coal-fired sigdis to make chai, and in the bustling port city, they found that they could sell the chai and earn a living. Those chai stops turned into the citys first cafs.* They set the precedent for dining out in Mumbai, says food consultant Rushina Munshaw-Ghildiyal.A warm welcomeBack in Mumbai, the revamped menus are finding the new takers they were designed to woo.Jeremy Cardoz, 29, is a banker based in Toronto who visits his granddad in Mumbai once a year. On these visits, he now spends every Sunday at Sassanian Caf in Marine Lines  because thats been his grandfathers routine for 42 years.Its only after they began serving something other than Iranian and Parsi cuisine that I started eating here, Jeremy says. I love their chicken lollipop gravy with fried rice.His grandfather Sam, 75, a retired banker, first visited the caf with a Parsi friend, on a Sunday, for their dhansak. The chicken dhansak with brown rice remains his favourite thing on the menu.Its the marriage of old and new that Sassanian was going for when they revamped their 80-year-old menu in 2000, cutting down on the tea cakes and plum cakes and adding sizzlers, burgers, rolls and Chindian fare.Around the same time, Caf Excelsior (1919) in Fort started offering paneer bhurji and palak paneer. We needed to cater to every demographic, says owner Ardeshir Mazkoori.In 2003, Caf Universal in Ballard Estate introduced a full bar, Indian-Chinese dishes, burgers, sizzlers, wraps and rolls. We realised that demand for Parsi food was limited, says head waiter Vasudev. Today, our sizzlers are one of our most-ordered items.Across the board, menus were changing at the turn of the century to cater to a rapidly changing city  there were far more youngsters and far fewer blue-collar workers in Mumbai now, more vegetarians in the island city, and a growing demographic of young professionals and college students looking for places with varied menus where they could hang out in groups.Add to that the growing competition from first lunch homes and Udupi restaurants, then the growing standalone eateries and finally the post-liberalisation multinational fast-food chains (McDonalds came to Mumbai in 1996), and the cafs were fighting for their lives.One big hurdle was the disinterested third generation, says Rashid Irani, film critic and co-owner of Brabourne, an Irani caf in Dhobi Talao that shut in 2008. These were educated and well-travelled young people who didnt want to survive on a pittance just to keep the family caf going.Farokh Shokriye, the third-generation owner of Mumbais oldest Irani caf, Kyani & Co (Marine Lines, 1904), was in his 30s at this pivotal time.I had to choose between migrating abroad and continuing this legacy, he remembers. I chose the latter because I thought it would be selfish to kill our forefathers legacy.Instead, he reinvented it. We added grilled sandwiches, sausages and baked beans, samosas, fruit bowls and aamras, he says. And today, it feels like a weekend every day.Sepia tonedThere were many stalwarts that didnt make it. In fact, most of Mumbais 400-odd Irani cafs succumbed to the cocktail of challenges.In 1998, Caf Empire shut. Brabourne downed its shutter for the last time a decade later. In the same year, Fairdeal Caf in Bandra and Cadell Caf in Mahim closed. About 30 remain today, says historian Baghdadi.As a tribute to those that were gone, filmmaker Mansoor Showghi Yezdi made a documentary called Caf Irani Chai in 2013, and two years later opened an Irani caf of the same name in Mahim. It was the first new Irani caf in the city in 50 years.Gleaming wooden furniture, mirrored walls, checked tablecloths, delicious berry pulao and bun-maska  it ticked all the boxes. In a nod to his ancestors  the famine-fleeing Yezds from Iran who set up the first cafs in Bombay  he placed Irani samovars and uris in the corners.We dont make more than 20-25% profit, but we arent aiming for more. This caf is a way of thanking India for letting us take refuge here, he says. You can get a meal here for about Rs 200.Its the perfect Irani caf for a Mahim that is changing fast but holding on tight to its heritage of Wednesday fairs, novenas and low-rise housing.In much the same way, SodaBottleOpenerWala is the perfect Irani caf for the glass-and-chrome business district of Bandra-Kurla Complex. You dont come here to reminisce; you come here to chat over retro music and take selfies against the dcor.Were a Parsi home menu-meets-Mumbai favourites place, says Singh. We knew the under-30s werent going to the old cafs, so we set one up that offered the same experience  with a very different vibe.Theres a full bar and a jukebox. The jars full of boiled sweets are shiny clean, a colourful bicycle holds bulls-eye and lemon-orange sweets that you can pose against or grab a handful of on your way out.Dhansak and bhajiya are on the menu, but so are vada pav, Eggs Kejriwal and seekh-paratha. We wanted to include very Bombay dishes because these cafs are very Bombay too, Singh says.Theres even a board of stern rules  No flirting, No asking recipe, No talking to cashier.All along one wall is a life-size photograph of an original Irani caf, taken some time in the 80s, a bicycle and two scooters parked outside. Old meets new, and takes a bow.What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city?

Being a homebound person by nature, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mother. Our food needs a lot of whisking, and she would ask me to stir the curries. She taught me how to make kibbeh, a mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulgur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices, which we would stuff in fish or lamb and fry, says Alshamali. The 35-year-old chef in the midst of launching a modern Middle Eastern cuisine eatery at the Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai is in Mumbai to helm the ongoing Arabesque food festival at the J.W. Marriott Juhu.When we meet Alshamali, the Lotus Caf is pleasantly enveloped with the pleasing fragrance of zaatar and cinnamon. Middle Eastern food is similar to Indian food as most of the ingredients are similar, shares the chef. The food that Alshamali is dishing up for Arabesque is more home-style making it an authentic Arabic experience on a platter.On the menu is an authentic shawarma station. Alshamali is serving shawarmas with a special red chilli paste he has brought all the way from Syria. From the grill section, we try chicken in harissa sauce, prawns in a green souk sauce made from coriander and chillies. While the ingredients are easily identifiable, they create a completely unique zing on our palates. We quite enjoy the mild chicken cooked in yogurt with saffron.Past the grill section, which also has crunchy baby corns, green chillies and baby aubergines,we take a dollop of kabsa, rice with minced meat and meatball in tomato sauce made with pomegranate molasses, kokum and sumac, which gives the dish a berry-like sourness.The chef, whose earlier stint has been at Qbara, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant that made it to Worlds 50 Best Restaurants this year. He says, My first job in Dubai was in Atmosphere, the highest restaurant in the world housed in Burj Khalifa, where we served authentic French cuisine.He breaks down Arabic cuisine to the basics. Tahina is made from roasted sesame and harissa, a sauce made from Magrebi red chili, Moroccan spices and garlic, are the most commonly used. We also make a fine green zouk sauce which has coriander, green chillies, caraway seeds and lemon juice. We use pomegranate molasses and cumin too in our curries, he adds, sharing a childhood memory of his mother pickling vegetables for winter months. She would put the olives in brine solution for two months before we could eat it, he smiles.Our order of the shawarma is here, and we roll the pita bread that is stuffed with grilled chicken, the Syrian red chilli paste, lemon juice, onions. We dunk it in sour cream and the sweet and tangy red chilli paste pleasantly surprises us. While it is not at all spicy, it is supremely flavourful.Alshamalis version of a bakalava takes us into a food trance. Its freshly made and comes with a twist. It has no pistachio but a filling of walnut with cinnamon. It is flaky and soft and we are likely to crave this version more than the traditional pistachio one.The Arabic Food Festival, Arabesque at JW Marriott, Lotus Caf from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily till April 30"

For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice.The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems.Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste.Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjabs agriculture department.We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops. Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules.The states pollution control board will take action against farmers who dont follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters  which harvest both wheat and rice  till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw, he added.In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May, said AK Bihnoi, director at the states agriculture department.With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies.Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryanas agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesnt see any need for a central subsidy for such steps.The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said."

An angry minister then asked the district magistrate and chief development officer to ensure repairs and improvements in a week's time and submit a report about the same to him.Yadav had come to Bijnor on the occasion of Ganga Swachchhta Sankalp Divas to flag off a 21-day rally with a view to creating awareness to keep the river clean among the people living along its banks.On his way to the function, the minister decided to stop and inspect the primary school of Daranagar, which is located along the banks of the river.When Yadav entered the kitchen where the midday meal is to be cooked, he found that all the cooking and edible material including rice and pulses missing. He then learned that all the groceries and utensils were kept at the pradhan's house instead of the school. The only dish that was ready for the midday meal was made of potatoes instead of pulses, which is a must on the menu.Next , Yadav inspected the toilets. He found that of the two toilets, one was locked while the other one was in a dilapidated condition, This was an indication that the students were not using the toilet and were going in the open to answer a call of nature.Several other irregularities came to Yadav's notice. He found that 70 students of the 205 enrolled at the school were absentThe upset minister immediately spoke with the DM and CDO , asking them to improve the standard of education and other things . He instructed them to send him pictures of the kitchen, toilets and midday meal to him. He asked the teachers that they motivate their wards to use the toilet regularly.Chief development officer Indramani Tripathi said, ""A few irregularities were detected during the inspection. Teachers told the minister that the midday meal groceries are kept at the pradhan's house to prevent pilferage of foodstuff. The toilets are locked but opened when any student wishes to relieve himself.""After the inspection, minister Yadav attended the Ganga Swachchhta Sankalp Divas programme and administered an oath to all those who were present to make the Ganga clean. He assured the people that both central and state govt have prepared a plan to keep the Ganga clean. It would start bearing fruit within the next two or three months."

Everybody is a foul person. Show us the investment proof. Bring in the farmers who received the machines.The NGTs order came on a plea by environmentalist Vikrant Tongad who had sought a ban on burning of agricultural waste and remnants in open fields.The pollution caused by these fires travel to Delhi because of the westerly winds, causing major health concerns among people, say environment experts.Apart from the lungs, the smoke also affects the brain, eyes and the nervous system, say doctors.A study by IIT Kanpur has listed stubble burning as the third highest contributor to Delhis winter air-pollution, after construction dust and vehicular fumes.The green court had earlier fixed the environment compensation amounts per incident of crop burning to be paid by small land owners having less than two acres of land at R 2,500, medium land owners holding over two acres and less than five acres at R 5,000 and those owning over five acres at R 15,000.It had also directed the state governments to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters of crop residue burning and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers.It had said that the five states -- Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi -- which have issued notifications prohibiting agriculture crop residue burning should ensure that these are enforced rigorously and proper action is taken against the defaulters.The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA) in April had also expressed concern over the crop burning gaining pace in the northern region. The EPCA, which has been spearheading crucial anti-pollution measures, warned the state governments of the northern states to stop being in denial and get their act together.According to satellite data, as pointed out by EPCA, the agricultural landscape of Punjab and Haryana is dotted with fires billowing out pollutant-laden smoke as farmers have set fire to the residues of the Rabi crop to usher in the Kharif season."

She has a private 840 square foot patch attached to her apartment in Hebbal. She says there is no plant she will not grow.Even weeds attract butterflies, she says. Even grass brings the Common Evening Brown (which flies in at dusk)... I used to think that Bougainvillae are useless. But now I know that Sunbirds (with colourful and iridescent plumage) feed on their nectar.Savitha takes her gardening lessons by observing her garden, crosschecking her findings on the Internet. I am also part of Oota from Your Thota, she says. Its a Facebook group where members share tips and trickson gardening.My mother used to garden and I took an interest even when I was six years old, she says. Savita remembers the Dahlias and Jasmine shrubs from this garden in Chikkabalapura. She never wasted water, reusing even what was used to wash rice and vegetables and any water from the kitchen.Savita has the fragrant Champaka in a pot. This attracts the Common Jay and the Tailed Jay, she says. My curry leaf plant attracts Common Mormont.There are fascinating instances of Natures balancing act in a butterfly garden. I dont use pesticides because I do not want to upset this delicate equilibrium, she says. She gives the example of mealy bugs, which is commonly considered a pest. Hibiscus, which usually attracts mealy bugs, also attracts birds. This is because ape flies lay eggs on mealy bugs and birds come to these plants to feed on the flys caterpillar.If the caterpillars survive and grow into flies, then they eat the mealy bugs, she says. On the whole, the mealy bugs draw the birds and their numbers are kept in check. But if there are too many mealy bugs, then I use neem oil and soap water made from washing soap, she says."

The nine-time MP from Bihar was recently in the news for urging restaurants to specify food portions on their menus. Last week, he also slammed Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for speaking out against the government. Thackeray had accused Paswan of forcibly getting a sentence  that NDA will fight 2019 elections under the leadership of PM Modi  added in an NDA resolution.RAM VILAS PASWAN: When I took charge of the ministry, the Food Security Act had already come into force (July 5, 2013) but was implemented in only 11 states. Today, the Act is in force in all 29 states. 67 per cent of the countrys population or 81 crore people are getting rice at Rs 3 per kilo and wheat at Rs 2 per kilo. The Centre bears the subsidy cost, but the state governments claim that they are paying for it. They dont pay a single penny.We want to make use of modern technology to make transactions cashless. Of the 23 crore ration card holders in the country, 19 crore have been linked to Aadhaar. The benefit of this process is that 14 crore ration cards were found to be fake. If it (Aadhaar) is integrated in more states, a lot of money can be saved.On the issue of food portions, we have not told restaurants how much to serve and how much to charge the customer. What we have said is that the consumer should know what they are getting for the price they are paying. If I am paying Rs 700 for a bowl of soup, I should know what quantity of it is being served. (Last month the minister had suggested that restaurants specify on their menus the amount of food they serve per portion.)ANAND MISHRA: Some of your old socialist friends are now forming a mahagathbandhan with the Congress to name a common Opposition candidate for the presidential polls. They are also trying to put up a united Opposition front for the 2019 elections.These people (opposition parties) are wasting time. Look, it is the Oppositions job to propose their candidate. It is not surprising at all. But I see no coordination and understanding between the opposition parties. In Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav are not on the same page. Mulayam says there will be no tie-up with the Congress, and Akhilesh is talking about an understanding with them. Then there is the Left, Mamata Banerjee (TMC), Congress and Arvind Kejriwal (AAP). The Opposition is fragmented and divided. For the first time, there is no Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The Opposition can come together and nominate their candidate for the presidential polls, but nothing will come of it.ANAND MISHRA: In the past, socialist leaders and splinter groups of the Janata Dal came together with the Left to form an Opposition front against the ruling Congress. They are coming together now as well.At the time when the opposition parties came together against the Congress, there was no one with the Congress. But now, when the BJP-led NDA is in power, there are many parties that have joined hands with the BJP. Like in the Janata Party government, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was foreign minister. In 1967 in Bihar, when the Janata Party formed the government, the BJP was with us and so was the Left. But today, the situation has changed.See, the biggest thing is credibility. During that period, the Opposition had never been in power. So people thought that when the Opposition comes to power, there would be new vision and direction. But today members of the Opposition have already had opportunities to run governments, and people have seen them. So what is the point of forming the mahagathbandhan?COOMI KAPOOR: The Supreme Court recently ordered that Lalu Prasad will stand trial in all fodder scam cases. Do you think it will affect the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar?There are two things here  mass perception and actual impact. The mass perception has been formed. First it was the Mohammad Shahabuddin episode, when he was granted bail. Then he was sent to Tihar. Now, an audio tape has emerged where a criminal like Shahabuddin is heard instructing Lalu Prasad, who is himself a convict, regarding a superintendent of police. The (Bihar) government is responsible for this and they must now clarify.Then there is the controversy over land deals involving his sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi. And now we have the Supreme Court judgment asking Lalu to face trial in all fodder scam cases.There is an ongoing cold war between Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar claims to be the face of sushasan (good governance), but so far he has remained silent over these issues.Many people claim that the (state) government is behind this, and some are even pointing to the role of RJD leaders who have been upset with Lalu Prasad. Nitish Kumar wants Lalu Prasads party to remain weak and surrounded by controversies. The RJD has more seats in the Bihar Assembly than the JD(U). The RJD has 80 seats (the JD-U has 71). One has the crown and the other has the power.ABANTIKA GHOSH: You have been a minister in both UPA and NDA governments. Whats the difference in their working styles?There was lack of decision-making in the UPA government. This could have been because it was a coalition government. Taking decisions was tough in the UPA government, there was no clear path. The government remained confused.The BJP-led NDA government has a majority in the Lok Sabha. Narendra Modi is currently the tallest leader in the BJP as well as in the country. He gets praise for the governments work and faces all of the criticism. Even if a decision is risky, the present dispensation takes a call.Take demonetisation for instance. The UPA government could have never taken a decision on the matter, but this government took the risk and was ready to face the consequences.The other difference is the lack of corruption. Its been three years and there is no corruption taint on this government. During the previous government, there were corruption charges every month.This government has only one centre of power. In the previous government, there were two centres.ANAND MISHRA: There are reports that ties between the BJP and Shiv Sena are strained.What can the Shiv Sena do? In Maharashtra, except for Mumbai, the BJP has won all the civic body elections. Even in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, there was a very small difference between the two parties. The Sena thinks that if it does not oppose the BJP in Maharashtra, it will lose ground. During the recent NDA meeting, we told them not to raise issues with the BJP in public.For example, it was unanimously decided at an NDA meeting that Narendra Modi will be our PM candidate in 2019. However, the Sena later claimed otherwise. All allies were of the view that Narendra Modi is the tallest leader in the country and thats why we took the decision.VANDITA MISHRA: Do you agree with the BJPs decision to appoint Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh?This issue concerns the BJP. The party got a massive mandate and it has a system in place to make such choices. Who are we to say anything on their choice for the CMs post.ANAND MISHRA: Whenever there is an issue between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad, it is speculated that Nitish will return to the NDA fold. Is that a possibility?Nitish Kumar has a double card. He is apprehensive of Lalu Prasad taking over the reins of the government. The RJD has 80 seats and the Congress has 27, which gives them a total of 107 seats.Nitish fears that in case their alliance breaks, Lalu will manage to get support from some of the JD(U) MLAs. That is why he keeps sending signals to the RJD that if you withdraw support I have another way to get the numbers.Nitish needs to make up his mind on whether he wants to stay in the Mahagathbandhan, resign and seek mid-term polls, or if he wants to join the NDA.So, first he needs to take a clear stand and only then will the NDA decide on whether to support or oppose his inclusion in the alliance.ABANTIKA GHOSH: Recently, the PM backed generic drugs. You have held the Chemicals and Fertilisers portfolio. What are your views on it?I have been pitching for generic drugs since 2007. I also support printing of names of drugs in regional languages. Names of drugs are mostly printed in English and sometimes in Hindi too. I had told M Karunanidhi, when he was the Tamil Nadu chief minister, to push for printing of names of medicines in Tamil.SANDIP DAS: Aadhaar seeding in the Public Distribution System (PDS) has been slow in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. How do you want to pursue it?They are yet to give us names of at least 10-15 lakh beneficiaries. The state government picks all the stocks and yet we get several complaints of the poor not getting grains. When we seed Aadhaar numbers with ration cards, it will stop people from picking up ration from multiple locations under one name. It will stop pilferage.The Central government stores food grains at FCI godowns. From there the state government picks up the stock. We tried to computerise the entire process and asked state governments to pay 50 per cent of the expenses. But the entire process has yet not been fully computerised.ANAND MISHRA: You were part of the all-party delegation to Kashmir in both the UPA and NDA governments. You have also met separatist leaders from the Valley in past. At the moment, the BJP is in favour of a muscular policy to handle the issue. What, in your opinion, is the way forward?We had met separatist leaders such as Yasin Malik and Syed Ali Shah Geelani. But the situation is completely different now. I dont think that these leaders are influential anymore. In fact they are now using the language of terrorists to keep themselves relevant. The first issue is that certain people give youths stones to throw at security forces, and in response, the forces open fire. On both sides our people die, and those responsible remain safe.The other issue is of terror activities. There is no dispute between political parties and other sections of the society on the fact that such activities are supported by Pakistan. We have asked the government to adopt a tit-for-tat policy and give complete freedom to the Army.ANAND MISHRA: Can you elaborate on the tit-for-tat policy.We only want an equally strong reaction to Pakistans actions.HARISH DAMODARAN: What are your views on the Supreme Courts order to arrest Justice C S Karnan.It is a justice verses justice matter. I wont comment on the issue.HARISH DAMODARAN: Do you support reservation in the higher judiciary?We want an Indian judicial service on the lines of the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service. In such a system the judges will be selected through competition, putting all questions about the collegium system to rest. No one can doubt the efficiency of IAS and IPS officers because they are selected through a competition. Similarly, no one will raise questions on judges if they are selected through a competition.I fully support the idea of an Indian judicial service, conducting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together, State funding of political parties, and keeping a record of foreign funding (to NGOs).SRIJANA MITRA DAS: With Mayawati losing Dalit votes and the BJP reaching out to the community, dont you think Dalit identity politics is being marginalised? Also, what are your views on the politics around beef?Mayawati falsely claims to be a Dalit leader. Dalits stand for Scheduled Castes. There are many castes among the Dalits  Paswans, Pasis, Jatavs etc. She was the leader of only one Dalit caste, but claimed to represent the entire community. She only inherited the legacy of Kanshi Ram. Has she participated in any Dalit welfare movement? Where was she during the Mandal Commission movement?She just believes in vote-bank politics. First she suffered a massive defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and now in the Assembly polls. She will have to form an alliance even to secure her seat in the Rajya Sabha next year.Because of social awakening across the country, one single leader does not represent an entire community anymore. No Brahmin represents the entire community, no Rajput represents the entire community. Likewise, no leader can claim to represent all Dalits. In Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswan has the support of Dalits, but he cant make similar claims in Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, Lalu Prasad is the leader of Yadavs in Bihar, but he has no say in Uttar Pradesh; Mulayam Singh Yadav is zero in Bihar. The BSP cant win a single seat outside Uttar Pradesh.SRIJANA MITRA DAS: And what about beef politics? People are being killed because of it.Beef, triple talaq, Article 370 and Ram Janmabhoomi are issues raised by political parties, but it cant be part of the governments policy. Have you ever heard anything from PM on Article 370 (that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir)?VANDITA MISHRA: But BJP-ruled states are bringing in stricter laws against cow slaughter.When they bring in any such law, you can ask for my views. Recently, in Uttar Pradesh, there was a controversy surrounding closure of slaughterhouses. We looked into that issue. Those were illegal slaughterhouses.ANAND MISHRA: Should the government talk to separatists in Kashmir?The mass perception is against any talks with the separatists when our soldiers are being killed. The mass perception is also that terror activities should stop and separatists must cut all ties with terrorists.As soon as separatists disown terrorists, we will initiate talks with them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Sanjay Choudhary Two relatives of the national president of the JDU youth wing were among six people arrested on Sunday in connection with the seizure of 120 cartons or around 1,036 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) in Rohtas district. The arrest of the JDU leader's kin is likely to come as a major embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar-led government, which has made war against liquor the cornerstone of its politics. Confirming the arrests and seizure, Rohtas superintendent of police (SP) Manavjit Singh Dhillon said: ""Investigations are going on in the case. We won't be able to provide much details about the case."" However, sources in the police said the people arrested from Kargahar, around 160km southwest of Patna, included Ramchandra Rai and Sadanand Singh, the father-in-law and the brother-in-law of Sanjay Kumar, the national president of Yuva (youth wing) JDU. ""We came to know about their connection only when they started dropping Sanjay's name. We found the relations to be correct. All the arrested are being interrogated and would be produced before a magistrate later on,"" a senior police officer told The Telegraph. The Telegraph could not contact Sanjay despite several attempts. However, JDU spokesperson and Legislative Council member Neeraj Kumar said: ""Sanjay is not involved in the case because he lives in New Delhi. How would he know what his in-laws are doing in Bihar? People can see that the rule of law in the state does not even exempt relatives of top leaders. If they commit wrong, the law will take its own course as in this case."" Manoj Gupta, Shashi Kumar, Chandan Kumar and Rasbihari Yadav were the others arrested in the case. They all belong to different parts of Rohtas district. The police officer said investigations were on to ascertain whether or not Sanjay colluded with those arrested in their operations. All the bottles belong to Royal Style brand and their labels show that they were manufactured and bottled in Chandigarh. Sasaram sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Alok Ranjan said: ""The seized liquor bottles were hidden in a distributary of Sone river at Karpura village under Kargahar police station area in the district. The distributary (water distributing channel) was dry."" ""The arrests and seizures were done on the basis of our increased surveillance across the district in light of prohibition. We were probing a case related to the seizure of around 900 litres of IMFL from a container truck here by the economic offences unit on January 30 this year, when the involvement of the people arrested today (Sunday) came to light. We were conducting technical surveillance and the mobile numbers of Ramchandra and Sadanand cropped up. They procured IMFL illegally from other states and distributed in Rohtas,"" Alok added. Sunday's seizure was also made on the basis of mobile surveillance of the accused, sources in the police said. Sadanand supplies broken/residual grains of milled rice to distilleries in Punjab and Haryana. The police believe he started dealing in illegal liquor in Bihar by using his connections in those states. Rohtas has seen around six major seizures since total prohibition was implemented in Bihar on April 5, 2016. Its location along Bihar's border with Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand helps bootleggers and liquor mafia, who have opened several channels to smuggle in liquor."
593557a67be9e061b1736c0a,Surprise checks on schools for midday meals,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surprise-checks-on-schools-for-midday-meals/articleshow/58674348.cms,2017-05-15,"NAGPUR: From the upcoming academic session, zilla parishad officials will be cracking down on schools that fail to implement midday meals (MDM) scheme properly.Nilesh Waghmare, district in charge for MDM said, ""There will be increased supervision and lot of surprise checks at schools to ensure that children are getting nutritious, tasty and hygienic food.""Waghmare's statements comes two days after a baby snake, also known as a 'snakelet', was found in the food served to students in a school in Uttar Pradesh. The academic session for state board schools in city, where MDM is served, will begin from either June 26 or 27. The task for Waghmare will definitely be tough because there are over 2,000 schools in district serving MDM and the staff dedicated for this task is less than a dozen. As per MDM guidelines, the primary responsibility for checking the food lies with the school's principal.Waghmare said, ""Safety of children is our main goal and we will ensure that they get good quality food as per the guidelines. Nagpur district has lakhs of students benefiting from the MDM scheme and it is a huge responsibility. I am drawing up plans to ensure that random checks will be held in schools on a regular basis.""In city, schools get raw rice in bulk quantity from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns based on requisition sent to Waghmare's office. The rice is delivered directly to school campus by contracted transporter. But other items like pulses, vegetables, oil and spices have to be purchased by schools and then the bill is reimbursed by ZP.In the last two years there have been only two cases of food poisoning reported in the district. Waghmare said, ""Starting surprise checks does not mean that we are accusing anybody in particular. It's just a method of double checking how things are being implemented at the ground level. We will act both on information received from public and random geographical selection of schools.""He added that neglecting to adhere to guidelines is considered a serious problem. Waghmare said, ""This puts the lives of hundreds of kids in danger, so we are looking at a major problem. In food poisoning cases anyway the police get involved and we also conduct a separate inquiry into the incident."""
59284b7f7be9e0137c77c937,Beef export: unethical slaughter for money,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612138/beef-export-unethical-slaughter-money.html,2017-05-17,"Ritwick Dutta, May 17 2017, 23:51 ISTThe massive growth of the meat export industry in India in the last few years has ushered in what is infamously called the Pink Revolution. This revolution has today become the centre of public debate and political discourse, principally because of the crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of India.Viewing the ongoing controversy over slaughterhouses only from the lens of the right of the people to decide what they want to eat or of religious intolerance, overlooks many fundamental questions.Should a country like India promote the export of meat? Have we really considered the environmental, social and ethical issues while focussing on the export earning and jobs provided by slaughterhouses? At a time when even rivers, lakes and glaciers have been considered as legal and living entities by a high court, should animals continue to be treated as inanimate sources of protein and revenue?The fact is that we must make a distinction between meat for domestic consumption and meat for export. The irony is, today India is the worlds largest exporter of beef; its total export is valued at Rs 26,000 crore and is slated to grow further.Indias legal beef export consists essentially of buffalo meat called carabeef. As of now, beef has surpassed Basmati rice as India's top agricultural export. India's buffaloes are being largely slaughtered not to add protein or satisfy the taste buds of its citizens, but of the people of 65 countries where it is exported.The country has been eager to tap the Chinese meat market; the worlds largest. China had, till recently, not allowed the direct import of Indias beef due to the prevalence of the foot and mouth disease here. It was only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China in 2015, that the Chinese government decided to send inspectors to visit India's abattoir to ascertain their conditions. In January, 2017, China finally allowed the import of Indian beef.India sees buffalo meat export as a means to reduce its massive trade deficit with China. Thus, while the ruling BJP actively advocates against the Pink Revolution, the Union government under the leadership of the same party has succeeded in opening a direct export channel for beef with China.Legal or illegal, slaughterhouses and the promotion of meat industry for export have serious environmental and social consequences. From an environmental standpoint, large-scale export of meat itself is a precious drain on the countrys natural resources.Meat industry is highly water-intensive: for producing just a kilo of meat, roughly 15,000 litres of water is required (UN World Water Development report, 2012). Thus, when India exports meat, it is not just exporting meat, but also large quantities of scarce water. Thus, a virtual trade in water takes place. Lax regulations and low wages make Indian meat far cheaper than other competing countries.Cruel industryThe export of meat raises an important question: do we have the moral and ethical right to kill in the most brutal and cruel manner to meet our foreign exchange requirement? Buffaloes are reared, transported and slaughtered in the most unthinkable manner. In a slaughter house, every effort is made to ensure that the animal suffers unimaginable pain. In the whole process of meat export, a live animal with emotions is reduced to an inanimate lifeless resource.Just because an animal is not the holy cow, does it legitimise it being subjected to excruciating pain and torture? It would not be amiss to say that the torture we inflict on meek and helpless animals in slaughterhouses is akin to the sufferings of people in the concentration camps under the Nazi regime.As a countrys living standards improve, activities that are hazardous and promote pollution are increasingly resisted by the local people; a classic example of Not in My Backyard syndrome. As quality of life and liveability index become important yardsticks in peoples lives, slaughterhouses, with their high polluting nature, have no place in the urban and rural landscape.A few years ago, the Sup-reme Court prohibited the export of iron ore from Goa and Karnataka. The export earnings from mining did not, according to the court, reflect the true social and environmental impact. Indias meat export is no different. It is an extractive industry given the nature of natural resources it uses.Slaughter houses, despite their high pollution load, are not subject to any Environmental Impact Assessment. The impact on the ecology as well as the people are never ascertained scientifically. No cost benefit analysis is done. No public hearing takes place. The public has no say in deciding whether slaughter houses should be allowed or not.We need an impartial debate on whether India should continue in its path as a global giant in meat export. India has many skills it can use to its optimal capacity to earn a place as a global economic giant. It will be sad indeed if the worlds largest democracy is one day known globally for its skill in raising and killing animals for consumption.(The writer is an environmental lawyer)"

Its managing director Sudhir Kumar Dhingra termed Thursday's ceremony a significant day for the textile industry in eastern India.""When we met the chief minister last year, he wanted a labour intensive industrial sector which can stop the migration of state's unemployed youth,"" Dhingra said. Drawing comparison to the textile industry of Bangladesh, Dhingra said the industry, if nurtured well, can give competition to Bangladesh.The Medicant Group of Hospital (Bokaro Sewa Trust) got land to set up a 500-bed hospital in Bokaro at a net worth of Rs 150 crore. Its managing director Majid said, ""We have hospitals in New Delhi, NCR and Jammu & Kashmir. But unlike other states we got everything here on a single plate. What surprised us was the pace at which roads were built here to improve connectivity between cities.""Entrepreneurs from the food processing sector also sounded upbeat. Uttar Pradesh-based rice bran oil manufacturer Chandra Prakash Agarwal said, ""Investors with smaller capitals are always looked down in other states. However in Jharkhand, the chief minister himself took the initiative of laying the foundation stone of our plant (in Ranchi). In other states, CMs only lay foundation stones of public-sector projects.""The positive feedback from the entrepreneurs will help the state government to build on its new image of an investor-friendly state in future, officers of the state industries department said. ""The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted with the objective of assuring investors that the government is committed to promises it made at the summit,"" an officer said.The ground-breaking ceremony was envisaged by the Das government as a confidence building measure among the investors who inked memoranda of understanding (MOU) worth Rs 3.1 lakh crore. The Das government went into overdrive soon after completion of the summit. The CM directed senior officers of the department to provide land and environmental clearances to several projects within six months. Senior officers went around hunting for land in the outskirts of Ranchi and zeroed in on 150 acres of land in Oremanjhi, Nagri and Tupudana areas."

Express Photo by Partha Paul Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. Express Photo by Partha Paul50 years ago, on May 25, an uprising in this North Bengal block changed the politics of the country, and continues to agitate it. But where it all started, the original rebels have little strength left against a new breed of landowners, the land mafia, allowing BJP a foothold in its ideological battle against the Left. Esha Roy goes to the ground.In March 1967, after years of oppression by landlords, the peasants of Naxalbari village in North Bengals Darjeeling district rose up in revolt, in one of the countrys most defining uprisings. Under Charu Majumdar, Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal, the Naxals, as they came to be known, seized land from the jotedars (landlords), grains from their godowns and distributed it among the peasants.The State retaliated by torturing villages, leading to May 24, when thousands gheraoed a police party at Jharujote. Inspector Sonam Wangdi was killed, three officers were injured. The next day, at Bengai Jote, 11 villagers, including eight women and two children, were shot dead by police. The firing would trigger an armed guerrilla resistance that, 50 years later, continues to inspire other such movements in the country, including in neighbouring Nepal and the Maoists. Today, as tea workers pick the First Flush of Darjeeling in Naxalbaris lush tea estates, the blood bath is a distant memory.Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)As the CPI (ML) Liberation and other fractured smaller Left parties prepare for the 50th anniversary of the uprising, the preparations are low-key. The headlines have instead been hijacked by the BJP, after its president Amit Shah chose Naxalbari to begin his tour of the five states where the party is yet to make his mark including, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana. Addressing party workers, Shah said, This is the place where violence had started. Now this is the same Naxalbari where Modijis Sabka Saath, Sabka Bikash slogan can be heard. I have full faith that development will defeat the violence.On May 29, says Naxalbari block BJP president Dilip Barui, the party unit will be inducting 220 new members. Asserting that the party presence in the region once dominated by the Left is steadily growing, Barui says, Local leaders and workers from the CPM, Congress and TMC from Naxalbari, Matigara, Bagdogra, Batasi will be joining us.Barui also points out that in the last panchayat elections, held in 2014, the BJP won one or two seats in every panchayat. In the 2016 Assembly polls, its candidate came in third, close on the heels of the TMC. While the Congress-CPM joint candidate won, the BJP leader says the gap is closing. This is a Left-dominated area. But people know there is no point supporting the Left any longer. The BJP is the future.Abhijeet Majumdar, the Darjeeling district secretary of the CPI(ML) Liberation and the son of Charu Majumdar, says there is more to the BJP campaign than the tussle for Naxalbari. Amit Shah knows that there is only one faction that can stand up to the huge Hindutva surge in the country. After the BJPs victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections, he did not celebrate. Instead his statement was that the BJPs golden era would come only when Bengal and Kerala are taken. He knows it is only with the death of the Left that Hindutva can flourish in the country.The six gram panchayats that make up the Naxalbari block are a patchwork of old tea estates, but now there is a new rush in the air. The National Highway that cuts through the area is being widened to a six-lane road, flyovers are being constructed, hotels and flashy malls have sprung up. And once again, real estate is at a premium.However, unlike that time half a century ago, with its call of Langor jaar, jamin taar (land belongs to those who till it), the battle for land today is more insidious. There are no loud protests or gunfire as the new breed of landlords, the land mafia, mops up chunks. Mani Mahatos 22-year-old primary school for tribal children in Jharujote, a stones throw away from where Inspector Wangdi was killed, shut down in 2011. Well-respected in the area, he no longer teaches, instead selling chaat from a small stall.Mahato recalls how they had all got land after the 1967 movement. But several years ago, people claiming to be descendants of our landlords came, propped up by the land mafia. The mafia told us to give up our land in return for compensation. They also said we would have to fight long-drawn battles in court. We were all scared. So most of us gave up our land. I got Rs 2 lakh for my 1.5 bighas, he says.Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul)He adds that many descendants later turned out to be fake but, when the real ones came, they too struck a deal with the land mafia. The mafia has been selling off land to people from Manipur, Nagaland and Shillong. Nepali families who cant buy land there have come here to settle down. The land grab means that members of the 50-odd tribal families who live in the village and had tilled the land earlier are now daily wagers. Most people have left. They have gone to Kerala, Gujarat and Chennai in search of work, Mahato says.He admits he supported the BJP candidate in the last panchayat polls (he lost by a mere 40 votes). The CPM did nothing for us, nor did the TMC. When they first came to power, I thought maybe this new party will help. We have tried the Congress, the Left, the TMC. Let us give the BJP a chance.Among the early members of the Naxal guerrilla force was Kandra Murmu, 62, who continues to live in Bittan Jote, once a part of the Naxal liberated zone. Like his village, his life is sedate now. Hailing from a family of bhagchashis (share croppers), Murmu tills his one bigha of land. He used to grow paddy, now he grows jute. His son helps. But the battle for land has returned.Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul)When the andolan was over, Charu Majumdar made sure we all got land. Jotedars were eliminated and we got pattas. But it turns out that in legal government documents, the land still belongs to the landlord. I registered my complaint to the panchayat but nothing changes, he says. After a pause, he adds, Its not possible to take up arms again. That atmosphere is just not conducive.Murmu joined the Naxals when 12, and spent many years underground. He is sad at the fate of the agitation he gave some of his best years to. If it wasnt for Naxalbari, zamindari would still exist in the country. But farmers still dont have land rights. It is a different kind of battle now, more difficult. But the government and the political parties are self-serving.Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. We have received reports of this. But the government has issued pattas to tribal families to cultivate these plots and if they are selling these on their own volition, there is nothing we can do, she says, adding their hands are tied without a complaint. We have come to know plots are being sold to outsiders at Rs 3-4 lakh a plot. At some point, we will take action, she adds.Shanti Munda, 74, one of the most well-known faces of the Naxalbari movement, who joined the protests as a young mother with her newborn, says the situation is the same in her Hathighisa village, neighbouring Naxalbari village. There are no jobs here. People cant eat. In order to sustain themselves, they have sold off their land. As many as 16 tea gardens have shut down in the Dooars. In this area alone, four tea gardens have shut down. The government says it is providing rice at Rs 2 a kg for the affected tea garden workers. But you need to be able to earn to even pay that Rs 2, she says.Munda, who unsuccessfully contested the local elections in 1982, winning just 3,500 votes, adds that Modis people keep visiting her. They came one-and-a-half months ago, just before Shahs visit. They said, We will do the work here, what you tried with the bullet, we will bring with the ballot. Another time they came to me and said that they would construct a new village at Hathighisa, make it a model one.Nantu Ghoshs family has owned a Hero cycle dealership for over 35 years in Naxalbari town, which is like any other flourishing Indian town. Rows of shops selling electronics, garments, sweets, furniture jostle for space. The town was never that affected by the Naxals, Ghosh says. There is a BSF camp here, so they mainly steered clear. Nevertheless there was an atmosphere of fear.Now, the 60-year-old believes, the Naxal movement is finished for good. Nothing good can happen in India. There is so much corruption, all parties are the same. If the Naxals couldnt bring about changes, nobody can. We have a Congress MLA here but he won because of the alliance with the CPM. But the Left is waning too. We feel that if there is a party that can compete with Mamata Banerjee now, it is the BJP.Ghosh understands that much of what parties do is petty politics. But adds, The Naxal leaders are all dead Kanu Sanyal died in abject poverty. In this day and age, one has to look after ones family, you have to survive. You cant be a revolutionary.Naxalbari Sharada Shishu Tirtha Vidyalaya was established in 1999 by RSS swayamsevak Sujit Das, who is also the schools Pradhan Acharya (principal). It began as a single rented room in Naxalbari village, but by 2002 had amassed enough funds to buy a two-acre plot in a quieter part of Naxalbari town. The school now caters to 539 students, mostly from Rajbongshi (SC) and Adivasi (ST) communities, and has expanded up to Class VIII. It is one of the largest primary schools in Naxalbari and Das says the aim is to grow up to Class X. He says he has applied for registration with the Education Department. When we started, Naxalbari had just one government higher secondary school and some private primary schools. People wanted to send their children to school. They just didnt have anywhere to send them, says Das.Apart from regular schooling, the students learn yoga, moral science and music, where they are taught patriotic songs. Das says they are encouraged to eat vegetarian food.At shivir camps at the school, children stay for two-three days to learn the correct lifestyle, and are also taken to tribal areas and tea gardens to distribute clothes and food to the underprivileged. We have many such social activities. When Panighata tea garden shut down, we provided food to the 11 tea garden families for a month and a half, says Das.It helps that about 60 per cent of North Bengals votes lie in its tea gardens. Das is also the advisor to the RSS shakha which operates in Naxalbari town. While he does not reveal numbers, he says membership to the RSS is growing. Seventeen of Naxalbaris young swayamsevaks just left for Muslim-dominated Malda district for a camp.The Left realises the danger it is facing. Outside the office of the CPI(ML) Liberation, a large sign says: Resist the onslaught of BJP-RSS combine. As part of the Naxalbari Golden Jubilee Celebrations, the CPI (ML) Liberation has planned marches and a large public event at Siliguri, where Communists from across the country are expected to come. Seventy-five cultural activist troupes from across the country will perform.Sitting inside, beneath photos of Left icons such as Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong, Abhijeet Majumdar, laments that the Left remains disjointed to take on the BJP onslaught. Right after the BJP came to power in 2014, we held a Central Committee meeting in Delhi. We resolved that keeping in mind that the BJP had a corporate-fascist agenda, it was imperative that all the Left parties come together and form a united front. We even invited the Aam Aadmi Party. The first person to respond to this was Prakash Karat. But the initiative remained still-born.The vice-president of the TMCs Darjeeling district unit, Amar Sinha, insists they are not worried about the BJP. In Naxalbari, the BJP is basically the RSS. They are playing their usual dirty communal politics. We conduct awareness campaigns, explain to people what this is. No doubt, some are swayed by the BJP. But many are not.West Bengal Congress general secretary O P Mishra calls Shahs visit nothing more than good optics for the BJP. The Congress-CPM combine is strong here. Mishra also claims that the land mafia in the area is controlled by the TMC. Naxalbari is close to Siliguri and located at the foothills of Darjeeling. So the land prices have been going up. This is being exploited by the land mafia. But when the administration and police are partisan, it becomes difficult for us to do anything. With the tea gardens shutting down, the economic situation has worsened, making people more desperate. Shanti Munda says it may be too early to write the Left obituary. People believe that the Naxals are irrelevant, this is not true. It is not over yet. We will be back.Agrees CPI(ML) general secretary Partha Ghosh. Our numbers may have come down, the Naxals may have been wiped out, but every one who resists is a Naxal  the student in JNU who stood up to Smriti Irani, the Maruti factory worker who resists oppression, those in the movements against POSCO.To read this article in Malayalam, click hereFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

All it took was eight months for members of SayTrees to turn this no-man's land in Krishnarajapuram into a beautiful, lungspace.A pilot project of city-based SayTrees, an organisation comprising like-minded people, the initiative started in September 2016 with the planting of around 2,000 saplings on the plot measuring 600 sq metres. The land, located near the diesel locomotive shed close to the ITI campus in Krishnarajapuram, belongs to Indian Railways.""The objective of our project was to create an urban mini forest in Bengaluru to increase green cover. On September 24, 2016 we planted saplings of more than 40 tree species like neem, jamun, mango, banyan and others. The saplings have grown upto 10 feet now. In the next two years, we aim to make this forest more dense. We have named this forest Miyawaki,"" said head of partnerships and projects, SayTrees, Durgesh Agrahari.The team members chose the name since they adopted the Miyawaki plantation technique where saplings of different species are planted close together in a small pit with organic rice husk and coco peat to boost cultivation. Agrahari added that the plot was handed over to them by the railways as they were not using them. Authorities also provided support.Kapil Sharma, the founder of the organisation said they plan to create similar mini forests near Yeshwantpur railway station and near Bommasandra Industrial Area, soon. ""We are also in the process of creating a mini forest in Hyderabad wherein saplings will be planted on three acres of land,"" he said.Around 50,000 saplings have been planted so far by SayTrees near waterbodies, army/railway land and available vacant spaces across the city. Those who want to join the green cause can contact the organisation, which is looking for volunteers, by mailing them at info@saytrees.org."

The Minister also distributed tabs to the Agricultural Extension Officers (AEOs).The mobile app named Maa Bhoomi-Maa Panta (our land-our crop), designed with the cooperation of Centre for Good Governance, would help the AEOs collect the data about farmers. Based on the data, the AEOs would help the farmers by offering information on crop cultivation, management and other methods. The Minister said such a database along with soil health cards would help the government suggest crops suitable to farmers lands.Stating that the database would further help the government plan programmes for making agriculture a remunerative vocation, the Minister said the new mobile app would help the officials retrieve the details of cultivation within no time.Apart from providing the AEOs with Tabs, as announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at a recent meeting with them, training would also be given on compiling/uploading data.All the 2,800 AEOs in the State, including the 2,112 newly recruited, would be supplied with Tabs in a phased manner for carrying out the comprehensive farmers survey to have a proper databased on the 55 lakh-strong farming community in the State.RecruitmentThe Minister stated that recruitment of 1,000 more AEOs was already handed over to TSPSC and in addition to that, recruitment of 526 more would be taken up soon to ensure that there is one AEO per every 5,000 acres of agriculture land.The AEOs were also given 2,000 mini soil testing labs to help farmers cultivate crops suitable to their lands.Director General of CGG Rajender Nimje said the objective of the mobile app is to provide all details pertaining to farmers at one place.Agriculture Secretary C.

""I have got information from credible sources that Tewari could be a victim of the foodgrain smuggling mafia.This is what middle-level officials in Karnataka are talking,"" she said in the letter.Tewari's family has alleged that he was about to expose a food scam.Speaking to TOI, Karandlaje, who was the food and civil supplies minister from 20102012 in the state's BJP government, said: "" A lot of corruption happens in transportation of rice from the food and civil supplies department godowns to fair price shops. I have some ground-level officers telling me that he was looking into these irregularities.""Karandlaje claimed she had no reasons to suspect that anyone in Uttar Pradesh wanted to kill him. ""I have asked for a CBI probe as the case involves two states and it cannot be investigated by the Special Investigation Team of Uttar Pradesh alone,"" she added. With the CBI commencing probe, the state Congress government's Rs 4,400 crore per annum flagship programme Anna Bhagya, covering 1.08 crore families, may also come under the scanner. T he scheme envisages giving 7 kg rice per person to BPL families at Re 1 per kg.An RTI application filed in 2016 had pointed out to discrepancies in payments regarding procurement of rice for Anna Bhagya during 2013-2014. While the Chhattisgarh government claimed to have supplied rice worth Rs 346 crore to Karnataka which maintained it paid Rs 383 crore. The CBI is likely to look into more such lapses including pilferages during transportation of rice from godowns to ration shops.Officials, however, said that Tewari was barely a month into the food and civil supplies department to understand the public distribution system and associated pilferages to comprehend a scam as claimed by his family .Food and civil supplies secretary Harsh Gupta, who was Tewari's immediate senior, said he's not concerned overtly about the complaint lodged by his family . ""It's a sad situation. The cops will do their job and investigate. The truth will be out there for everyone to see,"" he said.Food and civil supplies minister U T Khader said, ""Our department does not have any opportunity for a Rs 2,000 crore scam as claimed by the officer's family . And even if there was one, he could have brought it to the notice of Governor, CM or me. Where is the evidence for the CBI to probe?""Chief minister Siddaramaiah has welcomed UP government's decision to recommend for a CBI probe in IAS officer Anurag Tewari's death. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, the CM said, ""We had written to UP CM Yogi Adityanath for a thorough probe."" Meanwhile, a section of the bureaucracy feared that the BJP-led Centre could use the CBI to indulge in witch-hunting in Karnataka on the pretext of trying to ascertain if Tewari was about to expose a scam. ""We want the truth but don't want parties to politicize his death,"" a senior IAS officer said. TNNLucknow's Mahanagar forensic science laboratory will not handle viscera and other samples collected from the crime scene and Anurag Tewari's body.Conceding to the demands of Tewari's family, Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar on Monday assured them that the exhibits will be sent to reputed medical science institutes elsewhere.Tewari's brother Mayank raised doubts on credentials of Mahanagar laboratory, its director and some of his subordinates. ""A joint director-level officer of Mahanagar laboratory tried to influence the panel of doctors who conducted autopsy, so we have apprehensions. The joint director wanted to show Anurag's death as natural and argued with doctors at the KGMU mortuary. Senior administrative officials know about it but have not done anything,"" said Mayank.Kumar said he will write to Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU and AIIMS and get the examination done. ""If need be, I will also approach the Central Forensic Science Laboratory,"" he said."

We even heard Tewari saying to some seniors over the phone that he will not let go of that file till he takes it to its logical end. We do not know with whom he was talking, but he was very furious.According to sources, Tewari was after the foodgrain purchase mafia.BJP MP and former minister Shobha Karandlaje, who has written letters twice to Adityanath, said soon after Tewari took charge as the commissioner, he started inquiring with the ground level officers on the quantity of rice and wheat that were purchased and transported to ration shops.He had sensed all was not well in the system and he knew about a scam in the foodgrain purchase. Shobha said, Tewari had prepared a report on the same and was about to submit it to CBI. But before he could do that, he was killed. I have learnt that his reports, the files that he kept for inquiry and CCTV footage of a godown have all been destroyed.A senior official from the department denied any scam. We purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India for `3 per kilo. Every month we spend around `145 crore for the same. The FCI is a Union government agency. We do not buy rice or wheat from the open market. Only in 2013, was there a shortage of rice.Then we purchased rice from the Chhattisgarh government. We have not purchased from any private agency. Where does the question of a scam or mafia come from? It is just a rumour that people and the media are spreading, he said.Tewaris brother Mayank Tewari met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday."

Tewari was a committed officer and had a good rapport with Gupta. He had not unearthed any scams as there are no scams at all, Gupta added.About the allegations that there was a scam in the purchase of rice for Anna Bhagya scheme from Chattisgarh, he said rice was purchased from Chattisgarh government in 2013-14 as per norms, after the approval of Karnataka Cabinet.After 2013-14, rice was not purchased from any state as Karnataka procured it from the Union government at a subsidized rate."
593addd87be9e07a5a19f8d5,Goa Heritage takes on social media avatar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goaheritage-takes-on-social-media-avatar/articleshow/58830984.cms,2017-05-25,"PANAJI: Back in 2005, the Goa Heritage Action Group (GHAG) converted the Latin quarters at Fontainhas Panaji , into a venue of an art festival. In the wake of this exposure, this heritage conservation area went on to feature as the backdrop in many advertisements and movies and the flow of tourists that followed helped some residents maintain their heritage houses.After a period of lying low, the GHAG is back in action - its eyes now set on conserving Goa's intangible heritage, including its language. The organisation will soon launch accounts on social media platforms, where Goans will be able to use the hashtag 'GoaHeritage' to share anything from a fading local fruit, vegetable or cereal, an almost extinct art or craft form or a festival unique to a Goan village.""The entire focus has been on built or natural heritage so far. But, other than galvanising GHAG members and revitalising the group, we now want to focus on our intangible heritage like our agrarian practices or traditional vocations. We want to highlight on 'grow local, buy local and eat local.' For instance, the local variety of rice is far more healthy and by buying it you can help the local farmer continue growing it,"" said the new GHAG honorary secretary Raya Shankhwalker Shankhwalker said that a social media presence will help promote the idea of preservation of heritage among the younger generation, who will be the torchbearers of the conservation mission in the future.GHAG also wants to work towards convincing the government to draw a comprehensive heritage list and guidelines for heritage conservation. ""At present, the focus is only on a small number of historical buildings and a few heritage conservation zones that were declared as early as the 1970s,"" said Shankhwalker.GHAG believes that Goa has a vast built-up heritage, stretching far beyond the currently listed structures, which needs to be assigned grades based on their significance, rather than ignored altogether, like the rapidly vanishing heritage houses in Panaji.""In the absence of such guidelines, routinely buildings are being demolished and changes are taking place to our historic temples and churches. In Europe, for instance, the core of the heritage zone is retained and development takes place around it, which model can be adopted in case of Panaji. In India, demolition of heritage structures is seen as an easy way of carrying out development. In India, conservation is seen as anti-development, which need not be the case,"" said Shankhwalker, and added that the manner in which revenue generating businesses grew within the precincts at Fontainhas, even helping conserve the nature of the houses, is an example that heritage need not be seen as opposed to development and commerce."
593e01207be9e00dabcc77ce,Connecting the dots after three years in the saddle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/connecting-the-dots-after-three-years-in-the-saddle/article18596515.ece,2017-05-29,"In 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the mandate to rule India and took power after 10 years of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule. The BJP-led regime has now completed three years in office  on May 25 this year  which is also a fair enough time to critically examine the track record of this government. I let the facts speak for themselves in light of a series of unkept promises.Upholding farmers welfareIn one of his Chai Pe Charcha programmes on March 20, 2014, Narendra Modi, then Gujarat Chief Minister, termed farmer suicides as a national agony and added that the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) shall stand behind all farmers hit by natural calamities like the recent hailstorms, or economic crises. I shall not be able to sleep peacefully till I do something for you. He wanted a system where with the infusion of modern technology, water resources and efforts to double agriculture output, farmers were not driven to end their lives. Thus his attention was focussed on ensuring farmer welfare.According to a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, titled Accidental deaths and suicides in India, 2015, the number of farmers who committed suicide was 8,007. The corresponding number in 2014 was 5,650. Thus there has been a 42% increase in loss of lives between 2014 and 2015. After blaming the UPA and its policies for farmer suicides, in the run-up to the 2014 general election and much after, this government now attributes suicides to reasons which it says have nothing to do with its policies.For instance, in reply to a question in Parliament on July 24, 2015, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh even cited among several other reasons, love affairs and impotency as key factors. To make matters worse, Haryanas Agriculture Minister, O.P. Dhankar, in a statement on April 29, 2015, termed farmers who commit suicide as cowards.Now back to Mr. Modi. Addressing a rally in Pathankot in Punjab, on April 25, 2014, as the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, he said: If the NDA comes to power, it will ensure remunerative prices to the farmers by adding 50% profit into the peasants input cost. In addition he said: We will fix the Minimum Support Price of crops incorporating 50% profit in farmers cost of production including seed, irrigation, manure, labour. And he ended by saying that no one will be allowed to loot farmers.Fast forward to February 2015. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Modi government did a U-turn, stating that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) cannot be fixed on the basis of cost+50 percent as that would distort the market. Between 2009 and 10, the MSP for paddy was Rs. 950 a quintal as against a production cost of Rs. 670 a quintal  translating to a 42% margin of profit for farmers.In 2015-16, the MSP for paddy was Rs. 1,410 a quintal against an estimated production cost of Rs. 1,324 a quintal, which is only a 6.5% margin of profit to farmers. It is clear that the procurement prices of wheat, paddy and other agricultural produce have been much less than the price received by farmers during the UPAs tenure.Between 2014 and 2016, the Modi government hiked the MSP of rice only by 3.9% per year. In comparison, during 2011 and 2013, the UPA increased the MSP of rice by 9.5% per year. For wheat, the figure is 4.1% per year under the Modi government as against 7% per year under the UPA.Bringing back black moneyAnother major issue for the BJP government has been the subject of black money. In his Chai Pe Charcha campaign, launched in Ahmedabad on February 12, 2014, Mr. Modi had said: The whole country is worried about black money... We will bring back each and every penny deposited abroad by Indian citizens. I am committed to this because this money belongs to the poor people of India and no one has the right to do this kind of anti-national activity.The facts. In the last three years, the Modi government has received the names of those with illegal bank accounts in foreign havens. Yet, they remain a closely guarded secret.On October 17, 2014, nearly five months after assuming office, the Modi government told the Supreme Court that it could not reveal the names of Indians with accounts in foreign banks due to double taxation avoidance treaties with other countries  a position taken by the UPA. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley dismissed the governments reluctance in revealing the names by saying: Is the present NDA government led by Modi in any way reluctant to make some names public? Certainly not. We have no difficulty in making names public. But they can be made public only in accordance with due process of law.The Modi government now states that any account opened after 2017 will be made public, pursuant to an agreement between India and foreign powers under the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) or the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Informations, an information standard for the automatic exchange of information (AEoI).The resulting question is this. Why not the names of account holders before 2017? This was a demand made on the floor of the House by the BJP and the rest of the Opposition who attacked the UPA for not revealing the names of account holders.Job creationLet me focus on another Modi promise  of creating one crore jobs. Addressing an election rally in Agra, on November 22, 2013, Mr. Modi had said, If the BJP comes to power, it will provide one crore jobs which the UPA government could not do despite announcing it before the last Lok Sabha polls. Incidentally, the point about farmer interests becoming paramount under BJP rule was also made at this rally.The facts. In the three years 2009 to 2011, when Indias GDP was still growing at an average 8.5%, the organised sector was producing on average 9.5 lakh new jobs every year. In the last two years, 2015 and 2016, average employment generation has plummeted to less than 2 lakh jobs a year. This is less than 25% of the annual employment generated before 2011. In 2015, employment generated in eight labour intensive sectors collapsed to an all-time low of 1.5 lakh jobs.By adding service sectors to the organised sector employment data, the figures show a slight improvement in the growth of new jobs in 2016. New jobs generated increased from 1.55 lakh in 2015 to 2.31 lakh in 2016. But this is still only 25% of the organised sector jobs generated in 2009.Data on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act show that unemployment continues unabated, and in fact seems to be worsening. In Mr. Modis first year as Prime Minister, 4.65 crore households demanded work in the scheme. In 2015-16, this number had increased by 15% to reach 5.3 crore. In 2016-17, it further increased by 6% to reach a staggering 5.69 crore households in search of work.Another promise  on the safety of women. In a public rally in Pune, on November 1, 2013, Mr. Modi, while accusing the Congress of failing to ensure safety for women in the capital, said: In spite of Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi being women, Delhi is known as the rape capital. People dont know who to trust anymore.Womens safetyInterestingly, at the BJPs National Executive in New Delhi, in January 2014, Mr. Modi, while speaking about empowering women and ensuring that they went from being homemakers to nation builders, said: What is happening with our mothers and sisters in the country leaves us shame-faced. Dignity of women should be a commitment.The facts. According to an NCRB report, though there was a slight reduction by 3.1% in crime against women in 2015 as compared to 2014, there was an increase of 2.5% in instances of sexual offences against women. There was also an increase in instances of kidnapping and abduction of women in 2015. Delhi recorded the highest overall rate of crime against women. Data from Delhi, the epicentre of the Nirbhaya rape protest movement, shows that, contrary to expectations, under a new government and with a new law  in 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013 or the Anti-Rape Bill, later called the Nirbhaya Act, came into existence  the number of rapes has gone up in the capital of India. As in Delhi, national data on rape too showed a substantial increase in 2015, when compared with 2012 data. In 2012, there were 24,923 cases while in 2015, there were 36,651 cases.Curbing inflationAnother Modi statement made in early 2014: The Congress had promised to curb inflation in 100 days, but did they live up to their promises? Dont trust those who betray public trust. If the governments of Vajpayeeji and Morarji Desai could stop price rise, why cant we? The BJP government in 2014 will do it, I assure you.The facts. Food inflation has not shown any trends of reversing. Instead, prices of essential commodities are on the rise, with pulses especially selling at Rs. 100-Rs. 150 a kg. Petrol and diesel prices continue to be raised with shocking regularity. Industrial production is down, the rupee is down and somehow people have stopped believing in GDP figures that this government relies upon.On corruptionFinally, I focus on yet another Modi promise  of delivering a corruption-free India. At a rally in Sujanpur, Himachal Pradesh, on February 16, 2014, Mr. Modi had said:  Mere liye na koi aagey, na peechhey. Kiske liye bhrashtachaar karunga (I have no family ties. I am single. Who will I be corrupt for)?He added, This mind and body is totally devoted to the nation. Then again on February 23, 2014, he tweeted: When we come to power, we will serve as Chowkidars who will never allow any Hand to loot coffers of our nation. Again on April 13, 2014, he tweeted: [The] NDA is firm on its commitment to create a corruption-free India so that best opportunities are created for our youth.The facts. There has been an increase  by 67%  in complaints received of corruption in various government departments. According to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), the Railways tops the list with over 11,000 complaints.The probity watchdog received a total of 49,847 complaints in 2016, as against 29,838 in 2015  an increase of about 67%, according to the CVCs annual report tabled recently in Parliament.Kapil Sibal is a former Union Minister and senior Congress leader"

Sujata stupa in Gayas Sujatagarh is where an old woman, Sujata, is believed to have offered kheer (a sweet dish prepared from rice and milk) to a frail Buddha, who got an energy boost after having it.READ| Sujatas great gift of madhupayasaIn absence of a motorable road, pilgrims have to now take a circuitous 25 km detour via Gaya-Manpur-Bhusundi, making it practically impossible for them to visit all the three historic Buddhist sites in Gaya and then proceed the same day to Rajgir in Nalanda, part of the Buddhist circuit.In a letter to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on April 26, pilgrims and monks have requested the government to construct a 5 km stretch of modern road, linking Buddhas meditation sites with Sujata Stupa and connecting it with Nalanda. For this, the government would also have to construct a 800-feet (approx) bridge over Niranjana river, the letter said.Connecting the Sujatagarh-Dungeshwari route with Rajgir-Nalanda highway would facilitate international tourists to cover maximum Buddhist sites in the state within a short span of time.At present, the Sujata-Dungeshwari cave route does not have an all-weather road. The one existing now is damaged and unmotorable. Tourists visiting Bodh Gaya take Gaya-Manpur-Bhusundi route to reach Dungeshwari, which is an extra distance of almost 25-28 kms. This wastes a lot of time and money, said Shashikant of International Meditation Centre, Bodh Gaya.International Buddhist monks and tourists, desirous of following Lord Buddhas footprints, trudge on this treacherous route from the Mahabodhi Mahavihara temple in Bodh Gaya to Sujatagarh and then to the Dungeshwari cave. The stretch being sparsely populated is considered unsafe for tourists, with many complaining of robbery and theft on the route, he added.Prajnadeep, general secretary of the All India Bhikshu Sangh, said a survey was undertaken in 2013 to construct the road, but nothing moved thereafter.Founder president of the Asian Buddhist Cultural Centre, Bodh Gaya, Bhante ST Anand, said that several meetings had been convened between the state and the Central governments on the issue in the last 35 years, but to no avail.Bhante Satyanand of Dr BR Ambedkar Buddha Vihar, Agra, who has trudged on this route on many occasions, said, One can perceive the difficulties of a traveller only if one were to walk on this route."
5a06b8659855b76bf13c69dc,Farm provides growth impetus,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170601/jsp/business/story_154524.jsp,2017-06-01,"New Delhi, May 31: A robust farm growth of 5.2 per cent in the March quarter pushed GDP growth up to 7.1 per cent. However, growth in the sector was lower than the previous quarter's expansion of 6.9 per cent. Farm growth for the full fiscal zoomed to 4.9 per cent because of good rainfall and record food-grain production compared with a near flat 0.7 per cent expansion in 2015-16. ""The third advance estimates of foodgrain production was 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, which is higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 million tonnes and final estimates of 251.57 million tonnes in the agricultural year 2015-16,"" an official statement said. Earlier this month, the agriculture ministry had released its third advance estimates for agriculture production in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June). ""The volume, spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon in 2017 would be crucial in determining kharif sowing and production dynamics. Following the record-high growth of most crops in 2016-17, our baseline expectation is that growth of agricultural GVA would moderate appreciably in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent in 2016-17,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist with ICRA, said. According to the data, rice production is estimated at a record 109.15 million tonnes, wheat at a record 97.44mt and pulses at an all-time high of 22.40mt. Coarse cereal production is estimated to be a record 44.39mt in 2016-17 against 38.52mt last year. The foodgrain basket comprises rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses. ""As a result of very good rainfall during monsoon 2016 and various policy initiatives taken by the government, the country has witnessed record foodgrain production in the current year,"" the ministry had said. With the Met department forecasting a normal monsoon this year, the government is expecting to break last year's record foodgrain production. ""While GDP numbers are subdued we believe that this was expected after demonetisation. We do not expect demonetisation impact to spill over in 2017-18 as multiple sectors are showing signs of recovery as well as a positive thrust from the normal monsoon,"" Vaibhav Agrawal, head of research, Angel Broking, said. The southwest monsoon yesterday hit Kerala and the Northeast, two days ahead of the scheduled arrival of the crucial seasonal rainfall. The news brought cheer to farmers, especially from the drought-hit states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. More than 50 per cent of the country's farmers rely on monsoon to grow their produce. The farm sector accounts for about 15 per cent of India's $2 trillion economy and 260 million farmers depend on the monsoon to grow crops such as rice, cane and cotton. Higher farm incomes lift the demand for an array of consumer goods such as cosmetics, television sets and automobiles, which boost overall economic growth."

There is enormous paper work that goes with it.Two goals are sought to be achieved: First, buying cattle for slaughter from cow markets, even for legal abattoirs, is now impossible; second, trade and transportation of cows for dairying, too, will become restricted, spelling doom for cow markets.Dairy cycle disruptedThe normal dairy economy assumes the life span of a milch cow to be 8-9 years, after which output tapers off and becomes uneconomical. The farmer thereafter sells his aged stock and uses the money to renew his livestock. In the normal cycle, the ageing stock goes to the abattoirs as meat for exports and skin for the leather industry. However, with a ban on slaughter in most states in place and abattoirs being forced to shut down, the dairy farmer is staring at a huge financial crisis: the resale value of cows has plummeted, and the farmers ability to renew and create a healthy stock is under serious strain; on the other hand, being forced to tend to uneconomical cattle has brought him to the brink of financial collapse.By the blanket ban on slaughter, the once prosperous dairy economy has been fractured. Besides putting thousands of butchers out of work, rearing of cows and bullocks has been on the decline. In Maharashtra, the average price of the milch cow has fallen to less than `50,000 a head compared to `65,000 two years ago. It has also led to abandoned herds of ageing cattle wandering about facing slow starvation and cruel death. With farmers increasingly turning to the buffalo, the recent government measures, far from preserving the cow, may in fact lead to its slow extinction.Exports hitBesides dairying, bovine meat and meat products are central to the countrys food chain and economy. India has the largest bovine  cattle and buffalo  population in the world, accounting for 200 million heads or 14 per cent of the worlds bovine stock. Nearly 80 million people consume beef in the country with domestic consumption touching two million tonnes.Though No 5 in the world in beef consumption, India became the highest exporter of beef (almost entirely buffalo meat) in FY15 trading 2.4 million tonnes (20 per cent of world exports), and dislodging Brazil for the top slot. Export earnings accounted for $4.8 billion in FY15, more than the country got from basmati rice exports! Beef exports dipped in FY16 on account of the lower global orders. Exports could decline further, if anti-beef campaign gains momentum. In Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of Indias exports, the closure of abattoirs and the general clampdown will have serious implications for export earnings and jobs.For the leather and fashion accessories industry, too, it is now going to be a grim future.Abhishek Waghmare, writing for IndiaSpend.org, estimates that the fall in global demand and short supply of hides, has led to the shutdown of 128 of Kanpurs 400 tanneries. Kanpur district is still a leading producer of leather and leather goods with a quarter or 268 of the countrys footwear factories and 40 per cent of Indias leather exports; but since 2014, leather exports have fallen 11 per cent.Dairying, beef production and exports, and leather and leather goods have been a rapidly growing segment of the farm and industrial economy. Unfortunately, vigilantism and regressive legislation is turning the clock back.(The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com)"

This year, the festival is being held on Thursday, 8 June. On Vat Purnima, women observe a day-long fast, tying thread around a banyan tree. Generally a three-day festival, some women extend their fast to all three days. As per the Hindu calendar, the Vat Savitri Vrat is observed on Jyestha Purnima or full moon of Jyestha month. Vat Savitri Purnima Vrat Puja 2017 muhurat begins at around 4:16 pm on June 8 and will continue till 6:39 pm on Friday, June 9. Vat Savitri Purnima was first referred in the epic Mahabharata in relation to Savitri Satyavan mythology.Go on to read more about the significance and importance of Vat Savitri Purnima or Vat Purnima (Wat Purnima) Vrat here.The festival Vat Savitri Purnima was first mentioned in the legend of Savitri and Satyavan in the Mahabharata. Rishi Markandeya first refers to the couple Savitri-Satyavan while narrating a story to Yudhistra, the eldest Pandava. Yudhistra had apparently asked the sage if any other woman is as devoted and dedicated to her husband as his wife Draupadi.The legend goes: Savitri, the beautiful daughter of the King of Madra Kingdom - Asvapati, sets out on a pilgrimage to find a husband for herself. She chooses Satyavan, the son of blind king Dyumatsena of Salwa Kingdom who's living in exile. She later comes to know that Satyavan will die after a year but nonetheless goes on to marry him. She assumes the life of a hermit and lives in the forest with her husband and in-laws.Three days before the predicted death of Satyavan, Savitri goes on a fast and performs severe austerities. On that day, Savitri accompanies her husband Satyavan, who's blissfully unaware of his impending death, to the forest. While chopping wood, something happens and he lies down, putting his head in his wife's lap. God of Death, Yama, comes to take away Satyavan's soul. Savitri follows Yama. Impressed by her dedication, wit and pure nature, he once again grants life to Satyavan.The fast that Savitri observed for three days later came to be known as Vat Savitri Purnima.On Vat Savitri Purnima, women worship Savitri as the goddess, offering nine kinds of fruits and flowers including rice grain, pulses, mangos, bananas, etc, as Bhoga. They also tie the sacred thread around the banyan tree."
593c71f57be9e00ed19a34eb,Opinion| Farmer protests:&thinsp;Rewrite the rules to stop this cycle of agrarian dist...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farmer-protests-rewrite-the-rules-to-stop-this-cycle-of-agrarian-distress/story-ahjhxzLpA2CtCSRTOjVUHM.html,2017-06-08,"The farm protests in Madhya Pradesh that left five people dead this week is symbolic of a wider agrarian distress engulfing India. Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The realisation to pitch in to check recurring agrarian crisis was over the fact that a large number of crops and state are facing discrimination in price support policy of central government as the minimum support price is effective only for three crops.Though the centre has put this issue on the medium term reform agenda which would take about five years to role out, government sources, said if implemented it can take burden off the shoulders of governments from large scale procurement of rice and wheat. It will be beneficial for both sincegovernments can directly pay to individual farmers the difference between the low price and reasonable price of a crop at the time of glut in the market, there won't be any distress due to volatility, government sources explained.The government is also in favour of revoking Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and other control orders issued by the centre and states on agricultural commodities. The centre and the states uses this instrument to check hoardingand black marketing of items but has failedto check sharp rise in prices as it happened in the past in cases of onions, pulses and sugar.At the meeting, top bureaucrats of Modi government acknowledged that it is difficult to monitor and track stock of thousands of small traders spread across the country. The restrictive regime invoked through such acts and rules has also discouraged private investment in large scale storage and marketing, it was felt during the confabulation Mishra had with other stakeholders from ministries of finance and agriculture.The centre believes that the government should exit and leave it to private players to operate and manage this side of the agri sector. At best, the government may formulate rules of the game for market players, sources said.Among the long term reforms the government intends to initiate is removal of restriction on future trading in agri commodities. And short term goals are liberalising contract farming, allowing direct sale by producers to wholesale buyers, industries and exporters, take fruits and vegetables out of the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) act and adopt model land lease law."

It diverts his mind and he has made friends on the Link Express. I forget all my worries for a while. We are like one family on the train. We reserve seats for each other, work together and head back in the same train, he says.Its a brisk life with no margin. Everyone brings his or her own lunch for the wage is too slim for a meal at a hotel. Wrap up time is 5.30 pm and the walk back to the railway station is only a little less frantic than in the morning. Down from the train on the other side, theres still the bus ride back to be essayed, and for most of them, its 10 pm by the time they reach home.Loki, whose return train is at 7.30 pm, says, I just have a little time to spend with my two sons. I put them to bed. Thats all the time I have with my family.He has a 2.4 acre farm. But this has to be done, drought or no drought. I have to work extra hours to save for my childrens future, says Loki.Express logicNanded Express 16594, which starts from Bengaluru and passes through Andhra Pradesh, brings passengers to Raichur early in the morning. It passes through Anantpur (Hindupur, Penukonda, Dharmavaram, Anantpur), Kurnool (Gooty, Guntakal, Adoni), Bellary (Kupgal), Mahbubnagar (Kosgi) and Mantralayam before entering Raichur through Matmari and Raichur town. Besides these travellers, people from Yadgir and Wadi also come to Raichur for work.People travel to bigger towns from surrounding villages during the drought months (February to May) before the rains in June and make Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a month if they are lucky to get work. They are paid Rs 300 to Rs 400 a day depending on their skills.The work is mostly on construction sites, which dot the town centre with many small BPOs and IT companies opening shop here. Raichur also has iron and steel and electrical goods industries, and rice mills. Real estate industry is seeing a spike with many small apartments being built. People who know a specialised work, like painting or plumbing, are paid the highest, and women get paid the lowest, Rs 200 or Rs 250 a day."

The realisation to pitch in to check recurring agrarian crisis was over the fact that a large number of crops and state are facing discrimination in price support policy of central government as the minimum support price is effective only for three crops.Though the centre has put this issue on the medium term reform agenda which would take about five years to role out, government sources, said if implemented it can take burden off the shoulders of governments from large scale procurement of rice and wheat. It will be beneficial for both sincegovernments can directly pay to individual farmers the difference between the low price and reasonable price of a crop at the time of glut in the market, there won't be any distress due to volatility, government sources explained.The government is also in favour of revoking Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and other control orders issued by the centre and states on agricultural commodities. The centre and the states uses this instrument to check hoardingand black marketing of items but has failedto check sharp rise in prices as it happened in the past in cases of onions, pulses and sugar.At the meeting, top bureaucrats of Modi government acknowledged that it is difficult to monitor and track stock of thousands of small traders spread across the country. The restrictive regime invoked through such acts and rules has also discouraged private investment in large scale storage and marketing, it was felt during the confabulation Mishra had with other stakeholders from ministries of finance and agriculture.The centre believes that the government should exit and leave it to private players to operate and manage this side of the agri sector. At best, the government may formulate rules of the game for market players, sources said.Among the long term reforms the government intends to initiate is removal of restriction on future trading in agri commodities. And short term goals are liberalising contract farming, allowing direct sale by producers to wholesale buyers, industries and exporters, take fruits and vegetables out of the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) act and adopt model land lease law."

In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."

5a0389759855b76bf13b7bee,Cattle slaughter crackdown ripples through India’s leather industry,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cattle-slaughter-crackdown-ripples-through-indias-leather-industry-4704080/,2017-06-14,"A shoe-maker poses for a picture in an underground workshop in Agra. (Source: Reuters) A shoe-maker poses for a picture in an underground workshop in Agra. (Source: Reuters)In the backstreets of Agras Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community.The election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred.Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry.Last month the Modi government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts  including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks.Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.Social TensionsMuch of Indias meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of Indias Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100.The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of Indias poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh governments move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industrys image.Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad.Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread, says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.Muqeems monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.Impossible TargetLike meat, Indias leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment.India is one of the worlds top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.Modi government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion  more than double todays level  by 2020 as part of a job creation push.But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production  a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.Companies say the governments leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow, Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.There were no comments on the same by the commerce ministry.In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.Sitting in his one-room shop in Agras leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.Modis election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits, he said in Lucknow, the state capital.Wider Industry HitIn the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpurs Small Tanners Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpurs leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent.Qureshi, from the butchers organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear, said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduisms social hierarchy once called untouchables are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month  down from 25,000  because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a months inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeems cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.He now earns 3,000 rupees  or $47  a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his fathers income supports three sisters and his mother.I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a05ee649855b76bf13c2017,The best of times  the worst of times,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-best-of-times-the-worst-of-times/article19034516.ece,2017-06-14,"The ongoing farmers agitation has taken on a shockingly violent form. Discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? But any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. This is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. This is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965.If this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? For long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. While there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural India. And just one look at the state of Indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. So solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.Use and abuse of soil, waterThe problem with Indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called Green Revolution of the 1970s. I use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. Yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. And India no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. But this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. It completely neglected two-thirds of Indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. There is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. Large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact on our soil and water. Deep drilling by tubewells to grow these water-intensive crops has happened without any reference whatsoever to Indias unique hydrogeology, where nearly two-thirds of our land is underlain by hard rock formations which have very low rates of natural recharge.This has meant that there is now a serious water crisis, with both water tables and water quality falling rapidly. We have arsenic, fluoride, mercury, even uranium in our drinking water, creating serious health issues. What is worse, to get the same increase in production, farmers have had to apply more and more fertilisers and pesticides over time. This dramatically raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate increase in production. More than 3,00,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last two decades, which has absolutely no precedent in Indian history.Sustainable agricultureSo what can we do to address these twin tragedies of suicides and violence by farmers? First, we need to transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture. This becomes even more urgent in the context of climate change. Large-scale evidence now exists that non-chemical agriculture has become a profitable alternative. As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on production. The biggest votary of non-chemical farming is the Prime Minister himself. He has also launched the Soil Health Card Scheme, which potentially enables farmers to more carefully manage input regimes. The government must announce a comprehensive package to give a green direction to the nature of subsidies in the sector.Second, we must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater to ensure that the water in our irrigation commands reaches the farmers for whom it is meant and groundwater is managed sustainably in a way that ensures that no one is deprived of their right to water for life. There is positive movement in both these directions within government except for some hesitation in going ahead with a new model groundwater Bill drafted by the Ministry of Water Resources. This landmark Bill seeks to replace archaic British Common Law from the 19th century, which has provided legal legitimacy to the over-extraction of groundwater that underpins the current agrarian crisis. The new law needs urgent adoption and advocacy with the States by the Government of India.On diversificationThird, we require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as livestock and fisheries, among the fastest-growing segments of the rural economy, which could be hurt by recent policy changes. We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat. This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic. The key change required here is aggressive and extensive procurement of these crops by the government. FCI procurement focusses only on rice and wheat although this year we saw some initial steps in the direction of procurement of pulses. This is a welcome move but needs to go much further. The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day meal programmes.Fourth, investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would enable farmers to move up the value chain. We cannot continue to have them dumping their vegetables and milk on the road. They should be processed before they are sold and farmers must get their due share in the value chain.Fifth, we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85% small and marginal farmers. This is why I am strongly opposed to farm loan waivers as they destroy the integrity of the banking system and potentially undermine the extraordinary anti-poverty initiative led by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of women across the country. So many of these extremely poor women, with more than 97% loan recovery ratios, have helped the banking system survive in remote rural India. All this great work of providing an alternative to the usurious moneylender-traders is threatened by loan waivers.Finally, we need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation.Demonetisation crunchWhile many cumulative factors have taken a toll on farmers over decades, more proximate factors explain the outbreak of extreme violence. Speaking to farmers and traders, it appears that demonetisation squeezed so much liquidity out of the system that traders did not have requisite cash to buy the farmers produce. Farmers also feel that persisting with imports, even after clear signs of a bumper harvest, further depressed prices. Having lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, I do not recall a crash in prices as dramatic as this years, that too in the peak of summer. In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of tuar, gram, soybean, grapes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk, garlic, cumin, coriander and fenugreek are at historical lows. And when this happens in crops with high costs of cultivation and inadequate government support, the impact is catastrophic, leading to what the Reserve Bank of India has called fire sales.

(File/Photo) Industry officials said the shock of ban, coming on the heels of crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover. (File/Photo)In the backstreets of Agras Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community. The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in Indias most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry.Last month Modis government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts  including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks.Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.SOCIAL TENSIONSMuch of Indias meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of Indias Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100.The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of Indias poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state governments move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industrys image.Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad.Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread, says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.Muqeems monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.IMPOSSIBLE TARGETLike meat, Indias leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara did not respond to requests for comment.India is one of the worlds top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.Modis government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion  more than double todays level  by 2020 as part of a job creation push.But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production  a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.Indias environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.Companies say the governments leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow, Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment. Indias commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment.In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.Sitting in his one-room shop in Agras leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.Modis election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits, he said in Lucknow, the state capital.WIDER INDUSTRY HITIn the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpurs Small Tanners Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpurs leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear, said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduisms social hierarchy once called untouchables are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month  down from 25,000  because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a months inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeems cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.He now earns 3,000 rupees  or $47  a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his fathers income supports three sisters and his mother. I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Ashok Sinha The monsoon will take another three-four days to hit Bihar, the Met department said on Thursday. Earlier, the rains were expected to arrive in the state between June 12 and 14. The monsoon usually arrives in Bihar by June 10. Though rain lashed Patna early morning on Thursday for nearly 45 minutes from around 5.30am, there was no respite from the scorching sun and high humidity - that made the temperature seem higher than it actually was - throughout the day. ""It feels like a heat wave,"" said Santosh, who works at a electronic goods shop on New Dakbunglow Road. ""It seems we have to make some offering to God to please him so that it rains here."" Patna Met director Sumendu Sengupta said: ""Monsoon has been delayed in the state by three to four days. Now it is expected to hit Bihar after June 17. We were expecting monsoon to arrive in Bihar by June 13 as a very strong low-pressure area was witnessed in the Bay of Bengal. However, the warm westerlies changed the direction of the trough line of the monsoon."" A trough line is an imaginary line that generally extends from west to east. Weather-related activities like rainfall and thunderstorms are very common in and around the region a trough line passes through. Sengupta attributed the early-morning showers to localised factors and a cyclonic circulation prevailing over the state. ""In this season (pre-monsoon), local systems develop frequently. This was the reason behind today's short spell of rain in the state capital,"" he said. The monsoon has not yet covered the entire country as it still eludes Bihar and Jharkhand, he said. ""We can say that the system responsible for the onset of monsoon is lying on the Bihar border and it will take another couple of days to break in the state,"" he added. A forecast by private weather agency Skymet said: ""A cyclonic circulation is embedded on the trough over east Uttar Pradesh. Due to these systems, good rain is likely to occur over Bihar and the foothills of east Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile Gangetic Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha may also witness thundershower activities during the next 24 hours."" A Met official said a western disturbance was seen over Jammu and Kashmir. ""Its induced cyclonic circulation is over Punjab and adjoining areas. It will rain over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Showers today in some parts of Bihar can be attributed to this factor also,"" the official said. At other places in the country there was excess monsoon rain, the official said, including over north-eastern states such as Assam and Meghalaya.As per Skymet, during the past 24 hours, the country received 49 per cent surplus rain. While the south peninsula is surplus by 29 per cent, central India has seen 42 per cent more rain than usual. ""The timely onset of the south-west monsoon is crucial for sowing of kharif (summer) crops such as paddy, and a deficit in rainfall may hit rice output,"" said Gopal Sharma, a farmer in Rohtas district."
5a03a06a9855b76bf13b8944,"Column | Once again, Punjab Agricultural University is under the knife",http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/column-once-again-punjab-agricultural-university-is-under-the-knife/story-f2NaX3dhBa5YIAIu0efyqO.html,2017-06-17,"The concept of state agricultural universities was based on generating wholesome integrated knowledge, understanding and application of science in improving productivity and production of field crops, horticultural enterprises and livestock in respect of both quantity and quality. In Punjab, farming is quite diversified. Mixed farming incorporates field crops, fruits, vegetables and livestock.With an objective to providing integrated solutions to problems faced by the farm sector, agricultural universities were set up in every state on land grant pattern of US universities. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was the second such university after the one at Pantnagar in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962. PAU played a leading role in ushering in the Green Revolution, especially in Punjab, and contributed in making the nation food self-sufficient.The university carved its place among the countrys leading institutions and has been recognised at the international level for its research output, quality of education and contribution in the development of the farm sector. In recent years, it has developed less-seeded kinnow, improved Bt cotton variety, high-yielding short-duration varieties of rice and the first zincated variety of wheat.In 2006, PAU came under the political knife, and a veterinary and animal husbandry university (GADVASU) was carved out of it, maiming it by one-fourth. Ridiculously, even the fodder section was transferred to the new university on the plea that animals eat it. One wonders why then by the same argument wheat, rice, corn, vegetables and fruits production should have not been transferred to the medical university because humans eat these products! However, the financial position of the government permitting, there could have been no objection to setting up a new university separately, which could compete, supplement and complement the research at PAU. Yet, to take away its departments, and divide assets, infrastructure and budget hit the very vitals of this academic institution, negating the integrated concept of growth and development of the farm sector.ANOTHER SURGICAL STRIKE?Now, once again, it seems some person(s) with access extraordinary to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is/are planning another surgical strike on the PAU, mooting a proposal to carve a horticultural university out of this institution, which, if pursued, will render the PAU a non-entity. Research and education in horticulture crops will need most of the same department as for other field crops such as genetics, bio-chemistry, molecular biology, entomology, plant pathology, food technology, farm machinery, soil and water engineering, agricultural economics and marketing, agriculture business management, agricultural extension etc. How can these departments be divided without debilitating the agricultural institution beyond repair!Stretching the same logic, should there be an independent vegetable university, fruit university, cereal crops university and pulse crops varsity? Though PAU as a premier institute catering to agricultural research and education in the state has been ranked number two by the Union ministry of human resources and development, the university itself needs strengthening financially rather than weakening through bifurcation.BETTER, VIABLE OPTIONSFor impetus to horticulture in Punjab, there are better and viable options. The first is to strengthen the fruits and vegetables departments along with other related departments through additional funding and staff positions. A centre of excellence in horticulture crops can be created within the university, which would complement the research activities of the above departments by focussing on basic and strategic research in horticultural crops. No additional infrastructure will be required. For a fund- starved state this is a better option.Another option is to strengthen specialised horticultural research in production areas. There is a northern belt where kinnow and vegetables are grown and the second is the south-western belt where mainly kinnow is grown. In these regions, PAU has its research farms that can serve as specialised centres of research. These should be research centres focusing on seed and nursery production of fruits and vegetables. The state government may provide additional land and funds for this purpose to the PAU.Yet another and the most important viable option to strengthen horticulture research in the state is to expedite the setting up of the Postgraduate Institute of Horticultural Research and Education (PGIHRE) in Amritsar, which has been approved by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The setting up of PGIHRE was announced by the Union finance minister in 2015. The institute is to be funded by the Centre and only land is to be provided by the state government.For research, land at Attari (Amritsar) and Abohar have been marked. This institute requires 10 acres near Amritsar for an administrative complex and residences. PGIHRE has the provision of more than 200 scientific positions for horticultural research and education. Funds earmarked for the institute by ICAR are held up due to delay in land acquisition for building the campus near Amritsar.This is the best option for the cash-strapped Punjab government. Under this option, long-term financial sustainability of the institute is also ensured.The state government must not commit the blunder of acceding to vested interests to carve out a horticulture university out of one of the top-ranking agricultural universities of the country and weaken agricultural and horticultural research in the state.It is hoped that the powers that be are listening.(The writer is the chancellor of Central University, Bathinda, and a noted farm economist.

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

From a food-short country with a begging bowl, Ms. Gandhi changed India to a rice and wheat exporter, said P. Chadambaram, former Union Finance Minister and Rajya Sabha Member. He was speaking at the birth centenary celebrations of the former Prime Minister at a gathering organised in the city on Saturday. Though many ministers and scientists are credited with the green revolution, no one can deny the fact that without the support of the Prime Minister the process was unrealisable, Mr. Chadambaram said, adding,After Mahatma Gandhi, the name easily recognised world over is Indira Gandhi, he said.Mr. Chidambaram, however, went soft on Ms. Gandhis declaration of State Emergency in 1975. Every historic figure had to be considered in relation to his or her historic context, he said, adding during Ms. Gandhis period, India had fought two wars, faced an acute drought and battled the worst conflagration of communal tensions. She had both the courage of conviction and examination. Though she declared Emergency she admitted it was a mistake in 1977, Mr. Chidambaram explained. No other leader had supported the deprived sections as much as Ms. Gandhi did, he said. The Congress realised through her leadership that it had to fight the causes of poverty.No one is backward. People are oppressed and driven to a deprived and backward condition. Ms. Gandhi brought out this distinction, he said. The Congressman said she stood against anyone who divided the country on the basis of religion and caste. TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, who was also part of the gathering, said Telugu-speaking States had supported all developmental reforms that Ms. Gandhi implemented.Raman Magsaysay award winner Shanta Sinha, who presented a paper on Ms. Gandhis rule, said, Indira Gandhi radicalised reform in the Congress party and the country.

Convicted for the dowry death of his wife, he has spent 18 years of his life in jail, 13 of which at Sampoornanand Shivir, an open-air prison in Uttarakhands Sitarganj.Set amid lush green fields, the jail was established in 1960 over an area of 5,965 acres.Sampoornanand, then chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh of which Uttarakhand was a part, promoted the concept.Balbir attributes the transformation in him to the unfettered life in the shivir, which is among the 28 unique open jails of India.General jails are cramped, there is no individual space and inmates there are mostly depressed. Here we are already part of the mainstream, he said.But all is not well at this unique jail. Its area has now shrunk to just 640 acres as a vast swath of its agricultural land was given away to the Sate Infrastructure and Industrial Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of inmates, referred to as shivir wasis, too dwindled from 500 in 2000 to 44 in 2017. We have urged the inspector general of jails to shift 50 prisoners from other jail to this camp so that the number of inmates is increased and we can have more hands for agricultural work, superintendent of the shivir TD Joshi said.The area of the jail has now shrunk to just 640 acres. (HT Photo)Giving some respite to those who are striving to protect the unique concept, the Uttarakhand high court, Nainital, recently ordered that not an inch of the land belonging to the shivir should be given to any agency for any work other than building of hospital or school.But inmates are not fully assured. Besides, there are many problems that still persist.There is no doctor on the campus. The 15- day home leave to inmates was withdrawn by the government five years ago.Inmates at the shivir live in huts on the fields and guard the crops at night. Sugarcane, wheat and rice are grown over around 200 acres of land by them.The inmates are categorised as pucca and kachcha shivir wasis. The pucca shivir wasis live in the fields as they are trustworthy. They can, however, move only within the fields of the jail and not beyond the open boundary. They are allowed to keep with them their families for a week in a month and are provided daily quota of rations. They have to cook their own food. The kachcha shivir wasis are considered less trustworthy and are kept in unlocked barracks."

It's just not milk or cooking oil, prized spices too are heavily adulterated, according to officials of National Institute of Nutrition ""Many times, papaya seeds are grounded and mixed with synthetic gum to make it seem like black-pepper.This happens as pepper is costly and mixing them with papaya seeds makes it cheaper for miscreants,"" Dr V Sudarshan Rao, a scientist from the Food Safety Division of NIN , told TOI.Following black pepper, the next most adulterated food item is fennel, which is mixed with sodium hydrosulphite. ""This is then blended with sawdust and brick dust and sold in the market as masala powder,"" said an official from Nutrition Society of India.Not just food meant for daily consumption, even cold drinks and ice-creams are mixed with high quantities of glycerol monostearate, an emulsifying agent, which is meant to be used in moderate amounts as prescribed by Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI).""People are not aware that in current times, everything we eat could be adulterated. Earlier, the practice was limited to mixing rice with stones to fudge weight. Now, it has become modern with miscreants using chemicals. Even mustard oil is sold by mixing it with a low-grade oil. There's no mechanism in place to curb this menace,"" said Dr B Sesikiran, director of NSI ""While the food regulator has to monitor, check and penalize people who adulterate food, nothing moves on the ground. Till punishment is harsh, you cannot expect to have safe food,"" he said.TIMES VIEW:While its a welcome move that cops have finally launched a sustained crackdown against adulteration of spices and other food items in the city, efforts must be made to ensure that these traders do not get back to their old practice. Authorities should also ensure that these offenders get strict punishment and are not allowed to get away with minor penalties for playing with lives of people on a daily basis."

This is the second such case in the state. The infant, who hails from Kondhwa, is in a stable condition and has been admitted to a private hospital in the area, said Dr Kalpana Baliwant, in-charge of the Insect Control Cell at the Pune Municipal Corporation.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that the serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and primarily affects children.However, Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, These are sporadic cases and our surveillance network has been able to pick up the cases. The first one was from Raigad district and the second case this year is from Pune.The virus that causes JE is transmitted by the culex species of mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields as well as in water-logged areas of urban regions. The disease has assumed epidemic proportions in pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal, with sporadic cases reported from Maharashtra.According to Awate, the problem-prone areas in Maharashtra are Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia. Last year, 12 cases of JE, and one death due to the disease, were reported from the state; two of the cases were from Pune.As many as 100 houses around the society at Kondhwa have been surveyed for the culex mosquito, said Baliwant. We conducted the container surveillance for the last four days and have not been able to find the mosquito. The parents had taken the baby to Mumbai 10 days ago, and its likely that the infection was picked up from there, she said.Awate said field officers from the state entomology section had carried out their own survey. We are waiting for the report but in all probability, it is a sporadic case. Most JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms. However, one in 250 infections result in severe clinical illness, according to the World Health Organisation. JE is a serious virus infection resulting in the inflammation of the brain. The disease is characterised by the onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, coma, seizures and spastic paralysis, he said.This year, 111 JE virus cases and 20 deaths have been reported from across the country. A majority of the cases are from UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. Last year, there were 1,676 cases and 283 deaths in the country, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.Meanwhile, PMC officials have urged local residents to take preventive measures and ensure there are no mosquito breeding sites nearby. While carrying out the container survey PMC officials found the dengue causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito breeding site at a swimming pool in the same society. We have slapped a fine against them, said Baliwant.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a06149c9855b76bf13c388e,Along Cauvery  burned down by drought and debt,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/along-cauvery-burned-down-by-drought-and-debt/article19143743.ece,2017-06-25,"Emptying the rice bowl:Agricultural labourers in many areas in Tiruchi district are now working in brick kilns after the failure of their crop; below, the Cauvery in spate after a heavy monsoon in 2006 and the dry riverbed in May this year.M_MoorthyM_MoorthyOn June 12, the customary date on which the Mettur dam in Salem district is opened to provide water to the lower reaches of the Cauvery, the riverbed stretched as far as the eyes can see, barren as a desert. P. Ayyakannu, the farmer-leader who recently led a series of protests against the Centre and the State demanding drought relief, said, It has been six years since the dams gates were opened on time, and you can see the state of the river for yourselfand pro-Kannada organisations are calling for a bandh demanding two more dams in their State to tap the rivers water. Where are we to go then?The Cauvery irrigates eight districts in the main in Tamil Nadu  Erode, Karur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam  and it journeys eastward towards Nagapattinam district, where it finally drains into the Bay of Bengal. Following two consecutive years of failed Northeast monsoon, Tamil Nadu suffered its worst drought in 140 years in 2016-17. The entire State was declared drought-hit in January this year.Six months on, little appears to have been done by the State to remedy the situation. In six badly-affected districts, The Hindu found that farmers were beginning to grow tired of the blame Karnataka strategy adopted by the government every time there is a water crisis. Farming operations have come to a virtual standstill, and only those with deep borewell irrigation or those cultivating on the riverbed could be seen carrying on with regular cultivation. While Karnataka has already built adequate dams on the Cauvery to tap its water upstream, farmers in Tamil Nadu are angry that the State has done little in terms of implementing similar measures.Inadequate rainfall during the Southwest monsoon in 2016 affected the upper riparian state of Karnataka as well, resulting in its inability to allocate to Tamil Nadu the 2,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day as mandated by the Supreme Courts order of 2016. As on June 21, the inflow to the Krishna Raja Sagar dam in Mandya, Karnataka, was only 1,275 cusecs (as per government figures), most of which goes towards meeting the drinking water requirements of major cities in Karnataka.If you look at the total amount of water allocated for Tamil Nadu by the Cauvery Water Tribunal, Karnataka is only to provide 192 tmcft [thousand million cubic feet]. The remaining 227 tmcft is to be gained from Tamil Nadu. So the State too needs to do its bit to tap into the Cauverys potential for irrigation, said P.K. Deivasigamani, who heads the Tamil Nadu Joint Farmers Association, based in Erode. In 2014, Rs. 400 crore was allocated for building a check dam across the Kollidam River on the Nagapattinam-Cuddalore border, which could help meet the drinking water and irrigation requirements of the region, but the State government has not taken any action till date, he said.S. Janakarajan from the Madras Institute of Development Studies told The Hindu that across several districts in the State the problem of mining water was beginning to surface. Mining water refers to the stage when withdrawal of groundwater reaches a point where it is beyond replenishment. This was especially the case with the non-Cauvery delta irrigated zones such as Madurai, Theni, and Ramanathapuram. In coastal areas, sea water intrusion has resulted in the water turning saline. Half of Tiruvarur district now has saline water, he said.Even in the Cauvery delta regions, the groundwater table has fallen sharply, and the area under crops has come down drastically. In Thanjavur, kuruvai cultivation is only 1 lakh acres as against 4.5 lakh acres in a usual year, Prof. Janakarajan said, adding: Even samba cultivation is very uncertain due to low water levels in Mettur reservoir.Sand mining rampantSand mining is rampant in the Cauvery and its distributary, Kollidam, affecting its water retention capacity and quality of groundwater in nearby areas. While driving down the Karur bypass road from Tiruchi, we came across a 5 km-long queue of over 300 trucks on the side of the road waiting to extract sand from the Cauvery near Lalapet.A casual enquiry with one of the drivers revealed that trucks had lined up for 2-3 days outside the mine, near Pettavaithalai, and the quarry had dug deep into the riverbed such that a man could be buried in it standing upright. The same could be witnessed at Thiruvasi on the Tiruchirapalli-Namakkal Road where over 10 such sand quarries operate within a 10 km stretch. Inquiries with the police stationed outside the quarries revealed that about 350 trucks operated at each of these quarries every day. Sand mined from here fetches about Rs. 1,150 - Rs. 1,300 per truck load locally and was supplied across Tamil Nadu and to nearby states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka too. In the cities, the sand is purchased for a rate of Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 14,000 per truck load and sellers thus make a killing.N. Ramachandran, a block coordinator for the Tamil Maanila Congress, and owner of a banana plantation in Uraiyur, Tiruchi district, said that due to the quarrying operations from Thiruvasi onward, fields within the 10 km radius have been severely affected by falling groundwater levels. The miners use earthmovers to dig deep into the riverbed, sometimes going up to 20 feet deep. If they hit on some water stream beneath, the miners use a motor to drain the water off, before beginning to extract sand again. This has left red blotches on the surface of the riverbed, he said.When it rains on such a surface, the clayey soil beneath the sandy upper layer of the river mixes with the water to form mushy puddles, with none of the water percolating below to recharge the river naturally. It also leads to accidents, with goats grazing the riverbed or people crossing by slipping into the pits left behind by miners, residents say. As one drives towards Karur from Tiruchi, the coconut trees in groves on both sides of the road begin to wilt and disappear as the sand mines approach.In spite of the drought, the Cauvery and the Kollidam rivers continue to supply drinking water to 20 out of the 32 districts in Tamil Nadu. The Community Drinking Water Schemes, run by the State government, have caused great resentment among local residents in Thanjavur district, where many of these projects operate.In Anaikudi, a village in Thiruvaiyaru taluk, Thanjavur, a sugarcane farmer S. Selvaraj reportedly committed suicide last month after attempts to extract water for his farm using a bore well failed. He had spent a large sum of money installing it. His wife Rasathi told The Hindu that her husband had lost all his investments in agriculture and the sugar mill to which he supplied sugarcane had not settled his dues. He had a debt of nearly Rs. 4 lakh and was unable to repay the bank. The family hasnt received any compensation from the government.About a kilometre away from here, a long pipe carrying drinking water under a government community drinking water scheme from the Kollidam River, goes to Pattukottai. At the pumping station, where a trial is currently underway, two motors were running, each pumping out 6,000 litres of water per minute. Villagers who protested the drawing of water from here say false cases were foisted against them to suppress local dissent.Deepening distressMany farmer families and agricultural labourers have begun to seek wage labour outside their villages out of desperation. In Thiruvalarsolai, near Tiruchirapalli, we saw farm labourers working in brick kilns to make ends meet.P. Periyasami, who owns 2 acres of land in Thanjavur district, migrated with his family comprising his wife, two daughters and a son to this place to bake bricks after his paddy field failed to yield for three consecutive years. We get paid Rs. 1-1.50 per brick and earn about Rs. 100 per day. The money is better in farming, but with no water available we have no choice but to work here, he said. He pointed to a tiny, straw hut on the corner of the road, Thats where we live.If this is the case in Thanjavur district, a relatively prosperous agricultural belt, the situation is worse in places that lie outside of the Cauvery irrigation zone. In Peragambi, near Siruganur, Tiruchi district, lemon farmers are buying water for Rs. 4,000 per tanker load to irrigate their withering fruit-bearing trees. The trees arent eligible for crop loss compensation from the government. C. Selvaraj, who had been growing the trees for the last six years, said, Its only this year that the trees started bearing fruit and theres no water. Half of them have withered. Im trying hard to keep the rest alive spending Rs. 30,000 per month watering them thrice.Not very far from Peragambi and Vazhaiyur is the Sanamangalam eri , a lake that stretches over 8 acres. While driving down the Chettikulam-Peragambi Road, we came across this lake that was covered entirely in thorny bushes. No one would identify it until someone told them that this was a lake! Less than a kilometre down the same road MNREGA workers sat resting under the shade of trees. They had just completed digging a small canal for irrigation here.When we inquired as to why the eri was not taken up for clearing as it would help store water, the workers said that it came under the PWD and the village panchayat could not commission any clearing work in it. Farmers in Nagapattinam district had complained to us that work on dredging silt from a major irrigation canal, under PWD supervision, was progressing slowly. They say with some irritation that the officials seem busy overseeing sand mining operations with police protection.Farmers growing Bt. cotton in Peragambi, Vazhaiyur and border areas of Perambalur district had mortgaged all their family jewellery and now risked losing them to bank auctions. A source in NABARD told The Hindu that a majority of farmers in Tamil Nadu had taken crop loans against gold jewellery.Most often when the farmers failed to repay the loans, the banks recovered it by auctioning the jewellery. In spite of the Madras High Court direction to waive off loans and RBI (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas Affected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2016, asking banks to restructure loans of farmers affected by drought, banks have continued to send notices for loan repayment to farmers who failed to return crop loans borrowed last year.In Kadichambadi village, Kumbakonam taluk, Thanjavur, we met Aruljothi Murugan whose father Rengasamy, 78, died last month unable to bear the shock of crop loss. His total outstanding loan amount was Rs. 32, 263. The family continues to get notices for repayment from the bank.Three days after his death we received Rs. 10,000 as crop loss compensation from the government. But can we bring the dead man back? his wife Amisham, 65, asked.Usually, in times of distress such as these, farm animals provide some back-up for income generation for farmers. But with the agrarian distress deepening, maintaining livestock has become a challenge. G. Ravi of Panchanadikkulam, Nadu Setti in Vedaranyam taluk, Nagapattinam district, says he lost his father due to crop loss last year. He owned two cows given free of cost by a charitable organisation a few years ago. Feeding and maintaining them required Rs. 100 per day. But the 2 litres of milk he got from the cow fetched only Rs. 50 when sold. He owes Rs. 3 lakh to a private moneylender and Rs. 25,000 as bank loan.What should I do, he asks, Feed the cows or keep myself alive?"

Insiders, however, recalled that the name of Kovind, along with that of Droupadi Murmu, was all along on their mind since they were picked by the prime minister to occupy the Raj Bhavans in Patna and Ranchi two years ago.A soft-spoken Kovind made it a point to call on veterans L K Advani as well as Murli Manohar Joshi to take their blessings after his name was announced. On the day of his nomination, Kovind held on to the hands of Advani and Joshi to show everyone that the seniors, who could have felt left out of the race, were also supporting him. Finally, Modi too was seen holding Advani's hands as cameras clicked away.Shekhar Iyer, New DelhiQuick planThe Opposition is already rattled by the JD(U)s support to BJP Presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind. Therefore, it was no surprise that the parties did not want to leave anything to chance when they met to choose their candidate on June 22. While Uttar Pradesh-based parties SP and BSP were in a tight spot because Kovind hails from the state, NCP chief Sharad Pawar was wavering on whether to announce a candidate on the same day.Opposition leaders were still uncertain if all their plans would fall in line when they turned up at the meeting that decided Meira Kumars candidature. It was then that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury came up with a plan  get the signatures of the leaders of 17 parties on Kumars nomination papers at the meeting venue itself before venturing out of the room after the press conference.Shemin Joy, New DelhiSharmishtas strikesPresident Pranab Mukherjees daughter Sharmishta Mukherjee has not minced words in criticising West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her governments mishandling of the Darjeeling agitation. Blaming her for triggering a huge crisis during peak tourist season in the hills, she reminded the chief minister that the language issue had to be handled carefully. In a newspaper article, Sharmishta recalled several instances when row over languages even led to creation of a new country, like Bangladesh, and trouble over Hindi left a divide in the south in the 1950s and 1960s.Sharmishtas piece has come as a surprise to many. Only two months ago, Mamata was not averse to backing her as a Rajya Sabha candidate from the state if the Congress nominated her. Considering that West Bengal CM has had close ties with her father, Sharmishtas criticism of Didi has set tongues wagging. So far, Sharmishta had confined herself to Delhi politics. But is she considering her home state of Bengal for future course of action?SI, New DelhiRice blackmailWith rumours of plastic rice spreading on the social media, the owner of a hotel in Chennai claimed that a few persons, supposedly from the media, threatened to spoil the image of his restaurant if he did not take care of them. Two persons argued with Kumar, the restaurant owner, and said that the food they had bought from his restaurant was of bad quality. The hotelier apologised and returned the money. However, the duo returned that evening with two others, who claimed that they were from the media. They said that the rice used by the hotel was plastic rice.Though Kumar reasoned with them that even the government had clarified that there was no plastic rice, one of the mediaperson started bargaining. He demanded money from me and threatened that if I fail to offer, he would publish a news against my hotel, Kumar said. It was only when Kumar said he would lodge a complaint with the police, that the four left the place.R Sathyanarayana, ChennaiSenas recordVeteran Congressman Narayan Ranes son Nitesh Rane, had taken a dig at the Shiv Sena by writing to the Guinness World Records to feature a place in the record books for the most repeated threats to withdraw from a government. In the letter, Rane Jr, an MLA from Kankavli in Konkan, said: We would like to register a record on his (Uddhav Thackerays) behalf for announcing a number of times that his party Shiv Sena would withdraw support to Maharashtra government.The Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray is an ally of the BJP in the Devendra Fadnavis government. The two parties have been in an alliance for close to 25 years, but there has been a blow hot-blow cold kind of a relationship between them.Mrityunjay Bose, Mumbai"

Speaking on the occasion, BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa said that as many as 20,000 workers will participate in the programme and all the 54,431 electoral booths in the state will be covered.The booth reach-out initiative is said to have been one of the factors that helped the BJP win the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.The workers will visit places they have been assigned and stay there for 15 days. They will interact with voters, create awareness about the programmes of the NDA government, expose the misdeeds of the state government and visit local leaders, Yeddyurappa said.Yeddyurappa accused the state government of claiming credit for programmes initiated by the Centre. The state government was providing rice to the poor under the Anna Bhagya scheme utilising the grains provided by the Centre. He said the Centre was procuring rice from the open market at Rs 32 per kg and providing it to states at Rs 3.

5a0b40f79855b76bf13cd781,Why Indian farmers are distressed?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/info-nomics/why-indian-farmers-are-distressed/,2017-07-07,"On the eve of Uttar Pradesh (UP) election, Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi promised if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins then farm loan will be waived. BJP won, and the farm loan was waived-off. Sensing a case of political opportunism other states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka  joined the farm loan waiver bandwagon. Farmers usually take loan to grow crops and to buy farm equipment. However, waiving off farm loan does not makes sense economically. The cause of farm distress lies somewhere else. We find reasons for a farmer not realizing the market price has to do with inefficient supply chain management, with farm distress getting augmented because of lower farm size holding and lack of irrigation facilities.Between 2012 and 2015 over 10,000 farmers committed suicide. Globally, India has second largest amount of arable land (next only to USA) but less than 35 per cent of this land comes under irrigation. Fluctuation in Indias agricultural output is due to supply-side shocks resulting from inadequate rainfall. Investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification, rain water harvesting, and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures. Additionally, other factors such as lack of reforms to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power resulting from small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities are also important.If various state governments can addresses these issues it will be beneficial for the farmers than waiving-off farm loan.In India, not only percapita agricultural income is low, and but at times it is not possible to sustain this low income. Also, agricultural output fluctuates more than the outputs of the industrial and services sectors. Official output data shows that during the period between 1991-1992 and 2013-2014, the coefficient of variation for agricultural output is 191.34, in comparison to 50.48 for industry, and 22.03 for services sector. This has led to unequal income distribution in India with rural-urban wage gap at 45 per cent in comparison to around 10 per cent for China and Indonesia. Some 850 million people still live in rural India. India has around 260 million people living in poverty and 80 per cent of them live in the countryside. Increasing and sustaining farm income is important if India wants to reduce poverty.Majority of farming(65 per cent) is rain-dependent. Volatile rainfall patterns lead to lower farm income. The median annual wage for a farmer in India is around US $290 which is barely two months minimum wage in Mumbai  the commercial capital of India. Because of lack of proper irrigation facilities, and weather insurance schemes, farmers typically get stuck to growing low-value crops such as rice and wheat, although there is an ever increasing demand for high-value stuffs such as fruits, and vegetables.Inefficient supply chain management equally contributes to farm distress.In India, if farmers are to sell their produce, they have two options. First is to sell directly to the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in government outlets such as Food Corporation of India (FCI). MSP is the minimum price for a product established by the government and supported by payments to producers in the event of the market price falling below the specified minimum. The second option is to take their produce to the nearby government-designated mandi (market)where in front of state officers they can auction produce to the brokers. Mandis are the markets in smaller towns and cities to which farmers from nearby villages bring their agricultural produce to sell. There are around 7700 government designated mandis spread across India.Typically, MSP is higher than the market price, and one would assume that farmers gain every time the government announces the MSP. However, farmers are seldom able to sell their produce at the MSP. Every village does not have government outlets. FCI has a minimum presence in other major rice and wheat producing states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa. Compared to all-India average of 7340 farmers suicide committed between 1995 and 2010, only West Bengal has higher suicides numbering 19331 between 1995 and 2010. The corresponding figures for Assam, Bihar, and Orissa are 3566, 1235, and 4460, respectively. And, even if there is a FCI outlet, the government may not procure if the farmers bring their produce before/after the dates of procurement. The farmers are at whim of local traders and are forced to sell their produce in the informal market.In India, as much as 83 per cent of the farmers are smallholders, with less than 1 hectare of landholding. These marginal farmers do not have access to cold storage, and have no option but to sell their produce to the middlemen or traders. It is impossible for them to get a space in the state storage facilities without any political connection, and also because the smaller farmers do not have wherewithal to book crate in warehouses. Lack of reforms in the APMC Act prevents these small farmers to sell directly to supermarkets, exporters, and agro-processors. This prevent contract farming which otherwise can entail better price realization for these farmers.Rather than waiving-off farm loans there is a need to rise above party-politics and ensure reforms in the APMC Act. According to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report move to waive-off farm loan is likely to cost various state exchequers a whopping $40 billion (around 2% of Indias GDP).Timely procurement through MSP and training for increasing agricultural productivity will also help. Indias neighbor China produces more wheat and rice in spite of having lesser area of land cultivated in comparison to India. Finally, instead of spending on blanket subsidies (favoring the big farmers), investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification,rain water harvesting and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures."

(Representational image) Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image)THE COMMITTEE for revision of wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarentee Act (MGNREGA) has found that minimum agricultural wages are higher than MGNREGA wages in 15 states. An upward revision in MGNREGA wages is estimated to require a Rs 4,500 crore increase in its budget.Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month.As per data being examined by the committee, the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers are significantly higher than MGNREGA wages in Karnataka, Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The other states where MGNREGA wages fail to match up are Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the minimum wages are marginally higher than MGNREGA wages.In the 15 states where MGNREGA wages are lower, we tried revising it to bring it on par with the minimum agricultural wages paid by the respective states. Where MGNREGA wages are on par or higher, we decided to protect it as it is. If a revision is done as per this formula, it is estimated that a Rs 4,500 crore addition to the existing MGNREGA budget would be needed, said an official from the Ministry of Rural Development.The Indian Express had earlier reported that despite official claims of this years MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore being the highest ever, the wage revision, at 2.7 per cent, was the lowest ever. It meant a per day, per person wage hike of merely Re 1 in some states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Rs 2-Rs 3 in several others.This was because the finance ministry, on account of financial implications, rejected the recommendations of the S Mahendra Dev committee, which had proposed to bring MGNREGA wages on par with minimum wages paid to unskilled agricultural workers in the states. The expert panel had said that the Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the current consumption pattern of rural households, should be the basis for revising MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL), which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983.The basket of goods for calculating CPI-AL comprises mainly food items. With the implementation of the National Food Security Act, rice and wheat is available for as cheap as Rs 2-3 per kg. CPI(Rural) gives lower weightage to food items, and hence, is found to be a better indicator of wage increase, said a ministry official.The Nagesh Singh panel has found that based on the second recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, if the existing MGNREGA wages are revised as per CPI(Rural), it would mean another Rs 600 crore increase in the budget.CPI(R) should be used to revise the wages every year instead of CPI(AL), as the former is more representative of the current rural consumption basket. Also, wage revision should take place every six months, in keeping with the practice for other trades and occupation, said Ankita Aggarwal from the peoples organisation, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha. Aggarwal said that with such low wages and delays in payments, MGNREGA fails to provide the livelihood security for which it was enacted.Jharkhand Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma had recently written a strongly-worded letter to the Ministry of Rural Development protesting against the growing divergence between the states minimum wage, which is currently Rs 224 per day, and MGNREGA wages of just Rs 168 per day after the wage hike.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The entire forest which was segmented according to its resources, used to be leased out to contract for harvesting hone, medicinal herbs and wood among others for an annual revenue of Rs 30 crore.Everyone was dependent on the forest. Contractors for their money, administration for the revenue and locals for their day to day needs, said Mohammad Zagir, a local environmentalist.Very few people cropped paddy in their fields, they used to buy rice and wheat from the money earned from selling wild fruits or their salary from the forest contractor they used to work for, he said.All that changed after June 2014.The forest guards stopped villagers from entering inside the forest. We were going into the forest to collect grass for our cattle when the guards stopped, said Dinesh Verma 38, a farmer of Pipariya village, who was arrested for trespassing, something uncommon for villagers.Since then, conservator of forests VK Singh said 109 villagers have been arrested (mostly in the first year) for trespassing and it was important to deter them from entering the forest.There has been no poaching between 2014 and 2017. A burgeoning big cat population  up from 28 to 54  also meant that tigers have started moving out of the core areas.Despite the danger of lethal attacks, many of the villagers sneak into the reserve to collect forest produce for sale. And they are now up in arms against the national animal.Because of the shape of the reserve, the animal passes through human habitation while moving from one part of the forest to other. This has led to several attacks, Singh said, adding that three deaths reported early this year happened between two sections of the forest having high human habitation in between.The reserves 670km boundary is interspersed with farms mostly in the regions of high tiger kill and is fragmented by three national highways, two state highways, 47 district roads and over 20 smaller roads. In many places, the buffer between farms and reserve is as thin as 10 metres and poor farmers like Nankhi Devi, who was allegedly killed by a tiger on July 1, cannot afford a fence for their minuscule land holdings.Neither can the forest department.The cost (Rs 26 crore for 670km) is almost 80 times of our annual revenue. We do get some funds from the government but it is not enough. We do not have enough money for it, divisional forest officer of the reserve Kailash Prakash said.The locals find forest department suggestions like not entering the forest and making loud noises while working in fields weird.They tell us to visit our farms in groups, not go near the forest, make loud noises while working and this and that...why dont they control their animals. If they cant do it we will make arrangements for these tigers. We know how to protect ourselves, said Pankaj Kumar, 22, whose father was killed by a tiger while working in his farm on June 20.Experts say unless the green corridor connecting Pilibhit reserve with Surai national park of Uttarakhand and Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary of Uttar Pradesh is improved for easy passage of excess tigers, the conflict will continue."

A cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the IRRI regional centre in Varanasi aimed at boosting paddy production in eastern India, parts of Asia and Africa.Varanasi is parliamentary constituency of Narendra Modi and is also located in the eastern UP .Speaking to TOI, IRRI consultant Mukesh Gautam that Union government had approved the regional centre and most probably the prime minister would inaugurate it soon. Gautam added that the IRRI will help introduce new varieties of rice, increase production and encourage rice cultivation in countries like Africa where it is not produced.The IRRI consultant explained there are some states in the eastern parts, including eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa which failed to benefit from the Green Revolution as these parts had no irrigation facilities like in Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. The productivity of paddy in the eastern part is low compared to northern and central regions and the IRRI regional centre would introduce flood and drought resistant varieties for them. IRRI would assist the farmers overcome weather challenges, said Gautam.This is another major international intervention in Uttar Pradesh in the Yogi government as earlier during the visit of the prime minister to Israel, UP Jal Nigam had signed an MOU for checking pollution in rivers and water management in the state."
5a14653e9855b76bf13e3d6f,"Cong hopes crisis ends, backs Lalu",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170714/jsp/bihar/story_161748.jsp,2017-07-14,"New Delhi, July 13: The majority of Congress leaders are not in agreement with chief minister Nitish Kumar's posturing on the corruption issues that Lalu Prasad's family is grappling with, arguing that the Janata Dal United should have seen the BJP's larger agenda of destabilising the coalition. The Congress still hopes for an ""amicable solution"" to the crisis, but many leaders argued in private that there were better ways of dealing with the issues than creating an unseemly public spectacle. ""It would be naive to ignore the element of political vendetta in the entire exercise,"" a top party strategist told The Telegraph. ""Nitish broke away from the BJP and embraced a convicted Lalu to fight the Narendra Modi-led BJP. That time the JDU said they were aligning with a party, not an individual. Now they have staked the future of the alliance on an individual. If there is an ultimatum by the JDU for Tejashwi Yadav to quit, there should have been a simultaneous assertion that the alliance won't break. Why is there so much speculation about re-marriage with the BJP?"" the strategist asked. Nitish is understood to have said at a party meet that Tejashwi has to resign, but did not lay down a time-frame. Congress leaders have been asked by Rahul Gandhi not to speak against Nitish as they want to retain him in the secular alliance. But many senior leaders conceded the JDU was viewed with suspicion by most parties after its decision to support Ram Nath Kovind, the BJP's pick for President. ""We wonder whether Nitish was laying the ground for another somersault. Does he feel the Opposition doesn't have a chance in 2019 and it would be difficult to retain Bihar with Lalu in 2020? Why is he not ruling out the BJP?"" Another leader said: ""Nobody is saying corruption is not an issue but we can't surrender to the Narendra Modi government's political machinations. Let the probe establish Tejashwi's guilt. But we wonder why were repeated raids required at Lalu's house? Did the CBI or income-tax department not seize all incriminating material in one raid? How many times were raids conducted on BJP chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in the Vyapam, rice and mining scams?"" Congress leaders also contested the perception that they too want Tejashwi to put in his papers, insisting that it was up to Lalu and the RJD to formulate their responses. They said the Congress understood there was a witch-hunt and hence the yardstick of political morality cannot be blindly applied in this case. They recalled how the Trinamul Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party, NCP and the Congress were being selectively targeted while even serious charges against BJP ministers were ignored. Some leaders also asked if removing ministers on the basis of political morality by Sonia Gandhi during the UPA regime had paid off. ""We removed railway minister Pawan Bansal because his nephew was allegedly involved in transfer-posting. We removed Shashi Tharoor because of a cricket controversy and Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan because his mother-in-law had a flat in the Adarsh society. But Modi, who boasts of a clean image, didn't remove any of his charge-sheeted and convicted ministers when he was chief minister of Gujarat. He didn't take action against anybody after becoming Prime Minister, be it in the Lalit Modi scam or the Panama papers,"" said a leader. At a time when 18 Opposition parties have decided to forcefully fight the Modi government in the Parliament session starting on July 17, no leader is happy with the instability in Bihar. Ironically, political vendetta is one of the key issues the Opposition wants to take up, along with ill-effects of demonetisation, a flawed GST regime, agrarian distress and unemployment."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

A higher crop output is anticipated following increased sowing of rice and pulses when compared with the last season.The latest Union Agriculture department data showed that across the country, kharif crops have been planted on 563.17 lakh hectares till now, as against 521.80 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year.Increase in acreageWith the sowing of crops apace during the past few days across the country, paddy (rice) has been sown in 125.77 lakh hectares in the current season till July 14, which is marginally higher than the 120.32 lakh hectares recorded in the 2016-17 season. The acreage under pulses has been recorded at 74.61 lakh hectares till now, as against the 60.28 lakh hectares of the corresponding period for the last season.The sowing of coarse cereals is up as well, at 113.06 lakh hectares against the 98.79 lakh hectares of last year. But the total oilseeds sown has come down to 103.92 lakh hectares, when compared with 115.75 lakh hectares of last year.Cotton acreage is up this season at 90.88 lakh hectares, against 73.93 lakh hectares last year in the corresponding period. Sugarcane, too, continues to see an increase in acreage and has been planted in 47.94 lakh hectares against the 45.22 lakh hectares last year. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), conditions are favourable for further advancement of the monsoon and overall rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over the next two weeks, from July 13 to July 26.Conditions favourableSowing of kharif crops has gained momentum during the past few days as the monsoon is progressing well. Paddy transplanting, though, has been a bit sluggish in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but it is likely to pick up in the coming days. Sowing of pulses is apace in the key growing states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, which is an encouraging sign, Anand Sharma, regional co-ordinator of the IMDs agricultural meteorology told, The Hindu .Apart from western parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the monsoon rains have covered most parts of the country, he added. The monsoon rain delivers about 70% of Indias annual rainfall and is critical for millions of farmers as nearly half the countrys farmland lacks irrigation and is dependent on rain."

Leaders from the Congress, Left, Nationalist Congress Party, DMK, Janata Dal United and Rashtriya Janata Dal advocated such a policy at today's Opposition meeting. Trinamul, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party members, however, skipped the meeting on a day the focus was on the presidential election. Adjournment motions, allowed only in the Lok Sabha, seek to draw the House's attention to matters of urgent public importance and need the support of at least 50 members. The possible subjects of the adjournment motions the Opposition is considering moving include the farm crisis, lack of jobs, China standoff, ""flawed"" goods and services tax (GST) and the Amarnath Yatra killings. Tomorrow morning, the Congress will gherao Parliament in protest against the implementation of the GST. Rahul Gandhi will address a farmers' rally in Banswara, Rajasthan, the day after. The main slogan proposed for tomorrow - ""GST ka jawab/Sansad ka gherao (The answer to the GST is a gherao of Parliament)"" - indicates the Congress is ready to abandon its nuanced position on the new tax regime and go all out against it. Sources said that today's meeting was divided on the extent of disruption to be wrought in Parliament but was unanimous about the need to haul the government up and seek answers. The Opposition also wants to raise the subject of the ""brazen political witch-hunt"" against some of its stalwarts and the lynchings by cow vigilantes. A bout of aggression by some parties may make Parliament difficult to run, at least for the first few days. Prime Minister Narendra Modi today attempted an outreach in the Lok Sabha, walking up to senior Opposition politicians and greeting them, but the gesture seems to have had little impact. Many Opposition members questioned Modi's appeal at yesterday's all-party meeting for support for his anti-corruption drive, alleging the Prime Minister was himself protecting tainted NDA politicians. They rued that the Prime Minister's decision to speak last had denied them a chance to counter him, and said the Opposition wanted a thorough debate on corruption in Parliament. ""We clearly see discrimination against Opposition leaders. There is duplicity in the Prime Minister's stand,"" CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury told The Telegraph. Yechury said in a series of tweets today: ""Political corruption is a menace, as shown by Sahara-Birla diaries, Vyapam, Lalit Modi, rice & GSPC (Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation) scams of the BJP. Why no action on them? Instead, by amending FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) retrospectively and allowing secret corporate funding of elections, Modi government has legalised corruption in politics."" Janata Dal United senior Sharad Yadav, whose party has staked its alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar over a corruption FIR naming Lalu Prasad's son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav, too alleged selective targeting of the Opposition. Sharad tweeted: ""Corruption is a menace and stringent action should be taken but action needs to be taken against all and not against selected and in Opposition."" Modi's condemnation of the violence by cow vigilantes yesterday has left many in the Opposition wondering why he had not ensured tough action on the ground against the lynchings, which have been going on for two years now. ""Modi should look within the BJP and see where the virus of gau rakshak starts from,"" Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh tweeted today. ""Otherwise, it is all empty words."" Photographs showing alleged assailants with senior BJP leaders were attached to the message."

5a146da39855b76bf13e439d,For a few good men,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170720/jsp/opinion/story_162762.jsp,2017-07-20,"On my way to Basirhat, a couple of weeks after communal disturbances had been reported from this area in the North 24 Parganas, I noticed the landscape changing after the train - the Sealdah-Hasnabad local - had crossed Bahira Kalibari. The fields with standing crops - rice and, usually, vegetables - brick kilns, the occasional mango orchard and solitary scarecrows gave way to large water bodies that resembled bils. As the train approached Harua Road - Baduria is a 20-minute drive from here - I felt the atmosphere inside the compartment change ever so slightly. Most people got off, at Lebutala and Bhasila, before my destination, Harua Road, arrived. Those who remained were silent. I noticed one man poring over an old copy of a local newspaper (Jugasankha), which carried reports of clashes in a bold font. After getting off, I stopped for tea at a stall on the platform. Broken glass bottles had been stacked in a corner of the shop. On enquiring what the matter was, I was told that some people had vandalized the stall the morning protests broke out against a deeply offensive post on Facebook. I had travelled to Baduria to meet someone who had not lit the flames but had attempted to douse them. Mohammad Kamruzzaman is the secretary of the All Bengal Minority Youth Federation, an organization that works in the fields of education and employment. The work done by the ABMYF has given Kamruzzaman some leverage among the residents of Harua, Baduria, Deganga and Swarupnagar. His influence in these localities had turned Kamruzzaman into the local administration's right-hand man when disturbances had spread in Basirhat. Kamruzzaman and I got talking inside the educational institution that he has set up for needy students. A soft-spoken man, Kamruzzaman appeared to be an atypical community leader. He is equally concerned about such welfare measures as doles for imams as well as the poor representation of Muslims in education and employment, asymmetries, which, in his opinion, have created the conditions for the growing orthodoxy in thought among some segments of Muslim society. While describing his experience during the unrest - he had travelled extensively in Basirhat, requesting irate mobs to lift blockades - Kamruzzaman made an important admission. In places like Berachampa and Hamadama, where he succeeded in reasoning with the protesters - there were also occasions when the mob refused to listen to his pleas - he had talked of the need to preserve the honour of the grameen samaj, prioritizing the dignity of the rural community over religious identity, in order to secure a truce. Kamruzzaman's actions had been heroic. But I had other queries of him: what, for instance, are his views on the alleged radicalization of Muslims, the rationale cited by sectarian forces when intimidating minorities often with targeted, vicious assault? Political attempts, old and new, at radicalizing the majority community are a part of the public discourse. But it has been alleged that secular-minded citizens are diffident when it comes to addressing a similar contagion among Muslims. One of the reasons behind my visit to Baduria was to find out how a Muslim would respond to this supposed anomaly. Kamruzzaman agreed that radicalized elements exist among minorities, as is the case with any religious formation. But it is telling that he had to remind me of the obvious: that the radicals constitute the fringe. However, what allows the fringe to resemble the centre during conflagrations, in Kamruzzaman's opinion, is administrative laxity. The police's eagerness to rely on community leaders like him to defuse the crisis in Basirhat is a case in point. The absence of neutral but effective intervention on the part of the Trinamul administration opened the government up to charges of appeasement during the crises in Dholahat, Hazinagar/Halisahar, Dhulagarh and, more recently, in Raiganj where adivasi organizations indulged in arson. But the more serious issue in this context, Kamruzzaman insisted, was the failure to create a durable civil leadership among Muslims. The blame for this should be shared by India's political class - the Congress, the Left parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the least sympathetic of the political formations - that has been content with exercising control over minorities through the agency of the clergy or elected leaders who are indistinguishable from ordained functionaries. Kamruzzaman cited one more reason to explain organized as well as spontaneous violence, Basirhat being an example of the latter kind of disruption. The taste of power, however fleeting, as a means of retribution against an adversary, real or imagined, can be a decisive incentive for the underprivileged. Kamruzzaman is acutely aware of the risk of the falsification of the narrative of radicalism among minorities. This, we agreed, is the sinister trap that has been laid by political Hindutva. The snare works along these lines: provoke vulnerable segments among minorities to retaliate in areas where they have the numerical advantage through incitement, and then use it as evidence to legitimize a broader, brutal counter-mobilization movement against an entire community that has been demonized through sustained propaganda. But there is a way of breaking out of the trap. Kamruzzaman believes it lies in education. As proof, he introduced me to M.D. Irfan Habib, a 22-year-old with a wisp of a stubble, who is pursuing a higher degree in mathematics from Jadavpur University. Irfan talked spiritedly of his unshakeable faith in the scientific temper that helps him question everything, from the diktats of the ruling party to religious edicts. India's liberal constituency has its own entrapment to fight against. Its supposed hesitation to discuss the threat of radicalization in a small segment among minorities could be the result of a well-founded anxiety - that the spin doctors of the Far Right would co-opt such scrutiny to bolster the ongoing process of polarization. But the layered character and chronology of the violence in Basirhat, and elsewhere, must be talked about in the public domain, if only to expose the bigotry of Hindutva. Cancer, as we all know, spreads in silence."

(File Photo) Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. (File Photo)The Opposition and the ruling BJP on Tuesday traded blame in the Rajya Sabha over distress in the agriculture community due to which farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers. As the House took up a discussion on the agrarian crisis, the Opposition blamed the government for the problem, accusing it of being insensitive towards the farmers issues. They also sought to find faults in various policies of the government. The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate. I am sorry to say that we have neglected science and technology. There may be different views on BT technology but we have data how it benefits. We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It would work as policy guidelines for 12 government departments in implementing their respective schemes to boost the states economy based on growth in agriculture and allied sectors.We expect CM Nitish Kumar to unveil the new BARM on October 2, an agriculture department source said and added, The state is celebrating the centenary of Mahatma Gandhis Champaran Satyagrah (April 1917). The CM had also referred to it at the Kisan Samagam (farmers conclave) held here on June 16.The first BARM was for the 2008-12 period and the second for 2012-17.The draft proposal has pointed out that the two previous BARMs resulted in increased production of cereal crops (wheat, paddy and maize) in the state, apart from sustained boost to the increase of rice mills, wheat mills, maize processing units, rural agri-business centres, fruit storage and vegetable processing, milk processing, makhana processing, honey processing, biscuit production, seven ice cream producing units and food processing units.At the June 16 mega conclave, the government had invited over 800 farmers from across the state to give their suggestions for inclusion in the final draft. The draft proposal had also been provided to all the participating farmers and experts, besides bureaucrats from the 12 departments concerned.Incidentally, the agriculture department has also been inviting suggestions from the concerned through online mechanism, as to what should be included in the light of the diversifying dimensions of agriculture and farming activities, amid growing demand for processed products from the produce of agriculture and allied sectors, including fishery.The last date for making the online submission of the suggestions by the interested persons is July 31, said Sanjay Kumar Singh, deputy director (chemist, quality control) at the state agriculture department.First, the committee constituted will screen and shortlist the suggestions, which would be discussed at the high-level meeting of the agriculture department. Subsequently, the revised draft would be presented at the integrated meeting of the senior officials and ministers of the departments concerned, chaired by the CM.This meeting might make some suggestions for inclusion in the final draft, Singh said."

Seeding of Aadhaar cards of all family members with the ration card was meant to enable any member collect rations by getting his/her fingerprints read. Beena and Munna, working for the Sarva Janara Prarthanalaya, which describes itself as a gypsy charitable trust, said almost 150 families in the colony have been affected due to an erratic public distribution system.""Only 50-odd families of the 208 are successfully receiving rations. It's not as if they don't know the procedure for seeding, yet they are suffering. Aadhaar has made their lives difficult by excluding them from the benefits of PDS,"" said Beena.Maligehu, 56, said she hasn't been getting her monthly allocation of rice for five months now; her four-member family is entitled to 20 kg of rice. ""The person at the ration shop told me that my card has been cancelled. I went to the nearest BangaloreOne centre and the food and civil supplies office in Rajajinagar, but in vain. I haven't eaten properly in months. Sometimes, we rely on our neighbours and don't know where the next meal will come from,"" she said.Residents of the colony say life was much better earlier, when all they had to do was show their ration cards to get supplies. Before Aadhaar seeding, Vajara, 28, and her husband Ramakrishna, 37, used to get 20kg rice per month, five each for the couple and their two kids. But for the last few months, the PoS machine at the fair price depot has been unable to read her and her husband's fingerprints. Result: they have been losing out on half the allocated amount of rice.Some residents also claimed that not collecting ration for even a month resulted in cards being declared 'dead'. Most residents of the colony travel as far as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra to sell their wares. Reetha, a doll-maker, travels frequently for work and is away for several days at a stretch. In her absence, her friend would take her daughter Archana to the fair price shop to collect rations for the family. However, six months ago, Reetha's family, which couldn't collect rations for a couple of months, was told that their card is no longer valid. Rajendra Bai , another resident entitled to 20 kg rice, too hasn't been receiving anything from the shop. She was told her card has been cancelled.""We have to buy rice from other provision stores for Rs 30-40 per kg. The average income of most families in the Hakki Pikki Colony is Rs 3,000-5,000 per month. How can we buy overpriced rice when we can barely sustain ourselves with what we earn,"" asked Rajendra Bai. Also, in some cases, only the ration card-holder's fingerprint is considered valid. Ration shops too are open only for a few days a month when supplies come. If residents miss that window, they are helpless till the next month, said Bai. And then there are some like 32-year-old Chandra who, despite raising a request for Aadhaar seeding, hasn't received the activation message from the food office.""If rice is not meant for the poor, then where is it going? The owners must be hoarding and selling them for higher rates,"" said Sumalatha, another resident."

The deities, Sri Kalabhairava, Sri Amma and Naga, were worshipped at the shrine. The rituals were being conducted by a family belonging to the Jogi community (Natha sect) since centuries.He said that though there was a historical relation of this shrine with the nearby temple, the conduct of rituals at the shrine was the exclusive preserve of the Jogi community. There is a connection between the shrine and the Halavari Mutt (affiliated to Gorakhpur Moola Mutt) located at Yeddamogge, about seven kilometres from the shrine. Till recently, the shrine used to receive 10 murras of rice from the Halavari Mutt.At present, Basava Jogi and his son, Raghavendra Jogi, are looking after the shrine. Since Basava Jogi was old, Raghavendra Jogi takes care of the shrine. A few years ago, the latter began taking devotees who came to the village to the shrine. This was the source of livelihood for the family, he said.But as the shrine started attracting more devotees and adventure tourists, the temple authorities installed a hundi (money box) for temple renovation, he said and added that the family did not object to it. But recently, the temple authorities went a step ahead and appointed salaried workers to guide the devotees to the shrine. This affected the earnings of the family.When the family questioned the temple authorities and tried to resolve the matter amicably, they were ignored. We approached government officers and Gopal Poojary, Byndoor MLA, but they washed their hands off the issue. We want our rights to be preserved. The hundi and temple guides should be removed, he said.The samiti would hold a Guppi Guhalaya Chalo at Kamalashile on Saturday. If the matter is still not resolved, we will intensify the agitation and even approach Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Mr. Koteshwar said."
5a0f05789855b76bf13d53f0,Refashioning development,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/625260/refashioning-development.html,2017-07-28,"R Balasubramaniam, Jul 29 2017, 0:53 ISTA few months ago, the Chhattisgarh government made an announcement that it will now provide 35 kg rice at the doorstep of each tribal family. A thousand kms away, the Karnataka government was grappling with solving the issue of land that the tribals from Diddadahalli had occupied and were claiming as their rightful due.Around the same time, we had Prime Minister Narendra Modi announce just after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections that he would like to see a new India arise where the poor and marginalised had access to opportunities and not mere government doles.While each of these give conflicting signals, one is sad that despite 70 years of independence, the country is still grappling with how to strategise and undertake development of indigenous tribals who constitute a little more than 8% of the nations population.Article 366 (25) of the Constitution refers to Scheduled Tribes (STs) as those communities which are scheduled in accordance with Article 342 of the Constitution. The STs are mainly the indigenous population that the Government of India identifies as socially and economically backward and in need of special protection from social injustice and exploitation.The tribals are identified by the government based on a communitys primitive traits, distinctive culture, shyness with the public at large, geographical isolation and social and economic backwardness.Tribal communities live in about 15% of the countrys areas in various ecological and geo-climatic conditions ranging from plains to forests, hills and inaccessible areas. There are 705 ethnic groups notified as Scheduled Tribes in India who live across 30 states and Union Territories. Tribal groups are at different stages of social, economic and educational development.While some tribal communities have adopted a mainstream way of life at one end of the spectrum, there are 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) at the other who are characterised by a pre-agriculture level of technology, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy and a subsistence level of economy.The central government created the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the year 1999 to give focused attention to the social and economic development of these indigenous communities and has planned to spend close to Rs 5,300 crore in the current fiscal year on tribal development.While millions of rupees are being spent by the government, the non-government organisations and the corporates under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes across the country, one finds it difficult to explain why the development of the se indigenous communities has not been to the levels expected.To understand this, we need to appreciate that programmes are currently designed by non-tribal people who seem to be deciding on what tribal development should be. It is unfortunate that many of these experts and bureaucrats are designing and delivering programmes that many a time seems to be disconnected from the ground realities.Across India today, the tribals are at the crossroads and are neither able to move away from their dependence on traditional economies nor are they able to integrate with the demands of the market. They are wrestling with change  both at the individual and at the community level and are neither able to let go off the past nor are they able to embrace the present.Programmes that are thrust on them are forcing them to accept lifestyles that are unsustainable socially, economically and culturally. Caught between the devil and the deep sea, they are left vulnerable to the forces that continue to exploit them and are living a life of merely coping with the poverty that surrounds them.To make matters worse, most tribal areas are also rich in natural resources and they suffer the collateral damage created by large irrigation projects and extractive industries.Interventions to develop the indigenous communities needs to begin with an understanding of the tribals themselves. One needs to appreciate that these are communities who have traditionally lived in communes under the leadership of chieftains and have operated in the traditional economy.Moving from a hunter-gatherer situation to a mixed economy is culturally jarring and can have shocking consequences if not handled sensitively.The states planning and executing machinery has little time, patience or competence to understand the dynamics and power structures in the tribal areas and little appreciation of attitudinal and behavioural dimensions.Shoddy implementationThis results in shoddy implementation of schemes and does not provide enough space for meaningful participation of the people. What is further disturbing is that all these schemes are not dynamic or responsive, and seem to be urban solutions to tribal problems.Precious little consideration is given to the skills, knowledge and practices that could help in addressing tribal issues through grassroots perspectives. Seven decades of rapid acculturation and shoddy integration into the mainstream culture has left these communities in confusion.Forest conservation laws that they can neither understand nor find relevance in, has left them at a crossroad with neither a coping mechanism nor an alternate lifestyle.Economic and social demands of mainstream culture and life is forcing them to abandon their traditional methods which kept things simple and sustainable and adopt more expensive, government and NGO-driven coping strategies which are neither culturally appropriate nor contextually relevant.These indigenous tribals can neither go back to the past nor have they successfully integrated with the present. The skills that they traditionally had no longer meet the demands of modern existence. All that exists is an insensitive and patronising system that talks of their development bereft of the dignity that they deserve.(The writer, founder of Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, has lived and worked with indigenous tribal communities for more than three decades)"

But weighed down by three successive years of drought and mounting debts, he found it impossible to put the money aside for the wedding.So, when a brick kiln unit offered to lease an acre of his land for three years, the farmer thought he had struck gold. When he was offered three times more than what he earned from his crops, he immediately gave his nod to the proposal.The farmer at Kodiyaganj Village in West Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh district was the first in his village to lease out fertile land to a brick kiln owner for Rs 45,000 a year.Today he regrets the day he said yes. For what he didn't know was after the unit had dug out four feet of the top soil, the land was no longer as fertile as it used to be.""The land I got back was less fertile. I tried to grow some crops but they were of poor quality and the yield was also low,"" Ghayasuddin said.With a construction boom across India, brick-making is a lucrative business in Uttar Pradesh villages, with hundreds of furnaces baking millions of bricks day and night.The story of Ghayasuddin turns the spotlight on many such hamlets in the region. Over 250 farmers in six villages Kodiyaganj, Sikanderpur, Akrabad, Sakra, Gabhana, Dadaun and Pilakhana - in Aligarh have leased out about 200 acres of land to around 100 brick kiln units in the last four years.Some farmers said they were forced to do it because the prolonged drought had pushed them to the brink of starvation.""The proposal by the brick kiln industries came when we were in desperate need of money. We were making Rs 12,000 per acre by growing crops and for the same acre we were paid Rs 45,000-60,000,"" said Imran Khan, a farmer from Sikandrabad who grew rice and wheat alternately on his field.A few farmers said they were forced to lease out their land when their surrounding fields were dug out, leaving their field at a higher level, which led to their soil being washed off to the neighbouring, quarried fields.Those who still held on found it increasingly difficult to irrigate their elevated land.Ramesh Singh, a resident of Pilakhana village, said he was against leasing out his land to brick kiln units but had to yield to them when his crops started dying because water couldn't reach his raised land.""On all three sides, there was quarried land, which made it impossible for water to reach my field. I know the degradation the quarrying will cause to my land, but I am helpless as my crops are dying either way,"" Singh said.Singh leased out four acres of land to Kamal Udyog for three years for Rs 50,000 per acre per year.The owner of the industry, Kamal Agarwal, however, stressed he was helping farmers of the area.""Without our industries, farmers would have starved. We are paying them nearly three times of what they would have got by selling their crops. Moreover, each brick kiln industry gives employment to at least 50 labourers,"" Agarwal said.The brick kiln industries operating in these six villages manufacture around 70-80 lakh bricks per month, he said.Smoke emissions from brick kilns contribute 9 per cent of the total emissions in India, studies say.""There is a huge environmental cost involved - from smoke emission and local air pollution to the loss of valuable topsoil,"" said Khurram Ahmed, a social activist.India, the second largest producer of bricks in the world after China, manufactures nearly 200 billion bricks a year, a 2015 CSE report said.About 70 per cent of these bricks are produced in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which have one of the world's most fertile alluvial plains, Punjab State Council for Science and Technology said in a 2009 report.""Brick fields are mostly situated on riverine fertile agricultural land as they need clayish, silty, loamy, clay loam or silt loam soil with good texture,"" Ahmed added.After the brick kiln industries have excavated the top soil, farmers are forced to grow either rice or millet, crops that require more water. Because of water-logging in their fields, they find it difficult to grow vegetables and other crops such as wheat and corn on their once fertile land.""Water logging in the quarried land is a common problem.farmers are forced to grow crops that require excess water. In some cases, water logging makes it impossible for them to grow any other kind of crop,"" Ahmed said.Building construction in India is estimated to grow at a rate of 6.6 per cent per year between 2005 and 2030 providing a steady demand for bricks. The brick making industry is utilising 2.5 crore tonnes of coal and other biomass fuels per year, government reports have said.Brick kiln industries consumed 25,20,000 cubic metres soil during 1995-2010, said a 2015 report in the International Journal of Innovative Research Development. The industry has been closed in many big cities of India for polluting the environment but has started mushrooming in the countryside.Although the government is encouraging the use of ecofriendly fly ash bricks, it will be a while before red bricks are replaced because of lack of awareness about the harmful effects of brick kiln units on the environment, he said.""The construction boom is feeding the brick kiln industries across the country but the cost being paid is too high. Shrinking of agriculture land is pushing us towards a dooming agrarian crisis and there is a dire need to switch to more environment-friendly options,"" Ahmed said."

His brother whispered that he had an accident after he and a few friends set out on their bikes in Bengaluru, where he was studying at the time.Doctors told Sujith's parents that he only had a 40% chance of survival; the spine had a T6 level injury while the skull had 18 fractures. Even if he survived, they warned, he would not be able to see with his right eye; he would only have a poor memory and would never walk again. ""They were wrong about the first two. And I am still trying to prove them wrong about the third,"" says Sujith, five years later, over the phone from his home in Mavelikkara. He is on a short visit from Dubai where he lives and studies.

But I tell myself, there is a way, there has to be a way.""The thing about accidents is that while it happens in a flash, the full impact on a person's life unfolds bit by bit. ""It happened two weeks before my final B Com exams,"" he remembers. After about five weeks in the Bengaluru hospital where he had to undergo two major surgeries, he was moved to Vellore for rehabilitation. After a month there, Sujith and his mom came to their Mavelikkara home as the doctors said there was nothing else left to be done.Someone then told them about a vaidyan who was supposed to have worked wonders on many and they decided to give it a try. ""Just 20, I was into boxing and so active. I simply refused to accept that I was paralysed and was ready to do anything to get back on my feet."" But what followed was not massage but four months of daily torture. The vaidyan would apply oil and virtually hit him all over, promising that he would be alright soon. The pathyam (restrictive diet) was equally punishing; he was allowed wheat dosa and sugar in the morning and rice and bindi curry for lunch and nothing else.Not only did the diet sap him of all his strength but he also started developing pressure sores which turned septic when the quack applied oil on them. When he started shivering uncontrollably, they called in a nurse who was aghast at the infection level after doing a blood test. He was back in the ICU and the doctors then did a series of plastic surgeries to heal the wounds.""This was a big blow, to say the least. I recovered but had to face a lot of sympathy and negativity from everyone around me who kept saying that I can't do this or that while I wanted to be independent,"" he says. For instance, he wanted to sleep in his room upstairs but nobody liked the idea. But after wheeling himself to the steps, he climbed the 18 steps one by one before getting on to another wheelchair on top and went to his room. This routine was followed every single day of his stay in Kerala.His life brightened after his dad took him to Dubai. In one of the most crucial decisions, he signed up at a nearby gym and started exercising regularly though many were sceptical that he wouldn't be able to do much training. As his upper body gained strength, he got back his confidence too. If his mom took him there initially, he soon started going there all by himself. ""Today, I take the metro and go on my own,"" he says, proudly. He has even taken a plane journey without anyone to assist him. In 2015, he passed his B Com and is now studying for CFA and aspires to be an investment banker.Life took another turn when a radio jockey called Kris Fade saw one of the gym videos that he has been posting on Instagram and invited him to his show. Later, Kris also made him share his experiences at an event and the video got shared by many. He has already been invited by several corporates to speak to their employees.Is he on his way to become a motivational guru? ""Honestly, I do not know. But I tell people that if I can do what I have been doing from a wheelchair, for instance: fitness, they have no excuse not to do it. I also talk to them about the importance of not giving up,"" Sujith says.That's no empty boast. Besides hitting the gym every day, he also gets on to his cycle and his standing table where he tries to reactivate his legs. He has already tried acupuncture and chiropractic but in vain. ""Twenty years down the line, if I am alive and still on a wheelchair, then I'll know I have at least tried my 100%. Actually, I have just started."""

The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

5a12a4149855b76bf13e10ed,The disease that just won’t go away,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-disease-that-just-wont-go-away/article19520832.ece,2017-08-19,"At 17, Rohim Sarkar weighs as much as the average 11-year-old. When shirtless, each of the seven pairs of bones that make up his upper ribcage is visible from five feet away. An attending doctor at the Habibpur block hospital in Malda, West Bengal feels his spleen and the verdict is clear: VL, he declares, followed by two other colleagues jotting the verdict and leading the boy aside for a confirmatory dipstick test, a detailed set of photographs, a skin biopsy and a recommendation that he immediately begin treatment.Sarkar presented symptoms considered typical of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), or kala-azar, a disease that is endemic to a contiguous blob of districts spanning West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Caused by the Leishmania donovani parasite, harboured by an insect called the sandfly, the Habibpur block, barely 30 km from Bangladesh, is considered particularly vulnerable to kala-azar outbreaks.A parasitic diseaseKala-azar is a parasitic disease that is confined to humans, meaning that unlike, say, bird flu, there is no other animal that harbours the infection in Asia. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent in 119 districts in four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal), India itself accounts for half the global burden of the disease. If untreated, kala-azar can kill within two years of the onset of the ailment, though the availability of a range of drugs for almost a century has meant that less than 1 in 1,000 now succumb to the disease. According to numbers from the Union Health Ministry, 2016 was the first year that no kala-azar death was reported in India. Experts, however, note that like malaria and several other vector-borne diseases in India, the government only considers lab-confirmed and officially registered deaths and therefore, frequently underestimates both caseload and mortality.Historically, a 20-day treatment schedule with sodium stibogluconate (SSb) injection and the spraying of the malarial insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethan (DDT) in houses and surroundings were the only weapons against the disease.When DDT was used as part of the malaria eradication programme, very few cases of kala-azar were reported. When the use of DDT was stopped a few years later, there was an increase in the number of kala-azar cases.Over a period of time, resistance to the only drug (SSb injection) led to frequent outbreaks and fatalities and the Union Health Ministry, which had committed to eliminating kala-azar by 2010, revised it to 2015. Bangladesh, India and Nepal committed to eliminate the disease from the region, where elimination (as opposed to eradication) is defined as no more than one case per 10,000 population at the upazila level in Bangladesh, sub-district (block PHC) level in India and district level in Bhutan and Nepal.Since 2003, Indias National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is in charge of coordinating with endemic States to eliminate the disease. With funds from a World Bank-supported project (2008-2013), the NVBDCP now funds consultants at State and district level and Kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS) at the States blocks (or clusters of village panchayats) to conduct active surveillance. That means local village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs) are entrusted with constantly visiting houses and looking for patients who may present symptoms of the disease and alert health authorities.Several new medical advances have aided the fight against kala-azar. A rapid diagnostic test, called rK39 can  with a pinprick of blood  indicate the presence of the parasite. With SSb injection on the decline, there are now two mainline drugs, miltefosine  originally conceived as an anti-cancer drug and taken orally  and liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), a drug that once needed to be injected at regular intervals over four weeks but now only requires a single shot. These, besides an array of genetic tests that have obviated the need for painful jabs to the spleen and liver to confirm the presence of parasites, and global and national political commitment in terms of funding research and drug dispensation, has meant that kala-azar may be on the verge of being stamped out. However the 2015 elimination target was missed and postponed to September 2017, again a deadline that wont be met. This, in spite of the number of kala-azar patients plummeting from 36,000 in 2005 to 2,969 in 2017, according to Central government figures.At the campSarkar is one of 57 residents whove made it to the Habibpur hospital as part of biannual medical camps organised as part of the active surveillance process. About 160 were expected but a bus strike has thwarted attendance. West Bengal, like the other endemic States, was to have eliminated kala-azar in 2015, but is set to miss the deadline this year too despite the number of patients in the State coming down from 2,700 in 2005 to less than 50 as of this July.Among the camp attendees, seated on the rows of wooden benches that made up the capacious common hall of the hospital, Sarkar was the only one who presented the typical symptoms  the emaciation, anaemia and signs of a puffed spleen  that have helped doctors quickly ferret out kala-azar cases for almost a century. More than Sarkar, however, what worried the visiting doctors were 20 outwardly healthy occupants of those benches. Most were once kala-azar patients and, as the doctors who screened them found, are stricken in various degrees by a mixture of blotches and ulcers on their hands, legs, backs and, sometimes, on their faces.Painless and never known to trigger the fevers and pains typical of parasitical diseases, the blemished skin is the only sign of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It isnt the kind of disease that prompts villagers of Habibpur block, who besides kala-azar also live under the constant threat of malaria and tuberculosis, to skip farm work or forego a days earnings from manual labour, to line up outside hospitals. One of the patients with PKDL told me that the only reason he wanted treatment was because he was looking to get married, says Dr. Mitali Chatterjee, a medical doctor and researcher at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGME&R), Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital, Kolkata, which is known informally as the PG hospital.PKDL results from the parasites left over from a kala-azar infection that couldnt be slain by the chemical cocktails used to treat kala-azar. Though harmless, the pigmented skin can provide harbour, says Chatterjee, to the parasites and they can make their way onto other sandflies. Like the anopheles mosquito, the sandfly needs human blood to nourish their larvae and in the process can pass on parasites to new people and trigger a kala-azar infection. Roughly a tenth of those with a history of kala-azar will go on to develop PKDL and, potentially, seed a fresh outbreak. The precise reason for this isnt known yet. In the 1970s or early 80s, VL [kala-azar] had almost disappeared and then there was suddenly an epidemic, says Srija Moulik, a research scholar at IPGME&R, it was later traced back to a single case of PKDL. Theres a paper on that.Case and cure filesThe earliest empirical evidence for a link between PKDL as a silent agent provocateur for kala-azar outbreaks and DDT sprays came in the 1990s from C.P. Thakur, a physician and now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP. He reported an unusual trend in kala-azar cases in Bihar. Between 1970 and 1989, 530 individuals were confirmed with PKDL at the Patna Medical College (PMC), with the number of cases rocketing from two in 1970 to 59 in 1989. This was in contrast to no cases of this disease being reported at the PMC from 1958-1970. In the period 1977-1990, there were 3,01,076 cases of kala-azar reported in Bihar alone, with a mortality rate of over 2% (compared with 31,074 cases and a mortality rate below 0.4% for the rest of India). It seems possible, that once DDT spraying stopped, the re-establishment of large sandfly populations and infection of these vectors, largely as a result of them feeding on cases of PKDL, provoked the resurgence of kala-azar, Thakur and co-author K. Kumar reported in the June 1992 edition of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology .Even though this link between kala-azar and PKDL was hinted at since 1922, it wasnt until 2005 that the World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan (who together account for 90% of kala-azar cases) began concerted efforts to eliminate PKDL, as part of kala-azar elimination strategies.In a round-up of the countrys progress in dealing with the disease, at a conference in Bengaluru earlier this year, Chatterjee showed a slide illustrating that in spite of the rapid dive in kala-azar cases across endemic States, PKDL cases in Bihar, which bears 70% of Indias kala-azar burden, had risen to 500 from nil in 2013; from 300 in 2013 to 900 in 2017 in Jharkhand and 50 to 250 in West Bengal, in the same period. To Chatterjee, however, the rise in cases indicates States increased efforts to find kala-azar patients and hidden PKDL cases becoming manifest.At the IPGME&R, one of the nodal research medical labs in Kolkata thats part of the kala-azar surveillance-detection-and-analysis network, scientists are finding out through DNA analysis that the leishmaniasis parasite is an extremely resilient entity and can be dormant in the body and seed infections even after as many as five years.The group of mostly-women scientists, who are trying to cleave apart the mysteries of the parasite, are located a five-minute walk away from a modest building that once hosted the laboratory of Sir Ronald Ross, the India-born British Nobel Laureate who established that mosquitoes were responsible for transmitting malaria. Ross was also the one who christened the kala-azar parasite as Leishmania donovani , after the scientist duo that discovered them.Over the days spent peering through blood samples and skin biopsies from medical camps such as at Malda, Moulik points to yet another possible chink in the governments artillery to weed out kala-azar. The single injection of LAmB, which is now used to treat kala-azar, dramatically reduces the number of parasites in the blood and can cure the infection. However, when PKDL patients were subjected to the same medicine (targeting the same parasite), it didnt completely clear the parasite load. On the other hand, prior to LAmB, the treatment of choice for kala-azar was miltefosin, which is an oral pill taken over 12 weeks. It usually brought about nausea and other discomfort because of which several patients would quit treatment midway. However Moulik points to data in the lab that shows miltefosin did a superior job in flushing out the parasites from PKDL patients. There is a catch though. The ultra-sensitive probes that Moulik employs can spot parasites only if there are at least 10 of them in a microgram of DNA. It is quite possible that a patient might be well and disease-free for a few years but have a miniscule amount of parasites that will multiply at an opportune time in, say, five years, and then radiate the vicious cycle of outbreaks and epidemics that has undermined anti-kala-azar programmes through the years. I believe that if parasite loads go down to 10, the bodys immune system should ideally stave off infection but this is indeed the million-dollar question: How long till we are sure that the parasite loads never increase enough to pose a threat? says Moulik.The ground realitiesThe Habibpur hospital, from where IPGME&R gets a significant number of patient samples, is as large as a single-screen movie hall with X-ray machines, photocopiers, beds and a handful of trained nurses. To get to it, one must cross a stream of stagnant water that, according to local residents, swells up during the monsoon. Within several areas of the hospital, debris is piled up. There is a mossy pool of garbage alongside a water cooler that is inaccessible to the most flexible of gymnasts.The block medical officer is a busy man who must, alongside coordinating a kala-azar camp, dragoon the same set of field workers to fan out into the villages looking for tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy patients. Since 2015, when the government authorities woke up to the urgency of eliminating PKDL, patients are being given financial incentives. All those who complete the course of treatment will get Rs. 2,500 (and the medicines made available through the WHO network) and the village field staff, consisting of ASHAs and KTSs, stand to get Rs. 500 for every such patient. If financial incentives are given, then we get patients, says a doctor who has been part of several field camps, but almost never has a district medical officer accompanied us. They are supposed to.English Mohanpur, an inexplicably-named village a few km away from the hospital, is a slushy hamlet between rice fields. Several tribal communities populate its interiors and Koel, an ASHA worker, says some of the tuberculosis and kala-azar patients also battle alcoholism. Few houses have concrete roofs and fewer still comply with the government directive to spray the houses with the insecticide synthetic pyrethroid, the replacement for DDT. These sprays are needed at regular intervals and need a thorough application in every room including the kitchen. The problem is that the spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell, says Chatterjee. There is also a cluster effect. Families stay very close together and one infected person can spread it to the others.Sripad Mandal, 42, a daily-wage labourer and village resident, was bedridden for three months because of kala-azar. He says he visited the block hospital and was given a course of medicine but that didnt work. He wasnt given a second round of medicine at the hospital and finally had to get himself admitted to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. He now claims to be well. His disease, however, manifested before the government announced financial incentives for completing the treatment. This is the disease of the poorest of the poor. Unless socio-economic conditions are improved and better sanitation is available, I dont see just medicines and drugs completely eradicating kala-azar, says Chatterjee.The problem is that the pyrethroid insecticide spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell.Dr. Mitali Chatterjee,Doctor and researcher, Kolkata"

5a5314609855b770e037d151,China's Waging a Water War on India,http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-is-waging-a-water-war-on-india/story-6jqgabEffcatPFzJ6fQ6eJ.html,2017-08-22,"Tibet, a treasure-trove of natural resources, including water and precious metals, is a great strategic asset for China in its pursuit of an often improvident style of economic growth. The sprawling Tibetan plateau also arms Beijing with water leverage over downstream countries because it is the starting point for most of Asias great rivers, many of which are being heavily dammed just before they cross into neighbouring nations.China is sharpening its leverage with co-riparian India. Water indeed has emerged as a new divide in Sino-Indian relations, as Beijing quietly and opaquely builds dams, barrages and other structures on rivers flowing to India. It spurned then Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs 2013 proposal that the two countries enter into a water treaty or establish an intergovernmental institution to define mutual rights and responsibilities on shared rivers. The flash floods that ravaged Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the unannounced releases from rain-swollen Chinese dams and barrages.At a time when the Doklam face-off has entered its third month and the risk of a Chinese military attack on India is growing, there is more troubling news: Beijing is fashioning water into a political weapon by denying India flood-related hydrological data since May, even as major flooding has hit the region from Assam to Uttar Pradesh. Data on upstream river flows is essential for flood forecasting and warning in order to save lives and reduce material losses. Chinas data denial crimps flash flood modelling in India.By embarking on a dangerous game of water poker, Beijing has demonstrated how the denial of hydrological data in the critically important monsoon season amounts to the use of water as a political tool against a downstream country. Indeed, even while supplying data in past years, Chinas lack of transparency raised questions. After all, like rice traded on the world market, hydrological data comes in different grades and qualities  from good, reliable data to inferior data and broken data.Chinas latest action actually violates two bilateral MOUs of 2013 and a 2014 accord, which obligate it to transfer hydrological data to India from three upstream monitoring stations in Tibet every year from May 15 to October 15. No data has been transferred thus far this year, although India, in keeping with the MOUs, paid for the data in advance. While China sells hydrological data to downriver countries, India provides such data free to both its downstream neighbours  Pakistan and Bangladesh.China has long displayed contempt for international law. No bilateral accord seems to have binding force for it once its immediate purpose has passed, as Beijing recently highlighted by trashing the 1984 Sino-British treaty that paved the way for Hong Kongs handover in 1997. China said that pact had lost practical meaning because 20 years had passed since Hong Kongs return. Yet it selectively invokes a 19th-century, colonial-era accord to justify its Doklam intrusion, while ignoring its own violations  cited by Bhutan and India  of more recent bilateral agreements not to disturb the territorial status quo.India should not be downplaying Chinas breach of commitment to supply hydrological data from May 15. Yet, for two months, the ministry of external affairs hid Chinas contravention, which began much before the Doklam standoff. When the ministry of external affairs (MEA) finally admitted Chinas breach of obligation, it simultaneously sought to shield Beijing by saying there could be a technical reason for non-transfer of data (just as MEA sought to obscure Chinas August 15 twin raids in the Pangong Lake area by gratuitously telling the Financial Times that no commonly delineated boundary exists there). How can a technical hitch explain data withholding from three separate stations for over two months? Had China been in Indias place, it would have promptly raised a hue and cry about the commitment violation and linked it to the downstream floods and deaths.More fundamentally, the Doklam standoff, the Chinese hydro-engineering projects to re-engineer cross-border river flows, the denial of hydrological data, and Chinas claims to vast tracts of Indian land are all a reminder that Tibet is at the heart of the India-China divide. The 1951 fall of Tibet represented the most far-reaching geopolitical development in modern Indias history, with the impact exacerbated by subsequent Indian blunders. India must subtly reopen Tibet as an outstanding issue, including by using historically more accurate expressions like Indo-Tibetan border (not India-China border) and emphasising that its previously stated positions were linked to Tibet securing real autonomy.Brahma Chellaney is a geostrategist and authorThe views expressed are personal"
5a113cd99855b76bf13de6ca,Rice production hit: Bora,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170822/jsp/northeast/story_168433.jsp,2017-08-22,"Atul Bora Guwahati, Aug. 21: Assam agriculture minister Atul Bora today said rice production in the state would be six lakh metric tonnes less than the targeted production because of floods. Talking to the media here, Bora said his department had estimated that the production of rice this year would be nearly 62 lakh metric tonnes. But the second wave of floods has affected a large area of paddy fields, damaging saplings. After the first wave of floods on July 31, Bora had said the production of rice in the state would not be affected if there was no second wave of floods. On July 31, Bora had said that 2,89,032 hectares were affected by the first wave of floods. Today, however, he said the affected area in the first wave was 2.08 lakh hectares and in the second wave it was one lakh hectares. He had said 6,293 hectares of agricultural land in the state have been damaged by siltation in six districts in the first wave of floods. However, an assessment report of the department stated that as on August 1, about 6,615 hectares in eight districts of the state have been affected by siltation. As on August 1, siltation has affected 295 hectares of land in Barpeta district, 614 hectares in Biswanath, 32 hectares in Majuli, 3,565 hectares in Lakhimpur, 79 hectares in Golaghat, three hectares in Darang, 2,000 hectares in Dhemaji and 27 hectares in Jorhat. The amount of siltation is more than 70 centimetres in all the affected land in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts. The minister said the agriculture department is planning to reclaim the siltation-affected land through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. He said 6.29 lakh farmer families have been hit in both waves of floods in the state. Bora said the agriculture department thinks that after the second wave of floods the farmers will not benefit from kharif crops. ""We have to give emphasis on rabi crops and Bodo paddy cultivation,"" he said, adding that the agriculture department is preparing a list of the affected families and their estimated loss in floods. He said the families would be given compensation through direct benefit transfer from the disaster management funds of the state government. Bora said till July 31 altogether 45,000 farmers took the benefit of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana covering 29,400 hectares of agricultural land. ""But we are not sure how many of the flood-affected families have the insurance,"" he said. Bora said the agriculture department has received 17,757 applications under the Chief Minister's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana through which it has set a target to distribute tractors at 70 per cent subsidy to self-help groups."
5a10ea9f9855b76bf13dab0a,California dreamin’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/california-dreamin/article19591724.ece,2017-08-31,"Last week, a familiar scent filled a new restaurant at McCarthy Ranch Plaza, in Milpitas, California. The South Indians gathered patiently inside, all hankering for a taste of home, took a deep appreciative breath. Practically every table ordered the same item off the menu: biryani chunky with tender mutton and stocky seeraga samba rice.Judging by social media reviews of the 400 people who ate on the first day, most were delighted about the launch of this American outpost offering typical Southern Tamil Nadu biryani. Or namma ooru biryani as one commentator put it on the restaurants Facebook page.From a tiny eight-seater restaurant in Dindigul in 1957 to a high-powered chain of 42 restaurants serving about 2.5 lakh customers across the world everyday, Dindigul Thalappakatti has come a long way. Back in Chennai, owner D Nagasamy settles down to chat about his rapidly expanding empire at his Anna Salai restaurant (one of 24 he has in Chennai) over a bowl of fragrant biryani teamed with cups of sweet, milky chai.We are still using my grandmothers recipe, nothing has been changed... Well, except the method of cooking. Because we now make 1,500 kilos of biryani a day in the central kitchen in Chennai alone. And 2,000 kilos on weekends. However, we still use the same spices: cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, all hand-ground on stones with a little water to maximise flavour.Rice and spiceThe biryani is now made in a largely automated central kitchen. For every kilogram of rice, we use 10 grams of the spice blend. The spices are put along with onions, garlic and water into a machine to be made into a masala. It takes three hours for each cycle. At full capacity, the machine can yield 450 litres of the biryani masala. Mutton and rice are added after this.Nagasamy pauses for a few seconds to do the math. That much masala makes 7,000 biryanis. Which means they still have plenty of bandwidth for expansion in Chennai.Determined to standardise flavour despite the burgeoning number of restaurants, the team is particular about ingredients and technique. The meat comes from Kannivadi, from tender grass-fed goats. (Kannivadi is a small town in Dindigul district.) The rice is a type of short grain seeraga samba , called parakkum sittu , from Tiruchi and Thuraiyur. Cinnamon comes from Theni. Combined, they create a unique style of biryani, popular in Southern Tamil Nadu. Which is why, for the past 10 years, most of their expansion has been in the State. If you serve basmati biryani in Tiruchi, people wont accept it. They want seeraga samba , Nagasamy says.Turban talesBusiness was given an unexpected fillip by a rash of pretenders who used the chains trademark name, and now-iconic logo of a turban, to advertise. When my grandfather opened his restaurant in 1957 serving my grandmothers biryani, his customers began to call it thalapaketti because he wore a turban, so that became our logo, says Nagasamy, discussing how he advertised his first restaurant in Chennai (Anna Nagar) in 2008.A number of other establishments then sprung up, following the same theme. At one point, there were 70 restaurants using some version of thalapaketti in their name.Nagasamy finally went to court against Chennai-based Rawther Thalappakattu Biryani. Both sides defended their right to use the name and turban in a long-drawn legal battle from 2008 to 2013. Finally, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board ruled in favour of Dindiguls Thalappakatti, stating that Rawthers version  Thalappakattu  did not have a significant phonetic difference. Nagasamy says the episode turned out to be an advantage. By 2013, everyone had heard about us.Leading the way into the kitchen, past sacks of charcoal, bubbling kadais and vats of payasam topped with puddles of golden ghee, Nagasamy carefully lifts a cloth-covered lid on a large pot of biryani, which has just arrived from the central kitchen.Chamber of flavoursThe room is enveloped in a steamy fog of cardamon, cinnamon and ghee. He uses an oversized spoon to gently stir the meaty rice. This rice is easily digestible. It absorbs flavours so its very tasty. And we traditionally make the biryani with boneless mutton as its easy to cook and eat.Last year, he opened restaurants in Dubai, Malaysia and Paris. A lot of our customers in France come from Puducherry and Dindigul. We use the local meat in our international restaurants, but follow our traditional recipe.He adds, We still have expansion plans in Tamil Nadu. Salem and Erode are next on the list. By the end of the year, we plan to open 10 more restaurants. Including one in Abu Dhabi, which should be ready to launch in three months.Although he works with partners for the international launches (We invest 51% in each one), he keeps the Indian business small and fairly intimate. We have 2,000 employees, and many of them have worked for us for decades. Till now, I have taken no franchises. Its fully owned by me. So its my baby, he says, adding with a grin, So if anything goes wrong, Im the one who feels the pain.Whats so special about Dindigul biryani?According to legend, the water from Kamarajar Lake in Athoor enhances the flavours of the biryani made in Dindigul.Traditionally, it is prepared with a superiorseeraga sambarice, known asparakkum sittu.The meat comes from top-class breeds of cattle found in the famous cattle-markets of Kannivadi and Paramathi.By another nameTahari is a vegetarian version of biryani, prepared by adding potatoes to rice. In Kashmir, it is sold as street food and the dish became popular during World War II, when meat was a rarity."

It was his brother, Haleem. The building has fallen. I am under the debris and am having trouble breathing, was all he could manage. Mr. Saleem, a railing craftsman, and his three siblings were residents of the six-storey Husseini building on Pakmodia Street near JJ Hospital that collapsed on Thursday. Fortunately, all three were among the first to be rescued within 10 minutes of the collapse.The ground floor was occupied by commercial establishments including a caterer and a tailors. Tawakkul Sweets, located adjacent to the building, employed five workers including Sagir Ahmed, 31, an Uttar Pradesh native, his brothers Raees, 29, and Naseer, 24, and nephew Kayyum Mansoory, 19. All were sleeping when the building collapsed; only three could be rescued. The tailor died and his daughter was seriously injured, said locals.I was in a light slumber near the door. I remember hearing a loud crash and the next thing I know, I was being dragged out by several people, Mr. Ahmed said. Raees, a father of two, was later pulled out dead, while there is still no word on Naseer and Kayyum. We came to Mumbai 10 years go from U.P., looking for employment; this building was our only home.The collapse, which claimed 22 lives, left many families broken, including the Zafars. Reshma Zafar, who lived on the third floor, survived with serious injuries, but her husband and son were killed. Similarly, all members of a family on the fifth floor died with the exception of a young boy, who had been sent to buy bread for breakfast.I woke up early and had started cooking when the walls started shaking. I rushed out. When I turned around, the building came crashing down. My two brothers and three other colleagues died, Mohammed Sartaj said. Numb with grief, he continued standing near the massive pile of rubble, hoping to recover his monthly salary of Rs. 14,000 from the ruins.Locals rush to helpPakmodia Street residents poured out on the streets within seconds of the tragedy, rushing to help anyone who could be rescued. Eateries came together and cooked dal and rice in large quantities, and a makeshift kitchen was set up across the lane from the site of the collapse by afternoon. Residents moved from person to person, be it firemen, policemen, NDRF personnel or locals helping with the rescue operation, informing them that hot food was available. Local social and political workers were roped in, and carton after carton of bottled water was rushed to the site. Bheed mat karo, jinka kaam hai unko kaam karne do (Dont gather, let the people work), local resident Mohammed Ilias, 60, called out with a handheld public address system, while others helped him disperse crowds of onlookers who were getting too close to the site. Young boys kept fetching water for the elderly volunteer, who refused to take a break till evening.Around 3 p.m., Aftab Ali, another local resident, arrived at the site looking for blood donors for the victims admitted to JJ Hospital. Mr. Ilias immediately began calling for volunteers on the PA system, and Mr. Ali directed donors to the hospital. As the azaan for the third namaaz sounded, Mr. Ilias asked people to head to the local mosque and pray for the souls of the departed and speedy recovery of the injured."

Companies and traders were bullish about sugarcane and cotton , which have seen an increase in acreage by 9% and 18%, respectively, this year.Floods in parts of Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and weak rainfall in south India have hit crops. Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar has already stated that the government is planning to extend paddy cultivation to 1,000 acres in the Aranmula puncha and surrounding fields this year.The Special Officer of the Mission Green Aranmula project appointed by the government, J. Sajeev, told The Hindu that the department could launch cultivation in 250 acres in the puncha last year to produce rice worth Rs. 1.18 crore.Paddy cultivation was held in 250 acres of land in the Aranmula puncha against the original target of 56 ha, that too, at a far lower cost of Rs. 81 lakh against the original estimate of Rs. 154 lakh, sources said.Bonus cropThe government would provide financial relief worth Rs. 30,000 a hectare to the farmers groups (Padashekhara Samiti) and the Uma variety of paddy would be sown in the puncha, Mr. Sajeev said. Interestingly, the paddy seeds that had dropped in the fields during the harvest had sprouted and flourished well, without any fertilizers, to provide the peasants a bonus, amply indicating the natural soil fertility, said Ananthakumar, a Padashekhara Samiti leader.The Padashekhara Samiti has successfully launched cultivation in 14 acres of land that was previously included in the site marked for the controversial Aranmula airport project.Restoration of streamFarmers feel that the restoration of the Karimaramthode natural stream and the Aranmula-chaal, a major water reservoir, to their original condition was a must for the successful and smooth conduct of paddy farming in Aranmula Puncha.The district administration completed almost 90% of the stream restoration work a few months ago. Delay in carrying out the final leg of work has left the natural stream stagnant.Mr. Sajeev said that cultivation would begin in October itself."

We might consider orange juice a healthier option but 100 ml of it contains 9 gms of natural sugar. He explains, 100 ml of an aerated drink contains 10 gms of sugar. So, it is more healthy to have the fruit. You feel full after having one. For a glass of juice, they add about four oranges, increasing its sugar content.It is important to know the amount of nutrients you are consuming. Veer says Indians tend to have an unhealthy diet. Indian foods are heavy on carbohydrates and fat as there are rotis, rice and curries are made with lot of oil and butter. And, once you try them, you get addicted and it is difficult to get out of them. He says 35 per cent of his subscribers are from India. People from Mumbai and Delhi are more fitness conscious than Bengaluru, he adds.Todays youngsters want to look good and Bollywood impresses an image of that perfect body. They go to a gym but dont realise that gymming is just 20 per cent of the equation. The rest 80 per cent is food, he says adding people think it is important to consume proteins for developing muscles. It is true. They eat chicken but the meat contains fat too. Hence, it is important to eat in right amount, he adds.Veer founded The Food Analysts four months ago and has more than 60,000 subscribers from USA, UK, Middle East and India, India being the biggest market.He says, I used to spend a lot for a trainer and gym. But, I wasnt satisfied with the results. He downloaded a fitness app that tracks intake of food. I had to break down the food into its different nutrients and upload pictures and data on the app. I thought why not have someone else to do it for me, he adds. People usually click food pictures to post on Instagram, Facebook. With TFA, they can post the pictures on a WhatsApp group and get a report on the nutrients in their diet.I didnt want to inconvenience users, with downloading an app and then uploading pictures. Instead, I decided to have it on WhatsApp so they can chat like friends, he says.How the platform worksSign up on the platform, giving basic details such as weight, height, food habits and exercise routine. You can choose a monthly package or a yearly one. A registration fee of `400 per month for a year is charged. Once you register, you can start chatting with the nutritionists on WhatsApp. You can send the pictures of your food and get a report on the nutrients you have consumed. The nutritionists can also suggest a change in diet, if required and suggest the foods you should consume.How accurate is this platform?Veer Ramlugon, founder of The Food Analysts claims that they have a database of five million food items that have been tested in labs for its nutrients. The platform is 85 per cent accurate as the staff has received maximum training to detect the portion one consumes checking the size of the plate and food in the picture. Over a period of time, 15 per cent inaccuracy can be eliminated with the guidance from the nutritionists, he says adding, 10 calories can be burned easily by walking for five minutes."

Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi met on Saturday authorities of the energy and irrigation departments and directed them to ensure optimum power supply and to arrange for the necessary level of water to flow into paddy fields.The chief minister was informed that Agra, Hathras, Amethi, Ghaziabad and Bulandshar districts received highly deficient rains, less than 15% , while in the entire Bundelkhand region comprising Jhansi, Lalitpur and 16 other districts, rains were below 40%. 20 other districts of the region have also received deficient rains. In 48 districts comprising more than 50% of the state's geographical area, rain was deficient this year and if the dry and humid spell continues for the remaining days of September, there may be a crisis for farmers, as majority of them are depending on rains for their paddy crop.During the review meeting, the chief minister was presented a report by the irrigation department on its efforts to bolster flow of water into the agriculture fields, particularly for paddy and other crops of the Kharif season. State energy minister Shrikant Sharma said rise in demand for electricity all over the state was primarily because of deficient rains.Principal secretary irrigation Suresh Chandra told TOI he had issued necessary directions for optimum supply of water to canals for irrigation and he added that he had asked electricity department officials to ensure regular and adequate power supply to run tube wells. Agriculture director Soraj Singh said amid deficient rains in Bundelkhand, seeds and other aids to farmers are being supplied for the Rabi season.Paddy is sown in 59 lakh hectares agriculture land. Last year, rice production was 143 lakh metric tonnes as rains were normal but this time, with below average rain, not only paddy, most Rabi crops, mainly wheat will suffer because of lack of the requisite moisture level."

Clandestine Clara, rebellious and delectable. Roaring Radcliffe, her illegitimate son, a rake with a weakness for tobacco, rum and provocation. British perfume house, Penhaligons, knows a thing or two about using fictional stories of British aristocrats to pique your interest. It did mine, which is why, on a recent trip to San Francisco, I squeezed through a crowded itinerary to slip into the fairly recent Penhaligons store at Westfield mall for adekko. At the perfume bar, over 30 bottles topped with brass animal heads await  sitting pretty in the Portraits collection, the aforesaid Clara, with rhum vanilla head notes, cinnamon musk heart and amber patchouli base, makes her presence felt. She is about to be upstaged by Agarbathi and Paithani, two scents I least expect from a brand founded in 1870 by a Cornish barber who went on to become perfumer to Queen Victoria. The latest in the brands Trade Routes collection, they are inspired by Californian master perfumer Alex Lees visit to India. Notes of bergamot, pink pepper, jasmine and sandalwood define Agarbathi, the perfume houses homage to Indian temples. Paithani, meanwhile, with cardamom, nutmeg, rose and cedar, references our monsoon beverage, the masalachai. What do both fragrances have in common? A heart of milk accord. It is, let me assure you, no coincidence. For as master perfumer Lee confirms, milk in perfumes is trending. In an interview earlier this year, he bravely called it the future.We are closest to our palate than we were in a long time, begins perfumer Jahnvi Dameron Nandan, speaking to me from Paris, where she is working on a new fragrance with an opera house that uses pyrazines and a warm rice note. There is a strong connect between aroma and memory, and the general perception is that we associate the familiar smell of milk with warmth and comfort. Weve never consumed so many sweets as we do today, as I see on streets in Tokyo, Paris and India. It could be a sign of our (troubled) times, observes Nandan, trying to explain the revival of milk in fragrances today. When (Thierry Muglers) Angel came in the early 90s, it planted the idea of gourmand scents or wearing what you eat. The milky note, sticky, sweet and unisex, follows that idea. And when you have the blues, you eat more. Manan Gandhi, the founder of progressive Indian fragrance house, Bombay Perfumery, adds that the milk trend represents how far perfumery has come in terms of sourcing ingredients. Milk-like ingredients molecules are broken down and recreated to achieve a distinct scent that reminds one of comfort and ease, he says, referring to his Chai Musk, the perfect monsoon fragrance for its fiery note of ginger balanced by the milky notes of sandalwood. At Penhaligons, Lee, who hails perfume as a medicine for the spirit, says you can thank milk for imparting creaminess, volume, and a new type of addiction to a perfume.Penhaligons Agarbathi and Paithani at approximately Rs. 14,000 for 100 ml and the Portraits collection for Rs. 15,000 for 75 ml. Bombay Perfumerys Chai Musk at Rs. 4,100.Milk notes are the easiest way to give a creamy facet to a fragrance, bringing some comfort and extending an oriental dimension. A typical milky rich note is good for glamourous evenings, but think about a fresh aloe vera milk or fig milk blend for spring or summer.Pierre Kurzenne, senior perfumer, SymriseWhen sulfurol and pyrazine meet, you get a condensed milk note, cloying and intellectually stimulating. We are in gourmand territory now. It brings back the good moments, like digging into cake or sweets, or walking through a forest.Jahnvi Dameron Nandan, perfumer"

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"
5a14856c9855b76bf13e52ba,Kharif output hit,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/business/story_175032.jsp,2017-09-26,"New Delhi, Sept. 25 (PTI): India's foodgrain production is estimated to decline by 3.86 million tonnes (mt) to 134.67mt this kharif season because of poor rains as well as floods in some parts of the country. According to the first advance estimate released today by the agriculture ministry, the production of all kharif crops - rice, pulses and coarse cereals - is projected to decline from the record 138.52mt last kharif. Harvesting will start from next month. According to the latest data, rice output is likely to fall by 1.9mt to 94.48mt this year from the record 96.39mt in the previous kharif. Pulse output could drop to 8.71mt from the record 9.42mt because of depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur is estimated to be lower at 3.99mt from 4.78mt, while urad output may rise to 2.53mt from 2.17mt in the last kharif season. Coarse cereal output is also seen lower at 31.49mt, against 32.71mt in the gone-by kharif season. Maize output is pegged at 18.73mt against 19.24mt a year ago. Oilseed output is estimated to be down at 20.68mt compared with 22.40mt in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22mt against 13.79mt last kharif. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the earlier 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69mt, from 306.72mt before. Production of jute and mesta is estimated to decline to 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) from 10.60 million bales last year. The overall monsoon was projected normal, but till the first week of this month, it was less by 5 per cent. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced a dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states. The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting. Sugar production The government is expecting about 24 per cent increase in the country's total sugar output to around 25 million tonnes in the marketing year beginning next month on likely higher output in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra following good rains, an official source said. This is an initial projection based on the inputs of the state governments. The estimate, however, is in line with the industry body ISMA's projection. The country's sugar output in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) is estimated to be lower at 20.2 million tonnes because of poor rains. India is the world's second biggest sugar producer. In a meeting with state cane commissioners called by the Union Food Ministry, official sources said state governments have submitted the sugar production figures after assessing the likely sugarcane output and recovery level. Based on their inputs, the country's overall sugar output is expected to be around 25 million tonnes in 2017-18 marketing year, the sources said."

There is opposition to the move from state farmers, and the mandi board is at the centre of it, because it manages procurement of grains and other produce through a network of 1,700 mandis.The corresponding levy is lower in states such as Rajasthan (1.6%) , Uttar Pradesh (2.4%), and Madhya Pradesh (0.2%).One of the options on the mandi boards mind is to hike the fee only for the dominant crops, wheat and paddy. We will implement the governments decision, but we will see that farmers interests are not harmed, said the boards chairman, former Congress minister Lal Singh. In the board meeting of October 11, we will decide whether to implement the hike on all crops or just wheat and paddy.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said the enhancement is unjustified because, though the fees are levied on the purchaser of the farmers produce, the burden actually falls on the farmers. He added, This will lead to increase in the costs and dissuades traders from buying from the state, he said.The funds collected as fees go to the Punjab Rural Development Board for infrastructure, including link roads, which, the government argues, is for the benefit of the farmers.However, with the cotton crop ready, farmers in south-west Punjab prefer to take it to mandis of Sri Ganganagar (Rajasthan) and Dabwali (Haryana), where the levies are lower. Next, basmati growers are worried and already demanding a rollback as the crop is set to arrive in mandis by the end of October.The Punjab Basmati Rice Millers Association has said that said big mills set up under the mega project category have been exempted from the market fee, so the business will shift to those. In 2013, the government had abolished both the fees on purchase of basmati, but it was levied again in 2015.Wheat and paddy produce are bought mostly by state agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on behalf of the Centre, while other crops are primarily procured by traders."

This variety also offers good resistance to pests like Brown Plant Hopper, said officials. Already, 15 tonnes of CO-51 seeds have been distributed at subsidised rates to farmers with more seeds kept in stock at Agriculture Extension Centres."
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

Waterlogging and uprooted trees across south-central and north Kolkata occupied road space, hindering traffic flow.The worst-affected areas included the Rashbehari connector crossing, Narkeldanga Main Road near Swabhumi, Strand Road near high court, Strand Road-Esplanade Row West crossing, Southern Avenue, Loudon Street, Short Street, Sarat Bose Road, Beliaghata and Jadavpur.The Lalbazar control room said that waterlogging on MG Road near Syed Salley Lane crossing led to buses and minibuses towards Girish Park crossing being diverted from Shyambazar five-point crossing through APC Road (towards Manicktala crossing). Waterlogging at underpasses in Ultadanga, Patipukur and Canal Road led to traffic getting diverted from these areas. Other waterlogged roads were Amherst Street, Hide Road, stretches of AJC Bose Road and CR Avenue.Senior IPS officers, though, aid there was no major snarl in any stretch of Kolkata as few people braved the rain to venture out. ""In the entire festive sea on, we had the least number of vehicles on the roads on Monday,"" said DC (traffic) Solomon V Nesakumar.Although it was the first day after Durga Puja vacations, some schools declared a holiday due to the inclement weather.Waterlogging was also reported rom leading government ho pitals with patients and their elatives having to wade through the water at the SSKM Ma n block and cardiology depart ment, RG Kar Hospital's gyana cology department and fair rice shop and the administraive building at the Sambhu ath Pandit Hospital.Fallen trees and branches n Lake View Road and Rashbe ari Avenue led to withdrawal of traffic on Lake View Road (towards Southern Avenue). An uprooted tree on Loudon Street and Short Street crossing led to withdrawal of traffic movement on Loudon Street (towards Minto Park ). A similar incident disrupted traffic on Belvedere Road between Natioal Library and Thakers Island.Train services affectedSuburban train services in Sealdah south and main line sections and Howrah-Barddhaman chord and main line sections were affected as storm-torn tree branches blocked the tracks and intermittent signal failure occurred at some places due to waterlogging.Five pairs of EMU locals of Sealdah Division and nine pairs of local trains of Howrah Division had to be cancelled. Bad weather caused track circuit and signal failures at Belghoria, Titagarh, Kolkata, Baruipur and Sealdah stations, delaying a few EMU locals.Branches also fell across the Up line between Bhadreswar and Mankundu station on the Howrah-Barddhaman main line section at 3.50pm and at Boinchigram on the Down line at 5.05pm. Inclined bamboo trees touched the overhead wire of the Up line between Seoraphuli and Diara stations of Tarakeswar section around 4.30pm .The overhead power supply between Cheragram and Belmuri along the Howrah Barddhaman Chord line was also disturbed due to heavy rain around 4pm."

Sandip Daundkar NICU ward of Thane District Civil Hospital. Sandip DaundkarJust as Nashik civil authorities were dealing with the public outcry over 55 infant deaths in August, 80 km away in Jawhar, a tribal area three hours drive away, Hira Dambale lost the battle to save her 28-day-old baby. Blind in one eye due to a childhood measles infection, Hira battled anaemia during her pregnancy and gave birth prematurely, at just 24 weeks, to a child who weighed only 490 grams.Doctors at the sub-district hospital in Jawhar tried in vain to save the baby that had been kept in the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) for nearly a month. Hira has a seven-year-old boy who is moderately malnourished. She lost another baby two years ago and her third one could survive for less than a month. Hira required blood transfusion due to her low haemoglobin count. During my pregnancy, the doctors gave me tablets to increase my blood count but I did not take them. There was too much acidity, says this tribal woman whose staple meal is rice grown in a small patch near her hut at Talasri village.For 22-year-old Anita Budhar, who is from Mokhada taluka in Palghar district, it was her second delivery on September 2. The baby weighed only 700g and has been admitted to the SNCU at Jawhar hospital. Like Hira, she too had required blood transfusion due to her low haemoglobin count. At the government-run 100-bed cottage hospital at Jawhar, admits medical superintendent Dr Ramdas Marad, at least 30 new mothers undergo blood transfusions after deliveries every month.Low birth weight, one of the main reasons for a large number of infant deaths in Maharashtra and other states, is linked to factors like nutrition and anaemia. An anaemic pregnant woman is more likely to deliver a baby lighter than normal, and 49.3 per cent pregnant women across Maharashtra were anaemic according to the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4). Among the non-pregnant women too, 48 per cent of them in the age group of 15-49 were anaemic.Jawhar and Mokhada, along with adjoining Vada and Vikramgad talukas in Palghar district, have reported several cases of children with malnutrition. According to a National Human Rights Commission report, at least 600 children died due to malnutrition in Palghar district last year. The 100-bed cottage hospital at Jawhar caters to 1.5 lakh people and gets referrals from tribal pockets of Mokhada, Vikramgad and others. There are at least 180-200 admissions of sick babies every month at the 12-bed SNCU. Most of the babies weigh between 800 grams and 1 kg. From April to August, a total of 748 sick babies were admitted at the Jawhar SNCU, of which 27 died. While malnutrition related deaths are high in these tribal pockets, the cottage hospital has set up a Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre where every month a minimum of 20 children are admitted, says Marad.At Nashik civil hospital, which was in the eye of a storm with 55 deaths in August this year, about 250 to 300 sick babies are admitted to the 28-bed SNCU every month. Nearly 25 per cent of the 700-odd women who give birth at the hospital every month suffer from anaemia.While majority of the women have mild or moderate anaemia that is treated with injections, those whose haemoglobin count less than 7 need blood transfusions and at least two out of ten such women require it every month, says Dr Suresh Jagdale, Civil Surgeon, Nashik district.At Thanes 336-bed district hospital, Civil Surgeon Dr B C Kempi Patil admitted that out of 738 admissions at the 16-bed SNCU, there were 47 deaths of neonates between April and August this year. These are extremely critical babies referred from other centres. However, the death rate is 6.37 per cent and we have been managing these babies. In fact, a team from Uttar Pradesh recently visited the hospital to take tips on how we were managing the babies, says Patil.Maharashtra registers about 20 lakh deliveries annually. Between April and August this year, a total of 22,692 babies were admitted and treated at the 36 SNCUs across the state. About 16.62 per cent of the babies that were admitted to these SNCUs weighed less than 1,000g, while 29.33 per cent weighed between 1,000 and 1,499g. In 2016-17, a total of 50,373 children were admitted and treated in the SNCUs. According to the state analysis, a total of 15.31 per cent babies at the time of admission had weighed less than 1,000g, while 29.45 per cent had weighed between 1,000 and 1,499g.The state health department will now introduce National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) to address anaemia that includes providing supervised biweekly iron folic acid supplementation for all under-5 children and weekly tablets for adolescents in the age group of 10-19 years. The challenge, public health experts say, is huge. Fauzdar Ram, former director of Indian Institute of Population Sciences, Mumbai, who is a co-author of the Million Death Study published in September in The Lancet, told The Indian Express that the total number of childbirths in India had declined only slightly from 28 million every year to 26 million between 2000 and 2015.Our challenge is now to meet the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) for child and neonatal mortality. The child mortality rates have halved from 2.5 million child deaths in 2000 to 1.2 million child deaths in 2015. Neonatal deaths that were 50 per cent of all child deaths in 2000, however rose to 58 per cent in 2015. We will now have to address several challenges and will require an average annual decline from 2015 onwards of 4.1 per in child mortality and 5.3 per cent in neonatal mortality. The biggest target is to reduce neonatal mortality due to prematurity or low birth-weight deaths, especially in poorer states. These are strongly linked to factors like antenatal care, anaemia, education and nutrition, says Ram.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5a1516a49855b76bf13ead82,Food for reform,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-food-prices-inflation-indian-economy-food-for-reform-4898307/,2017-10-20,"Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

There are hundreds of units that produce veneer, plywood, and block boards, located mainly at Vengola, Rayamangalam, Vazhakulam and Asamannoor panchayats and in Perumbavoor municipality. Except quality control, most skilled and unskilled work is carried out by migrant workers, notes the study conducted by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) with support from Thummarukudy Foundation.Skilled workersEngaged informally at the units are workers from Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam, while the skilled workforce mostly comprises workers from Assam.The monograph on migrant workers in the district, jointly written by Benoy Peter and Vishnu Narendran of CMID, records their presence in the construction industry; hospitality sector; furniture industry that is thriving at Nellikuzhi where eminent craftsmen from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh known for their wood carving skills function; textile and apparel units around Kizhakkambalam; cement factories on Willingdon island; fishing industry at Thoppumpady, Munambam, and Vypeen; rice mills at Kalady, and other industries at Airapuram, Angamaly, South Vazhakkulam, Edathala, Edayar, Binanipuram, Nellad, and Kalamassery.They are also engaged as housekeeping staff in luxury hotels (the only exception being men and women from the northeast manning lobbies of hotels), fuel stations, restaurants, malls, and hospitals.Work at quarriesSeveral workers from Odisha and West Bengal have been engaged as gardeners. Quarries spread along the district also have migrant labour.The study has identified Nagaon-Ernakulam and Mushidabad-Ernakulam as the two arterial, and the longest, migrant corridors that have emerged in India in the past two decades.It also throws light on the education facilities available for wards of migrant labourers in the district."
5a149e2c9855b76bf13e62a3,Surface ozone is damaging wheat and rice crops across the country: Study,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surface-ozone-is-damaging-wheat-and-rice-crops-across-the-country-study/story-ATrw25PIoFHlYeQsqG7YDJ.html,2017-10-31,"Surface ozone, a plant-damaging pollutant could be destroying up to 15% wheat crop and up to 6% rice yield every year across India, a first-of-its kind study based on ground observations of ozone, has revealed.A multi-institute study comprising 14 scientists and led by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, under the Department of Space, has estimated that every year, surface ozone is likely to wipe out 4.014.2 million tonnes (MT) of the total 95 MT of wheat produced in India, and 0.36.7 MT of the total 105 MT rice grown.Surface ozone  also called a secondary pollutant  is generated through chemical reactions between primary pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight. The sources of these primary pollutants are power plants, vehicles, industries, and bio-mass burning.With a projected rise in man-made pollution including surface ozone, researchers said the findings are important since a decrease in crop yield in India, which is the second populous country, will have a serious impact on its food security and economic growth.Wheat and rice are important crops for India since they form a staple diet, said professor Shyam Lal, principal investigator, PRL. Photosynthesis takes place during the day. When ozone molecules, which are generated in the presence of sunlight, get into the plant cells, the plant gets affected and can get damaged.Previous studies have calculated the annual loss of wheat crop in the range of 5% to 30%, and between 2.1% and 16 % for rice yields. However, these high estimates were based on either limited observations  restricted to some states only  or regional and global chemistry transport models.Ozone is a very new phenomenon in India now, and ozone levels are rising. The findings are important, as we now know from different sources of the impact of surface ozone on vegetation and crops, in addition to health. This means that pollution is ultimately reaching food security, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, who was not involved in the study. Ozone reduction strategies have to become an important policy focus now.The present study, drawn from data on surface ozone recorded at 17 locations across India, has found that general pattern of ozone variability shows higher ozone in AprilMay, lower in August and again increasing in October November.This is because high pollution levels and strong sunlight especially between March and May results in high levels of surface ozone damaging crops. Low surface ozone levels recorded during winter months when pollution levels are high but sunlight is low will either not damage crops or the loss is less.Though there is a permissible human exposure level for surface ozone set by the Central Pollution Control Board, there are no safe levels prescribed for plants.For the study, researchers used two internationally adopted methods to assess the exposure of crops to surface ozone  average ozone levels for seven hours during the day for three-month cropping period and second, accumulated ozone levels that exceed 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) over the same period.[S2] In the present study, exposure to wheat in the north and west-central regions of India crossed the average surface ozone 40 ppbv threshold between January and March. The North Indian region includes Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, while west-central regions comprise Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Average ozone levels during the wheat crop duration of three months were highest in the west/central region at about 47 ppbv followed by north India at about 41 ppbv. The corresponding accumulated ozone levels recorded in the west was 16,300 ppbv*hr and it was about 7,200 ppbv*hr in the north. However, a major part of the wheat crop is grown in north India only.The damage to rice though lower was also pronounced in northern and western-central parts of the country. The seasonal average ozone levels in the north and west-central were 33 ppbv and 27 ppbv  and the corresponding accumulated ozone levels in both these regions were 4730 ppbv*hr and 3400 ppbv*hr.Researchers said as compared to wheat, crop loss for rice is less because surface ozone levels are lower as the main harvesting period is soon after the summer monsoon. Also average surface ozone levels are lower in the eastern and southern regions of India where large quantity of rice is grown.India has two cropping seasons  Kharif and Rabi. Sowing for rice, a kharif crop, takes place between June and July, and its harvested from September to October. Wheat is a rabi crop that is sown between November and December, and harvested from February to April.North India logged the highest annual loss of about 9 MT of wheat. For rice, the maximum loss of about 2.6 MT every year was recorded from the countrys eastern region of Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Assam, and Jharkhand.With pollution levels set to rise further including levels of surface ozone, international studies have predicted higher losses for wheat and rice for India by 2030.Ozone is a very reactive gas, and while it is very harmful for health it also has a huge impact on vegetation. Ozone will increase if emissions of gases from combustion of sources such as vehicles and industries increase. If you have to control ozone, then need to control emissions from nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, said Roychowdhury.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that wheat, 73% of which is cultivated in north India alone, should be sown as early as possible starting November so that it is grown in the period when ozone is relatively lower.Wheat and rice cultivars, which have resistance to ozone damage, need to be developed. We would like to suggest policy makers to work out plans to reduce air pollution, particularly in the northern India. This will take care not only of the losses of the crops but also health of the public, read the study.."

Action will certainly be taken on the basis of the report.The move came just weeks after Rawat issued marching orders to Kumaon regional food controller VS Dhanik in connection with the Rs 600 rice scam.Incidentally, the civil supplies department is among the departments which will face special audit, a source said. Other departments include Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd (UPRNNL), State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Ltd (Sidcul), Technical University and state cooperative bank.Cabinet minister Madan Kaushik confirmed that the order was issued. The order was issued after complaints were received against those departments, he said, confirming that UPRNNL is one of the departments to face audit.The order for a special audit of construction works carried out by UPRNNL was issued after the government received complaints, Kaushik said, denying the reports that such steps were initiated with an eye on the local body polls and the Lok Sabha election.The anti-graft measures we have been taking are in line with the CMs stated policy of zero tolerance to corruption. As it is, the general election is more than a year away.The government was duty bound to initiate action on all kinds of complaints, including those related to corruption, he asserted.The old constructions carried out by UPRNNL would be audited as the venture was banned in Uttarakhand. A decision to ban UPRNNL was taken after we got complaints relating to construction works it carried out, parliamentary affairs minister Prakash Pant had said.Political observers took a different take on the issue. I have no doubt that the anti-corruption measures being taken by this government will benefit the BJP in all elections, Prof MM Semwal of HNB Garhwal (Central) University said. But, he said, the government has to be consistent in initiating anti-graft measures.It introduced the law but its effective implementation in terms of providing timely services to people is yet to be carried out, Semwal said, citing the example of the Right to Services Act."

But within days of its journey rolling out from the north, the yatra got bogged down in controversy. By getting into a Mini Cooper belonging to a hawala accused in Kozhikode's Koduvally town, yatra leader and state CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan inadvertently pressed the wrong gear.BJP state secretary K. Surendran was the first to puncture the yatra by posting on Facebook the picture of a beaming Kodiyeri in the vehicle, only to be taken up by Muslim League and the Congress very soon.The Mini Cooper, now found to be falsely registered in neighbouring Puducherry, belonged to Karat Faizal, an alleged smuggler who happens to be the younger brother of the CPM-backed legislator of Koduvally, Karat Razak. Although Kodiyeri feigned ignorance, not many took it at face value.But a bigger Mini Cooper in the form of Thomas Chandy, state transport minister and the representative of Sharad Pawar's NCP in the government, was awaiting the yatra from the south, led by Kanam Rajendran, state secretary of the CPI, the other major partner of the Front.A moneybag bereft of any Left leaning, Chandy, facing serious accusations of flouting wetland rules allegedly under the benevolent protection of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, literally broke the yatra axle while in Kuttanad, one-time rice bowl of the state in central Kerala.Chandy, better known with his suffix 'Kuwait' in the area, has made his money in the Gulf and hence the sobriquet. He managed to bag an Assembly ticket and then became a minister by default, some say by design, when the other representative of NCP had to quit as minister following charges of lewd conversation over the phone with a woman reporter.Within months of his induction, Chandy was at the centre of a controversy swirling around alleged filling of backwaters to lay a road to his swanky multi-crore resort in Alappuzha, Venice of the East.Although the district collector in her report has indicted Chandy, the CPM leadership has termed the report ""one-sided"". As the Opposition and leading environmentalists clamoured for his resignation and a proper probe into the allegations, the chief minister told the Assembly that the attack on Chandy was ""politically motivated"".The CPI, which holds the revenue ministry, had differed with the chief minister, but Vijayan has brushed aside the objections.Chandy, while presiding over an event to felicitate Rajendran, went on a tirade against his critics saying that no one, ""not even investigating agencies will be able to lift a little finger"" against him.It was considered a statement made with the full backing from the government. It was also seen as an open challenge to the CPI that has been at loggerheads with the CPM on important issues, especially land deals.The deafening silence on the part of the chief minister has added legitimacy to the growing belief that the Left Front is with and for the moneyed class.

The number is reducing every year as the department is trying to take measures, he said.A senior official from the department, on anonymity, said that on an average, every year in Karnataka, 200 new boilers are added.These boilers need routine inspection. The wear and tear also cause damage. We can prevent accidents, provided it is routinely checked and maintained.The owners focus more on production than maintenance, official said.Further, an official said, though there are 3,000 boilers, there are hardly 10 officials, including the Joint Director, Assistant Director. Normally the inspection is conducted by inspectors, with one inspector for every 300 to 400 boilers. How can one person inspect so many boilers in one year? Some boilers need inspection twice a year to get certified. We need people to conduct a routine inspection. The department is planning to hire three more people, but even then it wont be enough, he said.When contacted T G Manjunath, Director of Factories, Boilers, Industrial Safety and Health, said, there is a shortage of inspection staff but they are trying to manage. The government of India has also given some relaxation on inspection.All these years, it was a department official. Now, third-party inspection is also possible, where an external private agency is given authorisation to do a periodic inspection. This will certainly lessen the burden, added the official."

We have done the weighing and I am happy to announce that this is the new Guinness World Record, weighing in at 918 kilograms, said Paulina Sapinska, a Guinness World Record judge. The minimum quantity required for making a record was 500 kilos, she said.The khichdi was cooked in a specially made stainless steel wok that weighed around 300kg and had a capacity of 1,000 litres. The wok full of khichdi was lifted with a crane to measure the total weight.The cooked dish was later served to hundreds of people at the venue and also distributed for charity .Earlier in the day, yoga guru Baba Ramdev added tadka (tempering of spices) to the dish at the India Gate lawns, where the three-day festival is being organised by the ministry of food processing industries.It is a proud moment for us. Now khichdi, the Indian dish, has earned global recognition, chef Sanjeev Kapoor said.Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Union minister of food processing industries, also lent a helping hand while the the dish was being cooked, suggested that khichdi be declared International Super Food. Union minister of state Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and chefs Imtiaz Qureshi and Ranveer Brar also helped in the cooking the dish that was made with 125 kilos of rice, 50 kilos of moong dal (beans), 200 kilos of solid ingredients such as millet, jowar and ghee and 700 litres of water.Khichdi is not just nutritious but it also symbolises unity and diversity of India, as it is consumed in one or the other form across the country, yoga guru Ramdev said.After weighing, the dish was sent for distribution to 10,000 children in Uttar Pradeshs Vrindavan through Akshay Patra Foundation, an organisation which serves meals to underprivileged children, and also as langar served at gurdwaras of Delhi to commemorate Gurpurab. The khichdi was one of the offerings at the Great Indian Food Street at the festival that features street food from 20 states.Even before being cooked, khichdi had taken the centre stage at the food fair. The buzz started when it was announced that the dish would be showcased as Brand India food . The dish was selected as it symbolised Indias unity in diversity and is eaten by both the rich and poor.Khichdi started trending on social media right after the announcement, with people whipping up a debate. On Thursday, Harsimrat Kaur Badal put an end to the rumours and tweeted, Enough khichdi cooked up on a fictitious National Dish. It has only been put for a record entry in #WorldFoodIndia.."

Thank heavens. Not that I have anything against khichdi. Indeed, its my dish of choice on rainy days, accompanied by deep-fried pakoras, papads and prawn pickle. But khichdi as national dish? Thats like saying drab is my favourite colour.My objection is to foisting one national dish on a country that displays such culinary diversity. (For that matter, I believe its difficult to impose anything by diktat in a temperamentally-anarchic society like ours.) As food historian Pushpesh Pant says, its a sad, bad idea to nationalise cultural heritage. People should have a sense of ownership, unprompted.Thats what legacy is all about. Two, I love my greens but dont see why our national dish should be vegetarian. Which is why I hugely enjoyed all the sarcy memes and jokes that were sparked by the reports of the chawal-dal mix being singled out for national honour, and was just gearing up for a candle march to Jantar Mantar in protest when Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur clarified that khichdi was just being celebrated as a dish that represents Brand India; nothing more, nothing less.Now that a few days have passed since the outrage and I know we dont need to click our heels and salute every time khichdi turns up at the table, I think the minister and celebrity Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who cooked over 800 kg of the stuff in a 1,000-litre capacity kadhai at the World Food India event in the capital on Saturday, to symbolise Indias great culture of unity in diversity at its best, may be onto something. Because after much mulling over our regional cuisines, the humble khichdi does seem to be the only dish that finds expression in kitchens across the country.Sweet, salty, spicy, vegetarian, non-vegetarian, we have khichdis in all flavours. Theres pongal in Tamil Nadu and bisi bele bhath in Karnataka. Hyderabad has the spice-laden keeme ki khichdi. In addition to the watery gruel cooked for patients, Uttar Pradesh has the amla khichdi that must be had on Makar Sankranti; Bengal the ghee-soaked khichuri packed with cauliflower and peas, and Odisha the yummy mix thats served as bhog to one lakh pilgrims a day at Puris Jagannath Mandir.In the West, Maharashtra has the sabudana khichdi and Gujarat the sola khichdi with vegetables, cream andwait for itmincemeat. Like other signature Indian dishes like the samosa, biryani and halwa, the khichdi too evolves, triggered by regional and seasonal imperatives like availability of produce and local palate, explains Pant.Not just geography, the dish works across history and religions as well. Historians mention Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya dipping their fingers in it while Moroccan traveler Ibn Batuta talks about having kishri, containing rice and beans, during his travels in India around 1350. Later books have Aurangzeb chomping on Alamgiri khichdi, containing fish and boiled eggs, while Wajid Ali Shahs favourite is said to have been a rich khichdi packed with almond slivers and pistachio. I wonder which version Minister Kaur likes personally.Shampa Dhar-Kamathshampa@newindianexpress.com"
5a155d1e9855b76bf13eda70,Demonetisation fails to bring any cheer for farmers,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/uMBxJKAeoC4n26DxmLdngP/Demonetisation-fails-to-bring-any-cheer-for-farmers.html,2017-11-07,"Demonetisation created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch in a the agriculture market driven by cash transactions. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."
5a5333b09855b770e037e1fd,Demonetisation and Tughlaq Modi,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/641638/demonetisation-tughlaq-modi.html,2017-11-08,"DH News Service, Bengaluru, Nov 8 2017, 19:40 ISTGauri Lankesh, the Kannada journalist gunned down on September 5, had responded to the note ban with a special edition of her weekly magazine and this editorial. PM Modi demonetised Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8, 2016.Narendra Modi has revealed his Tughlaq face. Claiming to wage war against black money, he has gone to war against the middle class and the poor, who constitute a majority. By demonetising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes, he has mocked them as cheats and dubbed as thugs people without a morsel to eat. This special edition looks at many aspects of his demonetisation madness.Bizarre stories made the rounds on social media last week. Some claimed the new Rs 2,000 note would have a nano chip to enable the government to monitor how the money was being spent. The income tax authorities, or so the stories said, would use satellites to locate and raid those hoarding new notes. The stories claimed the notes could be tracked even if they were buried 120 metres below the earth. Zee News in Hindi and a Kannada channel zealously put out imaginary stories. One of the anchors was bouncing up and down in delight like the pontiff of the Pejawar math. The woman presenter who seconds him went to the extent of proclaiming the note featured a picture of the Mars mission to indicate how satellites would keep an eye on the currency.The stories spread like wildfire. Last week, when I boarded a train to Hubballi, all my fellow passengers were talking about the chip. Taken aback at their naivete, I said, Its all a lie. Theres no such chip in the note. Two middle-aged men, sceptical about me, said the news had appeared on TV. Not everything that appears on TV is true, I said. They countered me: they had heard such notes were already in circulation in the US. Who told you? There are no such notes anywhere in the world, I said. What is the use of demonetisation then? one of them asked. Give it some thought, I said. A young man on a top berth butted in: You know what use it is? Big industrialists have borrowed money and are not paying back their loans. The banks have no money. That's why they are out to make people deposit their money. And people are taking their old notes to the banks, afraid they will turn out worthless otherwise.You mean this wont solve the black money problem? one of the men said. It will take care of fake currency for a while. But its extent isnt big. Within months, they will start making counterfeits of the new notes. The corrupt keep their wealth in jewellery and property, not cash. Only a small amount gets demonetised. In any case, we will never get, as Modi had promised, Rs 15 lakh in each of our bank accounts, I said.Oh, we thought Modi was on to something big. Looks like he has just put his hands into our pockets, a man said, sighing.The State Bank of India has just written off loans it had advanced to 63 companies. Know how much they owed? A whopping Rs 7,016 crore. This includes the Rs 1,201 crore owed by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. It isnt difficult to guess on whose side Modi is: the affluent who borrowed for their fancies and whose loans he has waived or the millions of hard-working people standing in long bank queues to deposit money they have earned.Modi has not been able to bring black money stashed away abroad. He hasnt even been able to name the secret account holders. His election promise of Rs 15 lakh in each citizens account remains a pipe dream. Even if we put up with such scams, how can we look on as he snatches away the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class?An elderly man waiting to take out money for his daily expenses has died. And how did a BJP vice-president respond to it? Big deal. People die even in ration shop queues.When it dawned on Modi that a majority was frustrated with his insane actions, he didnt say, Please bear with me. I will fix the problem in a few days. Instead, he said, Im doing all this for the nation. People who have ruled us for 70 years are conspiring against me. No one in his party told him, But sir, when did these people, struggling to withdraw their own money, ever rule in these 70 years? How can they conspire against you?The middle class and people in the media, who had hailed demonetisation as Modis masterstroke, now see the machinations behind it. They are aware the new note holds no magic. It cant banish black money, and Modis eccentricities are causing them misery.Modi continues to say we must put up with all this in the interest of the nation, but the problem wont go away anytime soon. Common people will have to scrape and scrounge for cash at least for four months. Business has been affected badly. With no customers, fisherfolk and traders in West Bengal are in the doldrums. In Punjab, farmers have no cash to buy seeds. If they dont sow now, the prices of rice and wheat will go up soon. No money in hand, nothing to eat either is the fate of millions. All this thanks to Modi.The BJP is feeling the heat of the peoples anger. Party president Amit Shah has instructed MPs to put up flex boards praising Modis surgical strike against black money. They usually follow his instructions to the letter, but this time they arent paying him any heed. Except for an MP in Gujarat, no one has put up laudatory flex hoardings.Even people in Gujarat have turned against Modi. Assembly elections are coming up. Expecting praise, party workers holding pamphlets went towards citizens standing in a bank queue. They received blows instead!Allies such as the Akali Dal in Punjab and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are also turning their back on the BJP. Quite a few BJP leaders are openly criticising Modis actions in the presence of the media, though they are unwilling to speak on record. Even Modi is coming to know of the attrition he has generated. That is why he comes across as so fidgety on his tours.About 25 people have died across the country because of demonetisation. In Uttar Pradesh, a couple with old notes was turned away from a hospital and their daughter died as a consequence. A woman in Gujarat with old notes couldnt feed her two children; she hanged herself.In Kanpur, a young man had been trying for months to sell his property. On November 8, he finally received Rs 70 lakh in advance. When he heard of demonetisation the next morning, he suffered a heart attack and died. A woman in Telangana, who had sold her land for her husbands medical treatment and her daughters wedding, was told the cash was worthless. She committed suicide. In Udupi, a man standing in a long queue, waiting for his bank to open, died of a heart attack.Not one of these was a thug. Not one of them was an Adani, Ambani, Tata or Birla. They were honest middle-class people, farmers, homemakers, all earning their livelihood from honest toil. They ended up as victims of Modis grandiose war against black money. He is responsible for their deaths.In fact, Modi has launched no surgical strike against black money. What he has done is push helpless people to death. What better can we expect from Modis Tughlaq dispensation?[Excerpted from The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, edited by Chandan Gowda, and published by DC Books and Navayana, Delhi.Chandan Gowda says, The book brings together select political and cultural writings of the courageous activist-journalist.

That it has turned into a public health emergency in the capital, with the air quality index touching extremely hazardous levels in some parts, necessitating the closure of primary schools, has further lowered its standing. It is unconscionable for governments, through indifference and inaction, to subject citizens to such toxic air, and cause extreme suffering especially among people with respiratory ailments and impaired lung function. The smog that envelops the region is exacerbated by the burning of biomass in Punjab and Haryana, and the winter atmosphere is marked by weak ventilation. An analysis of local sources by IIT-Kanpur last year pointed to construction dust, vehicular pollution, and domestic and industrial emissions as other major factors. Clearly, the burden of such chronic problems has outweighed the benefits conferred by measures such as the ban on Deepavali crackers, and in the past, the shift to compressed natural gas for commercial vehicles and restricting car use to odd and even number plates on alternate days. A comprehensive solution demands that the governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, assisted by the Centre, address farm residue burning and construction dust.The post-monsoon  as opposed to pre-monsoon  burning of rice and wheat residue releases maximum aerosols that contribute to the volume of PM2.5, which gets embedded in the lungs. Automation of farm operations leaves root-bound crop waste after machine harvesting, running to millions of tonnes, requiring a solution of scale. Sustainable residue removal cannot be achieved by the farmers alone, and requires help from the state machinery. Here, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should be commended for his initiative to discuss the modalities of joint action with the Punjab and Haryana governments. The national capital needs a major greening effort. Unpaved surfaces raise dust levels as in all Indian cities, but civic agencies ignore the problem. There is every reason to think that even the Ministry of Environments orders issued in 2015 under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to comprehensively green Delhis road margins and open spaces were not pursued seriously. Shifting more of the citys travel to comfortable public transport can cut fine particulates in congested areas and improve the air for residents. Many such initiatives were taken up by China in its cities to reduce exposure to PM2.5 that produces morbidity from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and leads to premature death. Only a determined response to the crisis can spare Delhi of its infamous tag as one of the most polluted cities on the planet."

While the benefits of bank credits are availed by land owners, the sharecroppers fall back on private lenders who provide loans at the doorsteps without the hassles of paperwork but charge a high rate of interest. This turns fatal for the landless or marginal farmers in case of crop loss.At a time when Kisaan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, launched in 1998, offers easy loan and flexible repayment option which even tenants and sharecroppers can avail, suicide by farmers under debt burden has become a baffling trend. But there is more to it than meets the eye.A senior bank official revealed that 90 per cent of agriculture loans disbursed under Kisaan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been placed under non-performing asset (NPA). He further said the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 has excluded agricultural land. Hence, it ensures that banks cannot keep, seize or auction agricultural land in case of default in agricultural loan.According to sources, the land owners avail the bank loans but are not interested in paying it back. With political parties choosing farm loan waiver for electoral gains, these land owners wait for this benefit to be announced. Moreover, there are middlemen who know the trick to facilitate agriculture loans from banks and they do it on a 50:50 sharing basis. The land owners do not mind sharing the loan as they do not have to repay it or lose their land.More than the original land owners, who are distancing themselves from agricultural activities due to lack of adequate workforce, courtesy the State Governments `1 per kg rice scheme, the sharecroppers are into cultivation. With the proposed Land Tenancy Act hanging fire, the sharecroppers, mostly landless, small or marginal farmers, get into verbal agreement with the land owner and have to pay seven to 12 bags of paddy each weighing 75 kg. At times, they take the pain to dispose of the paddy in Market Yard and pay the land owner in cash as per the prevailing minimum support price. However, the truth is that there is no written agreement between land owners and sharecroppers, which deprives the latter of the benefits being rolled out under KCC.Hence, the sharecroppers are forced to depend on non-institutionalised credit as they hardly have enough liquid cash to purchase seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and harvest the crop. With no other income source other than agriculture, crop loss leaves the sharecroppers devastated as they cannot escape from repaying loans to private lenders or settling the dues of the land owner.Sources in the banking industry said just like `1 per kg rice scheme which has hit the rural economy, farm loan waivers are affecting agriculture and the banks. Several States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have written off loans of the farmers in the past. With voters aware that the general elections are slated in 2019, farmers in Odisha are hopeful of yet another round of waiver."

5a531c399855b770e037d61d,"Now that the smog has not cleared, what can be done about it?",https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/voices/now-that-the-smog-has-not-cleared-what-can-be-done-about-it/,2017-11-13,"What Faiz Ahmad Faiz said on the eve of independence Ye daagh daagh ujala, ye shab-gazeeda seher// Wo intezaar tha jiska ye wo seher tau nahi may as well be said about the North Indian cities in winters. Over the past few days, PM2.5 levels in Delhi breached 700-800 micrograms per cubic metre  a level which is hazardous by both WHO and Indian government standards. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in these cities was highest in the world, even clocking maximum level that can be recorded on the scale, i.e. 999. In fact, the smog in Delhi and majority of North Indian cities has reached a level where doctors have suggested evacuation, CMs have ordered shutting of schools, construction has been halted, power plants have been momentarily shut, diesel-generators are banned, cloud seeding is seriously considered, among other such coping but knee-jerk reactions.The primary reason behind this Great North Indian Smog is burning of straw from rice paddy crops by farmers before they begin wheat plantation in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This year the situation worsened on the back of unfavourable weather conditions which have trapped the smog over Delhi and the rest of North India. Measures such as odd-even policy on cars, ban on burning of leaves and garbage and others mentioned above, have had only limited positive impact. As the political bickering begins over this issue, it is time for us to find long-term, low-cost and scalable solutions.It is tempting to draw parallels between Beijings and New Delhis air pollution issue. Both are capitals of the worlds biggest countries that jointly resisted the wests stringent CO2 emission cuts, exemplify shift of economic vibrancy to Asia and are among the worlds largest cities. However, there are fundamental differences between pollution in these two cities. Beijings pollution is fueled by vehicular and factory pollution whereas Indias pollution is mainly driven by stubble burning. Other small factors contributing to pollution in India include emissions from vehicles, industry and construction. Therefore, the solutions that worked in China to an extent cannot be replicated on the ground in India.Instead, India should learn from Singapores handling of its annual haze concern. The Singapore haze problem is an outcome of palm oil plantation burning in Indonesia, mainly in the Sumatra region.Another interesting similarity is how little Singapore can do on its own to prevent this annual curse. Singapore and Indonesia are both part of the ASEAN  Association of South East Nations  a regional association long hailed as the successful model for (sub)-regional cooperation based on minimum common values. Given the conflicts in South-East Asia when ASEAN was conceptualized, one common value jointly agreed upon was non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other ASEAN countries. This value has long been attributed to be the success of ASEAN; but the same ties Singapores hands in bringing Indonesia to table for taking concrete actions.Likewise, in India, the States are answerable to their local constituencies and have limited say in influencing/limiting farmer burning straw of rice fields in other states. In this regard, more solutions should be derived from Singapore than from Chinas example.First, Singapore tried to identify, shame and even penalize private firms burning forests in Indonesia. In the same vein, the Indian government in collaboration with states can identify the key sub-regions within states that are primarily responsible for such mass-scale burning. The local administration and region should be named and shamed to highlight their apathy towards their fellow countrymen. This identification can be done by hot spot mapping and tracking massive land-clearing activities.Second, the states and center need to come together to discuss this issue in detail and create binding solutions. NITI Aayog  in all its effort to foster cooperative federalism  is uniquely placed to convene all the concerned stakeholders and initiate evidence-backed discussion. One of the solutions of such a collaboration effort could be to use a challenge method to solicit scalable, cost-effective and innovative solutions to clear farms. The source of such optimism is the successful use of technology to mitigate smog issue in other parts of the world  Hong Kong, Philippines, Mexico and also in China.Third, the states and center can mandate installing screens at major public places and ask television and newspapers to display/publish the air quality index. Singapore being a city state has managed to do the same by managing the dedicated website: www.haze.gov.sg/.This is expected to yield three benefits. First, every state has a set of go-to measures in response to increase in pollution levels. Such information will prevent any catastrophic delay in their response.Second, such a display of information will continue to keep the public and civil society informed and any adverse movement in the index will lead to public pressure on the administration and legislators to get their acts together. Third, in states mainly responsible for crop burning, Delhi and other states should publish information linking how the farm activity in such states is impacting air pollution in their home states. They should also publish the AQI of cities in other developing countries which are still sub-50/100 level. This is bound to increase the empathy, accountability and fellowship in farmer community to limit their farm burning efforts.Fourth, unlike in Singapore, in India the states and central governments can explore the option of buying the crop residue from the farmers and using it as a fuel for Waste-to-Energy (incinerators) plants. These plants have massive fuel requirements and feeding such residue could create a possible win-win situation for all.Fifth, states should use softer elements of nukkad natak, graffiti art, wall paintings, messages on packaging of key agriculture inputs of seeds and fertilizers, radio and television messaging before winter cropping season begins and block-level target of crop residue procurement to limit stubble burning.The above measures will be able to create long-term and sustainable solutions to mitigate this annual smog concern. I would like to end this piece by highlighting two caveats. First, all major cities in the world, at some point of time have faced similar deteriorating air quality concerns and they largely overcame the issue with continued economic growth, technological development and policy perseverance. Second, the measures on controlling vehicular, industrial and construction driven pollution should be continued with as much determination as the overall pollution level cant be ignored. With these measures, Delhi will one day come close to Faizs vision of the future."

The Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to an average reading of 308, even as the city government extended the ban on the entry of trucks till further orders.Officials said light rain is expected on Wednesday, which might intensify the fog but could clear the smog.Delhi has been experiencing dense smog for about a week, forcing the authorities to enforce emergency measures in the National Capital Region.Here are the highlights:9.37pm: Gadkari says electric transportation could ease the situation in Delhi a bit like Nagpur which has 200 electric taxis that are going to swell to 1,000 next month.9.35pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari urges farmers to produce ethanol and biofuel from stubble instead of burning them. These can fuel vehicles including motorbikes on flex engines that will be launched shortly. A tonne of rice straw can produce 430 litres of ethanol, he says.9.33pm: 50% pollution from automobiles in Delhi will be removed after these projects as vehicles from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will not be required to enter Delhi, says Gadkari.9.30pm: Eastern Peripheral Expressway that will be completed by January and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project and other projects worth Rs 40,000 crore to decongest Delhi will contribute significantly in curbing pollution, says Gadkari.9.27pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari says he has written to environment minister Harsh Vardhan to look into Delhis pollution problem and get it studied by experts including international consultants.9.25pm: If vehicles are stopped or converted into electricity, still there is no guarantee that the pollution will stop completely. Climatic changes are also behind it and there is need of a holistic approach, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.22pm: Delhi pollution is not related to only automobile pollution. It is not such a case that the problem of pollution will be solved if odd even is introduced, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.20pm: Union minister Nitin Gadkari says the odd-even car rationing scheme or a ban on automobiles are no solutions to Delhis pollution problem.9.15pm: This year when the people are suffering badly and an accumulated fund of Rs 775 crore lies at its disposal, the Kejriwal government has not found it worth spending on improving the environment, says Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.9.12pm: The AAP government collected Rs 775 crore as environmental cess in the last three years, says Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari.9.10pm: The BJPs Delhi unit accuses the AAP government of failing to act on environment protection despite having ample resources, asks it to share details of spending of the environmental cess.9.08pm: Delhi government notification asks Delhi Traffic Police and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi to prohibit the entry of heavy and medium goods vehicles, except those carrying essential commodities, in the national capital.9.06pm: Delhi government says the ban on the entry of trucks in the national capital has been extended till further orders due to the fluctuating levels of air pollution.9.04pm: We are not relaxing anything as of now. The CPCB task force will meet tomorrow (November 15) and the day after (November 16) and suggest future course of action as drizzle is expected, says CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar.9.02pm: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakar says Delhis air quality may further improve on Wednesday as light rains are expected, which will help in flushing suspended particulates away.9.00pm: Delhi HC says stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana alone cannot be blamed for the poor air quality in the national capital.8.58pm: Delhi HC tells AAP government: Entire city is unable to breathe. Look at your concern in the areas of education and health facility. We want the same for public transport.8.56pm: All the authorities have opined that the major cause for air pollution was vehicles. So the Delhi government should make an effort on war-footing to bring in more buses. Public life has to be protected as Delhi is unable to breathe, says Delhi HC.8.54pm: Delhi HC says if the Delhi governments odd-even scheme is to benefit the people, there is a need for a better public transport facility.8.52pm: Delhi High Court says there is a grave urgency for more buses in the city and the AAP government needs to address it on a war-footing.8.50pm: The IMD has forecast that weather conditions in Delhi NCR are likely to become more favourable for dispersal of pollutants over the next 2-3 days. Hence, air quality is expected to improve further, says environment minister Harsh Vardhan.8.48pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan appreciates the discipline shown by the public. He says the improvement in the air quality was achieved largely due to efforts of various government agencies and voluntary participation by the public.8.45pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan says all government agencies need to maintain the highest level of alertness and continue their efforts to check pollution.8.42pm: Union environment ministry asks all state pollution control boards to intensify action against violators, especially in the industrial and construction sectors, to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR.8.40pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel appeals to farmers not to burn crop residue. For this, the government is providing them equipment on subsidy basis. The fertility of land is also decreasing because of the burning of crop residues as this would cause loss to farmers in the coming days, he says.8.35pm: Action taken against 369 farmers in Fatehabad, against 79 in Hisar, 54 in Jind, 138 in Kaithal, 357 in Karnal, 184 in Kurukshetra, 6 in Panchkula, 40 in Panipat and 301 in Sirsa, says minister Vipul Goel.8.30pm: Haryana minister Vipul Goel says even in Delhi, crop residues were being burnt by farmers, but the Delhi government has not taken any action.8.25pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel says action is being taken against farmers indulging in stubble burning, and at the same time, they are also being sensitised not to burn the stubble.8.22pm: In view of the National Green Tribunal orders, the Haryana government is quite serious in dealing with the issue of pollution, says minister Vipul Goel.8.20pm: In Haryana, cases have been registered against 244 farmers and fines of up to Rs 18.65 lakh have been recovered from 695 farmers, says minister Goel.8.18pm: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board acted against 1,586 farmers across the state to curb air pollution due to stubble burning, the states environment minister Vipul Goel says in Chandigarh.8.15pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel hits out at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, saying he has not taken any such steps but was doing politics in the name of smog and pollution in the capital.8.08pm: Since the winds are coming from Punjab and Haryana with good speed, the pollutant there would first settle due to rains, so the winds entering Delhi would be pure and then speed would disperse the smog here, says Charan Singh of IMD.8.06pm: Charan Singh, chief weather forecast officer at IMD, says there are fair chances of drizzling tonight (Tuesday) or early morning on Wednesday, November 15 in parts of Haryana and Punjab.8.03pm: The major reason for the emergency situation in Delhi was stubble burning. The winds coming from Punjab were carrying pollutants and then there was moisture coming from the east. Both winds collided at low height in Delhi causing smog. We do not see improvement, says Usman Naseem.8.00pm: Delhi is out of emergency but not out of danger. In the coming days by November 16 and 17, the conditions are expected to get better. Unfortunately we are happy even though the air quality is very poor. In many countries there is an emergency-like condition at this air quality which we are cherishing as improvement, says Usman Naseem, researcher at Centre for Science and Environment and member of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).7.31pm: Ban on entry of trucks in Delhi, except those carrying essential goods, extended till further orders due to pollution levels: Delhi govt official.7.25pm: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to ANI: I fail to understand why the Delhi chief minister is trying to force his hand, knowing well that any such discussion would be meaningless and futile.7.15pm: According to latest AQI data, Haryanas Vikas Sadan Gurugram is at 262, Sector16A Faridabad at 240, both fall in Very Unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.7.07pm: The latest AQI data for Delhis Punjabi Bagh is at 262, Dwarka at 244, ITO at 244,Anand Vihar at 287; all fall in Very unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.5.55pm: Delhi government requests NGT to direct neighbouring states to also implement odd-even scheme.5.52pm: Delhi government requests NGT to exempt two-wheelers and women drivers for one year or till 2,000 additional buses are engaged.5.50pm: Delhi government files fresh review petition before NGT in connection with odd-even policy: ANI4.50pm: The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi improves to an average reading of 308, according to CPCB data. However, even at this level, the air quality remains very poor.4.49pm: If electric bus system is introduced in Delhi, it will reduce pollution. Soon, bio-ethanol-based bikes are going to be launched which use fuel generated from sugarcane husk. This will not only lead to reduction in pollution levels but also help our farmers who are growing sugarcane, says Gadkari.4.48pm: Union government looking at introducing electric taxis and buses, bio-ethanol, methanol and other technologies to reduce pollution, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.4.46pm: The government is working on use of alternative and clean fuels, in place of diesel and petrol, as another way of reducing vehicular pollution, says Gadkari.4.45pm: Road transport ministry has formulated a Rs 40,000 crore scheme to ease traffic congestion in Delhi which would also bring down pollution levels as vehicles wont be stuck in traffic burning extra fuel, says Gadkari.4.42pm: Bypass roads, and upgrading of NH-24 into a 14-lane national highway will reduce vehicular pollution in Delhi by 50%, says Gadkari.4.40pm: Gadkari says once the easterly and westerly bypass roads become operational, vehicles destined for other places near Delhi wont have to enter the city. This would bring huge relief to the people of Delhi from vehicular pollution, he says.4.35pm: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari says that to tackle the rising pollution levels in Delhi, traffic not destined for the capital should be diverted to cut congestion on the city roads.3.50pm: The smog and pollutant levels will drop in Delhi because of the wind speed generated by the gathering weather system in Jammu and Kashmir, says Sonam Lotus, director of the Met department in Srinagar.3.48pm: The balancing of the weather system in the coming days in Jammu and Kashmir will definitely help in decreasing the pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining areas as the system is moving westwards from the state, says Sonam Lotus, director of the Met department in Srinagar.3.45pm: Rain and snowfall forecast in Jammu and Kashmir will help reduce the smog and pollution levels in Delhi and its adjoining areas, the regional Met office in Srinagar says.3.40pm: Aam Aadmi Party says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been following up with Punjab and Haryana CMs regarding the smog issue. Collective efforts are needed to resolve this grave issue, AAP posts on Twitter.Delhi CM has been following up with Punjab & Haryana CMs regarding the smog issue.Collective efforts are needed to resolve this grave issue. pic.twitter.com/iF5OK3pWOq  AAP (@AamAadmiParty) 14 November 20173.35pm: BJP Kisan Morcha president Virendra Singh says the party is running a campaign to encourage farmers not to burn paddy stubble as it not only caused air pollution but also reduced nutrients in the fields.1.20pm: Industries involved in essential commodities have been exempted to carry on their activity.We also direct industries whose emissions are limited in parameters be allowed to operate subject to verification, says NGT.1.10pm: NGT to Delhi govt: Dont gift infected lungs to children.

NGT suggested Delhi govt take care of the logical explanations for odd-even exemptions when they approach NGT again12.40pm: NGT to Delhi government: When reports have stated that two-wheelers are more polluting than four-wheelers, why do you intend to give arbitrary exemptions? Is this a joke? What does one stand to gain from this?12.30pm: Why dont you take positive steps? Why should we exempt anybody? If they (two-wheelers) are not polluting, we will allow them: NGT tells Delhi government .12.20pm: NGT asks Delhi Govt as to why it cant run ladies only buses to solve the problem of transport during odd-even scheme.12.10pm: If you show us you sprinkled water in a proper way and pollution doesnt come down, we will withdraw that order (of sprinkling): NGT tells Delhi government12pm: Kejriwal asks Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to join the meeting with Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday..@capt_amarinder Sir, I am coming to Chandigarh on Wed to meet Haryana CM.

Her family says she had not eaten for five days. The state government is investigating whether the family was denied their monthly quota of cheaper food-grain because Shakina, who was paralysed, could not be present at the ration shop for her fingerprint authentication for Aadhaar.Shakina's husband Mohd Ishaq says they begged the ration shop owner for grains when she was paralysed.The Yogi Adityanath government says its initial inquiries suggest Shakina died of an illness, not starvation.The family alleges that it had been denied ration under the Public Distribution System for November, because Shakina - marked as the head of the family in the ration card - was too unwell to be even taken to the shop in a rickshaw, as she was every month.""My wife died because of hunger. She was very ill. We used to take her there in a rickshaw. This time she was very ill. We begged the Kotedar (ration shop owner), but he said he would not give anything without the biometrics,"" said Mohd Ishaq, Shakina's husband.The ration shop owner insisted that Shakina come for her biometric identification using a fingerprint machine at the ration shop, says the family.The family is entitled to 35 kg of subsidised wheat, rice and sugar each month under the central government-sponsored Antyodaya scheme for the poorest.Seema Tripathi, the official in charge of foodgrain supply in Bareilly, said there is no order to deny food if anyone can't be present to authenticate their biometric data.""We found out through the newspapers. She had an Antyodaya card. We are trying to find out the exact cause of the death. There is no provision of the government that people will be denied rations because of an Aadhaar card. We have alternative systems in place. If the person in whose name the Antyodaya card is cannot go, then there is a provision for other relatives to be given ration,"" Ms Tripathi said. Sources in the local administration also question the starvation allegation because they say Shakina had about Rs 4,000 in her bank account. However, they have no answer to the question of why the ration shop insisted on Aadhaar biometrics to provide their share of food.In September, an 11-year-old girl died crying for ""bhaat, bhaat (rice)"" at her village in Jharkhand, allegedly because her family had been denied ration for not linking it with an Aadhaar ID. The state government ordered that no one should be denied food benefits for want of Aadhaar-linking."

Bargarh district, considered the rice bowl of the State, hogged the limelight in 2015 when more than 30 farmers committed suicide over crop loss and indifference of the State Government towards farmers. The district hogged the limelight again this year because of the Bijepur by-election which was necessitated following the death of sitting Congress MLA Subal Sahu.With the outcome of the by-poll all set to be a trendsetter for the 2019 general elections, the political parties have been jostling for space to prove their supremacy.The BJD set the ball rolling by announcing a series of development projects for Bijepur. The BJD also managed to nominate Ritarani Sahu, widow of Subal Sahu, as its party candidate for the by-election hoping to encash on the sympathy factor. The BJP, which is yet to nominate its candidate for the by-election, got an opportunity to come down heavily on the BJD after the death of farmer Brunda Sahu on November 1. Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and a delegation of the BJP Kisan Morcha visited the farm-affected pockets in the district to gain sympathy of farmers or kulta community, who have substantial votes.The death of Brunda and five other farmers pushed the Bijepur bypoll issue to the backburner and brought the farmers issue to centre-stage. The farmers had hoped that the Centre would declare some special package for them, which seems unlikely. Aware of the ground realities, the BJP launched Satyagraha for farmers and tried to corner the BJD Government.The Congress, not to be left behind, also staged a dharna in front of the District Collectorate. OPCC chief Prasad Harichandan visited the district and levelled allegations against both the BJD and the BJP. With many among the farmers educated enough to understand the underlying agenda of the politics being played over death of the farmers, it will be tough for the political parties to take the voters for granted."

Photo: PTINew Delhi: Thousands of farmers protested in Indias capital, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts, underscoring the challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces before elections in his home turf Gujarat next month and nationally in 2019.Representatives from 184 farmer organizations squatted on a road leading to the parliament building in the heart of New Delhi, demanding a nationwide waiver of crop loans on the lines announced by some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, higher prices for their produce and lowering seeds and fertilizer costs.The protest is the latest challenge for Modi who promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and ensure a 50% profit over the cost of production. The number of farmers committing suicides climbed about 42% to 8,007 in 2015 from a year earlier, according to a farm ministry statement in parliament in February.I am struggling to take care of my family and considering the current situation, I dont think I can get out of this mess without any help from the government, said Jayesh Bhai Hurabhai, a farmer from Gujarat. We have come here with a lot of hope as farmers from all parts of the country have joined hands this time to protest.Some farmers travelled for more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from different parts of the country to reach New Delhi to participate in the two-day protest that ended on Tuesday. As many as 300 widows of farmers who have committed suicides in the past years due to high farm loans also took part in the protest, with some holding placards that read Farmers are Robbed.Dwindling incomesAbout 800 million people of Indias 1.3 billion depend directly or indirectly on farming, with agriculture accounting for about 16% of the economy. The country is the worlds top grower of cotton and the second-biggest producer of wheat, rice and sugar.The farming community is agitated over falling food prices and high debt levels. Bumper harvests, boosted by a normal monsoon last year after back-to-back droughts and good rain this year, have hurt prices of crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Depressed prices, combined with poor arrangements for government-assured purchases, have triggered these protests.I have heard that the country is becoming prosperous. But what am I getting out of it?, said Pintu Patil, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. Rising input costs and household expenses are making it difficult to manage a seven-member family with an annual income of just about Rs2 lakh, he said.Indian farmers are likely to fetch about Rs36,000 crore less this crop season due to lower market prices of top seven commodities, including paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and some pulses, than what they would have received by selling at government-set minimum purchase prices, according to All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Minimum support prices for cotton, paddy and sugar cane have risen between 7% and 16% in the year ending in March 2018 from the start of 2014-15 when Modi came to power, according to government data.The government procurement agencies, which are mandated to purchase some agricultural commodities at fixed rates to support prices and supply to the government for its welfare programs, buy only a small portion of a commoditys total output, leaving million of farmers across the country to sell at the market-determined levels.

But the miller supplied only 19,409 quintals of rice and its proprietor Dillip Agrawal locked up the mill and absconded. Similarly, Pintu Rice Mill at Malidihi, Laxmi Rice, Starched Rice Mill and Maruti Food Products had also not supplied required custom milled rice to the Government. The department had filed FIRs against these millers at the police stations concerned and later Vigilance department lodged a case against Maruti Food for its large-scale irregularities in supplying rice.While the district civil supply office had estimated around `27.92 lakh due pending against the Maruti Food Products, a special audit conducted by the department found a loss of `47.09 lakh loss.

When cultivated, the land, which is around 10.3% of the area used for food crops in the state, is expected to increase Goas agricultural production.Satisfied with the project, the bureau now plans to conduct a similar exercise in other parts of the country, including Maharashtra After the project got sanctioned in 2015, a special task force of the bureau constituted in Nagpur carried out an extensive study for one-and-a-half years using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the bureaus report Characterization and mapping of land resource of Goa submitted this year, the Goa government is planning to introduce contract and organic farming to boost the states farmers and overall agricultural produce.The identified fallow land area is part of the khajan land (lying between the sea and the hills). This is an area which time and again is affected by seawater and fresh water of Mandovi and Zuari rivers draining the state from hills to the coast. Khajan land is considered as the best potential area for rice cultivation but currently is not being used by the farmers to its full potential, said Surendra Kumar Singh , the director of NBSS&LUP.As per the mapping, most of the fallow land lie in Tiswadi, Bardez and Salcette talukas of the state.Singh added that the land is affected by extensive erosion taking place due to the two rivers. The productivity of these lands has also declined due to flow of sediments from mining, he said.During the release of the report on December 5, which was also the World Soil Day, Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar announced that introducing contract farming in fallow lands will increase the states agricultural production and double farmers income by 2022.For this, the bureau is also preparing a land use plan. For contract farming, the government will be calling corporate investors. The contractor, will raise the crops and also provide employment to landless farmers, added Singh.Now, the bureau envisages to investigate and map fallow lands in different parts of the country. There is a lot of potential in North-Eastern states, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and many other places. With good data and management plan, fallow lands could be used to expand land for agriculture purposes, said Singh.Recently, the bureau had prepared a geo-spatial digital map identifying areas holding high potential for organic farming in the country."
5b2e92789855b7264011632a,Punjab's farm crisis a tragic irony,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/649073/punjabs-farm-crisis-tragic-irony.html,2017-12-12,"Punjab, the food bowl of the country, is faced with a paradox of plenty. Ever since the launch of the Green Revolution in 1966, Punjab has been producing a record grain surplus year after year. Yet, over the years, it has turned into a graveyard for its farmers. There is hardly a day when reports of farmers committing suicide do not appear in Punjab newspapers.Take a look at the food procurement figures for 2017-18. Of the total wheat procurement of 308.24 lakh tonnes, Punjab had contributed 117.06 lakh tonnes, thereby providing more than 37% of the country's wheat requirement. As for rice, for which the procurement season is still in progress, Punjab had contributed 174.35 lakh tonnes till November 28. This is 67% of the total rice procurement of 258.18 lakh tonnes.In other words, Punjab continues to be the top contributor to the national food kitty. Whichever year, and regardless of the extent of climatic aberrations, Punjab has dutifully delivered food for the country.Now hold your breath. A bumper grain production year after year belies the grave tragedy that has been worsening with each passing year. According to a survey by Punjab Agricultural University, as many as 16,000 farmers and farm labourers have committed suicide in the past 17 years, between 2000 and 2017 - an average of about 900 suicides per year. Of these, 83% committed suicide distressed by a mountain of unpaid debt; and 76.1% of them owned less than two acres of land.Every third farmer in Punjab is below the poverty line. Still worse, nearly 66% of these farmers and farm labourers who took their own lives were young. Surely, like all young people, they too had dreams. What made them to abruptly end their lives?As if this is not enough, the Punjab government has gone back on its electoral promise to waive off Rs 2 lakh from each small farmer's outstanding debt. It has now clarified that if the outstanding loan of a small farmer, owning less than five acres, is even Rs 100 more than Rs 2 lakh, he will not be eligible for the loan waiver.The tragedies that have struck many families in rural Punjab symbolise the agony that the entire farming community is living in. Those who have refrained from taking the extreme step are no better. They continue to somehow survive, living under acute stress, mental agony, depression and hoping against hope. Still, the bigger question that remains unanswered is, how can the nation's food bowl turn into a farmers' graveyard? How can Punjab be in the deadly grip of an unending agrarian crisis?That such a tragic serial dance of death is being enacted in a state that is considered to be the most prosperous as far as agriculture is concerned tells us clearly that the crisis is the outcome of an inherently flawed farming model.I have heard agricultural economists and policymakers often blame low crop productivity, failure to diversify crops, and lack of irrigation. But, in a state which has 98% assured irrigation and where the per hectare yields of wheat and paddy match international levels, those cannot be the reasons for farmers' suicides. Instead, it's the opposite - high crop productivity-linked intensive farming model - that's to blame.Deeper crisisAs per Economic Survey 2016, the per hectare yield of wheat in Punjab stands at 4,500 kg/hectare which matches the wheat yields in the United States. In the case of paddy, the average yield is 6,000 kg/hectare, quite close to productivity levels in China. With such high yields and with abundant irrigation available, why should farmers be dying?To say that these farmers are lazy, drunkards or do not spend the loans for the purpose they take cannot be true. If it were so, I see no way Punjab could have topped global crop productivity; or how Punjab could feed the entire country with its grain surplus every year, and that too continuously for the past 50 years.Punjab is in a terrible crisis because of the economic and development policies that encourage intensive agriculture. To meet its food requirements, erstwhile Punjab (including Haryana, which later split) became the focal point of a highly intensive agriculture, beginning with wheat, rice and then followed by a shift towards cultivation of cotton as a cash crop.While intensive farming played havoc with soil fertility, necessitating application of more chemical fertilisers, excessive use and abuse of chemical pesticides has contaminated the food chain as well as the environment.The tragedy is that we haven't learnt any lessons. As if this is not enough, the effort now is to push Punjab deeper into the environmentally harmful web of agri-business, which requires more intensive farming, adding to more greenhouse gas emissions. It's like moving from the frying pan literally into fire.What Punjab desperately needs is to move away from the intensive cropping system. It requires a shift in the research mandate of the PAU, accompanied by policies and programmes that encourage farmers to shift without suffering any economic loss."

They are provided with accommodation basic needs in the village.Each team consists of 25 members and in each village, more than four to five teams are sent.Paddy plantation machine is not useful and thats why they are depending on labourers, Renjal mandal LK Farm farmer Kadiyala Venugopal said.He said that the labourers work for more than 12 hours in paddy plantation. Team of 12 members cover three to four acres per day, he said. The local labourers are unable to do the work as their physical structure cannot withstand the work required for paddy plantation, he added. Another farmer K Sai Reddy said that demand for labourers per day is increasing in every village and even small farmers are seeking them for cultivating paddy. A labour contractor Diwakar Vishwas from Lakhanpur district in UP said that more than 15 teams are working in different villages in Navipet and Renjal mandals.

Khosla and his deputy, assistant civil supplies officer Sandeep Guru.According to official sources, the duo were suspended after a series of investigations revealed that they were involved in favouring the owner of Bajrang Rice Mill, situated at Pandripada in the district, and misappropriating about Rs 8.20 crore of rice during the kharif season.Earlier, the district administration had suspended the accounts supervisor of the same department, Chintamani Naik, for negligence on duty when it was found that the Rs1.5 crore bank guarantee provided by the mill's owner, Dilip Agrawalla, to be fake. The incident came to light when Bajrang Rice Mill was allotted 79,388 quintals of paddy for milling. The owner was supposed to provide 53,894 quintals of rice before September 20. But he deposited only 19,409 quintals and fled, after locking up the mill. Khosla, the civil supplies officer, did not report the matter to the State Civil Supplies Corporation.After Bajrang Rice Mill failed to deposit the remaining 34,574 quintals, the managing director of the corporation, Niranjan Naik, directed Khosla to seize the Rs 1.5 crore bank guarantee on November 22.However, the district supply officials kept silent on the matter. After repeated directives from the corporation's Bhubaneswar office, the civil supplies officer intimated the bank authorities to seize the amount. But the bank authorities found that Agrawalla's document was fake.Following this, accounts supervisor Naik was suspended on charges of accepting the bank guarantee without verification."

How green is the green here, in faraway Tamil Nadu, for the migrant labourers?On the occasion of International Migrants Day, to commemorate the Universal Declaration of Migrants Rights that was adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly of United Nations in 2000, a few migrant workers in the construction, hotel and spinning mill industries in Madurai district shared their experiences with Express.Nithesh (23), who is a cook in a hotel, said, I belong to a remote village in West Bengal and have been working here for the past three years. Nearly 100 people from our village came here looking for work. We are all illiterate and could not find jobs in our home States.How did they land up here in Madurai? We can cook Chinese items that seem to be in great demand in the hotels in Madurai. There are agents who brought us here. In fact, in every village, there are agents who offer us work outside our home base. They promise to get us jobs that will get us Rs 15,000 a month. Of course, the salary would vary, depending on the work. The agent will receive the salary and deduct 50 per cent as his commission. The arrangement may vary from agent to agent. Basically, there is no connection between the hotel employer and us, said Nithesh.About the working conditions, Nitesh said, From morning till the hotel is closed, we need to remain standing. Every day, I go to home with severe leg pain. I get a maximum of Rs 10,000 as monthly salary. I send Rs 8000 to my parents every month. I use the remaining amount for my expenses in the temple city.Accommodation is usually provided by the employer, continued Nithesh. Those working in the same hotel usually stay in one house together. We are given one months leave every year and we go to our native place. Those who work as cleaners and servers get very poor salaries, around Rs 3,000 a month. We dont get other benefits like Provident Fund, bonus and insurance. Though we have problems of language, discrimination, and poor working conditions, we take the job since it is helping our families get three meals a day.Lakshmi (18), a spinning mill worker in Madurai district, said, I come from a small village in Bihar. I am the first of five daughters. My father was an agriculture daily wage labourer. I dont have mother. About a year back, my father met with an accident and could not continue working. I took over earning for the family. I could not find any decent job in our village as I am uneducated. Nearly 80 girls in the 15 to 23 age group came here to work.I came with them. For the past eight months, I have been working here. The company has given us accommodation within the premises. They provide ration rice and some grocery, but they are not of good quality. There is no specific working time. We have to report to work whenever the supervisor calls us. Every month, we get Rs 3,000 as salary. We send Rs 2,000 home. We do not know the exact salary that we get and whether and how much the agents take.Sharma (35), a construction worker, had a similar tale to share. About 1000 workers from Uttar Pradesh came here with our families. We used to stay in a hut near the construction site. There were just no basic facilities. We do all sorts of work. If the employer paid the local labourer Rs 500 a day, we would get only Rs 400. Out of this around Rs 150 would go as commission to the agent, he narrated.Speaking to Express, K L Kumar, President, Madurai District Hotels Association, said, The agents supply labourers from the other states. They are in charge of everything. Nearly 10,000 migrant workers are employed in various positions in Madurai district hotels. We ask for their identity proof and share their details with the local police.We do not pay any commission to the agent. We hand over the salaries to the agents. Workers give a share to them. Depending on the nature of the work we pay the workers.But there are some other issues. Some mischief making, taking small amounts of cash from the cash counter and so on. If it happens, we approach the agent who arranges for a replacement. The agent takes care even when a worker goes on leave and we need a temporary replacement, explained Kumar."

Paul, then head of the paediatrics department at AIIMS, submitted its report.""The recommendations are unlikely to be accepted. The suggestion of reducing the cereal content may be politically upsetting,"" a top official source said.A meal for students of primary classes (I-V) now contains 5gm of ghee or oil. For upper primary students (Classes VI-VIII) the ghee or oil content is 7.5gm.Besides, each meal includes 100gm of rice or wheat for primary students and 150gm for upper primary students, apart from vegetables and pulses.The panel, set up in July 2015 to suggest changes to improve a meal's nutritional value, recommended reducing the food grain content to 90gm for primary students and 125gm for upper primary students. It found that children were often unable to finish the rice and wheat they are served.The proposed changes would have led to an increase in the cost of each meal from Rs 4.13 to Rs 6.18 at the primary level and from Rs 5.88 to Rs 8.88 at the upper primary level.Ten crore children in 11.5 lakh government and aided schools are served midday meals every day.Dr Abhay Bang, a public health expert and chairperson of the Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health that works in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra, supported the Paul committee's recommendations.Bang said 5gm of oil for 100gm of rice or wheat created an imbalanced diet. Rice and wheat don't have protein, so the oil content should be increased, he said.""If there is less fat content, the food is not palatable and the child cannot finish it. The committee's recommendations were in the right direction,"" Bang added.Food rights activist Ashok Rao quoted from a study to say that 82 per cent of schoolchildren in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, came to school on an empty stomach and felt sleepy after a rice- or wheat-based meal.""It affects their cognitive development. The government should rather divide the meal into some snack in the morning and a light meal in the afternoon. For that, the government's approach must change,"" Rao said.He said 46 per cent of children suffered from malnutrition, while 30 per cent of girls were anaemic, and argued for flexibility to serve cereals like millets to suit local tastes or other food items."

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: The central government, in consultation with states, proposes to launch a new price support scheme for farmers to prevent distress sales at prices below the minimum support price (MSP).Under the proposed market assurance scheme, states will be free to procure all crops from farmers for which MSPs are announced, except rice and wheat, which are already being procured by the centre for the public distribution system.Under the new scheme, the centre will compensate states for any losses capped at 30% of the procurement cost. It will be the states responsibility to dispose of the procured crops.The proposed scheme will ensure an assured price for the farmer, mitigating the price risks faced by farmers after harvest. Together with a prolonged spell of inadequate rains and two years of drought it has contributed towards rural distress.If successful, it will also politically benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), though it could place fiscal pressures on the Union government; in the just-concluded assembly election in Gujarat, one reason contributing to the BJPs less than usual performance was farmer angst triggered by rural distress.The system, as it exists now, under which only rice, wheat and small quantities of pulses and oilseeds are procured by the centre, leaves much to be desired, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by Mint. The new scheme proposes to strengthen the procurement mechanism to ensure that farmers do not suffer from marketing inefficiencies, as commonly reflected in the prices ruling lower than notified MSP for many commodities, it said.States will take ownership of the scheme, including which crop to procure and in what quantities, when wholesale prices drop below MSPs. State governments will be free to use the procured crops for targeted nutrition-support programmes such as mid-day meals for schoolchildren, or sell them in the open market.We have written to states to elicit their opinion on the scheme, and if they are interested we will launch the scheme, said a senior official at the agriculture ministry who declined to be named. According to this official, the letter to states was sent more than a month ago.The proposed scheme comes against the backdrop of a record harvest of cereals and pulses in 2016-17, which led to wholesale prices plunging below MSPs. The price crash has led to protests by farmer groups across the country since June, with demands for remunerative crop prices and loan waivers. While states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka have announced farm loan waivers that are at different stages of implementation, states like Madhya Pradesh have launched their own price support schemes for farmers growing pulses and oilseeds.Experts welcomed the move, but cautioned that it was at best a stopgap measure and that the eventual solution was to bring in greater competition in agricultural markets by dismantling existing cartels.While any intervention and attention to agriculture marketing is welcome, we must await full details of the scheme to make any specific comments, said Pravesh Sharma, farm expert and a visiting fellow at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. However, it can be generally observed that government does not seem to risk spending political capital to directly take on poorly functioning agriculture markets, where lack of competition, cartelization and opaque price discovery are the root causes of price distortions.Spending public money may be necessary in some instances, but the larger goal of reforming agricultural markets should not be lost sight of, he added."

Still High,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dry-still-highkallu-or-toddy-tadimahuakinnauri-195757?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-24,"Sonia SarkarBREWCREW: A Muria Gond tribal woman of central India prepares liquor from mahua (AFP)For tipplers in India, these are no happy hours. Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."
5a53850b9855b770e038032c,A mix of local flavours and tradition: How an Indian Christmas is celebrated,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-indian-christmas/story-K0tV83DZD1FRzvcMM8XPbP.html,2017-12-25,"Come December, and there is a mood of celebration in the air. Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

5a53a4e99855b770e0381bbf,Arsenic poisoning is spreading. We need drastic steps to tackle it,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/arsenic-poisoning-is-spreading-we-need-drastic-steps-to-tackle-it/story-j9UyOujE9izHfaTWvVy9fP.html,2017-12-27,"In a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the Union ministry of water resources said 239 million people across 153 districts in 21 states drink water that contains high levels of arsenic.Thats around a fifth of the countrys population, and by any standards, thats an appalling statistic.The actual number could be higher. India pegs arsenic concentrations above 50 parts per billion as harmful; in the US, it is 10 parts per billion. Arsenic is one of the 10 chemicals classified as a public health concern by the World Health Organization; it slowly poisons the body, potentially causing skin lesions, damage to the peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal ailments, diabetes, renal (kidney) failure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At least half the people who were known to be at risk of arsenic contamination live in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh and India (across the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh).Groundwater contamination, Indias hidden crisisThe number of habitations affected by arsenic in India has increased from 3,728 in 2012-13 to 7,535 in 2015-16. This is because of the overuse of groundwater for irrigation and drinking. Arsenic previously occurred in a harmless insoluble conjugate with iron called arsenopyrite. Overuse has split this compound, contaminating groundwater with a soluble ionic form of arsenic. Over-exploitation of groundwater started in India in the 1970s when millions of tube wells were installed in the Ganga delta to prevent diarrhoea from surface water sources such as tanks, ponds and open wells. Today, India has over 30 million groundwater extraction points.Groundwater is also used for irrigation. This means arsenic poisoning affects not just the people of the area but also those who consume the produce of the affected region. In food, rice has the highest sensitivity to arsenic followed by vegetables. In most arsenic-affected states rice is the staple.Despite the crisis, groundwater contamination , either by arsenic or other pollutants such as fluorides, does not get the attention it deserves, especially when compared to surface water contamination because the latter is visible. Moreover, there is no law yet to check groundwater withdrawal.This severe environmental-health crisis has to be contained quickly before it can expand. Along with periodic testing of water in affected areas and individualised testing of each hand pump or tubewell (marking it as safe/unsafe), it is important to encourage people to opt for low-cost, local solutions such as rainwater harvesting that can ensure clean drinking water. States such as Bihar have set up filtration units but the maintenance of filters has always been a problem.This needs to be addressed. Additionally, governments have to curb the use of groundwater and keep a strict control on agricultural and industrial effluents that pollute aquifers that recharge groundwater."

Interestingly, the food section of the fair has transformed into a foodies paradise with stalls offering lip smacking flavours to relish. I have been setting up my stall in this fair for three years now. I make rice flour-based dishes, ranging from peethas to marua cakes and gol kattas, all popular delicacies from the villages of Jharkhand People not only relish these long-forgotten recipes but often request for takeaways of dry items, said Sanchariya Didi , a resident of Namkum. Mahendra Singhs stall selling gatte ki sabzi and daal baati choorma, dishes from Rajasthan , too has become a rage among food lovers. We have been coming to this fair for over a decade now. While the giant mirch pakodas always woo the customers, our mawa kachori is being loved by the visitors a lot this year, said Singh It is not just the flavours that are overwhelming. A concoction of fragrance from dishes of different parts of the country is the main crowd-puller. From steaming hot cups of cardamom tea in traditional kulhads to the sharp smell of a mirch tadka on the Gujarati dal makhani, every element at the food kiosk is a treat to the foodies of Ranchi. The organisers of the fair too have taken good care to ensure that food lovers have proper comfort while enjoying the dishes. We have ensured proper cleanliness in the food zone, said Sanjay Seth , chairman, Jharkahnd Khadi Gramodyog Board."
5aeb39cc9855b73f522c7fe8,Meals that passed the taste test...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meals-that-passed-the-taste-test/article22329709.ece,2017-12-30,"This is my favourite time of the year. Not just because of the weather, and the festivity, and all the hope that comes with the New Year. I like these last days of the year also because it gives me an opportunity to go back and relive some of my happy food moments.Food-wise, 2017 was a happy year, indeed. Just a few days ago, I had Ghalibs tender tikkas, and kicked myself for not having gone there for long years. Ghalib Kabab Corner (Ph no: 9810786479) is situated opposite the Markazi mosque in Nizamuddin. The buffalo meat tikkas and seekh kababs are so deliciously juicy that the taste stays with you long after you have polished off a whole plate. In these days of high prices, when an egg costs more than a bun-omelette did a few years ago, the rates are incredibly reasonable, too. A plate of 16 tikkas is for Rs. 50, as is a plate of four, big-sized seekh kebabs.When it comes to fine dining, my happiest meal was at Guppy, a restaurant in the Lodhi Colony main market (Ph no: 011-24690005) which serves Japanese food. I went with some friends, who asked for its signature pork belly and tenderloin cube steaks  and both dishes were superb. The slow braised pork was soft, thick with fat, glazed with soy honey and redolent with the strong flavour of mustard. The pan-seared tenderloin cubes came coated in a mildly sweet sesame seed-flavoured sauce that gave it a delightful punch.Another memorable Asian meal was at a tiny restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Ph nos: 9650260408 and 9599450879). I loved the pancakes prepared with rice powder and beaten egg, served with lettuce leaves and smeared with a light fish sauce. I enjoyed the fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat and the fragrant yet light entres of sticky rice and braised pork and yellow chicken curry.During a visit to Kolkata this autumn, I went to an old favourite  called How Hua  which had reopened after remaining shut for many years. The place was known for its chimney soups, and its still the hot favourite in the reopened restaurant, on Prince Anwar Shah Road (Ph no: 0-7595999413). The soup came in a big vessel  large enough for a small family  and the broth was full of pieces of chicken, prawn, fish, vegetables, crab, tofu and vermicelli, as well and meat and fish balls. What I missed was their French pork chop. But I shall leave that for another day.One place that I hope to see a lot of in the coming year is a little caf called The Tea Lounge in Bikaner House in Pandara Road. The Tea Lounge serves an English high tea and an Indian high tea.The former comes with your choice of tea or coffee, three kinds of sandwiches (chicken, mint and cheese), walnut tart, lemon tart, mushroom khari, almond cookies and ginger biscuits, while the latter comprises kachoris and samosas.Discerning palateRun by Old World Hospitality, it offers savouries such as keema samosas, chicken patties and cheese and chilli patties. The keema samosa I ate was spilling over with the keema it had been stuffed with. On the sandwich menu are chicken sandwiches, ham and cheese roll, coleslaw roll, cheese and mint sandwiches.For fish loversIf you enjoy your fish, then you should not miss Sana-di-ge (Ph nos: 011-40507777 and 7042794546) in the Malcha Marg market. Beautifully done up, the restaurant offers various kinds of coastal cuisines  and I had a superb tawa fried seer fish, chicken ghee roast, where chicken chunks marinated with freshly ground spices and garlic had been roasted in ghee. I enjoyed the mamsa pepper fry, boneless lamb cooked with oodles of pepper and curry leaves, and ended the meal with a lovely and creamy sweet dish called eleneer payasum  sweetened coconut cream with the pulp of tender coconut.Another little place that gave me a lot of joy this year was Anmol, known far and wide for its butter chicken. This is not the regular butter chicken that you get in restaurants, but a juicy tandoori chicken in hot, melted butter. The chicken is grilled on a coal fire and then tossed with chillies, dried mango powder, chaat masala and chutney. Butter is melted till it is golden yellow, and then poured over the chicken.It was, as you can see, a good year. And now heres to 2018. Let there be good food, and no ones stomach ever empty."

He also said the family of rice mill owner Ravinder Kochhar, who was gunned down by gangsters in July, migrated abroad after selling their property. He said there is a fear psychosis in the minds of people, particularly businessmen who were being targeted by extortionists.The Akali leader said the situation was worsened by the visit of UP mUttar Pradesh alleged gangster Raja Bhaiya to Faridkot. He said that Raja was hosted by local Congress legislator Kushaldeep Dhillon who even boasted about the same on his facebook page. Romana demanded the reason behind Rajas visit to Faridkot should be verified along with a thorough probe into who all he met during this visit but the Congress government refused to do anything in the matter."
