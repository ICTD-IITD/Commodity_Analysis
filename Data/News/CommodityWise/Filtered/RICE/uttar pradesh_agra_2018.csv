Would you be up to avoid dairy products from your diet especially if you could get the right amount of proteins without them? Though the concept of avoiding any kind of animal products was officially established more than 70 years ago in the West, it took some time to become a trend in India. And in Chennai, particularly, veganism has been gaining popularity in the last couple of years.The city even witnessed a completely eco-friendly vegan wedding recently! I attended the wedding a few days back. And they served the yummiest butterscotch ice cream. It was made out of cotton seed milk, recalls Anu Vidya M, who runs the Instagram account @Chennai_vegan_ foodguide.Vegetarian vs Vegan Although many people tend to confuse vegan and vegetarian, veganism is basically an extension of vegetarianism, wherein the diet includes no food or products from animals. People tend to eat more of beans, lentils, tofu, etc, Basically no meat or poultry. It is just like how vegetarians do, but also we say no to dairy/ honey/ eggs, point out Roshni Sanghvi, body transformation specialist. Minal Agrawal who administers the Facebook page Veganennai, says that veganism is popular only in the metros and that too because of social media. Veganism is yet to reach smaller cities and town.Whether youre non-vegetarian and vegetarian, youre being cruel to animals. Veganism is against all the cruelty towards animals, she highlights. Indianised cuisine Food, in general, can be made vegan. It can have anything except for any product derived from an animal. So dairy products, eggs and meat is a complete no-no, says Sarmishta Baliga, head pastry chef, Ashvita Bistro. The taste and flavours still remain the same as any other cuisine.Is there a specialised Indian menu in terms of vegan food? Traditionally, most Indian cooking, especially south Indian vegetarian cooking, is vegan. Barring the popular curd rice and use of a little ghee while tempering for most dishes and desserts, most south Indian food is vegan in itself, explains Sruthi Harihara Subramanian, owner, Ashvita. Benefits Vegan food has several health benefits, including no risk of heart problems and cholesterol.Roshni points out that unlike meat and egg, which leads to higher levels of cholesterol and heart diseases, a plant-based whole-food vegan diet has almost no cholesterol. Dairy has been linked to indigestion, acne, headaches, diabetes, cancer, and a whole range of lifestyle diseases and disorders.A plant-based diet is also lower in calories and much more nutritious, she adds. Vegan food also promotes a healthy environment. You are reducing your carbon footprint, hence reducing damage to the environment, says Anu.Feasibility Minal, who became a vegan in 2011, says that cutting costs is easier if youre a vegan. People think it is not feasible; in fact, it is the opposite. Its easy and affordable to make dairy and meat alternatives at home. Roshni concurs and adds that most food we eat is accidentally vegan and almost everything can easily be customised. For instance, vegetarian Asian food is almost 100% vegan since they use tofu instead of paneer and no other dairy products. Abroad, the options are much more compared to India, but the Indian market is changing, she adds. Though awareness and acceptability is growing, its slow, claims A Mohamed Zakaria of Veganer restaurant, who had to shut down a couple of places, due to the same reason. We had formally opened the restaurant in September 2014.Since the awareness of vegan food is less in Chennai when compared to other cities, we couldnt get much response as we had expected. Hence, we decided to close the outlets in Anna Nagar, Ascendas Food"

(Right) A worker coating the threads used in flying kites with finely-powdered glass, cooked rice and colour at Dabeerpura.G. Ramakrishna & Serish NanisettiFor generations, Sankranti has always meant endless blue skies, colourful kites, and reels of manja . But fewer school holidays, disquiet over Goods and Services Tax, ill-implemented ban on Chinese thread has sent the kites and manja business into a tailspin.One of the main markets in the city between Kali Kaman and Gulzar Houz has shops only on one side of the road.Usually, both sides of the road used to have shops by this time, but the business is dull and there are hardly any buyers. I am expecting the business to change from tomorrow as it is a Sunday and more children will come and buy the kites. Earlier, the vacation period used to be long, but now its only for two or four days. Maybe thats the reason for the lack of interest in flying kites, says Moiz Khan, who has set up a makeshift shop near Kali Kaman.Inside the colourfully-decorated Bajaj Patang Ghar of Bhuvan Bajaj, kites made of thin plastic sheets are covered with political messages while kitschy movie themes dominate. But its the kites made of thin colourful paper that get a pride of place. I have even made small curios with kites, charkas which people can keep at home. People are showing interest and are buying these, but there are a few takers for kites, says Mr. Bajaj.We have a small mulgi (workspace) at Yakutpura where these kites are made. Not the big factories like they have in Gujarat, Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh. It is a year-round enterprise. But the last two years have been bad. While demonetisation killed the business last year, we dont even know why it has been affected this year. Not many children are seen buying the kites. Children from as far as Tarnaka, Secunderabad and Bowenpally would come and buy from us. But this year, there are no shoppers, says Muhammad Azhar, who has opened a kite shop, but drives an auto-rickshaw in his spare time."

The big cat was captured by a joint team of forest and zoo officials from St Franscis School after a rescue operation spanning over 8 hours. Having satiated its taste buds with over three kg of chicken meat, Thakur did not oblige many who wanted to have its glimpse on Sunday. Still, under the impact of tranquillizer, the animal could be approached only by the zoo staff.

5b13d7419855b762ecebfe72,Following the grain trail,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/following-the-grain-trail/article22452911.ece,2018-01-17,"Indias public distribution system (PDS) is in danger of being derailed in several States across the country. Recent disruptions of the PDS have taken different forms, from compulsory biometric authentication to so-called direct benefit transfer (DBT). The consequences are alarming, but tend to go unreported.Biometric mix-upsJharkhand is a prime example of this problem. By mid-2016, the PDS in Jharkhand had greatly improved, partly due to a series of reforms inspired by Chhattisgarhs experience and intensified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Instead of completing these reforms, for instance by removing private dealers, the Jharkhand government made Aadhaar-based biometric authentication compulsory for PDS users. The consequences, documented in a recent study published in theEconomic and Political Weekly, were sobering. Large numbers of people, especially among vulnerable groups such as widows and the elderly, found themselves excluded from the PDS. Those who were still able to buy their food rations faced considerable inconvenience due to connectivity and biometric failures. Worse, there was a revival of corruption, as PDS rice meant for those who failed the biometric test was siphoned off with abandon.The damage was made worse in mid-2017, when the Jharkhand government mass-cancelled ration cards not linked with Aadhaar. On September 22, the government claimed that Aadhaar had enabled it to cancel 11 lakh fake ration cards, but this figure stands no scrutiny, and indeed, it was retracted later. Many of the cancelled ration cards actually belonged to families that had been unable to link their card with Aadhaar for no fault of their own. The family of Santoshi Kumari, an 11-year old Dalit girl who died of hunger on September 28, was among them.The mass-cancellation of Aadhaar-less ration cards, without verification and without even informing the victims, was both inhuman and illegal. The State government received some flak for it from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)  it is another matter that UIDAI is participating in the crusade to make Aadhaar-based biometric authentication compulsory in various contexts. But far from learning from this mistake, or doing anything to repair it, the Jharkhand government launched a further attack on peoples food entitlements: the monthly PDS rations of 5 kg per person were restricted to those whose individual names had been linked with Aadhaar in the ration-cards database. The following sort of situation is now very common in rural Jharkhand: a family has five members, but only three are listed along with their Aadhaar number in the database, so the family ends up getting 15 kg of rice per month instead of 25 kg. This restriction, incidentally, is a flagrant violation of the instructions issued by the Food Ministry in Delhi on October 24, in response to the uproar that followed Santoshi Kumaris death.The cash routeAll this, however, is just a trailer. Preparations are on for a much bigger assault on the PDS in Jharkhand: the transition to so-called direct benefit transfer. Under the DBT system, people have to collect their food subsidy in cash from the bank before using it to buy rice from the ration shop at Rs. 32 per kg. Until now, they were able to buy rice from the ration shop at Rs. 1 per kg. Direct benefit transfer is an odd term for the new system, whereby the food subsidy is provided in a very roundabout way.The DBT system was initiated in Nagri Block of Ranchi district last October, on an experimental basis. The State government is planning to extend it in other parts if the experiment works. But it seems to have decided in advance that the experiment is a success, without paying serious attention to the ground realities.In Nagri, it does not take long to discover that the new system is a disaster, and that most people are angry with it. The main problem with DBT is that people waste enormous time shuttling between the banks,pragya kendras(common service centres) and ration shops to get hold of their money and then use it to buy rice at the ration shop. For many of them, this is a three-step process. First, they go to the bank to find out whether the subsidy has been credited and update their passbook. Second, they go to thepragya kendrato withdraw the cash, as the bank often insists on their doing so from these centres. Third, they take the cash to the ration shop to buy rice at Rs. 32 per kg. At every step, there are long queues, and for many people the bank orpragya kendrais also far away. For people with mobility problems, like the elderly or disabled, this entire process is a nightmare. One elderly woman we met had to be taken to the bank each time by two relatives  one to drive the motorbike and one to hold her from the back seat.The ordeal was particularly trying in the last few weeks, when people had to adapt to the new system. Many families have several bank accounts, but apparently, they were not told where to look for their subsidy. Even the bank manager we met in Nagri, or for that matter the Block Development Officer, did not know which account is selected for DBT when a household has several bank accounts. As a result, many people had to run from bank to bank to find out where their subsidy had been deposited. This is all the more difficult as the food subsidy is not always easy to distinguish from other bank credits.If people had cash reserves, the system might work better: PDS purchases would not be contingent on bank transactions. What is striking is that so many people in rural Jharkhand, even in a relatively developed block like Nagri, have so little cash. And even those who have some cash, it seems, prefer to use the DBT subsidy to buy rice from the ration shop, partly because they are not clear about the rules of the game.Incidentally, the State government announced last year that Nagri was all set to become Jharkhands first cashless block. Today, it is forcing people to handle more cash than they want to.Beyond JharkhandEven as the people of Nagri fume and protest against the DBT experiment, the State government is trying its best to project it as a success and justify its extension to the whole State. If this happens, millions of people will face renewed food insecurity.Jharkhand is among the worst cases of destabilisation of the PDS, but similar moves are happening in other States. Most of them are under tremendous pressure from the Central government to impose Aadhaar-based biometric authentication or move towards DBT. In Bihar, I am told, DBT failed in the pilot block (Kasba in Purnia district), but the failure went largely unreported. In Rajasthan, the biometric authentication has caused enormous damage, evident even in the governments own transactions data. Even Chhattisgarh, known for its model PDS, is under pressure to follow the diktats of the Central government and adopt Aadhaar-based technology. In all these States, we know senior officers in the Food Department who understand the inappropriateness of this technology and privately oppose it. Yet, they have no choice but to follow the Central governments instructions. This is symptomatic of a larger malady in Indias social sector: growing centralisation and technocracy.The most disturbing aspect of this trend is a lack of concern for the hardships that people face. Aadhaar-less ration cards are cancelled without notice. Pensions are discontinued without the victims being told what the problem is. Job cards are cancelled just to meet the 100% seeding targets. Elderly persons with rough fingerprints are deprived of food rations without compensation. Cash payments are automatically redirected to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts that people sometimes know nothing about. In effect, they are treated as guinea pigs for undependable technologies, without any effective arrangements for grievance redressal or even information sharing. Let people perish if need be, Aadhaar must prevail.Jean Dreze is visiting professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University"

Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people, Amarinder said.Amarinder said of the states almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. Its our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs, the CM said.With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing high-quantity rice and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into Mohali and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.He said: Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the states youth. I want to see it grow as a major technological hub in north, he said. The city is being equipped with all the necessary facilities. Amarinder said that in the next five years, his government would keep the development of Mohali a continued process towards technological growth."

(Reuters)When US President Donald Trump launches into one of his tweetstorms it sometimes seems like the diplomatic world is gasping in unison -- but not Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Many foreign policy professionals have set up alerts so their phones buzz in their pockets whenever the commander-in-chief insults a foreign leader or issues a vague threat of war.But not Tillerson, Washington's chief diplomat and arguably the man who has the toughest job clearing the air after Trump sets off another diplomatic incident with a social media rant.Tillerson is not on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. When Trump sends a tweet on world affairs a State Department aide prints it and brings it to the secretary for later perusal.At least, that is how he explained things to his friend and predecessor Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday in a chat after a speech at Stanford University in California.Rice asked Tillerson a question he gets asked all the time: how can he handle US foreign policy with Trump constantly stirring the pot with his undiplomatic tweets?Tillerson's reply went into more detail than usual -- although he again insisted that he has no problem with Trump's remarks and sees them as an opportunity to communicate his vision.""He's world class in social media, and I'm not,"" 65-year-old former oilman Tillerson admitted. ""I have no social media account, I've never had any and I don't intend to have any.""""It is a great tool when it is used well. The president has used it at a great effect by by-passing the traditional means of communicating,"" he told the assembled policy experts.""And he absolutely thrives with his ability to instantly communicate not just to the American people but to our friends and allies or to our adversaries in the entire world.""This much has been said before, but surely Tillerson receives a warning before Trump abruptly cancels a planned trip to London or threatens to pull out of the NAFTA trade pact?The answer is not, apparently. Tillerson likes it that way.""I don't know when he's going to do that, because that is just the way the president operates,"" he said.""The challenge is just getting caught up because I don't even have a Twitter account to follow what he's tweeting. My staff usually has to print his tweets out and hand them to me.""""I've actually concluded that's not a bad system.""'How do we use that?'Tillerson explained that it might be anything up to an hour post tweet that he finds out what Trump has been saying, and that means he can gauge official reaction before responding.""I already have the early reactions to that and it allows me to begin to think about: 'How do we take that?',"" he said.""OK, this is information. We know what our objectives are and he didn't change any of them. This is just the way he wants to communicate on a subject, how do we take that and use it?""Tillerson remains sanguine about Trump's exotic online monologue, which some critics fear could alienate US allies, despite having fallen foul of it more than once himself.In October last year, Tillerson met senior Chinese leaders in Beijing and afterwards told reporters that he had back channel communications open with Kim Jong-Un's North Korea.When Tillerson arrived back in Washington he discovered -- presumably on being handed a print out -- that Trump had disavowed his efforts to resolve the nuclear stand-off.""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,"" Trump had tweeted. ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what needs to be done!"""

The police found 236 cartons of liquor instead of fuel in the container.Gopalganj superintendent of police (SP) Raviranjan said the police initially thought the information was misleading. But they were proved right when the police intercepted the oil container on national highway-28 and seized the alcohol manufactured in Punjab.The police arrested the driver and cleaner of the oil tanker. ""Efforts are on ascertain the identity of the man, who had booked the consignment from Punjab. The seized consignment of alcohol and fuel container has been taken to the Baikunthpur police station of the district,"" the SP told The Telegraph.The SP said this is for the first time such a modus operandi has come to the fore. ""The cops are baffled,"" he said.In Begusarai, a truck laden with bags of rice was seized from Sahebpur Kamal police station area as it was allegedly being used to ferry liquor. The truck driver lost control and fell into a ditch after the police chased the vehicle.Begusarai superintendent of police (SP) Aditya Kumar said the consignment was to be delivered to a man at Iniyar village. The truck's driver and cleaner have been detained for interrogation.Earlier, bootleggers had used fake Indian Army permits to ferry alcohol from Punjab to north Bihar. It came to the fore when an excise team seized a truck bearing a fake Nagaland registration number at Jalalpur check post in Gopalganj district early this month. A senior excise official said the truck had entered Gopalganj from Uttar Pradesh. Acting on a tip off, excise department personnel intercepted it in an area under the jurisdiction of Kuchaikot police station and seized 300 cartons of liquor worth Rs 25 lakh.""Liquor smugglers have devised different ways to keep the tipplers happy,"" the officer said. ""From tomatoes to water melon, fuel containers to trucks laden with potatoes they use various methods to transport liquor from Punjab and Haryana.""Sources said illegal trade is facilitated by agents who coordinate with the smugglers in Punjab and Haryana."

Not scarlet or rose or even ruby, but red like the blood oozing from a ruptured vessel and dripping with the sting of several lost generations. Less crop, more a byword for colonial excesses.Which is why, talk of an indigo resurgence across the subcontinent - Bengal, Uttarakhand, Assam, South India, Bangladesh - elicits a reflex cringe. The reaction that follows is really a question. Why do we need a crop that has been known to decimate son and soil?That was also the response Amrita Mukerji got from the farmers she employed when she decided to grow indigo in her smallish plot in Santiniketan. ""Don't grow these. They will harm the land,"" is how they warned her. ""When I asked them who had told them as much, they said they just knew,"" says Mukerji, founder of the NGO, Sutra.Around the turn of the century, after years of globe-trotting with her husband, Mukerji settled down to a retired life in Calcutta. She says, ""I had visited production centres in Nigeria. And over the years, attended indigo exhibitions, met scholars studying the history of the plant, bought prints... I started to fall in love with the blue of the indigo.""And then in 2003, textile researcher Charlotte Kwon met her in Calcutta and handed her a packet of indigo seeds.The indigo project was apparently a whim. That year, after harvest, Mukerji noticed that the land had yielded a rush of mustard. The farmers were surprised.They needn't have been. Indigo is a leguminous plant, fixes nitrogen to the soil, enhances soil quality and soil productivity and has been popular in India from time immemorial as a virtuous rotational crop. From 2016, Mukerji turned to indigo cultivation in all seriousness.Around the same time in Uttarakhand's Kumaon region, Rashmi Bharti was also planting indigo. In Uttarakhand, food crops are prone to pest attacks; monkeys, parrots and wild boars are also known to destroy food grains. Farmers were fed up. And that is when Bharti, co-founder of the NGO, Avani, that creates viable employment opportunities for rural men and women, thought of indigo cultivation as a sustainable alternative. And for good reason - not only is the plant hardy and low maintenance, monkeys do not like the taste of it and there is nothing to peck at for the birds either.Mukerji is aware of cultivation in Murshidabad. Bharti talks about other geographies - Bihar, Andhra, Karnataka. It might be too soon to call it a revolution, but there is a definite indigo wave sweeping India.Indigo is indigenous to India. One finds mention of it in works as diverse as the Atharva Veda and the Ain-i-Akbari. Jenny Balfour-Paul, an expert on the subject, writes in her book Indigo: Egyptian Mummies to Blue Jeans, ""The word indigo itself derives from the Greek indikon, Latinised indicum, originally meaning a substance from India, indicating the import of indigo pigment by the Graeco-Roman world. The Sanskirt word nila, meaning dark blue, spread from India eastwards into Southeast Asia and westward to the Near and Middle East, probably both through the pre-Islamic trading routes and subsequent trade diffusion of the product in the Islamic era...""In a WhatsApp call from London, Balfour-Paul tells The Telegraph that Bengal in particular produced the best quality of indigo. ""Bengal had the perfect soil to grow this tropical plant. There are 800 species of indigo, of which only 10 will yield colour. Indigofera tinctoria is what is found in Bengal.""So when and how did indigo come to be a pejorative? The East India Company was aware of the commercial worth of indigo. There were indigo plantations across colonies.In her book, Balfour writes about how the company actively promoted Bengal's indigo industry by providing heavy subsidies and underwriting initial big losses. It brought over European indigo planters from the West Indies to establish efficient factories, and Bengal indigo soon equalled in quality the finest West Indian product. ""So successful was the operation that the company's Asian indigo imports into London jumped from 25,000 pounds in 1782 (when most of the indigo came from America and West Indies) to 43,68,000 pounds in 1795, the bulk of it from Bengal.""At the time, four million people were employed in the production and manufacture of indigo in Bengal alone. Indigo was a hugely profitable enterprise. Its colour was gold.Research associate Sanjukta Ghosh of SOAS South Asia Institute, London, tells us that W.B. Hudson, a major planter in the region, claimed that 4.5 million was invested in the indigo industry. The problem started when profits were not ploughed back to the ryots or indigo farmers. She talks about the planters' ostentatious lifestyle - sprawling bungalows, obliging servants. As the returns on indigo increased, so did their greed, and a time came when they started taking away every cultivable land for indigo cultivation.Indigo might have been gold, but what is gold in the face of hunger? The aggressive push landed on the farmer's stomach, fair and square.By the mid 19th century, the exploitation had assumed monstrous proportions. In 1860, on the back of the uprising of 1857, Dina-bandhu Mitra, an employee of the Raj, wrote a play on the subject. Titled Nil Darpan, it was meant to show the mirror to the Raj, the story behind the indigo success story. In his biography of Mitra, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote: ""Nil Darpan is to Bengal what Uncle Tom's Cabin is to America's slave movement.""Taking a cue from Nil Darpan, several learned men of Bengal took up the pen. One such anonymous writer's song goes thus: ""Hey nirodoy nilkargan/aar shohena praney ei nildahan/Krishaker dhoney praney/Dohile nilagune..."" The farmer writhing in agony is crying out to the indigo planters for mercy, pleading with them to rein in their indigo lust.Nil Darpan shook up British Parliament after 200 translated copies landed in Britain. It decreed that one could cultivate indigo in Bengal only if one was a landowner. Most of the planters were using leased land and when this diktat kicked in, they started looking for bluer pastures.Balfour-Paul tells us that two-fifths of the million-and-a-half acre of land that was under cultivation in India was in Bihar. She writes, ""Though the term satyagraha was coined much later in history, 'Champaran Satyagraha' began with peasants revolting against the Indigo planters.""From gold, indigo had taken the colour of death - black.Every drama must have its denouement. Indigo's was written by a German chemist. Adolf Von Baeyer invented synthetic indigo towards the end of the 19th century. It was cheaper, came minus the bloodbath and made natural indigo inconsequential.But not all the holy waters of India could wash the taint off the Blue Devil. At some point, history polluted fact and it came to be accepted, most mistakenly, that indigo was a villainous plant.Crops do not understand man-made divisions. As then, so also now, indigo is a common benison of India and Bangladesh.Ruby Ghuznavi is the founder of Aranya Crafts, an indigo enterprise based in Dhaka. She says, ""We first cultivated and extracted indigo in Bangladesh on an experimental basis in 1984. It was not very well received by the farmers because of its negative history. But once it was apparent to them that they would be the actual beneficiaries and indigo would no longer be the exploitative crop of the past, they accepted its production very eagerly. The fact that indigo as an extra crop between two major rice harvests has brought extra earnings for the farmers, is well appreciated by them.""Mishael Aziz Ahmad is also from Bangladesh, and runs the social enterprise Living Blue. He says that farmers in north Bangladesh were intercropping Indigofera tinctoria all along, as a fertiliser. Thus, in reality, indigo had never died out. What had happened was its use had changed from dye to fertiliser. Ahmad says, ""Now about 3,000 farmers in 80 to 100 villages are planting indigo in the peripheral lands. Landless labourers are also planting it by the roadside and earning a few bucks during the lull period. In Bangladesh, people have accepted it as a crop that is creating more employment opportunities.""Ahmad's account dovetails into Rashmi Bharti's. In Uttarakhand, there was a problem. Men would leave their villages for cities in search of jobs, and the women were left behind. The large tracts of unused land invited soil erosion.Indigo cultivation has addressed all these problems. Apart from the fact that it can grow at an altitude as high as 5,500 feet, indigo cultivation is not very labour intensive. Bharti's NGO has trained the women of these villages to do both. She says, ""In the first year, we had started with only 20 farmers. In 2017, we had 250 farmers. Their total earnings this year was Rs 4.6 lakh.""Avani consumes most of the produce currently as the market in India is nascent. Apart from dyeing - it is widely used in dyeing jeans - indigo is used for products such as watercolours, crayons and wood stains.Amrita Mukerji tells us that indigo is a non-pollutant and eco-friendly natural dye.In several pockets in south India, it turns out that indigo never went out of fashion. Victoria Vijayakumar, who runs Aranya Naturals, a community development project by the Tatas, tells us that indigo cultivation has been going on for generations in Munnar. It was used as manure. Vijayakumar also confirms that the renewed use of indigo for its dye is relatively recent. She tells us, ""We have six acres of land under indigo cultivation and in three years we have had 18 harvests. This year 80 kilos of indigo was extracted.""And so indigo has come full circle. From blue to gold to black to red, it is back to being a vivid blue once again. The colour of the expansive horizon, of the bottomless waters, and above all, of freedom and promise."

The seller claimed that there are firms in Delhi which take a hefty fees to test the radioactive properties of the copper bowl and can buy the article for a huge price as its rare and unique.In May 2017, the seller took me to a shop that deals in antique items and is located at KG Marg. The managing director of the shop assured me that they have a legal licence, issued by various government departments, including the DRDO, to engage in the business of radioactive products, said the complainant.Radiation testThe MD enquired about the genuineness of the article and demanded Rs. 70 lakh as the cost for testing its properties, including opening and decoding chemicals, closing chemicals and anti-radiation suit and spray. He said that if the article tested positive, he will pay Rs. 50 crore the same day and buy it, the complainant said.On May 31, 2017, the businessman deposited Rs. 70 lakh at the antique shops office for the testing of the article. I was told that the radioactive range of the article is measured by the distance from which it can pull rice, said the complainant.On June 3, 2017, the businessman along with the MD, two scientists and two assistant scientists went to a farm house outside the city where he was told to stay out as the rest of them went inside a room to test the radioactive properties of the copper bowl. They came out after one hour and claimed that the article had tested positive, but could not be opened as its radioactive range had increased and its protective layers had been ruptured. They did not allow me to to see the article claiming that it was highly radioactive and dangerous for health. They all left the spot asking me to visit the office, said the complainant.Demand for more moneyAfter several rounds of meeting, the MD asked him to pay Rs. 1.25 crore more to complete the testing. I kept telling him to complete the job but after lot of negotiations he agreed to perform the test again if I deposited Rs. 80 lakh more. I got suspicious and verified the background of the antique company and realised that I had been cheated by a group of conmen, he said.Fake identityWhen he further verified the credentials of the people he had met during the deal, he realised that the MD was not even a graduate and the scientists were illiterate persons. The company did not have any licence of deal with radioactive products. When he tried to get in touch with the six men, he realised that they had fled and the antique shop was shut.The fraudsters have vast network of agents all over the country who entice gullible investors with big bucks promises and get hefty commission on the fees deposited, said the complainant.An FIR has been registered under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code.

5aead7159855b73f522c3e30,India's Farmers Need a New Deal beyond Cliched MSP Politics,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-farmers-need-a-new-deal-beyond-cliched-msp-politics/story-fpGg1pb90g1IKOkWBTUN3O.html,2018-02-15,"Finance minister Arun Jaitleys grand budget announcement of Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) providing assured 50% return to farmers may not actually mean a 50% return. The government admitted on February 9 that it had the so-called A2+FL (a measure of variable costs) and not C2 (which also includes fixed costs) costs in mind while calculating return mark-ups vis--vis MSPs. An earlier HT story had pointed this on February 7.Now that the buzz around budget seems to have settled, a deeper question can be asked. How much of a role can MSPs, and promises of increasing them, play in addressing the growing viability crisis of agriculture in todays age? Beginning with some stylised facts may help.Less than one-fourth of Indias total cereal production is procured at MSP. The share of procurement is slightly higher, a little less than one-third, for wheat and rice (Chart 1). Of late horticultural production has surpassed food grain production in India. There is no MSP coverage for fruits and vegetables.Even the limited procurement which happens is extremely skewed. More than half of total rice and wheat procurement is done from the traditional green revolution states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (Chart 2).A National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report for 2012-13 shows that less than half of all farmers were even aware about MSPs. The figures vary across crops. Only a fraction of those who are aware about MSPs actually sell their crops to procurement agencies. Such sale is able to dispose off only a fraction of their total production (See Chart 3).These statistics provide a context to the twin challenges of putting into place a holistic and remunerative MSP policy. If MSPs have to be really remunerative, they need a significant hike compared to present levels. An even bigger problem is the skewed crop-wise and state-wise coverage under the procurement net. If this has to be increased significantly, it would require a massive scaling up of governments procurement operations. This is not just a question of money. Storage of procured food grains is a big problem even at current procurement levels.The only effective way to dispose procured grains is through public distribution system (PDS). This avenue would come under squeeze as cash transfers replace distribution of food in the PDS.Both the present and past government has been pushing for abolition of in-kind food security programmes. Politicians, who wax eloquent about the benefits of doing away with in-kind PDS hardly talk about the effect it would have on procurement operations. Wider MSP coverage and cash transfers in food security programmes cannot go hand in hand in India.The problem does not end here. It is a fact that more and more Indians are getting out of abject poverty. They are also becoming more and more mobile in search of jobs. The middle classes do not need the PDS to buy food grains and other essentials anymore. Scarcity of such things is not something post-reform India would even relate to. Growth in agricultural production is the biggest reason for this.Both these developments reduce the possibilities of a healthy growth in number of people using the old arrangement of ration shops to access subsidised grains. This means even without cash transfers, the ability of MSP- type policies to support farm incomes will shrink in days to come.All this is not to say MSP-based PDS is not needed anymore. Starvation deaths have been reported because people could not get their ration due to Aadhaar-related problems. The absolute number of very poor people is still very high. MSP-based procurement is an important anchor of agricultural prices in India. It also protects countrys food security. Many farmers could switch from food crops to commercial crops if there were no procurement.What all this does suggest is the fact that agricultural policy making has got itself into a cul-de-sac. The tested method of incentivising agricultural production  MSP-based procurement  is reaching its limits. Uncertainty in farm incomes is only increasing with growing weight of perishables in total agricultural production. Challenges such as climate change related adverse effects on farm production would be here much sooner. Farmers are feeling the pinch of all this, but they have no agency. Farmer politicians do not hold much clout in Indias game of thrones.Those who do not earn their living from farming are not bothered for the moment. Indias urban middle class probably never had it so good when it comes to consumption of food products. A large variety of food items are being delivered to their doorsteps at discounted rates. The more farmers incomes are squeezed, the cheaper they get these things. Although much smaller in number than farmers, this class exercises a disproportionate sway in opinion building.The political class has by and large chickened out from handling this fundamental political economy divide. Its happy to placate one class at a time. Lower inflation for large part of the term, followed by a tactical MSP hike towards the end.The consequences can be disastrous in the not-too-distant future. A deep rooted crisis in farming can end the supply glut largely taken for granted. Signs of growing social unrest are already visible. Any new deal to farmers would require resolution of this contradiction rather than fraudulent promises of MSP hikes."
5b177fa89855b75db2e79d76,Foodgrain production may touch record 277 mn tonnes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foodgrain-production-may-touch-record-277-mn-tonnes/articleshow/63104177.cms,2018-02-28,"New Delhi: India's overall foodgrain production may touch a record of 277.49 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) with output of pulses and rice reporting a new high. The agriculture ministry released its latest estimates on Tuesday, just when the government has been exploring various options of procuring more and more foodgrains from farmers in the year of plenty.Option of extending the government's guarantee to banks and lending agencies to ensure that state agencies do not face fund crunch for procurement is likely to come up before the Union Cabinet for approval on Wednesday.The move will help states go for procurement of pulses, oilseeds and cotton under the Price Support Scheme ( PSS ) through central nodal agencies and the other crops by state agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) without worrying about paucity of funds.The basic objectives of PSS are to provide remunerative prices to the growers with a view to encourage higher investment and production and safeguard interests of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices.Though the year is expected to report decline in production of wheat and oilseeds as compared to previous year (2016-17), the latest estimates gave a new hope amid reports of good sowing of winter crops ( Rabi ), except wheat, in December-January.The fall in wheat production can be attributed to farmers' decision to shift to pulses with the hope of better MSP. Farmers in Rajasthan, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh shifted to pulses during the Rabi season.The agriculture ministry, while releasing the second advance estimates of foodgrain production, attributed the record output in 2017-18 to ""near normal rainfall during 2017 monsoon and various policy initiatives taken by the government"".The ministry said that the assessment of production of different crops was ""based on the feedback received from states"". It claimed that the assessment was also ""validated with information available from other sources"".The ministry releases four advance estimates, before the final one which gives exact details of foodgrain output. The second estimates, released after completion of the Rabi sowing operations across the country, show that the production of wheat is likely to drop by 1.42% to estimated 97.11 MT. It is lower by 1.40 MT as compared to record wheat production of 98.51 MT achieved during 2016-17."
5b16bde79855b72ada088923,Stuffed with metaphors,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/stuffed-with-metaphors/article22872936.ece,2018-02-28,"Passionate about theatre, Faezeh Jalali is well known for espousing the cause of issue-based plays. Marrying the two, the versatile theatre practitioner has staged plays that entertain even as they provoke audience to contemplate. These include Jaal , Objects In The Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear and Im Every Woman among others. Theatre is a catalyst for change. While entertaining it must make viewers analyse and reflect, she comments, as we settle down for a luncheon interaction at the National School of Dramas Food Court. Adding to her evocative works is her latest, ShikhandiThe Story of the In-Betweens , staged at the ongoing 8th Theatre Olympics. Written and directed by Faezeh, it is a comic, tongue-in-cheek retelling of the story of Shikhandi, perhaps one of the earliest trans-charaters in mythology.Recounting how Shikhandi took shape, Faezeh says, while reading the epic, she was really enamoured by Shikhandi. Meant to be born male to avenge an insult in past life as Amba, she is reborn as female, raised a male and has a sex change. It was not just that aspect but the human struggle for identity and finding a voice that brought me close to Shikhandi, explains Faezeh. She strongly identified with Shikhandis struggle since as a girl she too encountered gender bias. Fond of cricket, I was not allowed by boys to join the game. They would ask me to play with dolls or stand outside the field to fetch the ball. I found this humiliating. It irked me when boys were told not to cry like girls. What has tears got to do with gender? she asks.Despite complete freedom from parents, others reminded her of being a girl. I was told repeatedly to conduct myself with grace. All this left an indelible mark. Youll be surprised to know that even today many are unable to accept that I am a director. Having suffered discrimination, made Faezeh understand transgenders situation better. It made me empathise with their pain, which they undergo because they did not fit the so called normal gender slot.Asked to order, Faezeh promptly requests for aloo and paneer parathas. I love the stuffed parathas they make in Delhi. I make it a point to have them whenever in the Capital. Continuing about her journey with Shikhandi , it is surprising to know that initially it was a one-person device for just 20 minutes which is now a 90 minute play with eight actors. The first draft was written in 2010 but in 2014 after my breakup I rewrote and expanded it to include more characters. Break-up always spurs your creative juices, she jests.Daunting taskAgreeing it was daunting task to turn a long play, she reveals, In the theatrical sense it was challenging to locate the dramatic quality which is necessary to ensure the play is engaging and flows. The story states that Shikhandi unable to consummate his marriage is helped by a Yaksha. From drama perspective why did the Yaksha do that, there has to be some justification. In the story I wrote, the Yaksha himself is struggling with sexuality. Moreover, I found back stories for every character and incident in the epic which I wove in the play.With piping hot parathas with chutney and boondi raita arriving, we take a break. Relishing the food in small bites, Faezeb informs she loves eating rajma chawal and gol gappe in Delhi. Not what is offered at the star hotels but on roadside eateries. It is simply yummy! I am not very fastidious about the eating place as long it is clean. Raised in Mumbai and having studied theatre in the US for more than six years, Faezeh has developed a liking for other cuisines too. Her choicest cuisine is of course Iranian. Being an Iranian, I prefer chelow kababs which has rice, kababs, butter and raw egg and tahchin the Persian baked cake which has yogurt, saffron, egg and chicken fillets. Liking them so much, she must know how to prepare them They are made best by my mother. I can guess what she has prepared simply by the fragrance at home. I did learn cooking but took it seriously in the US where I couldnt survive on pizzas and burgers. Through hit and trial and recipes, I learnt from mother. I can cook vegetarian and non-vegetarian biryanis, pao baji and curd rice. The last is a surprise. I first tasted from my roomy, a Malayali. I loved it and learnt how to make it. I can simply live on curd rice through the year, she grins.Elements of Indian artContinuing on her culinary skills, Faezeh reveals she loves to experiment with cooking the way she does with her theatre. The only problem is after whipping up something delicious I am unable to recall the ingredients and their quantity. That cant be the case in theatre as well. No way. In plays, I try incorporate elements of Indian art and folk forms with a contemporary touch. In Shikhandi , I have used Kalaripayattu, Yakshagana, Koodiyattam and Bharatanatyam gestures to explain the text and dialogues in English. Likewise, the fight sequences have elements of Kalaripayattu while the choreography has many facets of Bharatanatyam. My training in West has prepared me physically, made me capable to analyse script and go beyond the text, I still intuitively identify with Indian stories, epics, legends, myths and art forms. An amazing, rich and varied treasure trove dating back several centuries is what should inspire us and not the West. Not trained in these forms, Faezeh has attended several workshops and reads extensively about them.The costumes used in Shikhandi too attracted lot of attention. Yes, they are mix of traditional and contemporary and are same for men and women. The dhoti is in Yakshagana style with embellishments, short above the knee. There is a belt around the dhoti which covers the crotch area. The top has a feminine contemporary cut, one shoulder top which is like a sari blouse but sleeveless. That symbolises the feminine while the dhoti masculine. The reason is to reflect the concept of ardhanarishvara, both male and female attributes in us, just like Shikhandi.Casting transgendersWhile preparing for the play, Faezeh did think about casting transgender actors. I had met Living Vidya, a fine actor, who I was keen to cast. Likewise, a Kathak dancer and five others I had auditioned were excellent dancers and performers. All of them were keen but needed money to take care of their families and self. Short of funds, I couldnt immediately offer salary or allowance. It was a great loss.These interactions helped Faezeh in reflecting their plight. I realised how economic independence is vital for transgenders to be able to fulfil their dreams and ambitions. Many of the insights I gained in their life and struggle have found their way into the play. For example, when Shikhandi tries to tell Dhrupad, his father, about his gender confusion, the latter immediately suggests marriage as a solution. That is exactly how parents and family react when a person declares himself to be gay or lesbian. They think marriage will remove the confusion. There is more to transgenders than we know.With the parathas over, the staff suggests cheese vegetable grilled sandwiches. Yes, I will taste them. As I love the ones made in Mumbai, it will remind me of my city, she avers.Reflecting on her journey, Faezeh says, it has been a learning curve. Acting under ace directors like Rehan Engineer, Rajat Kapoor, Rodney Umlas and Pearl Padamsee, I picked up finer nuances of the craft and how to handle actors, be creative, open to suggestions and passionate about stage. Likewise, watching other plays, has exposed me to different forms of presentation. Besides, new content pushes you to become inquisitive. In this Olympics, I was amazed to know about Kalbeliyas life and their disappearing livelihood in Sabir Khans Doodhan .Having acted in films like Qissa and Slumdog Millionaire and TV show Mahi Way , Faezeh does not view them very differently. Both are fun and when it comes to acting they are the same except that stage does not allow any retakes. The only problem is you have to wait hours after the make-up for the shots. That waiting period for a theatre person like me is killing, she exclaims as she bids goodbye.In Shikhandi, I have used Kalaripayattu, Yakshagana, Koodiyattam and Bharatanatyam gestures to explain the text and dialogues in English"
5b2e79a19855b72640115ddf,"Pak's jobless are fleeing, many end up dead",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/662125/paks-jobless-fleeing-many-end.html,2018-02-28,"The family, faces torn with grief, huddled around their phones, replaying voice messages sent from 3,000 miles away.""I can't talk too loudly or they'll take my phone away,"" said a panicked, hushed voice in one. ""Don't call me because it will make the ringer go off, they'll hear it and I'll get caught,"" it cautioned in another. And finally, ""Please tell the agent to send the money to Libya.""The voice in the messages was that of Babar Shabir, a 19-year-old Pakistani. His relatives fear he is dead, among roughly 90 people who drowned this month when a boat smuggling migrants from Libya to Italy capsized. A majority, including a newborn, appear to have been from Pakistan.The 16 bodies that have been found arrived in Pakistan earlier this month. Seven of the confirmed dead were, like Shabir, from tiny Gujrat, in northern Punjab province, which has been rocked by the disaster.Though Libya has become a notorious transit hub for illegal migration to Europe - some 1,80,000 migrants used that route to cross to Italy in 2016 alone - Pakistanis have in the past rarely been among them. But desperate Pakistanis will now go far in search of better lives.Shabir left his hometown, near Pakistan's border with India, with his 24-year-old cousin, Mazhar Hussain, in December. Their families say the pair collected around $13,000, a fortune for even the well-to-do, to pay a local smuggler who guaranteed safe passage to Europe. When news of the capsizing trickled back to Gujrat, the young men's families tried frantically, but unsuccessfully, to reach them.Azhar Hussain says he knew his brother Mazhar was dead when he saw a photo of his body posted on Facebook, circulated by Pakistanis in Libya to help confirm victims' identities. Azhar covered his face with his shawl as Shabir's older brother looked at the picture of Mazhar Hussain's greyish body, covered in sand. With Shabir's death not certain, the men remained glued to their phones, scouring gruesome photos for his face.Local labourers in this largely agrarian area have streamed overseas in sizable numbers since the 1970s. For years, legal migration was such a force that little towns here were given nicknames like Little Norway and Little Britain, for where their people had gone.Homes here hint at the mass migration. Tidy mud-brick village houses, surrounded by wheat and rice fields, have been increasingly replaced by mansions with gaudy ironwork and colourful tiles, built with money from overseas relatives. In 2014, almost 30% of local households reportedly received foreign remittances.The houses serve in a sense as billboards for smugglers, proof of money to be made abroad. Ansar Burney, a Pakistani civil rights activist who works to end people smuggling, said the message was persuasive. ""If I'm living in these rural towns, I'd be convinced I should go, too,"" he said.For Shabir, the appeal was hypnotic. ""We begged him not to go,"" his mother, Hamida Bibi, said between desperate prayers for her son. ""But he had made up his mind long ago.""His cousin, Mazhar Hussain, the oldest son in his family, also was drawn by the lure of fantastic wealth and hoped to send money home. ""Now, we're left with nothing,"" his brother Azhar said. ""We sold what land we had to collect money for his ticket to Europe. My parents are old, and I can't find steady work. It's like we lost everything when we lost him.""Legal migration from Pakistan peaked in 2015 when just under 1 million Pakistanis left to work overseas. It has since dropped almost by half, Burney said, with migrants seeking visas squeezed by concerns about terrorism in Europe and economic belt-tightening in the Persian Gulf.""The Saudis took an initiative to reduce all overseas labour, Pakistanis included,"" said Jabbar Chaudry of Pakistan's Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, adding, ""The educated and semi-educated youth no longer have legal windows of opportunity.""An increasing number of Pakistanis, 14,000, applied for asylum in 2016 in Italy alone, most asserting persecution or fear of violence. Others fleeing in recent years included almost 7,000 ethnic Hazaras who gained asylum in Australia in 2013.With legal options for migrant workers shrinking, the Libyan route to Europe has become popular. According to the International Organization for Migration, in January about 240 Pakistanis crossed into Italy from Libya, making them the third largest nationality represented. By comparison, only nine were reported in January 2017.The cousins reached Libya by air and, according to their families, had legitimate visas. ""They took a flight from Lahore to Dubai, then Kuwait to Turkey, then they reached Libya,"" Azhar Hussain said. ""They would call us from a different airport every day for a few days.""Path of horrorsIn Libya, they joined the tens of thousands trying to reach Europe, and fell into the hands of smugglers demanding more money. Some of the men's last messages relayed the horror of being captive and beaten while others around them were tortured.Pressed for money, their families begged the smuggler in Gujrat to help and eventually came up with $1,000 more to secure the men's journey onward.This new path through Libya should get more scrutiny, said Mohsin Waheed Butt, an officer with the Pakistani Federal Intelligence Agency. ""Immigration officers, they need to inquire why people are going to Libya,"" he said. ""What kind of a person is going to Libya right now? It's obvious these guys are going for only one thing.""But Burney, the rights advocate, believes the government is on some level complicit, saying: ""These smugglers are flush with cash. They're getting Libyan visas in the dozens, and they've bought off the immigration officers sitting at the airport, too.""The director general of the Federal Intelligence Agency, Bashir Memon, confirmed that all the Pakistanis whose bodies were recovered after the capsizing had gone to Libya legally. He said law enforcement agencies ""try their best"" to counter ""a whole mafia of smuggling"" in the region.A short drive from where the cousins lived, Muhammad Khan held court recently in his ancestral house. Villagers came to offer condolences after learning his nephew died in the capsizing with his wife and children, the younger less than 2 months old.The nephew, Ismail Khan, moved his family to Libya two years ago, hoping to find work as a labourer.

We have plugged the leakage of subsidised wheat, rice and coarse grains to the tune of Rs 17,500 crore annually. Though there is no direct savings because new beneficiaries also get added, now we are providing the foodgrains to the real beneficiaries, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told TOI.According to government data, about 23.19 crore ration cards have been issued to people under the National Food Security Act ( NFSA ). While all the ration cards have been digitised, the progress of linking ration cards to Aadhaar numbers is about 82%. More bogus ration cards will be out of the system once we have 100% Aadhaar seeding, Paswan said.Data compiled by the food ministry show that nearly 50% of the deleted ration cards across the country came from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal . A large number of bogus ration cards were also deleted in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.NFSA is the worlds largest welfare scheme, which targets ensuring food security to more than 80 crore eligible beneficiaries."

How is being finance minister in the SAD-BJP coalition different from being one in the Congress government The difference between the Akali finance minister and the Congress finance minister is that the style of functioning of Capt Amarinder Singh is very different from Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Capt Singh likes to delegate his work, he trusts you completely and expects results. In Mr Badals case, he never delegated and he didnt expect results. He would take finance departments meetings personally and not invite the finance minister. In the present dispensation, I am expected to tie up everything, sew up everything and give a final presentation either to the CM or the cabinet. In that sense, its quite different.I think the last 10 years had been very reckless in so far as populism is concerned, in terms of good governance or administration. A lot of money was recklessly thrown on projects not in the larger interest of Punjab. For example, for the last 10 years they kept telling us that they had foodstock to cover all the losses. But one day before the counting of votes on March 10, 2017, the Punjab government signed an agreement with the Centre accepting all the losses and converting that account into a term loan. In one stroke of pen, we were saddled with $4.5 billion or Rs 31,000 crore. Similarly, electricity boards losses of about Rs 17,000 crore were converted to UDAY bonds. So about Rs 51,000 crore was loaded in within a few weeks.In the last financial year of the SAD government, they made memorials worth Rs 2,000 crore. But for the first time, there was a strike in the Panjab University for 20 days. Students were beaten up. PU was just asking for Rs 20 crore of additional government support. We have not paid the Sainik School at Kapurthala, which for continuous 17 years got the Presidents medal for sending most cadets to the NDA. The annual grant to the school was Rs 1 crore, which is peanuts. Baba Farid Health Sciences University vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur wanted Rs 50 crore to make it a world class university.Once they have been built, what do you do? Either you complete them or leave them. They are all half-constructed. So well have to complete them. But, why were these decisions taken?All revenue of Mandi Board accounts to the tune of about Rs 5,000 crore, PIDB about Rs 2,000 crore a year have been escrowed with the banks for five years. Before they left, they made sure that they emptied out everything and no sources of revenue were left for the next government. Its, as they call it in military, a scorched earth policy where the retreating forces destroy everything. But in this process, the Congress government has learnt a lesson, that howsoever reckless you are, you will be reduced to 15 seats, if you are not careful, if good governance is not there, and if corruption is there. The basic concern is rozi-roti and, what in Urdu they say, izzat ki roti.We were acutely aware of what was happening in Punjab. Whatever the Congress government has promised is basically with the view to kick-start the economy. Now in this cross-subsidisation of giving free power to farmers, the whole subsidy burden was loaded on to the industry of Punjab. They were getting power at Rs 7.60 a unit. If I can take you 50 years back: Why did Punjab progress? Punjab progressed because it had the Bhakra Dam. Because Punjab had access to cheap power, Punjab industrialised and developed.Industry was leaving Punjab in droves because of the power situation. So how do we retain them? We have to create a level-playing field. So when you talk about populism, I would respectfully disagree with you. It was not populism. It involves a subsidy of about Rs 1,500 crore. But I see benefits or multiplier effects if we can retain our industry. Because you dont just retain industry, you also retain jobs and taxes. So, this was a must.No, this is not the only way. There are two other things that need to be done. Farmers have to be weaned away from agriculture. If agriculture forms 20% of Punjabs GDP and 75% people are engaged in agriculture, that means 75% people are trying to earn Rs 20. They are not going to be rich or well-off. The idea is to give skill sets and job opportunities to farmers children so that they can get away and start doing other jobs. Second step is to give better crop prices and promote alternative crops. It has to be multi-pronged approach and debt has to be taken care of. Unless you do all three simultaneously, you will not have the desired effect.We have to remodel our economy from a foodgrainproducing economy into a more industrialised or a service-oriented one. That model has to be put in place in the next four years. If we dont do that, I foresee our resources will be severely affected in the post-GST situation when compensation stops after four years.The Green Revolution must move eastwards. Punjab should be relieved of this duty of growing foodgrains for the country. We have done this duty for 60 years, but in this process we have poisoned our soil, depleted our aquifers and water sources. Let Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, which form the natural food bowl of India, do that duty.We are saying instead of rice, we will be very interested in growing maize. As long as we get the MSP or a little bit of hand-holding, Punjab could become Denmark of India. Why should there not be MSP on milk, fruits, or vegetables? If you study the food policy of India, it is rooted in the 1960s and Green Revolution was the main thrust at the time.If you look at an average Indian, he is malnourished. So now, the Union government should change the food policy to nutrition policy. An average man should have the access to fruit, milk and vegetables, and Punjab could step in as the producer of milk, fruits and vegetables. And, this is how we can remodel and maize could be one of the options.Of course, maize would give as much income or cash as rice would. There would be no problem of stubble burning as well. It will take care of all that.I think that is the political line. The Punjab government is basically trying to assess the electricity requirement. At present, any transmission losses or any inefficiencies of the electricity board are actually all being billed to free power. This is only a pilot project. We are trying to tell farmers that every tubewell costs us, say Rs 48,000 per year. We have 1.4 million pumps. So we are saying, you take this Rs 48,000 which we anyway have to give. In case, you can save power of say Rs 18,000 out of Rs 48,000 that we pay you, then Rs 18,000 is yours. There is another angle to it. We want to save water as well. If farmers accept it, we are going to go further and if not, let it remain a pilot project.We had flagged this issue with the Union finance and agriculture ministers. Maybe the CM will again meet Union minister (Ram Vilas) Paswan and we again will say, Either you take over the entire procurement operation, or reimburse us our actuals  whichever is convenient for you. Pre-GST, we have been charging some cess from the FCI, but it has been subsumed now.Food procurement exercise is inherently a lossmaking exercise to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore per year for Punjab. The Punjab government has to pay Rs 3,200 crore every year to the Centre for next 20 years. Over that, Rs 1,800 crore is the annual loss for procurement of grains. Why should we suffer a burden of Rs 5,000 crore every year? Why should we be burdened with this huge amount when we are undertaking the procurement exercise for the Centre, we are poisoning our soil and exhausting our ground water?I think we are actually selling water not the foodgrains. Every kilogram of rice takes 5,000 litres of water and every kilogram of wheat takes 3,000 litres. To get a cash credit limit, we have to first deposit that loss with the Central government before they give us the limit. We had paid Rs 1,100 crore before the wheat season.I quite agree with this. We have not been able to increase our revenue share and industry in our economy. We are dependent on the Centre. That is why I said, we need to remodel our economy.There are two huge areas I see for Punjab. One is our excise policy. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have opted for corporation model. We are not trying to go for retail mode, but trying to have wholesale part of it so that we can track every bottle that comes to the state either from our own distilleries or from outside. There is a technology to help curb sale of illegal or nontaxed liquor. My own feeling is that distillers, wholesalers and retailers are the same people. This is the area where Punjab should increase revenue by 25% every year. This year, my target is to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and next year it could go up to Rs 2,000 crore.Second area where our revenue can be increased is mining. My feeling is if we can identify additional mines and if we can install technology to check illegal mining, this is an industry worth Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. We are now generating around Rs 150-200 crore from mining compared to around Rs 45 lakh during the Akali regime. Although we had auctioned around Rs 400 crores of sand mines, some people backed out and there was some controversy.Punjab should also be looking at non-tax revenue as it has the lowest non-tax revenue collection in India. The rates have not been revised for 20-30 years. We would ask all departments to review their non-tax revenue.We have flagged this issue with the RBI and even the Union finance minister that there has been some unethical lending to the farmers by commercial banks. This must be checked because in order to achieve their targets they indulge in such things where they know that this money can never be recovered. It is beyond our purview to bring these banks to kneel. We have made a big hue and cry. The reason why we started farm debt waiver first with cooperative banks was that we did not have data from commercial banks.We have already rolled out some of the bigger promises. There were two types of promises. Ones which did not entail any financial liability like electricity subsidy to industry, or farm debt waiver. So we have already rolled out all these. For smartphones we are in talks with many companies. There are some procedural and tax issues with those firms because it is a service and soon those would be resolved. I dont think smartphones will not be handed out as promised.Sometimes tokenism is also important. Mahatama Gandhi was not short of kurtas. He was a barrister from London. But he never wore kurtas because he realized that 70% of people in India at that time never wore a shirt. I think leaders should be role models. Even tokenism of doing away with red beacons on vehicles was a decision in the same direction.It is not only about PDS. They have not allowed use of ethanol made of foodgrains. They have banned it for rice and maize.At this moment, if I look at the total under the MSP regime what the farmers are being paid is about Rs 55,000 crore and the subsidy bill of power, which is the biggest subsidy, is around Rs 6,000 crore. It would add up to around 15% of the total compensation which is being paid to farmers. At this moment I feel that farmers are not able to take that 15%. That would be a huge blow.We will have to carry on with it till such time when we can have farms up and running. It is not possible at the moment. Basically, you have to prioritise, what needs to be done. In Punjab, human resource needs to be upgraded in a massive way.Manpreet Badal is not a first-time finance minister, he was the finance minister in the Akali government as well. Despite that he has not been able to generate resources and has been taking the shelter of empty coffers left by the SAD-BJP government. If he cannot implement the promises made in the election manifesto and cannot improve the financial condition of the state, it is better for him to give up the post. It is for the first time that the salaries of employees are being delayed. How will there be development in the state? At the same time, he has been making unrealistic promises of making Punjab revenue surplus in next four years.The Punjab finance minister has always been begging for financial support from the Union government when the state government has not even been able to distribute funds released by the Centre for various welfare schemes. One of the best examples is the post-matric scholarship for the Scheduled Caste students where around Rs 115 crore sent by the Centre has not been released by the state. Finance department sher-oshayari se nahi chalta. Jab Raja hi mast ho jayega to wazir se kya umeed ki ja sakti hai? Salaries are not being paid on time to employees, pensions are not being distributed for months, and farm debt waiver has not been properly implemented. What to talk about distribution of smartphones to youth as promised in the election manifesto?It seems to be a totally confused government. The Congress govt totally miscalculated Rs 15,000 crore revenue in its first budget. The finance dept doesnt seem to be in the loop of the decisions being taken by other departments. I had asked them during the last budget session where they would generate Rs 10,000 crore revenue from when they do not have any concrete roadmap. The state cannot borrow more than 3% of the GSDP. The Congress government has not been able to even implement announcements made in the last years budget. They have not even cleared the DA and arrears to employees till date and salaries are being delayed every month."

Ashok Rao, general secretary of the institute asked by the government in 2015 to conduct the survey, said the failure to address classroom hunger was affecting the quality of education. The report was submitted to the HRD ministry over a year ago but no action has been taken yet.The survey conducted in 70 schools found that for a large number of children, the midday meal is the first and main meal of the day. The data showed that 83 per cent children in primary classes and 56 per cent in upper primary classes had come to school on an empty stomach.""Their parents send them like that because they have no food at home. Since the children are on an empty stomach, they fail to focus on classroom transactions. After eating the meal, they feel sleepy and fail to focus on studies,"" Rao said.The NGO experimented by splitting the meal into light snacks, such as roasted rice or roasted chana, as soon as the students arrived and another light meal around 10.30am. ""We showed that the split is possible without spending extra money,"" Rao said.The HRD ministry spends Rs 4.13 per meal at the primary level and Rs 5.88 at the upper primary level, excluding the cost of rice or wheat.According to the SSMI study, about 25 grams of snacks costing between Re 1 and Rs 2 can be prepared in 10 to 15 minutes and served.The purpose is to break the cycle of hunger, Rao said. The study also found that about 57 per cent children had mouth ulcer, indicating Vitamin B deficiency.The study criticised the practise of supplying of food materials like rice and wheat under the public distribution system centrally instead of local procurement.Sources said HRD minister Prakash Javadekar had recently asked the department of school education to work out if breakfast could be served without diluting the midday meal. But after it was estimated that Rs 7,000 crore would be needed, no further action was taken."

Several districts which were earlier neglected by businesspersons are seeing an inflow of investment due to assurance on the power front. It has also markedly changed the lifestyle of residents, with thousands of people purchasing air-conditioners.A recent study by discoms showed a rise in domestic and industrial power consumption as several industrialists are setting up small and medium units in rural areas. This is particularly visible in most backward districts such as Adilabad, Asifabad, Mahabubabad, Mahbubnagar and Kothagudem, where the land prices are cheap. Availability of cheap labour is an added attraction that is pulling in fresh investments.Sources in the industries department said that they are overwhelmed with the response from industrialists for setting up new units in most backward districts. We received more than 4,000 new enquiries for fresh investments in rural Telangana , which is unprecedented, said sources.Self-employment units also coming up in the villages with the availability of power. Youth who have some technical skill and a diploma are looking to open their own ventures in the villages. Rice mills, granite polishing, pumps and motors repair, floor mills, welding units and service centres are coming up with the introduction of 24-hour power supply, said a senior official of energy department.Across the country, only Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana supply 24-hour power to rural areas. Rural households in nine out of 28 states  Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Mizoram, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh  receive less than 18 hours of power a day.Till recently, urban areas, particularly cities such as Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad and Khammam were attracting new industries due to availability of power and other infrastructure. But as the expenditure of setting up business increased in the urban areas, industrialists have started looking at backward districts."

Tracing the soul of Tamil Nadu through Kolams and Sangam poetry is what researcher-artist Chantal Jumel has been doing for two decades. Kolams in different patterns, colours and designs has helped her explore the more abstract ideas of the philosophy that propels popular culture in the state.Jumel talked about her doodles of kolams and the idea of cryptograms, which are paintings or drawings using the written word in a picture format. The conversation turned out to be her art using the symbol of Om that she found being used as a meditative practice in Indian culture. ""Dance and traditional floor paintings of South India have been a part of my journey ever since I landed here decades ago. I love the vibrant and lesser known arts that unfold in the domestic context such as ephemeral diagrams drawn on thresholds with rice powder. Kolams attain a fresh meaning and perspective in my works,"" says Jumel, whose works titled Inner landscapes are on display at Apparao Galleries in Chennai.Jumels journey through the intricate patterns and designs of kolams and Sangam poems was challenging. In her works, Jumel weaves together the spirit of kolams, ritual designs, images of deities, mantras and spiritual traditions. ""I repeatedly use the syllable Om as a unique script character to create visual poetry. It is a meditational practice and a celebration of the universal need for connection,"" said Jumel, who is specialised in Indian visual and performing art.Jumel has used Sangam poetry as a reference in several works. Her Life Path accompanies a Sangam poem: Friends/his seas swell and roar/Making conch shells whirl on the sands/But fishermen ply their little wooden boats/Unafraid of the cold lashes of the waves/Look my bangles slip loose as he leaves/Grow tight as he returns/And they give me away/. ""I have used Sangam poems as a reference in some works while moving towards a minimalist approach to the picture that is simple yet dense. The density comes from the repetitive use of the symbol and the simplicity in the translation of ideas,"" said the Paris-based artist.Jumel has travelled across the south to know more about the social and cultural practices associated with each place. In Tamil Nadu, she was attracted towards the kolams and Sangam poetry, Kerala offered her its traditional and folk themes. ""I used a medium that could communicate my ideas through poems and drawings. The Sangam poems and kolams attain a sophisticated form. And this is what I was looking for,"" she said."

With the roll out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and with an eye on the upcoming state elections, the state did not introduce any new indirect taxes or levies, and the minister even shied away from hiking excise duty on alcohol, a staple measure to mop-up resources.With an allocation of Rs10,000 crore for the farm loan waiver; Rs10,000 crore for salary hikes; and Rs11,804 crore committed to local bodies as Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation  beyond its wage bill and administrative costs  the states 2018-19 budget had little scope for new initiatives.The budget, with a revenue expenditure of Rs3.01 lakh crore, tried to maintain a status quo by allocating resources to ongoing projects in its priority areas  agriculture and allied sector (Rs18,112 crore); irrigation (Rs8,685 crore); and road development and transport (Rs12,857 crore). The state evidently maintained a farmer-centric appro-ach given the agrarian crisis has been a chink in BJPs armour.The budget made provisions of Rs922 crore for subsidised wheat and rice for below poverty line (BPL) farmers in 14 districts; Rs1,500 crore for the flagship Jalyukta Shivar scheme to make villages drought free; Rs100 crore for organic farming; and Rs750 crore for agriculture pumps, among other announcements.Mungantiwar announced implementation of the 7th pay commission recommendations from this year. A move that will benefit around 18 lakh state employees, including 7 lakh pensioners.In a bid to woo the youth, the budget announced setting-up of a new skill development centre (under the new start-up policy) and district-level competitive exam centres. However, none of these measures have been backed by specific monetary allocations.Beyond this, the finance minister has used the limited elbow room he had to announce several small and big populist dole-outs to appease different communities and sections of the state.With elections expected to be held within a year, the sops include a new scheme to provide basic facilities in settlements of scheduled tribes and Neo Buddhist communities to a welfare corporation for 20 lakh auto rickshaw drivers and increasing pensions for the differently abled from Rs600 a month to Rs800-Rs1,000 a month.As a token gesture, the state also allocated Rs300 crore and Rs150 crore to the proposed Shivaji memorial in the Arabian Sea and the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial at Indu Mills, respectively.Many announcements, however, were mere repetition of the policies announced earlier in the year.Despite constraints, we have increased the annual plan (development spending) by 23 per cent to Rs95,000 crore this year, said Mungantiwar. This budget has tried to chart out the states direction to a trillion-dollar economy by increasing growth in sectors like agriculture, textiles, start-ups, tourism and infrastructure. The bid is to increase our growth rate in service sector.The finance minister said that through the budget, he had tried to reach out to the disadvantageous sections of society, from tribals to the differently abled.The Opposition, meanwhile, slammed the government for making a lot of empty announcements without backing them with any allocation. This budget shows that the Fadnavis-led government in just four years has got the state to its worst-ever financial situation, said Ashok Chavan, Congress state unit chief.The revised revenue deficit for 2017-18 has been reworked from Rs4,511 crore to Rs14,843 crore. The deficit for this year is Rs15,374 crore. One can only wonder how much will the 2018-19 figure get revised to considering the entire burden of the salary hike has not been accounted for.A senior BJP minister, on the condition of anonymity, said, Within the available space, we have tried to make several constituents and constituencies happy. At the end of the day, elections are close-by. For instance, by announcing Rs2,000 crore for rural roads, most legislators in rural areas can reach out to the last-mile voter."

I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."

Plates are arranged and food from a makeshift kitchen is brought here. It is then that Azhar Maqsoosi, the man behind the Hunger Has No Religion campaign begins to serve food to them as if they were his own.On Saturday, the campaign entered 2,163rd day. Sitting in his modest one-room shop, the pensive 38 year old recounts the genesis of the campaign.My father passed away when I was four years old. My mother raised me and my five siblings with much difficulty and there were days when we went hungry. Soon I realised what hunger was and thats when I decided to fight it, he says.While the campaign had its humble beginning in the city, Mr. Maqsoosi says it has now spread to other States such as Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and now, Assam. His Facebook page keeps his followers informed of the daily developments.Speaking in the straightforward Dakhni idiom, Mr. Maqsoosi says the campaign was built on goodwill. The support of volunteers and collaboration from other organisations has taken it forward. The dastarkhwaan at Dabeerpura and at Gandhi Hospital  which has entered the 896th day  is a daily affair. In Assam, it is weekly which is in its 30th week now. We have also partnered with an NGO in Bengaluru which is seeing its 505th day near Siddipura police station, he says. Dastarkhwaan in Urdu means a table cloth or great spread  apt for Maqsoosis generosity. The typical meal is a simple fare of plain rice and Hyderabadi khatti daal . Sometimes, theres zeera rice and occasionally bottle gourd gets added to the daal , just enough to satiate a persons hunger. About 60 kilos of rice goes into feeding the hungry souls every day.Mr. Maqsoosis work has attracted even the attention of Bollywood star Salman Khan. Last month, he was invited for an interaction with the actor. The Being Human Clothing representatives informed me that I have been nominated to meet the actor. When I met Salman Khan, I told him how my wife and I began serving home-cooked food to the homeless in 2012 and today we serve food to around 300 people in Hyderabad alone. He appreciated our work, he says.Fund-raising has not been a problem for Mr. Maqsoosi except in the initial days. When people realised his genuine work, kindred spirits flocked to help.My friends on social media have helped me a lot. They have always come forward for the cause. Its only about the cause and nothing else. They understand that irrespective of faith, hunger is real. No person should sleep on an empty stomach, he says."

This study confirms, for instance, that Dravidian speakers were present in the subcontinent before the Indo-Aryan speakers arrived (around 3,500 years ago). We know about this from Dravidian (word) loans into Sanskrit but this is a confirmation, said lead author Annemarie Verkerk of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.One thing we dont know is which Dravidian language(s) were in contact with Sanskrit; if we have an idea of the timing, we can make inferences on which ancestral language this could have been, said Verkerk. The same goes for contact with Munda (An Austro-Asiatic language spoken in Eastern India) speakers and relationships with the isolate languages of the subcontinent.The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, suggests that it is likely the Dravidian languages were much more widespread to the west of India in the past than they are today.For instance, Brahui, perhaps the oldest of the Dravidan family, is spoken by 600,000 people in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, and 10,000 more speak Dangar in Nepal, according to the Thiruvananthapuram-based Dravidian Linguistics Association.Because some of the Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tulu) have very long literary traditions, we can link certain diversification events (such as the split between Tamil and Malayalam) to real chronological time. These so-called calibration points help to map lexical change in the entire family to real time, and that is how we get the age for the ancestor of all Dravidian languages, said Verkerk.Archaeological inferences date back the diversification of Dravidian into Northern, Central, and Southern branches to 4,500 years, coinciding with the beginnings of cultural developments found in archaeological records.We know rice was being cultivated in south India 10,000-11,000 years ago and an agrarian society calls for communication using at least basic sound icons to articulate thought processes, said Ganesh N Devy, linguist and founder-director of the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, Vadodara. Devy led the Peoples Linguistic Survey of India in 2010, which documented 780 living Indian languages.In the absence of carbon dating and neuroscience to study structures of language perception to date language, advanced statistical models provide crucial bits of evidence that piece together the evolution of languages, he added."

An MCom graduate, he has been channelising his energy towards propagating the benefits of growing these plants and how badly the future generation would need them.A Siva, 36, of Thiruvenkadu in Sirkali taluk of the district is a progressive farmer of his locality who has been growing rice and vegetables organically. Inspired by Sivansar, brother of Kanchi Maha Periyavar, he started cultivating herbal and medicinal plants 20 years ago on his one-acre land.He also grows rare trees like Maha Vilvam, Rudraksham, Sowkanti, Kalkaram, Brahma Kamalam, Sarkarai Vilvam, Raja Vilvam and Panneer flower tree. Besides these, he also has different varieties of Sanjeevini, the plant which sustains age, such as Raja Sanjeevini, Amirtha Sanjeevini, Mrudhanga Sanjeevini and Narayana Sanjeevini Cultivation of medicinal plant is gaining ground because of the skyrocketing prices of allopathic medicines which have side effects. Besides, cultivation of medicinal plants is economically viable. I sell rare plants to many siddha doctors who have been visiting my nursery from across Tamil Nadu and even Bangalore, Siva said. He also prescribes particular trees or plants to his customers based on their zodiac sign or star. He has plants and trees for 27 stars, 12 zodiacs and nine Navagrahas. If people raise trees or plants related to their star or zodiac, they would give out a positive vibration which would benefit their physical as well as mental health, he said.Siva says marketing of medicinal plants was very important since, unlike food crop which has universal demand, they were not much sought-after. He rues the fact that people have been showing no interest in raising medicinal plants in their garden. People should come forward to raise one or two medicinal and herbal plants. Those who have terrace garden can also try. It would help stop these rare species from getting extinct, he added.For instance, he points out that anyone can plant a popular medicinal plant like Aloe Vera for commercial purpose as the profits were quite high. It belonged to Liliaceae family. Normally, the inner area of the leaves are jelly-like with bad odour and bitter taste. But, a rare variety  Red Aloe Vera  had no such bad attributes and was known to cure 60 types of diseases. It was also prescribed for fertility-related issues.Like Aloe Vera, each and every plant has its own medicinal value. We should focus on the treasure we already have to avoid spending huge money to get rid of our ailments. The government should also do something to create awareness about these medicinal plants among the general public, he further said."

We have been providing 7 kg of rice to four crore people of the State. No other State has a scheme of this magnitude, he said.Accusing the BJP of being anti-poor and anti-minority, Mr. Siddaramaiah said nobody could do politics on communal issues for long. The BJP tries to divide people by raking up issues like Bababudangiri-Datta Peetha. They do politics over the dead, he accused.The CM said his government had proposed a Karnataka-model of development and it had fulfilled promises it made during the elections.

A Saora painting is seen in the background. The art was born in the remote ranges of southern Odisha.Biswaranjan RoutSaora paintings, lately sought by art lovers for living rooms around the world, have their origin in the mud walls of aboriginal Lanjia Saora tribal homes in Odisha. Selling fast at tribal art fairs and handicraft outlets, painting lots are also exported regularly to Germany, France and the U.S. The paintings, which are pleasing to the eye and widely admired for their artistic excellence, now offer a sustainable source of livelihood.It is a remarkable transformation for the sacred art of a little-known community. Also called the hill Saoras, the community inhabits the remote ranges flanking the great Bansadhara river in southern Odisha.Talented artists from the community have clearly benefited from training and design interventions. People waste no time in buying our paintings as soon as they are completed. Foreigners are showing special interest in our paintings, says Sanjay Gamang, a 22-year-old Saora artist.Idital and iditalmar sA Saora painting is called Idital and the person who creates it is known as the iditalmar . Interesting anecdotes are associated with their art practice. Iditals are sketched to appease Saora ancestors and deities that may have caused diseases faced by the iditalmar s or the villagers at large. In Saora society, a shaman is believed to be an intermediary between the worlds of the living and the dead. The iditalmar draws to instructions from the shaman .An Iditalmar follows stringent sacred rituals by eating one meal a day for 10-15 days till the painting is completed. Before the painting is made, the wall is cleaned and smeared with locally available red soil, then rice paste is prepared as white colour for painting with bamboo sticks [instead of brushes], says Purusottam Patnaik, researcher with the State-run Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI), Bhubaneswar.Each painting has a rectangular frame, and features icons of deities, or those drawn from nature. Its said that there are 64 artistic motifs that are drawn by the iditalmar s in a painting. Some frequently featured motifs include Labasum (the earth god), Jodisum (the village deity), Manduasum (the sun god) and Jananglosum (the wind deity). Distinct paintings are drawn with different occasions between birth and death in mind.SCSRTI director A. B. Ota believes tribal cultures can be preserved if they are seen as livelihood options. He encouraged some changes that made Saora paintings easy to market.Skills honedWe sent Saora youth to professional institutes like the B. K. School of Arts, where they honed their skill further, and the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) where they received inputs for modernising. Little changes were introduced, such as painting in different sizes and using acrylic colours for longevity, said Dr. Ota. Saora paintings have also been embossed on tea cups and document folders.While some changes were made to the paintings, we kept their essence intact and never interfered with their sacred beliefs, he added.The agrarian Saoras have lived a quiet life in the lap of nature for centuries. The tribe finds mention in the Hindu epic Ramayana with Savari, Lord Rams devotee.Hardly any iditalmar remains unemployed. The artists are also hired by civic authorities to paint and beautify city walls. It takes a day to complete a 20x8 inch painting priced upwards of Rs. 700; the materials required to make it cost Rs. 100. Larger paintings are more expensive.Buoyed by their success in linking Saora paintings to the market, Odishas ST and SC Development, Minorities and Backward Classes Welfare Department is preparing other training modules. It wants to bring similar value to the Dongria Kondh shawl, Dokra relics, bamboo and paddy handicrafts, the tribal jewellery of Nilagiri, Koraputs workmanship in iron, and the beed jewellery of the Bonda tribals."

Some time last year, the rain failed completely in his region, and he was forced to look for work elsewhere.A man in the area offered him, and others suffering from similar agrarian distress, a job in Bengaluru. The lure came in the form of a loan of Rs. 20,000. I came here in November thinking I would work till the end of the summer... But, some time in February, I didnt even think I would survive till then, he says.Krushna is among 43 labourers and children rescued from a brick kiln in Bagalur on Thursday, where they were trafficked to work as bonded labourers. The group would work nearly 16 hours a day.The children would flip over bricks during the baking process. If every couple achieved 6,000 bricks by the end of the week, they would be given Rs. 300 each  or, one-sixth of the mandated daily-wage rate in the State. Children were made to flip the bricks in the baking oven. I thought if I work, I can send some money to my wife and two children (who are in his native village). I havent been able to save a single rupee, says Krushna.If distress in Odisha has seen labourers being forced into feudal servitude each year, the brick kilns on the outskirts of the city  catering to the burgeoning demand from the real estate sector  continue to see exploitation of cheap labour. According to the group, which left for Odisha on Saturday morning, their relatives and neighbours are spread across at least 12 kilns in the region  all of them working in similar conditions.International Justice Mission, which assisted the district administration and the local police in the rescue, said more than half of the bonded labourers rescued are from Odisha, and in particular Bolangir district. Of the 1,141 persons rescued, 623 were from Odisha; while in 2017, 155 of 273 workers were from Odisha.Among those rescued was 20-year-old Mithali, who is six months pregnant. While her husband and brother-in-law pleaded with the owner to let her go back to their hometown, she said he would give her a tablet and force her to continue. It was very hard work. Even if I felt sick and would be vomiting, I would be forced to make bricks, she said.But, for the rescued persons, there is fear of going back home. The traffickers and their networks continue to remain strong in their home district. Some narrate stories of their relatives, who had fled brick kilns, being threatened and assaulted. They were either forced to go back to bonded labour or pay up the loan amount.Where do we go now? What protection will we get from the traffickers that brought us here? said a diminutive woman in the group.No compensationWhile the 2017 Central Government Scheme, which enhances the on-the-spot compensation to Rs. 20,000 for those rescued, none of the rescued in this case or previous cases in Bengaluru have received the money.We have written to the Centre for clarity on how to give the money, under which head (of accounts) should it be taken, and whether it should be given in cash or cheque, said M.K. Jagadeesh, Assistant Commissioner of Bengaluru Urban. But, the compensation amount can be claimed from their home districts and we will provide certificates that say that these labourers have not been paid compensation, he added.(Names of the people rescued have been changed to protect their identities)"

The rectangular board atop the entrance has ""Salehjee Musafirkhana"" written in three different languages - English, Bengali and Urdu - one out of compulsion, one for necessity and the last for the sake of tradition.The literal translation of musafirkhana would be travellers' lodge, guesthouse, hostelry, inn... And yet it is not. It is not just about the checking in and the checking out. It is not just a stopover; it is a hyphen connecting journeys. Musafirkhana is redolent with the joy of diverse and disparate peregrinations.The three-storey building has pillars with a dark grey chevron pattern resembling a regular heartbeat. The floors are red oxide, smooth and cool to touch. The louvered sunshades, only half covering the balcony on each floor, are wood in faded turquoise. The railings, couplets in iron, flirt with the sunlight, their effect khwabeeda or dreamy. Breaking all subdued tones are bursts of red and yellow on the clothesline on the topmost floor.It is 5 in the evening. The doors of the common room on the first floor are a soothing bottle green and ajar, not unlike the people inside. These men must have just arrived from some place, dead tired. Their luggage lies hither thither, much like themselves, splayed on mats in deep slumber. The soft evening light streams in through arched stained glass windows - green, red and yellow - missing a pane or two in places.The musafirkhana was established in 1889 by Ebrahim Sulaiman Salehjee and Musaji Ahmed Salehjee of the Sunni Bohra community who had come to Calcutta from Surat's Kathor village. Musaji's great-grandson Mohammed Ibrahim Ameen Salehjee, the present secretary of the place, tells The Telegraph, ""We were billionaires at that time and had shifted here seeking to expand the business. But my great-grandfather wanted to create something people would remember him by. That is why he built this place."" He adds, ""In those days, there were no other hotels or lodges not only in this area but in all of Calcutta.""Salehjee shows an old photograph of the place, from 1947. He says, ""This picture was taken during the Bengal riots. Many Muslims from all over the city took refuge here.""For the first 100 years, the musafirkhana would not charge even one paisa from anyone. Thereafter, a nominal fee was levied.The place has 70-plus rooms and can accommodate as many as 1,500 guests. But even that is not enough during Haj season. Says Salehjee, ""Despite the government arranging accommodation for the pilgrims, those from the poorer sections prefer staying here. In fact, there have been times when we have had to put up a tent on the terrace to provide lodging. We don't refuse Haj pilgrims and during the season, we do not allow anybody else to stay.""Abdul Salam from Bareilly is here on a business trip. He is staying on the first floor, which is where all the single men check in. In the room adjoining his are four people, all from different parts of Uttar Pradesh. One of them, Khurshid Alam, tells us, "" Yahaan pe sab log apne jaise lagte hain. Hotel mein jaayenge toh ek hi room mein akele rehna padega. Yahaan par naye logo se milna ho jaata hai, baat cheet ho jaati hai."" He is basically recommending the familial ambience of the musafirkhana, the wealth of interactions that cannot be accrued from a sanitised stay in some hotel room.Some renovation work is going on on the second floor. Apart from the common room, most of it is empty. On the staircase leading to the floor above, there is a board that reads: Gair mard ko upar jana mana hai. It is the only floor that has family rooms. The notice written in English is not as nuanced: Do not go upstairs. This is the liveliest and most colourful floor of all. Children run about playing catch-catch as their mothers comb their hair, put out clothes to dry, all the while exchanging pleasantries, swapping tales. A family of seven from Malda busily tucks into a meal of rice and dal. The little ones eat puffed rice heaped on a newspaper spread on the floor. They are here to get their visas for Bangladesh. And then, like all those others before them and those many that will come after, they too will take their leave.Not for nothing did the poet write - Hava par hai ye buniyad-e-musafir khana-e-hasti.

As part of the efforts to promote paddy cultivation in the district, Rs. 80 lakh has been set aside for a project offering subsidies for labour. High labour charges and scarcity of workers are the main challenges in this field and we hope to overcome the crisis through this, said the district panchayat vice president while presenting the budget.The second phase of Poliyopoli will receive Rs. 1 crore and the project includes an array of proposals to benefit paddy farmers. For strengthening agro-production and ensuring market, product conglomeration and distribution centres will be started across the district at a cost of Rs. 50 crore.A total of Rs. 1.25 crore has been earmarked for Keragramam to promote coconut farming while another comprehensive agriculture expansion project for coordinating paddy cultivation, livestock farming, and inland fish farming gets Rs. 20 lakh. Coconut nursery at Karunagappally, State seed farm at Kadakkal, and State seed farm at Kottarakara get Rs. 11 lakh, Rs. 11.5 lakh and Rs. 7 lakh respectively. A total of Rs. 1.1 crore will be utilised for the expansion of cashew farming.Poultry sectorIn a bid to make the district self-reliant in poultry production, broiler parks will be set up and in the first phase of the project, five poultry units will be started in 20 village panchayats at Rs. 25 lakh. A total of Rs. 1.2 crore has been allocated for providing dairy farmers with subsidy and milk societies will receive Rs. 25 lakh as revolving fund."

A narrative of north versus south, them versus us, Centre versus states with splices of rationality riveted with rhetoric has come to occupy centre stage.Context crafts the contours of dissent, discord and discourse. The immediate provocation is the change in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, set up to design devolution of funds to states. Population is and has been a determinant of allocation. Hitherto, Finance Commissions used the 1971 data. The 15th FC will use 2011 data. States with lower population assert that they will be shortchanged.On Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan used Facebook and Twitter, no less, to state: Presently, Kerala receives only a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee of tax it contributes to the Union, Tamil Nadus benefit is a mere 40 and Karnataka gets only 47 paisa. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh receives `1.79 for every rupee they contribute. The new move will further aggravate this disparity.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, tagging the CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Puducherry, tweeted: This will further affect the interests of the south: we need to resist. DMK leader M K Stalin charged the Centre with unilateralism and wrote to 10 CMs, including those of the south, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, already in a face-off with the Centre, called out, There is nothing called Centres or States money. It is the taxpayers money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre, but they are diverting the money to the development of the north.Assertions aside, the actuality is that states with smaller populations and lower rates of growth in population could be affected. It is also true that use of data from 1971, when India had 54 crore people, in 2018, when the population is 131 crore, is irrational. Besides, population is only one of the factorsothers, including progress in moving towards a replacement rate of population growth, will deliver compensatory dividends.Political narratives are rarely linear. The southern states have delivered better outcomes and the anger is about the incentive structures and the lack of disincentives. The articulation and the underlying angst is less about who is getting more and more about how states that do less get more.In 1960, the government of India identified the 100 most backward districts. Over 80 of them were from the Hindi heartlandBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Four decades later, a study on the 100 worst districts by this author found that laggards continued to lag. After much was said and done, little had changed. In 2001, a study by N J Kurian found that not a single district from Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh figured among the top 100 districts of India.It is true that the Constitution obliges governments to deliver a minimum level of public goods and services. Ergo population matters. But so does governance. Poor governance is best illustrated by the level of vacancies in the fields of education, health care and security. The largest numbers of teacher vacancies are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The largest number of vacant posts for police personnel is in Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar, the hospital bed to population ratio is one bed per 8,681 persons. Bihar has 40,043 registered allopathic doctors for over 10 crore persons, Uttar Pradesh has 65,343 for over 20 crore people.Governance requires interventions, and some of the most transformative interventions have been in the south. It is, therefore, shocking to find Control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures among the terms of reference of the 15th FC. Fact is what is populist today most often than not becomes policy sooner or later.When M G Ramachandran introduced midday meals in Tamil Nadu in 1982, it was considered populist. It became policy in 1995. The 1983 two-rupee rice scheme of N T Rama Rao led to the National Food Security Act. The 1960s EGS was born south of the Vindhyas in Maharashtra, and became MGNREGS. Amma canteens are now sprouting in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as are fair price medicine shops.The schism is not necessarily geographicit is about performers and non-performe0rs. On October 29, 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the 14th Finance Commission and urged a paradigm shift in the approach. He argued that the Centre share 50 per cent of the divisible pool and that fiscal discipline, revenue collection and contribution to national growth be factored in for allocation. The argument is just as valid in 2018.Article 1 of the Constitution states, India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. This is us. That said, there is no mistaking the discontent bordering on alienation born out of a real and perceived sense of discrimination coloured by social, cultural, religious, political and economic interests. Perception is a high-octane volatile cocktail of facts, fancies, finger-pointing and frailties. Embedded therein are questions that demand dialogue, debate and a dtente of thoughts. To argue that much of it is political is to state the obvious. There is no politics without economics. shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

Millets are a naturally rich source of vitamins and micro-nutrients.Rajasthan is the top producer of coarse cereals in the country. Millets are mostly cultivated in low-fertile lands, mountainous terrain, tribal and rain-fed areas in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.Supply of cheap millets to poor households and through school midday meals will improve nutrition outcomes among the poor and also boost incomes of small farmers, the minister said.According to agriculture ministry data, the area under millets has been declining. Despite growing demand for millets from urban consumer because of their natural high content of vitamins, proteins, oils and minerals, in 2016-17, the area under millet cultivation declined to 14.72 million hectares, down 60% compared to the previous year. India produces, on an average, over 40 million tonnes of coarse cereals.The ministry is rolling out a programme called nutri-cereals under the National Food Security Mission to increase output of millets, such as jowar (sorghum), bajra (pearl millet) and ragi (finger millet) as well as indigenous indigenous little millets known as kutki, kodo, sawa, kangni and cheena. The government has declared 2018 as the National Year of Millets.Last July , Prime Minister Modi had called for inclusion of millets under the public distribution system. Following this, a meeting of the consultative committee on agriculture headed by NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand was held in October 2017. Based on the recommendations of NITI Aayog, the agriculture ministry has decided to create a sub-mission on nutri-cereals.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, millets are drought-tolerant and resistant to climate change. Cultivation of millets requires less water than rice and wheat, which makes them suitable for small growers."

(AFP)Chandigarh: An unusual spell of rain on Monday morning has cast a cloud on the wheat crop yet to be harvested in Punjab, forcing the agriculture department to sent teams across the state to assess the damage.The rains have come at a time Punjab has been grappling with a storage crisis.The state has a total storage capacity of approximately 153 lakh tonnes. But it can accommodate only 37 lakh tonnes of fresh stocks that are expected to be around 130 lakh tonnes.Of the total storage, 103-lakh-tonne capacity is with the Food Corporation of India, while the rest is with five state-run procurement agencies.From last year's harvest, 26 lakh tonnes of wheat and 90 lakh tonnes of rice are still lying in the warehouses.Although officially the procurement of the current stock of wheat started from April 1, sources said the bulk starts arriving by the second week of April - just when the rains have hit.The Punjab government has invited expressions of interest to arrange for cover and plinth space for wheat storage. It is also expecting the FCI to pick up the stocks lying in the warehouses by the time the fresh crop starts arriving.""If things work out as we have planned, we will manage to store between 110 and 120 lakh tonnes but anything over that would be a problem for us,"" said Anindita Mitra, director of the department of food supplies.According to the meteorological department, western disturbances caused the unseasonal rainfall in Punjab as well as Haryana.Amritsar, Pathankot, Anandpur Sahib, Nangal, Faridkot, Talwandi Sabo, Adampur, Sangrur, Kapurthala, Muktsar and Kharar in Punjab received the rainfall.""An upper air cyclonic circulation over North Pakistan caused this rainfall. There is another similar cloud formation over Haryana adjoining western Uttar Pradesh which could bring more rainfall to the area over the next few days,"" said a senior official in the Meteorological department in Chandigarh.While the drop in the temperature brought smiles in the urban areas, the farmers and the agriculture department have reasons to complain.""The damage would not be restricted to the standing crops but also the yield that is yet to be taken to the grain silos as there would be an increase in the moisture level in the crops. How the weather remains for the next couple of days will be extremely crucial,"" said Arvinder Singh, chief agriculture officer, Patiala.The Met department has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall on Tuesday.Sources in the agriculture department said they were expecting damage to 10 per cent of the wheat crop, if the inclement weather continued.""The standing crops have been flattened in most of the areas because of the strong winds that were raging since Sunday night. The minimum damage to the standing crop would be around 10 per cent. We are awaiting reports from the field,"" said Naresh Gulati, a senior officer in the agriculture department."

Its his love for adventure that gave him the courage to fight all odds to complete the treacherous journey, says Das.It turned out to be a life-changing moment for Das, when Indrani Chakraborty, a television producer from Naktala, hailed his rickshaw in 2014. During the short journey, she learnt that Das was planning to leave for Ladakh soon. He fished out old pictures of him visiting Puri and some places in north India on his rickshaw and showed it to her. At that moment, Indrani decided to shoot his journey to Ladakh and turn it into a film.I didnt have the money to follow Satyen Das on his entire journey to Ladakh, so taught him to shoot on a handycam. It was tough when the handycam stopped working after he crossed Benaras and someone from my team had to rush to where he was and get it repaired. Two of my associates and I met him on the final leg of his trip in Ladakh, says Indrani.Das credits Indrani for helping him in completing the journey and doesnt forget to thank some of his regular passengers and members of Naktala Agrani Sangha , a club in his neighbourhood.I drove my wife and daughter to Puri and north India and was inspired to take my rickshaw to Khardung La mountain pass, the worlds highest motorable road, 39 km Leh. I got help from Indranidi, a few of my passengers and members of Naktala Agrani Sangha. There were many challenges; every day, someone or the other would ask me to return to Kolkata. You can go till Srinagar, not beyond, they told me. But I didnt budge, recalls Das.For Das, food was as big an issue as the lack of oxygen and the inclement weather. I carried basic ingredients like rice and potatoes. I would either have aloo chokha-bhaat or instant noodles; it was more of a fight for survival, he says.But the toughest part of his journey came when he reached Zoji La pass. The roads were rough and there was no way that I could carry my belongings on the rickshaw and cover the 8-km stretch. I would offload everything on the road drive the rickshaw for a few metres and return to carry the things on my shoulder. It took an entire day to cross that stretch, but I didnt stop. I wanted to create a record of sorts by reaching Khardung La.Das, who shot his journey on a handycam, was joined by a three-member camera team in Ladakh. From thereon, there was no looking back. I returned to Ladakh again in 2017, this time with the message of fighting global warming. I sprinkled 5,000 date seeds along the way.His rickshaw has been put on display at the university campus set up by Sonam Wangchuk in Ladakh. Indrani, who helmed the documentary film, said even though the journey took two-and-a-half years to complete, it took her three years to finish this 64-minute film. She approached Films Division, which has taken the project under its wing."

Considered the biggest open-air eatery in the world where devotees jostle for Mahaprasad every day, the place, however, appeared lifeless on the day.The stalls that sell Mahaprasad and dry prasad were found covered with polythene sheets, while some priests could be seen persuading devotees for dakhina citing that donations on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya can bring them good fortune.Baisi Pahacha, the 22 steps which connect the Lions Gate of the temple to the main premises, was however crowded for sometime as devotees struggled to get khichidi that was being served by a group of servitors.For the last three days, Mahaprasad has not been prepared after a rift between Suar Mahasuar Nijog and the temple administration over unsold Abadha after delay in rituals of the Trinity - Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra on April 16.The body of cooks, which has the sole right of preparing Mahaprasad in the 12th century shrine, demanded a `50 lakh compensation as the unsold Abadha had to be buried as per the tradition.This is perhaps for the first time that devotees were denied Abadha on Akshaya Tritiya which is believed to be one of the most auspicious days in the Hindu calendar. The day also marks beginning of agriculture season and construction of chariots for Rath Yatra.I visit Jagannath temple at least once a month but never experienced such a situation. Whenever I visit the temple, I take plenty of Mahaprasad packed for my family members back home. For the first time, I am returning empty-handed. No one is above the Lord and the law. Whoever is responsible must be dealt with iron hands, said Bhubanananda Sahu, a resident of Patia in Bhubaneswar.Devotees from as far as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, who had come to witness the rituals, were left disheartened too.This is my first visit to Puri and I feel unlucky to have missed out on Abadha. I will stay back for one more day, said Sambhunath Jha, a devotee from Rajasthan. Earlier in 2015 and 2011, a cease work agitation by the cooks had deprived Mahaprasad to devotees. Around 600 cooks prepare Mahaprasad for about 10,000 pilgrims everyday and on special occasions, the number touches one lakh. Nearly 20 quintals of rice and 10 quintals of dal besides other vegetables are used to cook the Mahaprasad daily."
5aea89129855b73f522c0565,Why Fighting Hunger Is India's Greatest Challenge,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/fighting-hunger-is-india-s-greatest-challenge/story-1UBa5bIKbS094GpXnKQIAI.html,2018-04-21,"The stories from Indias hinterland on hunger are woeful in themselves. Earlier this year, a 13-year-old girl from Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh hanged herself after starving for more than two days  her father had passed away and her mother had found no work as a labourer. In the same week, a tribal youth in Kerala was beaten to death for stealing a kilo of rice from a grocery store. He had earlier resorted to begging and then to stealing; when caught, he was severely beaten and later succumbed to his injuries.More than 14.5% of our population is considered as undernourished, says the Global Hunger Index, 2017, with 21% children suffering from acute malnutrition, while 38.4% of children under the age of five suffer from stunting. This is reflected in the height of our children (children born in India are on average shorter than those in sub-Saharan Africa). More than 250 million Indians remain food insecure, ingesting less than 2,100 calories every day. As the Planning Commission put it in the Human Development Report, 2012: If India is not in a state of famine, it is quite clearly in a state of chronic hunger.Its not that policymakers dont recognise this. Along with the Right to Food Bill, the landmark PUCL vs Union of India case (2001) has seen more than 60 orders over the last decade  but this judicial activism has failed to translate into execution on the ground. This is owing to three key systemic factors. First, there is little institutional will to execute reforms that lead to better food delivery nationally, despite extensive legislation. Second, our food policy has focused on making cereals widely available even as the Food Corporation of Indias warehouses continue to leak away our agricultural surplus. Finally, the low social status of women has kept them ill-nourished. This, combined with open defecation has taken its toll on women and on children.This complex issue is not unsolvable  a variety of countries and states offer a template. South Africa, like India, has sought to explicitly guarantee a right to food, while Brazil has utilised its Fome Zero programme to provide three square meals to its people. This is backed by an institutional commitment, which has led to the consolidation of more than 31 food welfare programmes. Brazil has also allowed public prosecutors to take up the issue of hunger as a violation of human rights at the local level. Meanwhile, Uganda has sought to confer a legal responsibility for food security on the head of the household with penalties for malnutrition. It has combined this with urban centres which offer food for subsidised prices, and supplementary nutrition schemes have helped reduce hunger.States such as Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan have changed grain entitlements, while others such as Himachal Pradesh have sought to achieve universalisation of the PDS scheme. Chhattisgarh, in particular, has focused on better service monitoring while better commissions for fair price shop owners and price reductions have also helped increase PDS offtake while lowering incentives to cheat. India continues to store more than three million tonnes of grain in the open, exposed to rain and pests, with plastic sheets offering minimal protection. This is enough to feed a mid-sized European country.The challenge is one of getting more grains to the poor, while eliminating wastage and corruption along the way. Meanwhile, the leakages of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) can run up to 90% due to a range of factors, including poor quality wagons and inadequate security. Its stocking operations must be outsourced to the private sector, along with the adoption of a proactive liquidation policy. Breaking up FCI into its constituent parts should be evaluated, potentially decentralising procurement and encouraging local storage. With rising food inflation, its procurement policy should be increasingly skewed towards crops under the minimum support price policy, including pulses and oilseeds, even onions, and focused on food insecure states such as Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.There is a need to pursue a zero hunger programme with no stunted children below the age of two. This should be a multipronged strategy that focuses on improving agricultural productivity, empowers women through support for maternal and child care practices, and offers nutritional education and social protection programmes. Even as we offer such programmes for Vitamin A and iron, there are still significant gaps in implementation. Maharashtra has adopted a multi-disciplinary initiative, reducing child stunting by 15% between 2009 and 2014. The states nutrition mission has sought to develop better protocols for treating the acutely malnourished while ensuring better coordination between the nutrition and healthcare departments. India should adopt this mindset , battling against hunger over the next decade through long-term political commitment, along with policies encouraging food coupons, cash and in-kind transfers. Without such changes in execution, India will continue to remain hungry.Varun Gandhi is BJP national general secretary and a Lok Sabha MPThe views expressed are personal"

My dinner began with platefuls of mouth-watering starters. I relished Dimer Devil, Chingri Sesame Fry, Enchorer Chop, Veg Chop and Bhetki Fish Chop.What made the taste even more delightful was the combination of chutneys and sauces especially the pungent kasundi sauce which if not made according to the authentic recipe can turn disastrous ruining even the taste of the fries or chops. The star of the segment is Peas Kebab with the vegetable quite taking in to the flavour of the select spices. Another chutney that I enjoyed the most was Amer Chutney: the glassy slightly green preparation with cumin seeds giving its typical sweet and sour flavour.In the bhaja platter, Jhuri Aloo Bhaja and Karela Bhaja were crispy enough to get crunched under your teeth. The secret? Shares Swarnali, The trick is not to add salt in the beginning as it makes the preparation soggy. And this is not just one of the secrets that they have brought to the hotel. We have tried to include comfort food items also in the menu, adds Sarbani. Thats how in the main menu you have Sona Moonger Daal and steamed rice which I relished up with Kosha Mangsho and Potol-er-Dalma. Another dish which is a must-try is Shahi Rui Machh prepared with cashew-nut paste, posto (poppy seeds) and curd. Its balanced flavour went really well with the rice and daal combination.Shukto and Chicken Chaap increased the taste of fluffy golden-fried luchis. The mutton biryani was good but could have tasted better if more ghee was added to it. Another must-try is Mutton Rezala, the Mughlai dish in thin white gravy cooked with ground poppy seeds and select condiments oozing the fragrance of meetha attar and kewra.For capping the delightful spread I recommend Kheer Komola: juicy chunks of oranges cooked in thickened milk.

He will repeat the same drill on April 26 at Mehndipur village, where his host will be the dalit gram pradhan of the village.Several villagers, including many women, were seen at the chaupal where Adityanath interacted with villagers, most of whom were OBCs and Dalits, the group BJP is wooing ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The chief minister also gave away kits of Ujjawala Yojana, the scheme being run by ministry of petroleum and natural gas for providing LPG connections to women below poverty line, at the chaupal, obliged mothers by feeding kheer to a new born and said that his government would always be there for them. Village chaupals, dinner at Dalit houses and night halts in villages are part of BJPs gram swaraj campaign that was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14, Dr Ambedkars birth anniversary.He also spoke to the villagers about the Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the drinking water scheme being run by the government. Adityanath also directed the officials to hold camps to provide ration cards and gas connections within a week to all those who didnt have it. He also ordered officials to read out names of 136 beneficiaries figuring on the list of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.As soon as the chaupal commenced, the villagers unable to get their voice heard, broke the barrier and reached almost near the stage and started apprising Adityanath about their woes, largely pertaining to official apathy.The CM realizing the anguish of villagers called Pratapgarh district magistrate Shambhu Kumar along with chief development officer and district panchayat raj officer (DPRO) on stage and made them answer the complaints one by one. He questioned the DPRO as to why toilets were missing from houses and ordered for transferring money in account of beneficiers by tomorrow.He questioned DM as to why ration cards of villagers were not yet made and why panchayat level officials did not know the count of families residing in the village.Expressing annoyance Yogi Adityanath ordered holding of week-long special camps in every corner of the village and ensure enrolling of every genuine beneficiary residing in the village in different welfare schemes.He also warned that he would not leave the place on Tuesday morning after launching of School Chalo Abhiyaan without reviewing work of drinking water scheme in the village.Its a unique campaign to take the government to the doorstep of the villagers and address their concerns. It will help us create a New India that the PM has been talking of, an India that is strong and self reliant, UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey said.Adityanaths security had a tough time balancing between the chief ministers wish to allow access to villagers and ensuring that there was no security threat. Such village chaupals would continue. We would want to cover all the villages, interact with all of you, Adityanath was heard telling the villagers.Despite instructions from the chief ministers office to keep it simple, Dayaram Saroj, the Dalit lekhpal, made elaborate arrangements. Anticipating several people, Manju Devi, the lekhpals wife, started preparing for dinner from 4 pm even when Adityanaths chaupal hadnt even begun. The dinner comprised four types of vegetables, chapattis and rice with kheer for dessert. Adityanath praised the preparations before proceeding to upper secondary school campus for the night halt.Instructions have already been issued not to make any special arrangements like ACs for the chief minister, an aide of the chief minister said.Though the Gorakhnath temple of Gorakhpur of which Adityanath is the head priest annually organises samarasta bhoj or community feasts, this was only the second occasion since Adityanath dined with dalits after becoming the chief minister on March 19, the first being in June.That time the dinner at Dalit home had followed after caste violence in Saharanpur. This time it has come amid the likelihood of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party teaming up against the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Several Dalit MPs of the BJP too had raised questions on their partys handling of issues Dalits hold dear, including reservation for the Dalits.The chief minister is a monk. When he dines with Dalits, it helps convey the message about our intentions to build a casteless society, a local RSS leader said."

The rice flour parcels as thin as Kleenex hiding roundels of poornam, would disappear within minutes of coming out of our pooja room once the obligatory offering to God was made. Of course everything else she made was superlative too. Even humble upma became a treat, and we would all clamour for the crispy layers or rava that would cling to the curves of the kadai once she was done.My children are regularly treated to steel dabbas of laddoo, murukku, barfi and mysore pak by their grandmothers, and each woman has a special sweet she is known for. I have childhood memories of bowls of steaming hot, sticky kesari appearing magically post dinner, when the mood took my mother. My sister bakes bread, cookies and regularly tosses out pancakes stuffed with deliciousness before she heads out to work.Me? I have our cook K Aunty on speed dial and some mean food delivery joints on my phone saved under ICE.To feed our children is an innate instinct. From the first time you lift your newborn to nurse them or offer a bottle to quell their wails of hunger, we are programmed to want to put food in our childrens mouths. As they get older we puree and mash, coax and cajole, scream and bribe and even beg them to try new foods. And between the oats, sambar rice, dal and roti are the magical items of food we make to show the softer side of our love.I unfortunately have neither the ability nor the inclination to express this soft love through food. I wasn't always like this. I used to be interested in cooking. I even scoffed when my husband offered to find a cook when we were newly weds. After some incidents with toor dal and recalcitrant pressure cookers, I gave in. In an attempt to develop these skills I have procured an entire shelf of cook books over the years and have even ventured in to the terrifying domain of food Instagram (tip: shoot from an angle and in black and white and no one will notice the burnt bits. Even better, buy a loaf of bread, removing packaging and post as your own creation #whocantell?)Theres a part of me that wants to be that parent. Its the same part that wants to be able to cut along a straight line, Mary Kondo my sock drawer and scrapbook. But, I will always be the person with mismatched socks, poor cutting skills and a mountain of random pictures sitting on a cloud somewhere.I and my children (and perhaps one day, grandchildren) will have to make peace with the fact that I will never be known for a particular delicacy. That no one will be welcomed home to the smells of gulab jamuns frying or cookies baking. Burning perhaps. But not baking.A few years ago my mother tried to persuade me to learn how to make Indian sweets and savouries. I recoiled from the idea. I think that by agreeing to learn, I would be acknowledging that I was no longer the child who would be pampered. I would have to become the purveyor of sweets. Thanks, but no thanks. Are there any kozhakattais left over?"
5aea7ff29855b73f522bfee2,Straight out of a village,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2018/apr/24/straight-out-of-a-village-1805885.html,2018-04-25,"Vaishali Vijaykumar ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI : The minute you step from the soaring heat and noise outside into Cook Gramam, you will feel refreshed under the green cover and cool breeze. In the newly launched eatery you will be welcomed by the idols of Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar and ayyanar (a god worshipped in Tamil Nadu) terracotta horse, which also happens to be their logo.The pure vegetarian restaurant is run by city-based couple PK Senthil Kumar and Devi Umapathi, who have completed their Masters in Business Management. They also run an organic store, G Organics, inside the same compound from where they source groceries for the restaurant. Initially we planned for a cafe. Ive been negotiating with the owner for the past one year because of the organic and green environment, says Senthil who spends most of his time travelling to farms around the country. He picks up goods from a particular place only after visiting them. Ive visited over 300-400 farms and you can figure that from the distance Ive covered in my car. Having a look at the farm will give an idea about the methods of farming practices and organic growth of the plants, he explains. The couple have studied about organic farming practices for about two years.Their aim is to introduce the younger generation to age-old village delicacies. Both of us believe that certain food items and lifestyle suit only a particular category of DNA. Nature is designed in such a way that seasonal fruits and vegetables adapt themselves to it and the yield is more only during that time. For instance, mangoes are available only during summer, he adds.Going the organic wayAs we take our seat and munch on hot and crispy vazahaipoo vadai, Senthil tells us they share the recipes with their customers. Not many are willing to explore new organic products. So we thought of using such ingredients directly in the food. Now they are surprised about the variety we offer and the way it can be used in preparing a dish, says Senthil.To spread awareness, they also plan to organise cooking workshops. Through brainstorming sessions we have arrived at a menu based on what our grandmothers used to make in our native village Varusanadu near Theni. Instead of asking customers for feedback we are asking them to share traditional recipes, so that we can try it out in our kitchens and add it to the menu, he says.The menu will be seasonal. Nongu, kambu koozh, and elaneer will be added in the summer menu. We tried payasam using karuppu kavuni arisi and sukku karupatti halwa. Karuppu kavuni is 60 years old and only a few activists have preserved it. Millets have nutritional values but this rice is known for its medicinal properties, he says adding most of the rice varieties are sourced from Thanjavur and Kumbakonam. Surprisingly, Senthil had a tough time finding chefs who specialise in south Indian cuisine.Best out of wasteCook Gramam is two-storeyed. In a bid to go organic, and be nature-friendly, there are varieties of trees like chikkoo, mango, and guava planted around the 100-seater place. The chairs are made of bamboo and there are bamboo mats with layers of vetiver (fragrant grasses) as the fragrance from it is believed to calm you down. Alongside there are plants like pepper mint, and lemon grass picked up from Auroville. Weve designed the interiors using scraps, keeping it as economical as possible, he shares. Many village features are replicated into the ambiance.On a small thinnai (sit-out) outside, Senthil plans to set up traditional games like pallankuzhi, pambaram, and dhayam for entertainment. Beside that there is a push cart to serve snacks like hot bondas and bajjis in the evening. Right next to it is a small kitchen. Among the highlights of the dcor is the staircase. You can find cycle wheels, milk can, old machine parts, broken model windows, and metal scraps on it. Their take away items will be packed in boxes made of corn starch, sugarcane waste, and paper straws. There will be more outlets in Chennai soon."

(Express Archive) Madhya Pradesh farmers contend Pusa Basmati-1 is superior when grown in their region as opposed to being cultivated in states such as Punjab, Haryana. (Express Archive)Even as the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry has rejected the claim of Madhya Pradesh to be included as a traditional basmati-growing area, rice millers in the state are challenging the order. Central to their argument is that the quality of rice, from an improved variety, Pusa Basmati-1, is superior when cultivated in MP, as opposed to Haryana, Punjab or West Uttar Pradesh (UP).MP accounts for 50 per cent of Indias area under Pusa Basmati-1 and 70 per cent of the export of this rice variety to the western world (US and Europe). That itself is proof of the quality of basmati being grown by farmers in MP. Since GI certification is meant primarily to protect the quality of a product, it is unfair to deny recognition to MP as a basmati-growing state, says Ashwani Arora, managing director & CEO of LT Foods Ltd.The MP government had demanded that 13 of its districts  Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna, Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur  be given the GI tag for basmati paddy, along with the areas of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Western UP in the Indo-Gangetic plain below the foothills of the Himalayas. The GI Registry under the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, however, rejected MPs contention in its order dated March 15.According to Arora, whose Rs 3,500-crore sales company sells basmati rice under the Daawat brand, the soil and environmental conditions in MP are best suited for growing the high-yielding Pusa Basmati-1 variety. The traditional tall basmati cultivars are suited for saline and alkaline soils of pH 7-9 found in states such as Haryana. But Pusa Basmati-1 is ideal for the neutral to acidic soils of MP with 6-8 pH.Also, the shallow to deep black soil in MP is better for moisture retention. And with the main growing areas (Raisen, Vidisha and Hoshangabad) getting twice the rainfall of Haryana and Punjab, the crop gets enough water without a flood-like situation. That, in turn, also makes it less prone to pest and disease attack, says a company official.The common pests in basmati include the brown and white plant hopper (sap-sucking insects that attack between mid-September and mid-October), while diseases are mainly the leaf and neck blast fungus that infest the nodes of the plants main stem (from where the grain-bearing earheads or panicles emerge).The stagnant water and high humidity during late-August is particularly conducive to the blast in Haryana. Farmers, therefore, are forced to spray fungicides like Tricyclazole and also insecticides such as Buprofezin and Picoxystrobin against plant hoppers. All this leads to pesticide residue issues, whereas you dont get these conditions in MPs well-drained soils, the official states.The other advantage that MP has is the less sharp drop in temperatures during the October-November period at the time of flowering and grain-filling. While traditional basmati paddy or even other high-yielding varieties such as Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 can tolerate these, Pusa Basmati-1 cannot. The latter when grown in MP, hence, yields better quality paddy with more grain length and less chalkiness due to more complete filling. That is precisely why Pusa Basmati-1 rice from MP has good consumer acceptance in the western world, adds the official.But whether this argument will cut ice with regard to GI certification remains to be seen. The GI Registry, in its order, held that MP did not satisfy the fundamental requirement of popular perception as a traditional basmati-growing area for being granted the coveted tag. Basmatis GI character was derived from its supposed uniqueness as a rice grown in a specific region. MP did not fall in this specific geography, namely the Indo-Gangetic plain situated below the foothills of the Himalayas.However, the fact that about 2 lakh hectares area is today under basmati cultivation in MP (of which 1.5-1.6 lakh hectares comprises Pusa Basmati-1), and the one million tonnes of paddy from this is worth Rs 2,600 crore, makes the GI issue fraught with complexity. What will these farmers do if they are denied the right to grow basmati? Can you force them to cultivate soyabean, which yields only one tonne per hectare (against 5 tonnes from Pusa Basmati-1) and fetches a marginally higher price (Rs 30,000/tonne versus Rs 26,000/tonne)? a rice miller in Mandideep near Bhopal asks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Chile has approved coconut fibre and walnut. South Korea and Malaysia too have agreed to buy Indian mangoes. Equador is the latest country to clear Indian rice.Read | IMD forecast of normal monsoon may temper economic, political risksAccording to a new farm export framework thats in the works, the government is looking to moderate its strategy of placing frequent restrictions on agri-exports to tame domestic consumer prices.The plan is to curb commodity exports only in extreme situations and to boost farm income from trade. The government has promised to double farm incomes by 2022.Agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh recently tweeted about increasing the value of agricultural exports to $100 billion by 2022-23. The Dalwai Committee Report on doubling farmers incomes also talks about freeing up farm exports.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. The countrys net exports (i.e. exports minus imports or the agricultural trade surplus) fell to $7.8 billion in 2016-17.Read | Why a normal monsoon is crucial for Indian economy, 2019 general electionIn 2016-17, marine products, meat and rice together made up 52% of Indias agri-export basket. India also exports spices, cotton, fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar, coffee, groundnut, oilmeals and cashews, which together with marine items, rice and meat comprised over 80% of the agri-export basket in 2016-17. According to farm economist Ashok Gulati, in farm exports, the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies which he says must be addressed.New export hubs for horticultural produce  fresh fruits and vegetables  are being opened in smaller cities as part of the strategy to provide direct global access to local farmers. Trial shipments were recently sent from Varanasi and Guwahati. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, in association with our ministry, has identified 70 districts as potential export hubs, agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said.Shipments to Dubai from Varanasi contained chilli from Uttar Pradesh. Pineapples were sent from Guwahati and oranges from Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Both Varanasi and Guwahati now have complete infrastructure for exports, including phytosanitary certification.In a boost for mango exports, the US has agreed to transfer requirements of pre-shipment inspection to Indian plant quarantine authorities starting in 2019. The US has also agreed to bear the cost of inspection of mango shipments by US personnel, which will bring down the cost of exports, an agriculture ministry official said."

The convoy on Thursday morning took break at Fetri near Gorewada in order to protect the elephants from scorching sun, drawing curious onlookers to the spot.The trucks carrying elephants had stopped at Gorewada for feeding, bathing and health check-up. We are taking them for rhino monitoring and patrolling. They will also be helpful for tackling man-animal conflict. We have 13 elephants at Dudhwa camps, said Mahavir Koujalagi, deputy director, Dudhwa, who is leading the group.To restore number of elephants in the camps, Karnataka has come to our rescue by gifting these elephants. The job becomes tougher in Terai region during rainy season when forest is dense, says Koujalagi.He along with one ACF, three foresters, one RFO and three vets, besides 60 others including transporters, drivers, mahouts, caretakers, and labourers are taking care of the tuskers during transit.Apart from trucks carrying the elephants, there are three cars and a jeep for vets and motor pump to draw water. There are water tanks of 200 litres in the truck from which they can drink water. Two trucks carry feed like water melons, sugarcane, green grass, coconuts, and jaggery etc.WWF-Indias senior project manager Ajinkya Bhatkar was present at the spot and coordinated teams visit with the help of Gorewada officials. As per request by UP PCCF (wildlife) SK Upadhyay, our field formations have been coordinating with the convoy throughout the tour. We got water tankers at Fetri and water melons to avoid dehydration to animals, said Bhatkar.The convoy started on April 29 from Karnataka with four elephants from Shimoga and seven from Mysore. It took four days to reach Nagpur passing through Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. It will take another week to reach Dudhwa, says Koujalagi.As there is no shade in Gorewada, we took shelter under trees near Fetri. It is a tough exercise. We bagged the contract to shift the animals. So far, we have shifted 50 odd elephants to places in MP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, said Mohammed Rafi, the transporter.Our biggest problem is not feeding elephants or transporting them but food for around 30 men from Karnataka, who want rice and in Maharashtra and MP, roti-sabji is the staple diet, adds Rafi. Breakfast for all costs around Rs8,000, lunch and dinner even more.This is a classic example of interstate coordination. We have failed to shift elephants from Gadchiroli to Pench to create a permanent rescue unit but UP is transporting elephants all the way from Karnataka by spending lakhs of rupees, said local wildlife lovers."

The room is warm and muggy, and her face glistens with flushed longing. Sweat drips in little rivulets down the spine, as her lips surround the plump tip in a moist viscous exploration of mouth and tongue. She had been waiting nearly for a year for his arrival, and now that hes here, their union is about to explode and erupt into the most seismic frenzy of golden, luscious, sweetness. Her lips engulf the taut, juicy fruit. Shes finally bitten into her first mango of the season.Waiting for the mango season to arrive has been a ritual of anticipation way before Katrina Kaif seduced us with her unique and voluptuous handling of the fruit. In Mumbai, by February, people usually start discussing how much the first mango is expected to cost.No one is talking dozens at that time, just one fruit. By February end, the big fruit shops unwrap their boxes, unfold the tissue paper and prominently display small quantities of the fruit. You will never see the shop full of mangoes. There will be only a box or two and the phalwallah charging a premium.Its end February or March and about 600 dozen Alphonso mangoes arrive from Ratnagiri and Deogad. Street value of Rs 175 a piece or Rs 1,900 a dozen. Ive been to Devgad. Their economy is mangoes and the fruit straight off the tree is pure nectar.There is a mad rush to the shops and like most things that are in demand in India, the King of Fruit too is rationed out.Its now that psychology kicks in. Our brains are genetically wired to seek social status, and this desire triggers activity in the reward network of the brain. I must have it first, before everyone else, whatever be the price. So that I can put up pictures on social media and serve freshly cut fruit at the next party I host.I have a little more patience. For me, mango season starts when the Gujju thali joints in Kalbadevi add amras-poori to their menus and when Natural announces that their Fresh Mango Ice-Cream is ready.Im no longer a big fan of Natural, I find their ice-creams a bit powdery and watery now. But their Fresh Mango is a goopy fantasy. Hand-churned, creamy, and glorious. Every spoonful scoops up chunks of real mango, not just pulp.Theres a mad rush for those first batches of mangoes. Everyone wants to have pictures to post on Instagram.Bachelorrs at Chowpatty and Haji Ali Juice Centre suddenly get more crowded, with street side waiters whooshing aluminum trays from car to car, balancing mugs of Fresh Mango Milk Shake and oversized bowls of Fresh Mangoes with Cream.Then its amras-poori time. Its actually an odd combination. Chilled sweet fruit pulp eaten with hot, deep-fried savoury pooris? But someone back in the day decided it was an auspicious kinship, and it works.My advice, go to either Thackers at Chowpatty or Shree Thaker Bhojanalay and order the thali. Skip the bhakras, phulkas, puran polis, rice, khichdi and all other forms of carbohydrates. Just let them fill your platter with the farsaan, vegetables, daals and pooris. At least half a dozen pooris to start with. One big katori of amras and then dip the poori in amras and hit your high notes.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.Restaurants and patisseries too will start their mango extravaganzas. Mango Gateaux, Mango Mousse, Mango Panna Cotta, Fresh Mango Tarts, Mango Samosas, Mango Cupcakes, Mango Cheesecakes, Mango Brle, Mille Feuille Mango Mango Mango MangoFor me, Im going to indulge in one thali with aamras, and then head straight to The Blue in Bandra. There I will have a bowl of fiery Thai Green Curry with Prawns on Jasmine Rice, and then settle down to slowly savour their Sticky Rice with Mango."

They are ridiculing and insulting the Scheduled Castes,"" Savitri Bai Phoole told reporters in Bahraich, her constituency, on Friday.She seemed to also imply that these BJP leaders were practising untouchability. ""They hire caterers, rent utensils and deploy their own people to serve the meal. The Dalits are kept at bay,"" she said.Phoole added: ""The poor are insulted repeatedly by being reminded they are from the Scheduled Castes. I am an MP of this country but I am identified as a Scheduled Caste MP.""She suggested her party leaders should visit Dalit homes ""without prior information and eat whatever has been cooked in their kitchen, even if it is just roti and salt or rice and dal"".Her comments come at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked BJP politicians to spend time in Dalit localities and instil confidence in them about the BJP.Phoole called it a sham, highlighting the government's failure to punish people who have desecrated statues of Babasaheb Ambedkar and attacked Dalits.Asked about Phoole's allegations, state BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla avoided a direct reply.""The idea is to identify localities with substantial Scheduled Caste populations that are still awaiting development. All the leaders are supposed to spend nights in those localities and mix with the people,"" he said.""I suggest the Bahraich MP follow the (party) decision so that the poor can be empowered.""Phoole's comments back up claims by many Dalits that BJP leaders had ""picnicked"" outside their homes, eating food brought from hotels or cooked by caterers.Rajnish Kumar, a Dalit from Lohgarh in Aligarh district, has alleged that state minister Suresh Rana had arrived at his home with more than 100 people at 11pm on Monday and told him they wanted to dine in front of the house.""Everything was brought from a hotel. They ate matar-paneer, pulao, tandoori roti and gulab jamuns. They drank bottled water brought from outside,"" media reports quoted Kumar as saying.Kumar said he was asked to sit in a corner and have his share of the food.Rana, however, said it was Kumar who had requested him to eat at his home. ""Some of the food was cooked by the family and some of it was brought from outside,"" he told reporters.Phoole's fellow BJP parliamentarian, Udit Raj, had said on Thursday that the outreach programme would not bring the BJP any electoral gains but would make Dalits feel ""inferior"".""Pretending through night stay and eating food... neither empowers the Dalit families nor benefits the politicians,"" he said.""Rahul Gandhi (who started the trend a decade ago) is a live example.... It would be better if politicians come forward (to provide) food, clothes, houses, employment and treatment.""On Tuesday, Union minister Uma Bharti had skipped a scheduled meal with Dalits at an event in a Madhya Pradesh village, saying she was not Ram who would purify people by eating with them.She later apologised, claiming she had not known she was supposed to eat at the event and pleading she needed to rush to an urgent appointment elsewhere. She, however, invited the Dalits to a meal at her home in Delhi.It was Rahul who started the trend of politicians eating at Dalit homes about a decade ago. He also invited friends from India and abroad to spend nights in Dalit hamlets.In 2009, Rahul and British politician David Miliband had met self-help groups in Amethi and both had spent the night at Dalit homes, prompting BJP accusations of ""showcasing India's poverty to the world"".Sting in the taleAn Uttar Pradesh minister on Friday lauded BJP leaders for visiting Dalit homes and braving ""mosquito bites the whole night"", all for the sake of educating the community about government welfare schemes.""Ministers have to face mosquito bites the whole night, still they visit the villages and feel happy about it,"" PTI quoted basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal as saying.If a minister gets an opportunity to hold two chaupals (village meetings), he wants to organise four more, she added."
5b1b410c9855b76d57038a21,"Feeding Kolkata, one hungry mouth at a time",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/feeding-the-city-one-hungry-mouth-at-a-time/articleshow/64035954.cms,2018-05-05,"KOLKATA: Four friends sat down to hang out one evening in 2016, a couple of months before Durga Puja. The idea was to discuss a plan that one of them had, to bounce it off among the other three. Fortunately, they were very excited at the idea... and thus started their project to feed Kolkata.It started as one ATM to ladle out free food to the hungry. In a period of just nine months, its gone up to three ATMS. And, if things go according to plan, therell be two more before Puja this year.Together, the three Food ATMs, as the project is being lovingly called, feed at least 2,000 people each day. The first one came up on the EM Bypass at Uttarpanchanna Gram, the second opposite Ladies Park on CIT Road, and the third one inside Ramleela Maidan off Moulali. The fourth is supposed to come up at Bhowanipore, near Chakraberia, and then a fifth near the 8B bus stand at Jadavpur.Restaurateur Asif Ahmed and his three entrepreneur friends Prakash Nahata, Rahul Agarwal and Nirmal Bajaj decided to start their endeavour as a sort of experiment by connecting with clubs that organise Puja. With the first letters of their names they formed Pran, a group to fight for a hunger-free Kolkata. Almost every club cooks and feeds bhog on all four days of Puja. We requested them to cook some extra bhog, so that we could distribute it among pavement-dwellers, Ahmed says. We were able to convince 15 clubs, and they gave us immense quantities of food, which we were able to distribute among hungry pavement-dwellers. The gratitude and satisfaction we saw on those poor faces was the incentive that sowed the seeds of the Food ATM project.Ahmed first turned his attention towards the food that his restaurant was left with at the end of each day. At his Uttar Panchannagram outlet, he got his workers to cool, pack and refrigerate the food, so that it could be distributed. His friends got a real estate company to donate a specially designed refrigerator, kept outside his restaurant, packed with food. Twice a day, the food was distributed to the needy. We started on August 15, 2017 to emphasize the freedom factor. What is the value of freedom unless we are able to give freedom from hunger to everyone in the city? Ahmed says.Bengali New Years Day was celebrated on April 15 a little differently at the Ramleela Maidan. Members of the Entally Yuvak Brinda joined hands with Pran to start the citys third food ATM. A special room was built beside the park, where the refrigerator is kept stocked with food, water and cold drinks, to be distributed among the homeless twice each day. At least 10 restaurants in the vicinity have been sending their packed excess food to the food ATM. We just had to visit the restaurant owners and tell them about our intent, and they readily agreed. If the city restaurants stop wasting their leftover food and refrigerate it, we will be able to eradicate hunger completely, says Jami Siddique, the clubs secretary.Most restaurants have to throw away the food even after feeding their staff, as they do not have extra refrigeration facilities and also because they cannot serve it to customers the next day. They just needed an organised, hygienic and efficient collection and distribution system, which is why the idea of the food-ATM seemed so appealing to the donors. Once in a while, restaurants also give away cold drink bottles, which we gratefully accept, says Sujoy Banerjee, a member of the clubs Food ATM organising committee. Members are now going a step further and approaching households in the area, telling them not to waste food but to pack it up neatly and call a helpline number that the club has set up, so that it can be collected from their doorsteps. Even one small container of rice and a little dal or dry sabzi, which is what we are able to collect from most households, is enough lunch for a hungry mouth, Siddique says.You have to be present at Ramleela Maidan around 1pm or 9pm any given day to see how the distribution is done and to see how happily the recipients  especially the kids  are, leaving with the food packets. Khub bhalo khabar... we even get pieces of chicken, fish or eggs at times, says Monua Patra, a 70-year-old woman who comes with her grandchildren for the food every day. We share the food amongst us. God bless these good men, she says.Perhaps the most popular of all the food ATMs is the one opposite Ladies Park on CIT Road. At this ATM, we are not only getting food from restaurants, but also get excess food and cakes from birthday parties, wedding halls and party organisers, says Surjya Kanta Haldar, the points person for this ATM.This ATM is also getting a lot of donations from schoolchildren of Don Bosco Park Circus and Mahadevi Birla Girls HS School, who keep chocolate, juices and cakes on their birthdays. These happen quite often nowadays and we are able to happily distribute the goodies among the needy kids, Haldar says.Both in Bhowanipore and Jadavpur, Pran is in the last stages of discussion about starting the ATMs. The refrigerators come free from the real estate group in accordance with the agreement with Pran. The real challenge is that the club members need to network with local restaurants and in the neighbourhood to get a steady chain of donors, Ahmed adds.At each partner restaurant, efforts are on to educate patrons about the initiative so that after they have eaten what they need, they can ask waiters to pack up the leftovers. Needless to say, the idea has clicked."

As the director of Indore Zoo , Dr Uttam Yadav , maintains, The animals need special treatment to battle the rising temperature. They are already away from their natural habitat where they use their instincts and natural topography to keep themselves cool. Indore is more of a concrete jungle, so it becomes imperative to create a cool environment for the animals during summer. Even birds, that are most susceptible to rising temperatures, are getting vitamin supplements to keep their energy levels high. In their natural process of life, birds migrate to colder places to maintain their body temperatures. But special care and artificial cooling becomes important for birds in captivity, shares ornithologist Mohammad Khaliq.In order to retain the body fluid levels, the zookeepers are making sure they feed the animals with various fruits. The diet during summers is full of juicy fruits like watermelons, cucumbers and mangoes. For birds we add essential vitamins to their regular feed in order to meet their nutritional requirements, explains Nihar Parulekar , zoo curator and educational officer. He adds that fruits and vegetables that have more water and vitamin content keep the digestive tract of the animals cool. The big cats too have been getting controlled portions of meat to keep them healthy through the summer. Some zoos in other parts of the country have been introducing curd rice for some animals to help with their digestion. When enquired about the same, Nihar informs, While curd has some real benefits to humans during this season, it is not a natural occurring food for the wild animals. Though the animals have been reared in captivity, it is not advisable to change their food habits.To maintain an optimum body temperature of the animals, cage keepers work tirelessly right from 8 am to 5 pm giving the bigger animals regular showers and putting out coolers and sprinklers for others. In the morning, cooling baths are given to the tigers (Lucky, Adam and Jamuna) and the elephants (Moti and Laxmi). The bears (Krishna, Prabha, Gajni and Chotu) like to splash around in their shelters where water barrels are kept, shares a cage keeper. Besides the regular baths, khus screens have been set up around all shelters which are regularly sprinkled with water throughout the day to keep the areas cool. Khus screens are natural coolers and also give out a pleasant dewy fragrance that reminds one of everything green. The bigger animals are provided with coolers in addition to all this, owing to their body size and fat percentage, shares Parulekar. Chimps and deer, on the other hand, get a green cover to imitate their natural habitat. The zoo authorities add more plants by March to their shelters for this.Besides regulating the diet and creating a cool environment, the zoo authorities also take adequate precautions in order to avoid any instances of heatstroke. Since these animals are residing in the heart of city, we make sure to take precautionary measures during peak summer. We add Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) in a prescribed quantity to their water bowls, to keep them sufficiently hydrated. Similarly, cage keepers give a report every three hours on the status of the animals. Reptiles are very vulnerable during the season and they are closely monitored. If any animal shows signs of suffering a heatstroke, it is immediately shifted to the zoo hospital and kept in an air-conditioned area for recuperation under supervision of certified vets, informs Yadav. Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal has spread out hessian cloth rugs in shelters and sprinkles have been installed for animals.- At Kolkatas Alipore Zoo, animals are being given a special diet of summer fruits, bananas, sugarcane leaves and curd rice to beat the heat.- Special water coolers and pools have been put in place for the animals to cool off at Vishakhapatnam Zoo.- Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad has set up special foggers, rain guns and exhaust fans in their nocturnal section to keep owls, mongoose and bats hydrated."

First, he tosses her in the air, then pulls her onto his lap and thereafter, rocks her back and forth. But she is not interested, shrugs off his overtures and runs away.""My daughter cannot recognise me anymore,"" says Kafeel Khan, the 38-year-old paediatrician from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, who is just back home after spending eight months in jail.Zabrina was barely eleven months old when Kafeel was arrested last September. She used to crawl then; now she can walk, climb and run. She could barely say ""Papa"" then, now she can string whole sentences. Says Kafeel, ""As a paediatrician, I always tell parents, never miss the milestone moments of your child. But I have missed all her milestones. I couldn't even celebrate her first birthday.""Kafeel, who was assistant professor at Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) in Gorakhpur, and eight others were held responsible for the deaths of at least 60 infants over a span of five days.It all started on August 10, 2017, when the agency, Pushpa Sales, stopped supplying oxygen to the government-run hospital because of non-payment of dues worth Rs 68 lakh. Apparently, the company had sent 14 reminders to the authorities, including BRDMC principal Rajiv Mishra, UP health minister Siddharth Nath Singh and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to clear dues, but nobody paid any heed.Dr Kafeel Khan with his family.Pictures: Sonia SarkarWhen the hospital ran out of its supply of liquid oxygen by 7.30pm, an alert was put out on the WhatsApp group of the doctors. Kafeel was on leave, but upon getting the message he rushed to the hospital.As he goes over that day's incidents with me at his three-storey house - with an armed guard stationed at the entrance - in UP's Basantpur, Kafeel claims he called the head of the department of paediatrics, Mahima Mittal, and Mishra, but nobody responded.He says he arranged cylinders from a local hospital and a local agency. ""There was no oxygen available in the hospital from 11.30pm to 1.30am. Every day, 12-13 children were dying of premature birth or because of Japanese encephalitis. But on August 10, 30 infants died. I cannot deny that the sudden stoppage of oxygen supply was one of the reasons for these deaths.""He picks up his phone to show me an image from that fateful night. Four living infants along with a dead one cramped into a single warmer at the hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit. He also shows me screenshots of the calls he made to the higher authorities and the cash memos for the oxygen cylinders he bought from local vendors.Along with his colleagues, Kafeel procured over 250 cylinders in 48 hours. The oxygen tank finally arrived on the night of August 12. By then, television channels were running his images and hailing him as the saviour. But on August 13, when Adityanath arrived to inspect the reason for the deaths, he blasted Kafeel.""He told me, 'You are Dr Kafeel? You bought cylinders? You think you are a hero? I will see...' He thought I had informed the media about the mess in the hospital. At that point, my life turned upside down,"" he recalls.And before he knew it, Kafeel had moved from being saviour to villain. Charges of corruption were levelled at him; it was alleged that he was running a private nursing home and diverting oxygen cylinders from the medical college to this nursing home. He lost his post of nodal officer under the National Health Mission at the 100-bed acute encephalitis syndrome ward at BRDMC. Well-wishers warned him that he could be killed in an encounter.Fearing for his life, he left for Delhi on August 17 and stayed at an undisclosed location for a fortnight. Since he was untraceable, the police allegedly harassed his family. Kafeel's daai, the elderly helper at his Basantpur home, tells in chaste Bhojpuri how the cops would often come around at night, banging on their door, when no male member was present in the house. When she refused to let them in, they barged in and ransacked the house.On September 1, Kafeel's elder brother, Adeel, was detained by the special task force (STF) in Lucknow. Realising that things could get worse, Adeel asked his brother to return. Says Kafeel, ""I surrendered before the STF in Lucknow on September 2.""Illustration: Suman ChoudhuryThe STF took him to a government guest-house in Sahjanwa, 251 kilometres from Lucknow, before handing him over to the police. He says, ""They threatened to slap on me charges under the National Security Act. It was Id al-Adha that day, but I was not even allowed to offer prayers.""Here, I ask him, if he was made a scapegoat because he is a Muslim; the ideological inclinations of the Adityanath regime are, after all, known to all. He pauses. His eyes, restless and sleep-deprived, are fixed on the floor for a few seconds. ""When Mohammed Akhlaque was killed for allegedly storing beef and Junaid Khan was killed by random men during an argument over a train seat, I condemned them on Facebook. But when it happened to me..."" He does not complete his sentence.After another pause, he says, ""Only Yogi ji will tell you if my Muslim identity was the only reason for punishing me. Yes, after a point, I thought I won't be able to get out for the next five years, as long as he [Adityanath] is there.""Kafeel's wife, Shabista, and mother, Nuzhat Parveen, met the chief minister to plead his case, but all that Adityanath apparently told them was - ""Justice will be done.""The family remained silent for many months, but on April 9, when Manish Bhandari, the owner of Pushpa Sales and one of the nine accused, got bail, they realised they needed to expedite Kafeel's case.On April 18, Kafeel wrote a 10-page letter, explaining his role and appealing for justice. He wrote, ""I surrendered to save my family from humiliation and misery, thinking, when I have not done anything wrong, I should get justice.""The family released the letter to the national media. A week later, Kafeel was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court, which ruled out charges of ""negligence"" against him. ""I still consider those 48 hours [from August 10 night to August 12] more harrowing than the eight months in jail. I am out now, my mother has got her child back, but those parents will never get their kids back,"" says Kafeel.Indeed. Some of the families I spoke with are still not convinced about Kafeel's innocence. Some hospital officials believe he did nothing to save lives. It is uncertain if Kafeel will ever be back in the hospital; his suspension order is yet to be revoked. He says, ""If they call me respectfully, I will go back. But I am not desperate to join them. I have suffered so much humiliation and misery.""He plans to open a hospital to treat children suffering from Japanese encephalitis. Gorakhpur badly needs one. Right now, BRDMC is the only one that caters to ailing infants from UP, Bihar and Nepal. Primary healthcare centres in Adityanath's constituency are tardy, hence the pressure on this hospital. ""My hospital would cater to the needy,"" promises Kafeel, fiddling with his goatee.In eight months, his beard had grown longer than usual, but now the goatee is back. He is dressed in a white shirt, a pair of black trousers and a chequered tie, perhaps attired for a television interview earlier in the day. He has lost around 10 kilos.In jail, he found solace in books. He read Ken Follett's The Pillars Of The Earth, S.J. Whitcomb's The World Never Ends and Robin Sharma's Who Will Cry When You Die. Says Kafeel, ""My biggest lesson from these was, I should never run away from a situation.""Our meeting is interrupted by visitors. As he shares his ordeal with them, I enter his mother's room. She is busy surfing news channels. All these months, she has been glued to the television, hoping to hear some news related to her son's case. But they never showed anything on him, she complains, except when he was arrested and released.Even Kafeel thought people had forgotten him. But on the day of his release, hundreds greeted him carrying banners saying ""Dr Kafeel is our hero"" and ""Congratulations"". ""I realised I am no longer tainted,"" he says.It's Shab-e-Barat, the night of forgiveness for Muslims. I urge him to take a family photo before he leaves to pray. He stands next to Shabista, who has been stirring biryani rice in the kitchen. He drags an unwilling Zabrina into the frame too. In a few seconds, however, the child leaves their side and rushes to feed a cow at the main door.Looking at her fondly feeding the bovine, I wonder, what Adityanath would have to say.ttevitae1979: Khan is born to an engineer father and a homemaker mother in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh1998: Completes school from the Mahatma Gandhi Inter College there2000-2012: Completes MBBS and MD from Manipal University, Karnataka2013: Returns to Gorakhpur and joins Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) as a senior resident for three years2016: In August, is appointed assistant professor in the department of paediatrics2017: Gets embroiled in the controversy that follows the BRDMC infant deaths.

Yadlapur in Raichur, is among the many villagers whose children work in Bengaluru.V. Sreenivasa MurthyIts a hot May afternoon at Yele Bichale, a village on the Karnataka-Telangana border. As the temperature rises to 40 degrees Celsius, most villagers are back home from work in the fields. For 12-year-old Jyothi, however, the days chores are far from over. She has to look after her two sisters, Narasamma (20), who is mentally challenged, and Nandini.Their parents left the village two years ago to seek work as construction labourers in Bengaluru, leaving the two siblings in Jyothis care. We have a loan, says Jyothi, who understands the desperation that has driven her parents and other able-bodied men and women from nearly a hundred families in her village to Bengaluru. Many have left behind their children or old parents.Distress beltRaichur in north Karnataka, along with neighbouring Yadgir and Gulbarga, sees very high migration to cities, especially Bengaluru or Hyderabad. Job guarantee schemes such as the MGNREGA or food security schemes such as Anna Bhagya have not been able to stem this tide completely as families struggle to pay back loans they have taken at high rates of interest.Barely a few kilometres from Yele Bichale, a similar story plays out at B. Yadlapura village. Buddalappa (62) looks after his 27-year-old physically challenged son, while his wife and second son are in Bengaluru. The son and daughter-in-law of Hanumanthappa, 70, are construction workers in the State capital. They have all experienced the desperation that forces loved ones to leave their homes. With elections approaching, many of these families are expecting their family members to return to vote. Lack of jobs and migration, however, are not big election issues here, says Venkatesh, a grassroots worker with the Grameena Kooli Karmikara Sangha. Even when politicians approach them for votes, villagers dont question them about these schemes, especially the implementation of the MGNREGA, he says.He concedes that Anna Bhagya (the free rice scheme for poor families) has ensured two meals for families and reduced the burden to an extent, but one non-institutional loan can mean a vicious debt trap.Anna Bhagya may ensure food and the MGNREGA may ensure some pay. But if there is a marriage or health issues or any major expenditure, they become vulnerable. If one gets sucked into the debt trap, they are sure to land up in one of the construction sites in Bengaluru, says a village leader.In his late 30s, Shalom has returned to Chennaveera Nagar near Bichale for a wedding. He intends to stay back till May 12 to cast his vote. He had taken a loan of Rs. 30,000 from a moneylender at an annual interest rate of 36%.We do not have land here. Daily wage is minimal, and we cannot repay loans that we take if we stay back and work in MGNREGA-related work, he says.A majority of migrant workers are expected to return a day before the elections to vote. Political parties have already started sending signals out to village leaders to get them back for voting. Candidates give them the return bus fare. It is an occasion to visit the village free of cost. Though not all may come for assembly or parliamentary elections, most make it to gram panchayat elections, says M. Nagraju, who is among those tasked with getting people back home to vote."
5b1379359855b762ecebc83e,Palghar bypoll: A rural-urban water conflict intensifies along Surya river,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/palghar-bypoll-a-rural-urban-water-conflict-intensifies-along-surya-river-5167386/,2018-05-08,"According to data from the Palghar divisional office of the Water Resources Department, while 14,696 hectares of farmland was to be irrigated by the Kawdas and Dhamni dams, water will now be available for only 7,015 hectares. According to data from the Palghar divisional office of the Water Resources Department, while 14,696 hectares of farmland was to be irrigated by the Kawdas and Dhamni dams, water will now be available for only 7,015 hectares.ADIVASI CULTIVATOR Bijla Lilka has made her peace with the fact that an irrigation dam built with funds from the Maharashtra governments tribal sub-plan submerged her paddy fields in Sava village, Palghar taluka, and led to her familys slow impoverishment. They had 25 acres of fragrant basmati, Bijla says. Then the dam was built, we lost our land, my sons had to work as daily wagers for years before we started cultivating 2 acres of forest land.Last year, under the Forest Rights Act, Bijla received the patta for her forest land, a now-meagre paddy field she irrigates with a pump in a stream of the Surya river. And now theyre saying hundreds of adivasis like me could lose our irrigation because the government wants to give this water to Mumbai?The Lilkas, belonging to the Malhar Koli tribe, are among hundreds of tribal families from nearly 50 villages in the Palghar and Dahanu talukas of Palghar district who have joined a movement to oppose a 403 MLD (million litres a day) water supply project by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority to provide water to Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayander, two rapidly growing satellite towns of the financial capital, already home to over 20 lakh people.The project is set to draw water from the Dhamni dam and the Kawdas pick-up weir across the Surya river, which were to have irrigated 14,696 hectares of farm land, an area that will reduce by 46 per cent if the MMRDAs project takes off, according to activists of the Surya Pani Bachav Sangharsh Samiti that has resisted the project through a hunger strike and multiple delegations to local officials, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and also to Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao.The anger among the 90 per cent tribal residents of this belt is on account of the fact that the dam, built originally for tribal farmlands and from funds meant for tribals, never met its stated objectives but will now supply water to Mumbais satellite towns 80 km away from the dam. According to data from the Palghar divisional office of the Water Resources Department, while 14,696 hectares of farmland was to be irrigated by the Kawdas and Dhamni dams, water will now be available for only 7,015 hectares. Also, while the department claims irrigation potential has been created for 12,490 hectares, locals disagree  theres a 13-km missing link in the main left bank canal, the minor canal network is overgrown with weeds in the absence of any maintenance for over a decade and lift irrigation schemes for farmland located higher than the canals were never built.The big cities thirst never ends, but how can the state government divert water for municipalities until the promised 14,696 hectares is irrigated? asks Prakash Hadal of Veti village who participated in a hunger strike in March outside the Palghar Collectors office.If the canals dry up, it would be insult added to injury, say those who were displaced in 1990. The rehabilitation of those whose homes and lands were submerged was messy, and in that process families ended up migrating repeatedly, looking for work on other peoples land or in the cities, says Hadal, Lilkas nephew. In Veti-Varoti, a group gram panchayat comprising 12 hamlets that with a 95 per cent tribal population, at least half the families now send out able-bodied people into nearby cities for summer employment. The promise of the Surya dam was irrigation  we should all be able to take a second crop every year. Instead, more and more residents are becoming slum dwellers in Vasai, says Shivram Kakad, sarpanch of Veti.Vikas Dokphode, 39, spends 12 to 15 days at a stretch in a large slum colony opposite a festering lake in Vasai, 70 km north of Mumbai. Then his rice stock runs out, and he spends Rs 200 to return home to Veti. We sell our rice for a maximum of Rs 8 or Rs 10 per kg. Buying rice in a city at Rs 40 per kg is unthinkable.As labourers, Vikas and his wife earn Rs 300 and Rs 250 per day respectively. Nearly half is spent daily on water, food and shelter in Vasai. If our land had been irrigated, I might be able to sow a second crop instead of going to Vasai, he mulls. A landless tribal, Vikas tills 1.5 acres of forest land, barely a couple of km from the Kawdas weir. He depends entirely on the monsoon for irrigation.The big city and its fringes where Palghars tribals find work for subsistence-level wages are seen as a many headed hydra  the pollution, the grisly living conditions in its slums, its out-of-reach prices of essentials and, above all, its insatiable appetite for water. Whether its the dam on Pinjal in Wada or Damanganga in Nashik district, water for Mumbais suburbs is set to come from farther and farther away. Its unsustainable, says Brian Lobo of the Kashtakari Sanghatana which is leading the tribals protests. And while infrastructure built for tribal lands is appropriated for the financial capitals growth, all sustainable water use practices and policies lie ignored, he adds.Despite villagers protests, the MMRDA says there is no cause to reconsider the water supply scheme. The water allocation by the state government is decided after a Cabinet sub-committee decision, says Additional Metropolitan Commissioner Sanjay Khandare. We are awaiting clearances from the Forest department and work would continue subsequently. He says while the tribal protestors are being heard by Palghar Collector Prashant Narnaware, there are as many or more people who have demanded the water supply scheme.The MMRDA seeking permission to build on forest land has run into opposition too  the projects purification centre is proposed on a 26 hectare plot of forest land that was already allotted to the Gram Panchayat of Veti as Community Forest Rights under the FRA. Any construction here, including for public projects, will require our consent as per law, says Veti resident Hadal. And we will not allow it.In Hanumannagar, a resettlement village where those displaced by the Dhamni dam were given land and homesteads, scores of residents land is not yet in their names, nor even in the name of the village. Sarpanch Bandu Umbarsadas own 7/12 extracts locates his land in the neighbouring village of Nevala, while a one-acre plot tilled by his brother Devu is shown as located in Shigaon. We are not opposed to giving water to Mumbai or Vasai-Virar, but we feel dismayed that so many issues related to our rehabilitation remain unresolved even 30 years later, he says. Many fields in Hanumannagar do not have access to the canals, and depend on wells and borewells.Back in Palghar, residents of the Dandekarpada and Sagpada hamlets scoff at the suggestion that drinking water supply takes primacy over water for irrigation and industry. Suffering an acute water shortage and dried up wells, residents of Dandekarpada have already written to the talathi seeking tanker water as the summer heat peaks.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

JCP (Crime Branch) Alok Kumar identified the arrested accused as Virender Mohan Brar (56) and his son Nitin Mohan Brar (30).Police said they had recovered what the accused claimed were copper plates, anti-radiation suits, anti-radiation chemical stickers as well as a laptop, printer, foreign cheque books, fake ID cards and an Audi car from their possession.A few years ago, the complainant, Narender Saini, met Virender, who told him his company would sell the rice puller to NASA after building it. He said he needed seed money for this purpose, JCP Kumar said.Police said Virender told Saini that he would be paid Rs 10 crore as soon as tests for the equipment were successful. Saini entered into an MoU with Virender and paid Rs 87.2 lakh for anti-radiation suits, which the accused said would be worn by scientists during testing. They said tests were scheduled in Hapur, but could not be held as the place was not conducive. They also took him to an office in East of Kailash to convince him that he was not being conned, he said.The accused also roped in fake actors posing as DRDO officials, after giving them a salary of Rs 20,000, just to convince Saini about the authenticity of the equipment, DCP Bhisham Singh said, adding that the father-son duo were also arrested, and released on bail, earlier.They were earlier arrested when they allegedly sold snakes in Dehradun for Rs 17 lakh by claiming that the reptiles were rare and had medicinal properties. They were also arrested from Kurukshetra in a separate case, but resumed duping people once they came out, an official said.Police said they stayed in the posh Meera Bagh area at a rent of Rs 60,000 per month. They travelled in luxury cars with two personal security officers who carried weapons, at a salary of Rs 35,000. They wore branded clothes and sported expensive watches. With their confidence and fluent English, most people would not suspect them, an officer said, adding that they ran seven offices in Delhi.Virender ran a motor workshop in the 1990s and Nitin assisted him. But they faced financial losses and started duping people on the pretext of selling rare and antique objects such as magic mirror, rice puller and two-headed snakes, Kumar said. The arrest was made by a team of inspector Sunil Jain and ACP Aditya Gautam.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

They also told the victim that it was being used by NASA and the DRDO in advanced space research.Rice Puller is a non-existent product. The cheats coated a copper plate/ utensil with liquid magnet. Then, they used a mixture of boiled rice and iron filings to fool the victims by pulling the rice towards the magnet-coated copper utensil/ plate, said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar.Complainant Narender, who deals in garment exports business, approached the Crime Branch saying he was cheated of Rs. 1.43 crore by Virender Mohan Brar, his son and others.Mr. Narender alleged that he had came in contact with a person a few years ago who had told him about huge profits in Rice Puller testing.Virender, who posed as the managing director of a company, told the victim that he was in the process of testing the Rice Puller and would sell it to NASA for Rs. 37,500 crore if he was successful.Virender assured Mr. Narender saying the testing would be carried out by the DRDO scientists who work for him, the police said. The accused further told the victim that he would receive a lump sum if he invested money at the testing stage.To gain Mr. Narenders confidence, Virender told him that he would be paid Rs. 10 crore on the spot as token money if the testing was okay.The victim signed a memorandum of understanding with Virender after this and paid Rs. 87.2 lakh for the special anti-radiation suits to be worn by scientists during testing, the fee charged by the scientists, purchase of chemicals required for testing, etc.The testing was scheduled to take place in Uttar Pradeshs Hapur but the accused cancelled it saying the place was not conducive.They kept delaying the testing repeatedly, the police said. Meanwhile, Virenders accomplices started pressuring Mr. Narender to either finalise or let go of the deal. They took him to another companys office in East of Kailash and promised that he would not be cheated this time, they added.The complainant entered into another MoU with the new company and paid Rs. 51.1 lakh for testing, scheduled to take place in Himachal Pradeshs Dharamsala this time.However, the accused cited unclear skies and postponed the test.The victim later discovered that the DRDO scientists worked for Virender for Rs. 20,000 per month and that all the persons who had taken money from him were members of his gang, the police said.Following this, Virender and his son Nitin Mohan alias Baba were arrested.Seized itemsDuring the investigation, the RP copper plate, the anti-radiation suits and anti-radiation chemical stickers were seized from the accused, the police said.Rice Puller is a non-existent product.

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

Subham Dutta Dibakar Mondal at the hut where he has been hiding since the nomination process began on April 3, along with nine other BJP supporters; (below) the TMC celebrations after the results on May 17. Subham DuttaDIBAKAR Mondal jumps over a 3-ft boundary wall at the back and disappears, within seconds of a car stopping outside a 10X12 ft mud hut in Mainan village in Magrahat 1, South 24 Parganas district, on 9 am, May 17. He returns 15 minutes and several phone calls later. A slender man of 30, dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers, nursing a gun wound in his leg, Dibakar smiles nervously, saying he had mistaken the occupants of the car for people who had been threatening him. I thought they had come, he says, entering the mud hut with cracked patches and a kuchcha roof, and turning on a television set.The old TV, kept on a stool, was arranged by Dibakar recently to track developments since the violence-ridden panchayat poll process began in West Bengal. Dibakar is a candidate of the BJP, which is contesting all the three panchayat samitis in Lakshmikantpur, located 60 km from Kolkata. He was shot in the right leg when he refused to withdraw his nomination, and has been hiding out here since then along with nine others, all BJP supporters. With fields of grains and pulses spread all across and the lush-green growth around them, Mainan appears a picture of serenity. But tension is running high, and like Dibakar, other BJP candidates of this village have taken shelter in mud houses like the one he is occupying. In all, Magrahat 1 block had 11 BJP contestants in the panchayat polls.South 24 Parganas district has 4,884 gram panchayat seats, of which elections were held on 3,058 seats, the remaining having been won uncontested by the TMC. Between April 3, when the nomination process began, and May 14, there were several instances of violence, leaving more than 10 injured. Dibakar was shot on April 5, when he was leading a group of BJP workers to file nominations. Says BJP district president Abhijeet Das, Dibakar was being threatened to withdraw his nomination. When he refused to do so, a group of TMC goons attacked him and he was shot from point blank range.Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384.Denying this, TMC local leader Subhasish Chakraborty says, Losers always have some excuse or the other. The BJP as a party has no base in South 24 Parganas. As far as Dibakars bullet injury is concerned, it was a fallout of a group fight. They are unnecessarily blaming the TMC. People of Bengal are happy with us and hence they voted (for us). Counting is on today at the Usthi Block Development Office, about 7 km from the hut he is in. But Dibakar says he doesnt dare venture out to check.Bijoy Bayen, 36, who is staying along with Dibakar, says he has picked up cooking since the job of feeding the party mates fell upon him. I had no idea about cooking, but now that we are living like refugees, I have learnt, says Bayen, who adds that he too has been threatened as he is a close aide of Dibakars. Dibakar, meanwhile, keeps switching between news channels, and making phone calls.Around 8 am, TV channels start reporting that some panchayat poll results have come. Quickly, Dibakar turns the set off, and starts reading a Bengali newspaper from among the several lying around.Dibakar explains that he is not too keen to know the results. No one was allowed to vote here after 9 am (on polling day). It was all rigged, counting is just a formality.Shankar Mondal, 29, who has been listening to the conversation, says its too scary to contest on a ticket other than the TMCs in West Bengal. I have been hiding for several days for my survival. I keep moving from one house to another, he says, just before stepping out to relieve himself after tying a handkerchief around his face.Before he has his breakfast around 10 am  usually roti-sabzi  Dibakar offers prayers at the idols of lords Laxmi and Narayan he has placed in a corner. He picks up a party pamphlet lying on the floor, puts some prasad of nakul dana (sweet makhana) on it, and says some mantras. However, this daily puja routine, lasting him around 5 minutes, is disrupted when Dibakar gets a call on his mobile.He answers the phone but keeps silent until he is sure its his family on the other side. They told him once again to stay safe, he says later. Hanging up the phone, Dibakar serves himself breakfast in an aluminum plate. Eating the food, he talks about how great a cook his wife is. Not a day goes by without me eating fish and rice at home, but here we will have chingri maach (prawn) and rice after so many days for lunch today, he says.However, its not safe yet to return home, Dibakar adds. My days start with a call to my family to find out if they are fine and end with sleepless nights.Breakfast done, he again decides to sit in front of the TV to get an update on the panchayat polls. The results of the Lakshmikantpur panchayat samitis come in around 2 pm. All the three seats go to the TMC. Dibakar shows no reaction, saying, None of the opposition parties could station their polling agents in booths on election date. No one was allowed in the vicinity. People didnt come to vote because there was continuous bombing in the area. The TMC took all the seats through rigging.Around noon, Dibakars friend Kali comes with his two-year-old son. As the friends play with him, for a while, tension seems to leave the hut. Meanwhile, the TV is on, updating the count. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 913 zilla parishad seats, elections were held on 579; 354 go to the TMC and only 15 to the BJP.As the day draws to a close, a stoic Dibakar says, I was threatened, received a bullet injury, but none of the top party leaders visited me. Now that everything is done counting too has been completed we are still running from one place to another to save our lives. Local goons of the ruling party are watching us. We are scared because they can easily outnumber us and attack. However, Dibakar asserts, he wont cow down. I have been in active politics since 2016 and will not leave until the Lok Sabha elections of 2019.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

MudurThe archaeological site near Lahuradewa lake in eastern Uttar PradeshNew Delhi: Fossils of microscopic algae found near an ancient lake in Uttar Pradesh suggest that people cultivated paddy there about 9,000 years ago, adding fresh evidence for the independent domestication of rice in China and India, scientists have said.The scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP) in Lucknow say their study of the algae microfossils called ""diatoms"" associated with paddy fields point to the presence of cultivated rice near Lahuradewa lake in eastern Uttar Pradesh about 9,000 years ago.A team of Chinese and Canadian archaeologists had two years ago described plant remains, including residues of rice, dated to between 9,000 and 8,400 years ago, representing the earliest evidence for domestication of rice in the Yangtze valley.""The evidence from Lahuradewa supports earlier suggestions that domestication of rice occurred in parallel in China and India,"" Rakesh Tewari , a senior archaeologist and former project director of the Archaeological Survey of India's excavations at Lahuradewa told The Telegraph.Tewari, who was not associated with the new BSIP study, said differences of a few hundred years from a single site should not be used to claim domestication of rice may have taken place in India even before it did in China.Paleobotanist Biswajit Thakur and his colleagues at the BSIP analysed the distribution of diatoms across excavated areas around the Lahuradewa lake which has long been recognised as a site of ancient cultivation.""We looked specifically at the distribution of diatoms associated with paddy fields - these algae are like signatures for rice cultivation,"" Thakur told The Telegraph. ""The rise and fall in the populations of diatoms coincides beautifully with conditions conducive and not conducive for rice cultivation.""Their study, published this week in Current Science, published by the Indian Academy of Sciences, has found increases in diatoms along the margins of the lake when environmental conditions were favourable for paddy cultivation and decreases when conditions were unfavourable.The earlier excavations by Tewari and his colleagues had already recovered phytoliths, or fossil remains of rice plants, from around the Lahuradewa lake area dated up to 8,300 years ago.The BSIP researchers believe the lake's margins with between 10cm and 20cm deep water were used as paddy fields. ""Even today, we see lake margins used for paddy cultivation,"" Thakur said.Two years ago, a study by scientists at the University of Cambridge and the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, had shown that farmers in the Indus valley civilisation had independently domesticated rice as an annual summer crop.""Rice is a staple across eastern and southeastern Asia and the subcontinent - it is possible the domestication process occurred at multiple sites,"" Tewari said."
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The aroma of fuming kebabs and fried chicken will take you places while your eyes feast on stacks of vermicelli, dates and breads sold in small street stalls. The medley of cultural influences is richer than the food served. As par t of the Ramzan celebrations, Raipur Times takes you to a food walk in one of the oldestlanesin the city. With Badi Masjid in the backdrop, the outer lane (Urdu Bazaar Road) is lit up with kebab shops. Among many, Lalus and Qureshis stall is 80 years old. The slender and juicy kebabs are served hot off the griddle and put you in the mood. These are the softest kebabs that youll find and full of flavour. Ours is a family business and for generations we are selling kebabs here. During iftar time, we serve over 200 people from different communities. During Ramzan time, we reduce our prices to half so that more people can come and savour kebabs here, says Qureshi Mian, owner of the shop. You can eat kebabs here at Rs 40 a plate which comes with four kebabs.Just ahead of Bilal, head here for some serious feasting. Pieces of meat are cooked for hours along with saffron flavoured rice to give you a place of delicious biryani, without which your food trail will be incomplete. The Mirchi Masala Biryani is a must try at Mota Pehelwaan which is a 100-years old Biryani seller in the area. The mirch masala biryani is aOriginally from Uttar Pradesh, youll find his food carts dotted across the lane selling a blush pink drink popularly called Pyaar Mohabbat Maza sold in Rs 30. This refreshing concoction is a mix of watermelon, milk and Rooh Afza. It's fragrant, its light and its got these gorgeous chunks of watermelon and it is a must have during summer and Ramzan, shares the seller of the drink Nizam Khan.The nihari at Bilal is so sublime that its absolutely worth elbowing your way to get here. A plateful of nihari with moti roti is very popular among the people. The meat is slow-cooked for hours to make it delicate and tender. It is then simmered in gravy with a mix of spices handed by our grandmother we served it with squeeze of lime juice and green chillies. We also serve haleem.

(Representational) Officials said that the family in Mangargaddi village did not have a ration card, but added that they were probing whether a formal application for the same had been submitted. (Representational)A 58-year-old woman allegedly died of starvation at a village under Dumri Block of Giridih district in Jharkhand. District officials said the womans family did not have a ration card but are probing whether a formal application for the same had been submitted.According to officials, Savitri Devi, a resident of Mangargaddi village in Dumri, died on Saturday. However, they were only informed about the death after her younger son, Hulas Mahato, reached home on Sunday. An investigation is underway to probe Devis death, they said.Executive Magistrate and Dumri Block Development Officer (in-charge) Rahul Dev said, We reached her home on Sunday afternoon. The administration was not informed about it earlier. Prima facie, there was no food in the house. The family did not have ration card. We are probing whether an application was submitted and, if so, whether it was properly processed.Officials are also probing as to why the woman, or any other member of her family, was reportedly not getting any other government benefits.Ram Prasad Mahato, mukhiya (village headman) of Chainpur Panchayat, under which Mangargaddi falls, said, Savitris elder daughter-in-law had come to me about two months ago for verification of her ration card application. I had verified it. But I dont know whether she submitted it in the block office or not.Mahato claimed that his mother has not been receiving pension in the last three years despite being selected under a scheme for widows in 2014. He said that after his fathers death in 2010, the little produce they got from a small family-owned farm barely lasted for two-to-three months. And the partly stipend he was earning through an apprenticeship program in Uttar Pradesh was also not sufficient to feed the family, he added.My elder brother was not getting salary regularly, while I was getting paid stipend that was too little. The last I talked, the food grain had been managed from a self-help group in the village. But it too had finished-off and for nearly three days, no food was cooked in the house, he told The Indian Express.Mahato said his elder brothers wife, her three children, his wife and their daughter lived together with his mother.Following Devis death, a local dealer has arranged about 50 kg of rice for the family of eight, he said. The family has requested the administration to not send the body for postmortem but cremate it.A womens self-help group also provided three kgs of rice for the family before Devi died.Sunita Devi, one of the core group members of Maa Kali Swayam Sahayata Samooh (Maa Kali Self-Help Group), said, Around eight days ago, Savitris elder daughter-in-law had called me asking if we could be of some help, as there was no food grain in the house. We managed to provide her three kgs at that time. We were again supposed to meet on Tuesday, this week, and could have arranged for more. But, in the meantime, Savitri died. With a family of seven to feed that amount was obviously not enough.Meanwhile, Food and Supplies Minister Saryu Roy has directed the Deputy Commissioner for a detailed report by a senior official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b2043ab9855b70ae8cacec2,Available  accessible  but not stable,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/available-accessible-but-not-stable/article24083353.ece,2018-06-05,"The right to food is a well established principle of international human rights law. It has evolved to include an obligation for state parties to respect, protect, and fulfil their citizens right to food security. Our current understanding of food security includes the four dimensions of access, availability, utilisation and stability. As a state party to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, India has the obligation to ensure the right to be free from hunger and the right to adequate food.From availability to accessBroadly speaking, attitudes towards food security in India can be divided into two generations subsequent to Independence. While the demarcation is far from exact, it indicates how the importance given to different elements of food security altered over time.The years post-Independence were turbulent for India. Memories of the Bengal famine remained fresh and fears of a food shortage were rampant. Hunger was thought to be a function of inadequate food production. In 1974, the World Food Conference defined food security primarily in terms of production  as the availability at all times of adequate world food supplies.It is arguable that the framing of food security in quantitative terms sparked Indias determination to initiate the Green Revolution to boost food production. While the programme achieved dramatic increases in rice and wheat production in some parts of the country, its devastating environmental impact has also rightly been critiqued.Two occurrences over the 1980s and 1990s set the stage for what we understand as food security in India today. The first was when the Supreme Court dramatically expanded the ambit of rights that citizens could claim against the state. While no explicit right to food could be made out, there was an increased mention of food as being among a cluster of basic rights integral to human dignity. The second was a shift of the frame from the problem of availability to the problem of access.The 1980s and 1990s saw an increasing acknowledgement that Indias focus on increasing food supplies was falling short of actually ameliorating hunger. Even as the data showed that India had transformed from a food deficit nation to a food surplus one, seminal research by Amartya Sen and others revealed that hunger and food security were tied to the issue of access  that is, in spite of ample quantities of grain, and a variety of government efforts such as the Public Distribution System, people were dying of starvation because they were unable to physically or financially (or both) reach this food. This view of food security was mirrored at an international level too. In 1996, the World Food Summit stated that food security was achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food.This focus on access culminated in India in a 2001 case brought by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, in which the Supreme Court evolved a right to food and read it into the right to life provisions of the Constitution. Following that, a host of court orders and directions ultimately resulted in the 2013 National Food Security Act (NFSA), which has been lauded for guaranteeing a quantitative right to food to all Indians. However, the NFSA suffers from serious lacunae in its drafting, which severely undermine its stated objective of giving legal form to the right to food in India.Assessing the Food Security ActThe NFSA surprisingly does not guarantee a universal right to food. Instead, it limits the right to food to those identified on the basis of certain criteria. It then goes on to further restrict the right to 75% of the Indian population. It also specifies that a claim under the Act would not be available in times of war, flood, drought, fire, cyclone or earthquake (notably, it is within the Central governments remit to declare whether such an occassion has arisen). Given that a right to food becomes most valuable in exactly these circumstances, it is questionable whether the Act is effective in guaranteeing the right that it is meant to.Another problematic aspect of the NFSA is its embrace of certain objectives that are to be progressively realised. These provisions include agrarian reforms, public health and sanitation, and decentralised procurement, but they make no mention of the need to reconsider fundamental assumptions about our agricultural systems and look at food security in a more comprehensive manner. It is arguable that the rubric of progressive realisation actually retards food security reform in the country. This is because some of the elements mentioned under this head are already incorporated in laws and policies at the State and national levels. Demarcating them as obligations to be realised progressively will lead to counter-intuitive results where the States will simply refrain from doing any more than what the NFSA explicitly requires them to do.Worryingly, the framing of the NFSA as being the final word on government commitments to provide food security to citizens might instead have the result of limiting the courts with respect to how far citizen entitlements can be extended. This fear was borne out in the recent Swaraj Abhiyan cases that address the impact of government failures in tackling consecutive drought years in India. While the court took a strong stance in ordering the executive to implement the provisions of the NFSA, it was reluctant to go beyond the provisions of the NFSA in terms of what it could order the government to give citizens. Given that the NFSA predominantly mentions just rice and wheat, and that too for only some citizens, this has worrying implications.Finally, while the NFSA addresses issues of access, availability and, even tangentially, utilisation, it is largely silent on the issue of stability of food supplies  a startling omission given Indias vulnerability to climate change impacts, to name one impending threat to food security.Thus there is a need to frame a third generation food security law and recognise and mainstream issues including increasing natural disasters and climate adaptation. Such a framework would robustly address the challenges facing the countrys food security across all four dimensions and make a coordinated effort to resolve them instead of the piecemeal efforts that have characterised such attempts so far.Food security brings together diverse issues such as inequality, food diversity, indigenous rights and environmental justice. Given the current crises in India, it is time we prepare a third generation right to food legislation that recognises that a climate-as-usual scenario no longer exists. Such a legislation would ideally be rooted in the principle of a right to food security in its true spirit and not merely as a sound bite.Shalini Iyengar is faculty with School of Law, Environment and Planning at Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru, and Balakrishna Pisupati is Chairperson, Forum for Law, Environment, Development and Governance"

The researchers, Max Friedrich from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and Delhi-based freelancer Bonolata Sen, will carry out the study to know why farmers burn stubble and the scientificallyviable alternatives and how behavioural change interventions could be adopted in containing the trend.The study will be started in the first week of July. The researchers held talks with farmers, agriculture scientists and other stakeholders on Thursday in Bathinda Every year when stubble is burnt in the fields after paddy harvest in November, complaints of air quality turning very poor in Delhi start pouring in. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already asked the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to contain stubble burning by imposing fines on farmers and make alternative arrangements to manage crop residue.The study proposes to understand behaviours related to crop residue burning in Punjab. Why some farmers burn crop residue and why others do not? The study will be designed using the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-regulation (RANAS) approach. Combining leading theories of health behavioural psychology, the RANAS approach postulates that behaviour is primarily driven by peoples mindsets and perceptions, Bonolata told TOI.The design of this research study will be outlined soon after listening to the views of varied sections of society and what do they think about stubble burning, the challenges to address it and the research plan to gather scientific evidence of preferred practices and beliefs related to the issue, said KVM executive director Umendra Dutt."

However, if the low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal intensifies into a depression, it can push the monsoon current towards Bihar. However, no change has been witnessed in the low-pressure area since Sunday, which means it is stagnant, said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, department of environmental science, Central University of South Bihar and secretary of Indian Meteorological Society, Bihar.Meanwhile, the IMDs Patna office has predicted widespread pre-monsoon rainfall in several districts of state on Tuesday and Wednesday and scattered rainfall from Thursday onwards.Weathermen have attributed the prevailing weather conditions to an east-west trough that runs from Punjab to the centre of a low-pressure area over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.The late arrival of monsoon adversely affects rice crops. Although with scientific advancements, enough awareness has been created on how to save the rice seeds from damage. IMD, weather and agricultural scientists from Bihar have also planned to conduct an awareness programme by the end of June to create awareness about sustainable ways of farming when the onset of monsoon is late. It includes information on certain rice seeds that sustain and grow in less amount of water, Sarthi said."

Congress provided farm loan waiver in 2006 and was now doing so in Punjab and Karnataka, he said hinting it would be replicated countrywide.Like Modi, I will not give any false promises and I have come here to tell you that if we are elected we will do all that is needed to rebuild your confidence, he said while interacting with farmers. Rahul did not give a speech but directly started a dialogue with the farmers that lasted over 20 minutes.Modi government is dishonest, it only cares for the 15 rich, top industrialists and has provided them Rs2.5 lakh crore corporate loan waiver. It will not do anything for the poor farmers, he said answering a question from college student Sagar Khobragade. The student asked Rahul how the Congress would address unemployment problem while pointing out Modi government had failed to provide promised 2 crore jobs to youth.Rahul said food processing units at village levels could provide jobs to farmers children and better price for the produce. You have to first elect the Congress, he quipped.He landed by helicopter from Nagpur, travelling 100 kms, and first visited the house of HMT rice inventor and researcher Dadaji Khobragade who passed away on June 3. Then he started an interaction with a modest crowd comprising some farmers and mostly party workers in the region reeling under farmer suicide crisis for the last two decades.Has Modiji ever offered to take questions from public like this, asked Rahul and drew an immediate applause. He said his request to make petrol, diesel cheaper by including them in GST list was not acceptable to Modi. Because he wants to rob money from your pockets and generously pass it on to Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. These two have walked away with Rs 35,000 crore of your money. While this much money was lavished on them, how many jobs have these two provided, Rahul questioned.With the chaupal pe charcha, the Congress is trying to re-establish support for the party in what was once its impregnable fort.Khobragade, 67, developed nine rice varieties in his modest farm and home. The high yielding HMT variety revolutionized paddy cultivation in the country. Ironically, he struggled with poverty all his life and was even robbed of credit for developing the HMT breed.After Khobragades death, politicians have started rushing to his village and offering sympathy and largesse in the form of money to his only son Mitrajit and daughter-in-law Raibai. They are marginal farmers with a small holding.In all Rahul took only three questions. The other two were asked by Ramchandra Deshmukh, a middle-aged farmer, and a woman, Avisha Rokde, a Congress gram panchayat member from Bhisi village.Top Congress leaders, AICC general secretary and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, MPCC president Ashok Chavan, AICC general secretary and Maharashtra in-charge Mohan Prakash, leader of opposition in Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, deputy chairman of legislative council Manikrao Thakre, former MPs Naresh Pugalia, Marotrao Kowase, Nana Patole and deputy leader of assembly Vijay Wadettiwar were among the large number of party leaders who made it clear the whole event was aimed at scoring some political points though it was around death of a prominent Dalit farmers untimely death.Questions Rahul Gandhi took on WednesdayModi promised 2 crore jobs to the youth. Not only he failed to keep that promise, but many people have lost jobs in last four years. What will you do if you win in 2019?Sagar Khobragade | 20Rahul: We will work on agriculture, food processing industry network, infrastructure like roads, and marketers to help farmers.Farmer suicides are unending. How will you stop them?Ramchandra Deshmukh | 50Rahul: By building farmers confidence in themselves, loan waivers are a temporary relief. Increasing price of farm produce will give more income to farmersFarmers do not seek loan waiver, they want better prices for produce. How can you ensure this?Avisha Rokde | 40Rahul: Providing opportunities of value addition, government funds for farm infrastructure and better remunerative prices for farm produce will be the way to go for solving agrarian crisis."

(File) After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. (File)Even as it is struggling to get sugar mills to discharge over Rs 12,500 crore worth of cane dues to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP administration in Uttar Pradesh can take credit on another front: Procurement of wheat by government agencies in the state for the current 2018-19 rabi marketing season has almost touched 50 lakh tonnes (lt) and looks all set to surpass the all-time-high 50.63 lt achieved in 2012-13.We will be closing procurement operations on June 15. With two more days to go and also more updated information for the previous days, the total figure will cross the 2012-13 record, a senior official from the UP Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Indian Express.He said that the state and central agencies had procured the roughly 50 lt of wheat  from the 2017-18 crop, harvested and marketed after April  from over 10 lakh farmers. We opened 5,000-odd centres in 75 districts of the state and ensured that the farmers got the official minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,735 per quintal. In addition, we gave them a Rs 10/quintal incentive for grain that was brought to the centres after proper cleaning and drying, he added.After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat from UP had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. Even during the last marketing season, official procurement touched 37 lt, as against only 8 lt during 2016-17. This year, we set a target of procuring 50 lt out of the states total 350 lt wheat production. That target will be exceeded, the official pointed out.Meanwhile, wheat procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies across India had, based on information received as on Wednesday, reached 353.59 lt. This is again more than the original target of 320 lt, though below the 381.48 lt high of 2012-13. The higher-than-expected procurement this time comes in the wake of the countrys wheat output hitting a record 98.61 million tonnes (mt), surpassing the 2016-17 crop size of 98.51 mt.Besides wheat, government agencies had, as on June 11, also procured 356.81 lt of rice during the ongoing 2017-18 kharif marketing season (October-September). This is already the second highest procurement after the previous seasons 381.06 lt. For rice, too, the production of 111.62 mt in 2017-18 was the highest ever achieved by the country, ahead of the previous years 109.70 mt.Guaranteed MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy has made the two grains the preferred growing option for farmers, especially in a scenario where prices of other crops have been prone to extreme market fluctuations. With roughly 36 per cent of the countrys wheat and 33 per cent of paddy being bought by government agencies, the market for these crops has practically ceased to be significant. That, in turn, means putting more pressure on the already stretched storage capacities of FCI and other state-run agencies.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Manoj KumarPatna: Matthew Morell, the director general of International Rice Research Institute, Manila, The Philippines, on Wednesday had a meeting with state agriculture minister Prem Kumar and other senior department officials.The participants discussed the avenues through which the premier research institute could help Bihar to enhance rice productivity and help the state in providing seeds of paddy of such a quality which could withstand vagaries of weather.Morell said: ""We see a very good opportunity to work with Bihar farmers and universities in the state for enhancing rice productivity and add more value to the crop.""The institute had introduced seven new varieties of paddy in the state last year, and this year too it has introduced two new varieties ahead of the kharif season when paddy cultivation is mainly done in the state.The institute is going to work in close cooperation with the Bihar Agriculture University and the state agriculture department for collecting data from the field to assess the outcome of its efforts by introducing new varieties of paddy. The international institution has also set up its south Asia regional centre at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said he urged the institute team to provide paddy varieties to Bihar which could withstand the vagaries of nature as Bihar had 21 flood-prone districts in its northern parts and 17 drought-prone districts in the southern region.""I have been informed that International Rice Research Institute has developed a paddy variety whose plant does not get damaged even if it remains under water for 15 days. This could be very useful for north Bihar districts and urged the team to develop such a variety which could survive up to one month despite being under water. Similarly, I drew the team's attention towards the water problem in south Bihar districts and requested to provide varieties which could give good productivity even when there is a scarcity of water,"" Prem said while sharing the details of the meeting.Paddy cultivation is being done in 33 lakh hectares in Bihar and the state produced around 71 lakh metric tonnes of rice last year. Productivity-wise the state stands at sixth place in the country. Even within the state there are wide variations in productivity and while it is around 2,000kg per hectare in the Bhojpur region, its level comes down to around 1,000 kg per hectare in the Bhagalpur region.The minister also announced that the agriculture department would provide land to the International Rice Research Institute in its farms both in north and south Bihar so that the institute could demonstrate the benefits of using its paddy varieties among farmers."

The film documented the journey of a rickshawala, 46-year-old Satyen Das, from Kolkata to Ladakh.I have had many job offers since the award, and even before that as people in this area (Naktala) know about my adventures, Das, who is fluent in Bengali, Hindi and English, told The Indian Express. I have been offered money to open a stall of my own. Shop owners have offered to hire me. But I like my life. I own my own rickshaw and ply it the way I want. I dont have a boss, I am not accountable to anyone and I can go travelling whenever I want.At 9 am every day Das arrives at the Gitanjali Metro station at Naktala and leaves for home 12 hours later. A shack near Naktala is home to Dass family  his wife Meenu works as a maid and 14-year-old daughter Sukanya studies in a government school. It is also home to Dass vast reputation  a neat folder will all the certificates from various government departments he has ever received and a collection of around 100 stamped police permits from all over India.I want to become a mountaineer, Sukanya said to the approving gaze of her father. She will climb Everest one day, said Das. The family climbs a mountain every day with Das earning around Rs 300 each day and Meenus monthly Rs 5,000. For the award-winning film, Das got Rs 15,000 as remuneration. His travels had been taking him across the country.In 1995, after years of work and saving money, he travelled through much of India in 403 days  from Kolkata to Puri in Orissa and then from there going down south then back up through Rajasthan to Jammu on a cycle. It set the tone of Dass annual adventures.In 2007, he took Meenu and Sukanya, who was just over a year old then, to Puri (Odisha) on his rickshaw. We carried a sack of potatoes and rice and would cook on the journey and eat. We had only Rs 1000 in cash and used it to fix tyre punctures and repairs which needed to be done, said Das. We caught sleep at railway stations, schools and even in peoples homes when they allowed us shelter. Some of them would give us food and money too when they heard our story. People are very kind.The next year he peddled to Rohtang Pass (altitude 3,978 m) and found his way to the Limca Book of Records. It was sheer luck that brought Indrani Chakrabarti and Das together. I had taken a ride on his rickshaw and struck a conversation, she said. When he told me his story I knew then it had to be shown to a wider audience.The Ladakh trip saw him come close to a snow leopard, suffer a drop in oxygen and navigate through uneven terrain. On the way, he planted close to 5,000 date seeds. They dont need much nurturing and will grow in adverse circumstances. Its like human willpower, he said.I stayed at Sonam Wanchuk School in Ladakh, he said. Sonam sir kept my rickshaw there to inspire people who would come. He also gave me advice regarding my rickshaws gear. He is an incredible man. He arranged for a flight ticket to Delhi despite me wanting to take a bus from Ladakh. He even gave me Rs 5,000 for returning to Kolkata.Back home, the local community felicitated him and even refurbished his rickshaw with a special brake.The members of the Naktala Agrani Sangha (the local club) helped me in all possible ways by raising funds. They upgraded my humble rickshaw with suitable break and gear too. Ive received both love and recognition, Im grateful for that, he said.Das has taken to learning and educating people on global warming. He scours newspapers, social media and follows National Geographic keenly.

The waiver, which would cost the state Rs 34,000 crore, would apply to crop loans of up to Rs 2 lakh. Besides, arrears will be waived for defaulters so they can get fresh loans. For this, the Chief Minister said, Rs 6,500 crore has been earmarked in the 2018-2019 budget.There are incentives for farmers who repaid loans in time. ""I have decided to credit the repaid loan amount or Rs 25,000, whichever is less, to each farmer's account,"" Mr Kumaraswamy said in his budget speech.Later, Mr Kumaraswamy told NDTV that Rs 34,000 crore ""will be disbursed in 4 phases... 10,500 crores has already been allotted in this budget.""The relief for the agrarian community was the centerpiece of the maiden budget of the state's Congress-JD(S) government announced by Chief Minister Kumaraswamy today.The measures had been cleared in the meeting held by the coordination committee of the Congress and Mr Kumaraswamy's JD(S) held on Sunday. The committee had also approved irrigation projects worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crore.The farm loan waivers had been high on the agenda of the JD(S) ahead of the elections. Mr Kumaraswamy had promised that he would waive all farm loans within 24 hours of coming to power.Ahead of the budget, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had also mentioned the issue in a tweet:On the eve of the Karnataka Budget, I'm confident our Congress-JDS coalition Govt will act on our commitment to waive farmer loans & to make farming more profitable.This budget is an opportunity for our Govt. to make Karnataka a beacon of hope for farmers all across India.  Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) July 4, 2018The Chief Minister has also proposed to increase power tariff by 20 paise per unit and levy a higher tax on fuel. Petrol prices will go up by Rs 1.14 per litre and diesel by Rs 1.12 per litre.""I also propose to increase excise duty on Indian made foreign liquor by 4 per cent to raise additional revenue for meeting the budget expenditure,"" said Mr Kumaraswamy.As the opposition BJP pointed fingers at the loan waivers and hikes, Mr Kumaraswamy told NDTV that the hike in fuel, electricity prices is negligible. ""I can't answer each criticism of the BJP - they see everything with jaundiced eyes,"" he added.Mr Kumaraswamy had gone ahead with the budget presentation despite the disapproval of His predecessor Siddaramaiah, who was heard questioning the need for a new budget citing the one he presented in February, before the assembly elections. The two allies however, claimed that there was no rift within the alliance.Mr Kumaraswamy's budget has retained all the welfare schemes of the previous Congress government -- including rice at Rs 1 a kg to the poor and Indira Canteens that serve low-cost meals."

Mamata had done many things for the Hindus, including developing Gangasagar, building skywalk at Dakshineswar temple and renovating Tarakeswar temple,"" he said.Mr Bandopadhyay claimed that although the highest number of farmer deaths were reported in Maharashtra during the past six months, PM Modi chose to hold a rally for welfare of peasants in Bengal where not a single farmer had died.Accusing the BJP of creating a rift between the Hindus and the Muslims, he said, ""We will not let that happen"".""The Rambhakts of Modi's BJP trigger riots but the Rambhakts of Bengal work for building communal amity,"" he claimed.He claimed that the turnout at PM Modi's public rally comprised people from four states - Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha -- but not a single farmer was present at the rally.Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said, ""The people of India need Mamata Banerjee. She has no lust for power. But she has to take up the responsibility. The people of the country need a leader who works for everybody.""He said PM Modi had raised a slogan of bringing ""Achhe din"" but bad days befell the people.Mr Hakim, who is also the Trinamool Congress' general secretary, said, ""We have syndicate for development but not formed syndicate to organise riots like what happened in Gujarat.""He claimed that the Trinamool Congress would win all the 42 seats in the state and the BJP would not be able to win a single seat.State Education Minister and Trinamool Congress Secretary General Partha Chatterjee alleged that PM Modi was shedding crocodile tears for the farmers.""Modi had suddenly turned up in Midnapore to profess his new-found love for farmers. I ask where was he when the farmers' agitation in Nandigram and Singur were taking place,"" he questioned.Mr Chatterjee said Ms Banerjee had a history of standing by the people and she did not become a mass leader in one day.He said those who failed to provide mid-day meal rice were now claiming to side with the farmers.Mr Chatterjee alleged that the BJP was trying to win polls by bringing out rath-yatras and allowing display of swords in processions, thereby, creating fear among people but, said that, they would not succeed."
5ce7d2b1e8e3fc56af41b789,Fines fail to deter stubble burning,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fines-fail-to-deter-stubble-burning/article25267643.ece,2018-10-20,"Between September 27 and October 14, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) imposed Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they collected only Rs. 3,05,000, according to figures from the organisation.The fines are collected over time  frequently the farmers dont have money to immediately pay them, Gulshan Rai, Chief Environmental Engineer, PPCB, told The Hindu . However our experience from previous years is that this is not a substantial amount.The Centre and the States  Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  have in several meetings through the year declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble for farmers, which, according to various studies, contributes anywhere from 17% to 78% to the particulate matter-emission load in the city during winter.To discourage farmers in Punjab and Haryana  who are responsible for the bulk of such fires  the government has also disbursed Rs. 591 crore to these States to sell subsidised farm implements that can do away with stubble without having to burn them.Officials in the PPCB, on the condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that they were frequently lenient when they caught farmers in the act of burning stubble  an offence that invites fines of at least Rs. 2,500 an acre.Officials said satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complex process.We are helplessWe get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to ascertain the farmer in question. Sometimes, farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence and sometimes poverty. We are helpless at times, said an officer tasked with following up on stubble burning fires in Punjab.Despite a vigorous focus by governments on making mechanised farm implements  combine harvesters-cum-straw management system, seed drillers, rotary harvesters  available to farmers, its still inaccessible to many farmers with landholdings less than 5 acres or those not rich enough to invest in such machines.In Bibipur village, Patiala, there are about 800 households, according to Hardeep Singh, a resident farmer, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields ripe for harvesting.These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are only three or four machines available (for a variety of tasks from cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw) for all of us, he told The Hindu . That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. However, farmers have barely two months  between mid-September and mid-November  to clear out the field.This year, delayed rains have shrunk the window further and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times, in keeping with subtle weather differences.In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, Mr. Singh added.Then theres the spike in diesel prices. Deploying the machines uses up nearly 5 litres of diesel per acre (running the tractors, to which these implements are hitched) to sow wheat and nearly 20 litres per acres to farmers who want to grow potato, said Jitender Pal, a farmer in Jaspal Bangar village in Ludhiana.At village Rola, in the Samrala tehsil of Ludhiana, Upendra, a daily-wage labourer from Bihar, was busy setting fire to a 1.5 acre plot of rice straw. It wasnt his land, he said, and was merely following instructions of the malik. The Hindu couldnt contact him. Sarabjit Singh, a farmer in Rola, said no machines were made available to his village. And thats true for 50 villages around, he added.Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, said that change would take some time. Were educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys soil nutrients, and increases their fertilizer requirement. Weve run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier  just Rs. 300 more per acre  than burning the field and helps preserve the environment as well as their health, he said in a media briefing.( The author was part of a media contingent, sponsored by the Union Environment Ministry, to review measures to address stubble burning in Punjab )."

5ce7d0a8e8e3fc56af41b6cc,How Betki’s child goddess and her brother rose to be forces of nature,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/how-betkis-child-goddess-and-her-brother-rose-to-be-forces-of-nature/articleshow/66300349.cms,2018-10-21,"This story is from October 21, 2018Download The Times of India News App for Latest CityPONDA: In the village of Betki in Ponda, Mandodari , the wife of the mythological demon king Ravana is worshipped, or so it is mistakenly believed. The confusion arises because the object of the villagers reverence is a young girl, who happens to be Mandodaris namesake. The story behind her elevation to divinity is marked with blood, and it goes thus.Young Mandodari lived in the village of Betki in the 16th century, at a time when the locals were trying hard to establish a water management system.It is not that Betki suffered from water paucity, in fact, quite the opposite. The lush agrarian hamlet was blessed with numerous springs that fed the water table and replenished its many waterbodies. Also, located as it was in a valley, it became the recipient of monsoon-fed streams. Rather than let the water go to waste, the villagers decided to harvest this bounty of nature and channelise it to ensure round-the-year water supply for their agricultural and horticultural activities. For this, they decided to dig a huge tank that would serve as a catchment area.Legend has it that, in a bizarre twist, no matter how hard they tried, all attempts by villagers to raise a mud embankment failed. After many tries, the frustrated villagers turned to superstition for relief, and as in the tradition of some dark rituals, it was decided that a blood sacrifice would be offered. Spilling blood to appease evil spirits is part of an ancient and complex tradition followed all over the sub-continent.It so happened that Mandodari and her brother, Narbando, lived near the tank with their widowed mother. And, for reasons unknown, the people of Betki decided to offer the blood of these innocent children in sacrifice.The embankment went up, and Mandodarichem tollem, one of the states biggest man-made lakes, was completed. But, the course of events leading to Mandodari and Narbandos elevation to divine status were yet to play out.In a dramatic turn, the grieving mother, on realising the conspiracy behind her childrens death, placed a curse on the village. No rice will be cooked in Betki for 24 years, she said.What then was the use of having such a huge water reservoir , one that recharged the water table of four villages in its vicinity? The irony of the curse defeated the very purpose behind constructing the lake.Fortunately, around this time, the Fadte Gaonkar community, in a bid to escape religious persecution at the hands of the Portuguese colonial rulers, migrated from Verna in Salcete and settled in Betki.Moved by the conundrum facing the villagers, they decided to help the people of Betki convince the widow to minimise the intensity of her hex. By then, the unfortunate lady had moved residence to a neighbouring village. They tracked her down and prevailed upon her to change the curse. And so, from not growing rice for 24 years, the widow changed the proscription to no rice will be cooked for 24 hours.The relieved villagers on returning to Betki built a shrine in the memory of Mandodari and Narbando near the tank. That was how Mandodari worship came to gain precedence in the village.Writer R B Phadte from Betki, says, In our village, the role played by the sacred tank dedicated to deity Mandodari is immense. There is a saying Shil Savoi, Betki aavai, which mean Betki is the mother of this tank while Savoi is the body.Every year on Mahashivratri, a palanquin procession is brought to the shrine of Mandodari and the goddess is worshipped. Once, this tradition served to create a sentiment of sacredness around the water body, which ensured its up keep.While this traditional water harvesting system survives and continues to be the main source of water for irrigation, the lake has silted and sustained neglect over the years. And the growing apathy towards ecology is sure to lead to its death."

There should not be a deficit of one single vote. We need to display our might once again to come back to power. Unlike Congress, who only deceived the poor and the farmers, we worked for the development of Chhattisgarh,"" Singh said while addressing a rally from his constituency in Rajnandgaon.Launching a scathing attack at the opposition Congress, Singh said, ""The Congress just took the people for a ride here in Chhattisgarh through their ""Garibi Hatao"" slogan. They did nothing for the poor here. The poor, these days, get rice at Rs 1 per kg, the women get gas cylinders for free. The Congress government here struggled to buy five quintals of rice to feed the people of this state. The farmers of this state badly suffered because of Congress,"" he added.Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath who was also a part of Singh's public rally, said, ""In the last 15 years, the state government through its various schemes have reached out to every single people living in Chhattisgarh. The Chief Minister through his humbleness, hard work, honesty, and his leadership deserves every credit for making Chhattisgarh what it is today. From the deprived, poor, to the Adivasis, everyone in the state has got food security under the Raman Singh government.""The state will go to polls in two phases on November 12 and 20, while the counting of votes will take place on December 11.On Saturday, the BJP announced the names of its candidates for 77 seats out of 90 in the state."

The proceeds from the harvest will be distributed in flood-affected districts in the state.The initiative launched by Bharat Bhavan in association with WIWA Cultural Development Organization in July envisaged cultivating paddy in a 10-acre farm at Kalamachal panchayat in Vamanapuram with support from public. Rehearsals of a play were also to be held.Inaugurating the event, culture minister A K Balan said the first Organic Theatre is a turning point in the history of Keralas agrarian concept. The Organic Theatre initiative to promote organic farming and culture has finally become a reality. It is also a good start for the rebuild Kerala mission, said A K Balan.Minister of agriculture VS Sunil Kumar said the concept of Organic Theatre should be extended to more places. Agriculture depicts the relation humans have with art and soil. We should adopt this culture of cultivation to promote organic farming. The message of the programme is to recall our nature, culture and the equilibrium, he added.According to Pramod Payyannur, the organizer of Agri-Culture, Organic Theatre aims to create a holistic lifestyle through eco  friendly farming and various art forms. It is a redefining of agriculture as Agri-Culture, he said. Crops that we cultivated in Kalamachal will be taken to flood-affected areas. We are planning to distribute 10kg rice bags to flood victims of Alapuzha, Chengannur and Kuttanad, said Pramod. Bharat Bhavan is now planning to implement the idea of Organic Theatre in a 20-acre plot at Kannur. We will identify the fallow lands in other districts and replicate this theme, said Pramod Payyannur, secretary of Bharath Bhavan.Lyricist Sreekumaran Thampy, Lalithakala Akademi chairman Nemom Pushparaj, Folklore Akademi president C J Kuttappan and WIWA chairman S N Sudheer attended the function.

5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

Hugh Jackman falls into the first category, as witnessed when he recently settled into a well-positioned banquette in a West Village restaurant and faced his dining audience, the better to disarm and dazzle.But his latest character  former United States Senator Gary Hart of Colorado  is definitely not a fan of the limelight. In The Front Runner, the director Jason Reitman chronicles the three weeks in 1987 when the presidential candidacy of Hart, a Democrat who was considered the man to beat, imploded after journalists caught the scent of a supposed extramarital tryst with Donna Rice. It didnt take long before that infamous photo of Rice sitting on Harts lap near the Monkey Business yacht was splashed across the National Enquirer. (Both Hart and Rice have denied an affair. And earlier this month, The Atlantic reported that a dying Lee Atwater  the campaign manager for George H.W. Bush, the presumed Republican candidate, who trailed in the polls  claimed that he had set Hart up.)Gary is a private person by nature but also a believer that there should be a separation between the public and private lives of politicians, said Jackman. And what I love about the movie is it does not give any easy answers on that. Were all human, weve all got flaws, but what level of flaws would you accept? Its actually Garys line: In public life some things are interesting; it doesnt necessarily mean theyre important.Jackman, on the other hand, seems to have no obvious shortcomings: His offscreen persona is that of a happy husband to the Australian actress Deborra-lee Furness and a doting father to their teenagers, Oscar and Ava, who sings in the shower and makes his best decisions while tap dancing.On the day before his 50th birthday  which he would celebrate with his wifes ricotta hot cakes before heading to the set of Bad Education, about an embezzlement scandal in a Long Island school district  Jackman talked about politics and privacy, whats next for The Greatest Showman and why his life just keeps getting better.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.What was it like being cast as Gary Hart?It produced a little anxiety in the right kind of way. I mean, nerve-racking for many reasons  [Gary] is mysterious, hard to pin down, closed off. Even he said, People call me cold and aloof but if I start winning theyll call me enigmatic. Then of course Ive never played someone whos alive. But I feel very strongly that our stories are one of the most valuable things to people. How were seen in the world, potentially how were remembered. And I wanted him to know that I took that very seriously.Before Hart, presidents had affairs but the news media mostly left them alone. What changed?This was really a key turning point, particularly in the relationship between press and politicians, and also politics and personality. Once the private life became a really important indicator of character, and something that voters and press could latch onto to describe their worthiness to lead, then the floodgates opened. Its the most important job in the world, arguably, and you are making a decision about the character of someone in terms of what they say theyre going to do. For me, how they conduct their marriage is not that important.In 2017, with Logan, you retracted your Wolverine claws after 17 years, a decision which you credited to Jerry Seinfeld.I was asking him about the end of Seinfeld, and he said: Im a firm believer that its very important for your creative self not to run your self ragged. Leave before youre completely worn out on something because it catapults into the next thing. As he was telling me the story, I just knew in my gut it was time.After which you made your passion project, The Greatest Showman, about P.T. Barnum, which became a box-office smash. Will there be a Broadway version?I dont know. Its not definitive at all. Theres a lot of people working on what a live version of that would be. Is it something thats on the West End or in Vegas? Is it a touring tent show? Is it an arena spectacular? All I know is when we were in the room during those workshops, you get a really keen sense if its going to work in a theatre. And I know it will work. I just know the power. Ive seen Keala [Settle] standing in the centre of a room singing This Is Me, and there was not a dry eye in the house.Agency pictureOr maybe a film sequel?Im sure there are pitches being done but I have no idea whats going on.What is 50 like?For me, life feels better and better. People talk a lot about the arrogance of youth and how the world is at your feet, and I didnt really relate to that. I felt more insecure certainly than I do now. But a bit of insecurity is good. It makes you work harder.Is there anything youd like to do that youre not ready for yet?Hmm, no. Maybe I am arrogant. Because Im promoting this movie, people are like, Wow, are you going to run for prime minister [of Australia]? [Laughs] And Im like, No, thats not happening. Any job where the day you sign up literally 60 per cent of the country hates you, I dont know if Id be able to cope with that.Its hard to imagine 60 per cent of any country hating you. After all, 20.8 million followers enjoy watching you make fun of yourself on Instagram.I do try to hold onto the bubbly colloquial Aussie way of not taking things too seriously. I know its probably breaking all the movie star rules where youre supposed to be mysterious and not show who you really are, but I really dont care that much about it. I prefer to do my pretending on film or on stage."

Village Child Development Centre (VCDC) Scheme2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for PDS3. DBT for Tribal Ashram Shalas4. Public Health SchemesDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityThe BJP government in the state spent the last four years announcing social sector schemes  each more ambitious than the other  at a rapid pace, but the public reaction has been far from uniform. In other words, the government's social sector sops have been a mixed bag.Its blood on call' scheme earned bouquets, but its announcement to provide premix food as children's meal got widespread flak for being unimaginative. Its decision to introduce direct benefit transfers in the public distribution scheme was trashed, but beneficiaries of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule insurance scheme have been ecstatic to get angioplasty costing lakhs for free.The budget also reveals a worrisome trend: allocations for schemes have been slashed or the private sector has been roped in areas that have traditionally been the domain of the government sector.An analysis of state budgets from 2015-16 to 2017-18 by Jaganyachya Hakkache Andolan showed consistent failure of Maharashtras government to allocate adequate funds for social sector, despite a deep agrarian crisis and peoples undeniable need for social services. There is continued and deliberate massive underspending of allocated funds, said health economist Dr Ravi Duggal. Only 40% of allocated funds were spent by February 14, 2018, a few days from the close of the financial year.Heres a performance report:The women and child development department launched a Rs 100-crore scheme to fight malnourishment after the Centre stopped funds three years ago. The scheme envisaged giving children in villages premix food thrice a day  an idea health experts felt would not be popular. This was the third time in as many years that the ministry was caught in a storm. In June 2015, minister Pankaja Munde courted controversy for clearing purchase of chikki , mats and books for Rs 206 crore without floating tenders. The next year it emerged that the department's Take Home Ration scheme distributed packets of sheera or upma to womenfar from a balanced diet. Dr Ashish Satav, who works in the tribal-dominated Melghat area, said the VCDC scheme should be scrapped. It does not administer WHO-UNICEF recommended diet or micronutrients, said Dr Satav. Unless we know the real figure of malnutrition, appropriate measures cannot be planned to reduce child deaths.The state decided to implement the DBT scheme as part of the public distribution system (PDS) in two ration shops in the city with 1,400 Antyodaya and priority household ration cardholders as an experiment. The Food Security Act entitles the neediest families in the country to 35kg of grain at heavily subsidized rates per month under the Antyodaya scheme, while each member of a priority household is entitled to 5kg. Both have to pay Rs3 for a kg of rice and Rs2 for a kg of wheat. The social organization Anna Adhikar Manch slammed the scheme, alleging that it is a step towards dismantling the PDS system. This is a ghoshnabaaj sarkar. The scheme has amounted to diluting food security, which was guaranteed to the poor after a long agitation. The cash transfer business is part of doing away with PDS and also do away with buying grains from farmers for FCI godowns by providing them a minimum support price, said activist Ulka Mahajan.The state implemented DBT in tribal ashram schools. It was meant for the purchase of 17 essentials items like toiletries so that these reach them directly instead through a contractor. The state has started transferring cash to students bank accounts as food allowance or scholarship (for hostel students). The state said the scheme has 4.14 lakh beneficiaries, with Rs 1,474 crore spent till date. As of now, it is being implemented in only 120 out of 491 hostels, located in the jurisdiction of corporations and districts. Minister for tribal welfare Vishnu Savara claimed this was being done to put an end to the constant complaints of poor quality of items reaching tribal children. Rajendra Maraskolhe, president, Organisation for Rights of Tribals, said the scheme is good, but needs awareness among tribals. The tribal community is different. They still hesitate to mix with others; so, they are not aware about how to spend the money. The state should consider counselling them, he said.The government flagged off many schemes, but the blood on call' program seems to be the most popular one, with experts and critics acknowledging that it fills a yawning gap in the public health system . The government's bike ambulances have also met with positive response, but these have a limited role and cannot do much in big crises, said Dr Abhijit More of the NGO Jan Arogya Abhiyan. The free health insurance scheme Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana has been the government's most visible scheme for the masses as it provides free access to 1,000 surgeries that cost up to Rs 1.5 lakh. This year, after the Centres Ayushman Bharat scheme was launched, the benefit has climbed to Rs 5 lakh. But some economists are not happy. There have been complaints of patients still not getting proper access. Until a few months back, some hospitals made patients pay extra, said one. The biggest criticism, according to Dr More, is that the scheme is only dedicated towards surgeries. What about hospitalisation due to chronic diseases? We get calls from people across the state to enquire if hospitalisation could be covered under the scheme, he said. It's time to revamp the scheme and make it more broad-based."
5ce7513fe8e3fc56af418ac3,Dye Another Day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dye-another-day/cid/1335376,2018-11-02,"The colour of indigo, to a lot of Indians, will always be red. Not scarlet or rose or even ruby, but red like the blood oozing from a ruptured vessel and dripping with the sting of several lost generations. Less crop, more a byword for colonial excesses.Which is why, talk of an indigo resurgence across the subcontinent - Bengal, Uttarakhand, Assam, South India, Bangladesh - elicits a reflex cringe. The reaction that follows is really a question. Why do we need a crop that has been known to decimate son and soil?That was also the response Amrita Mukerji got from the farmers she employed when she decided to grow indigo in her smallish plot in Santiniketan. ""Don't grow these. They will harm the land,"" is how they warned her. ""When I asked them who had told them as much, they said they just knew,"" says Mukerji, founder of the NGO, Sutra.Around the turn of the century, after years of globe-trotting with her husband, Mukerji settled down to a retired life in Calcutta. She says, ""I had visited production centres in Nigeria. And over the years, attended indigo exhibitions, met scholars studying the history of the plant, bought prints... I started to fall in love with the blue of the indigo.""And then in 2003, textile researcher Charlotte Kwon met her in Calcutta and handed her a packet of indigo seeds.The indigo project was apparently a whim. That year, after harvest, Mukerji noticed that the land had yielded a rush of mustard. The farmers were surprised.They needn't have been. Indigo is a leguminous plant, fixes nitrogen to the soil, enhances soil quality and soil productivity and has been popular in India from time immemorial as a virtuous rotational crop. From 2016, Mukerji turned to indigo cultivation in all seriousness.Around the same time in Uttarakhand's Kumaon region, Rashmi Bharti was also planting indigo. In Uttarakhand, food crops are prone to pest attacks; monkeys, parrots and wild boars are also known to destroy food grains. Farmers were fed up. And that is when Bharti, co-founder of the NGO, Avani, that creates viable employment opportunities for rural men and women, thought of indigo cultivation as a sustainable alternative. And for good reason - not only is the plant hardy and low maintenance, monkeys do not like the taste of it and there is nothing to peck at for the birds either.Mukerji is aware of cultivation in Murshidabad. Bharti talks about other geographies - Bihar, Andhra, Karnataka. It might be too soon to call it a revolution, but there is a definite indigo wave sweeping India.Indigo is indigenous to India. One finds mention of it in works as diverse as the Atharva Veda and the Ain-i-Akbari. Jenny Balfour-Paul, an expert on the subject, writes in her book Indigo: Egyptian Mummies to Blue Jeans, ""The word indigo itself derives from the Greek indikon, Latinised indicum, originally meaning a substance from India, indicating the import of indigo pigment by the Graeco-Roman world. The Sanskirt word nila, meaning dark blue, spread from India eastwards into Southeast Asia and westward to the Near and Middle East, probably both through the pre-Islamic trading routes and subsequent trade diffusion of the product in the Islamic era...""In a WhatsApp call from London, Balfour-Paul tells The Telegraph that Bengal in particular produced the best quality of indigo. ""Bengal had the perfect soil to grow this tropical plant. There are 800 species of indigo, of which only 10 will yield colour. Indigofera tinctoria is what is found in Bengal.""So when and how did indigo come to be a pejorative? The East India Company was aware of the commercial worth of indigo. There were indigo plantations across colonies.In her book, Balfour writes about how the company actively promoted Bengal's indigo industry by providing heavy subsidies and underwriting initial big losses. It brought over European indigo planters from the West Indies to establish efficient factories, and Bengal indigo soon equalled in quality the finest West Indian product. ""So successful was the operation that the company's Asian indigo imports into London jumped from 25,000 pounds in 1782 (when most of the indigo came from America and West Indies) to 43,68,000 pounds in 1795, the bulk of it from Bengal.""At the time, four million people were employed in the production and manufacture of indigo in Bengal alone. Indigo was a hugely profitable enterprise. Its colour was gold.Research associate Sanjukta Ghosh of SOAS South Asia Institute, London, tells us that W.B. Hudson, a major planter in the region, claimed that 4.5 million was invested in the indigo industry. The problem started when profits were not ploughed back to the ryots or indigo farmers. She talks about the planters' ostentatious lifestyle - sprawling bungalows, obliging servants. As the returns on indigo increased, so did their greed, and a time came when they started taking away every cultivable land for indigo cultivation.Indigo might have been gold, but what is gold in the face of hunger? The aggressive push landed on the farmer's stomach, fair and square.By the mid 19th century, the exploitation had assumed monstrous proportions. In 1860, on the back of the uprising of 1857, Dina-bandhu Mitra, an employee of the Raj, wrote a play on the subject. Titled Nil Darpan, it was meant to show the mirror to the Raj, the story behind the indigo success story. In his biography of Mitra, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote: ""Nil Darpan is to Bengal what Uncle Tom's Cabin is to America's slave movement.""Taking a cue from Nil Darpan, several learned men of Bengal took up the pen. One such anonymous writer's song goes thus: ""Hey nirodoy nilkargan/aar shohena praney ei nildahan/Krishaker dhoney praney/Dohile nilagune..."" The farmer writhing in agony is crying out to the indigo planters for mercy, pleading with them to rein in their indigo lust.Nil Darpan shook up British Parliament after 200 translated copies landed in Britain. It decreed that one could cultivate indigo in Bengal only if one was a landowner. Most of the planters were using leased land and when this diktat kicked in, they started looking for bluer pastures.Balfour-Paul tells us that two-fifths of the million-and-a-half acre of land that was under cultivation in India was in Bihar. She writes, ""Though the term satyagraha was coined much later in history, 'Champaran Satyagraha' began with peasants revolting against the Indigo planters.""From gold, indigo had taken the colour of death - black.Every drama must have its denouement. Indigo's was written by a German chemist. Adolf Von Baeyer invented synthetic indigo towards the end of the 19th century. It was cheaper, came minus the bloodbath and made natural indigo inconsequential.But not all the holy waters of India could wash the taint off the Blue Devil. At some point, history polluted fact and it came to be accepted, most mistakenly, that indigo was a villainous plant.Crops do not understand man-made divisions. As then, so also now, indigo is a common benison of India and Bangladesh.Ruby Ghuznavi is the founder of Aranya Crafts, an indigo enterprise based in Dhaka. She says, ""We first cultivated and extracted indigo in Bangladesh on an experimental basis in 1984. It was not very well received by the farmers because of its negative history. But once it was apparent to them that they would be the actual beneficiaries and indigo would no longer be the exploitative crop of the past, they accepted its production very eagerly. The fact that indigo as an extra crop between two major rice harvests has brought extra earnings for the farmers, is well appreciated by them.""Mishael Aziz Ahmad is also from Bangladesh, and runs the social enterprise Living Blue. He says that farmers in north Bangladesh were intercropping Indigofera tinctoria all along, as a fertiliser. Thus, in reality, indigo had never died out. What had happened was its use had changed from dye to fertiliser. Ahmad says, ""Now about 3,000 farmers in 80 to 100 villages are planting indigo in the peripheral lands. Landless labourers are also planting it by the roadside and earning a few bucks during the lull period. In Bangladesh, people have accepted it as a crop that is creating more employment opportunities.""Ahmad's account dovetails into Rashmi Bharti's. In Uttarakhand, there was a problem. Men would leave their villages for cities in search of jobs, and the women were left behind. The large tracts of unused land invited soil erosion.Indigo cultivation has addressed all these problems. Apart from the fact that it can grow at an altitude as high as 5,500 feet, indigo cultivation is not very labour intensive. Bharti's NGO has trained the women of these villages to do both. She says, ""In the first year, we had started with only 20 farmers. In 2017, we had 250 farmers. Their total earnings this year was Rs 4.6 lakh.""Avani consumes most of the produce currently as the market in India is nascent. Apart from dyeing - it is widely used in dyeing jeans - indigo is used for products such as watercolours, crayons and wood stains.Amrita Mukerji tells us that indigo is a non-pollutant and eco-friendly natural dye.In several pockets in south India, it turns out that indigo never went out of fashion. Victoria Vijayakumar, who runs Aranya Naturals, a community development project by the Tatas, tells us that indigo cultivation has been going on for generations in Munnar. It was used as manure. Vijayakumar also confirms that the renewed use of indigo for its dye is relatively recent. She tells us, ""We have six acres of land under indigo cultivation and in three years we have had 18 harvests. This year 80 kilos of indigo was extracted.""And so indigo has come full circle. From blue to gold to black to red, it is back to being a vivid blue once again. The colour of the expansive horizon, of the bottomless waters, and above all, of freedom and promise."

So, its a good idea to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger food. Source: `www.cucinamiabynatasha.com`I love how the festive season in India stretches for so long. In Bengal it starts with Durga Puja and in other parts of the country with Dussehra. Once that is done, the countdown to Diwali begins and then theres bhai phonta or bhai dooj.It goes further on to the New Year for some communities. So its a long time before people are back to normal life! And this means parties, celebrations and more eating and drinking. And lots of hosting! Heres a guide to make you shine as the host at your festive celebrations.DECIDE ON DECORYou do not need to spend a fortune to decorate your home to reflect the festive spirit. Diwali is all about light. So simple diyas and tea lights around the house can create magic. Pair those with fresh orange and yellow marigold and you have a gorgeous traditional look.The entrance to your home should give a positive first impression. Do it up with floating candles and flowers in a large bowl of water or a simple rangoli on the floor adorned with diyas.For me, the dining table is always the highlight as food is an integral part of any party. I love doing up the table based on the occasion and theme. At my own Diwali party in Bangalore, I added a south Indian touch with banana leaves, flowers from the local market and classic earthen diyas. All for less than Rs 200!PREP IN ADVANCEWe all host parties and get-togethers because we want to share these happy moments with our loved ones. However, most of the time, the host ends up running around and getting stressed during the party. This would not happen if you organise yourself and also reduce the number of unnecessary tasks.Choose a menu which you can prepare a day in advance. Dishes which have to be made or assembled just before serving are a complete no-no.For garnishes like fresh herbs, lime wedges and other fresh ingredients, prepare them just before the party and keep them ready on a tray in the service area of your kitchen. That way you dont have to go rummaging around in your overcrowded fridge for the dhania while the hot food is waiting to be served.Use disposable crockery and cutlery to reduce washing up. These days you get lovely bamboo and paperware which are eco-friendly and look nice as well.Ice, ice, baby! How many times have you been at a party getting your drink from the bar, only to be told Sorry we are out of ice! There is nothing more putting off than a warm drink, be it a whisky or a cola. Do remember to start stocking up on ice cubes a couple of days in advance so that will be one big job out of the way.Sweet potato chips www.cucinamiabynatasha.comSWEET POTATO CHIPSGet healthy and gourmet with these oven-baked sweet potato chips.Ingredients4 sweet potatoes2tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperChilli flakesMethodPeel the potatoes and cut into chips.Steam half-way.Heat the oven to 180C.Combine the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.Bake on a baking dish or tray for about 30 minutes, tossing in between till crispy.Serve warm with any dip, sauce or chutney.Minted pea hummus/ beetroot hummus www.cucinamiabynatasha.comMINTED PEA HUMMUS/ BEETROOT HUMMUSWhen the classic hummus bores you, you revive it by adding vibrant colours and veggies! You can use either peas and mint, or beetroot in this recipe for some gorgeous hummus.Ingredients1 cup chickpeas (boiled)2 beetroots, cut in large cubes, or 1 cup of boiled peas and some mint leaves1tbsp tahini2 garlic clovestsp cumin powderJuice of  lemonChilli flakesSalt and fresh pepperToasted pine nuts or walnuts for garnishMethodSteam the beetroots/boil the peas or bake in the oven.In a blender, blend together the boiled chickpeas, beetroot/peas and mint, tahini, garlic, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and 2tbsp of water till you get the right consistency.Garnish with toasted nuts and seeds. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil just before serving.GET THE MENU RIGHTIt is incredible how much food gets left over at parties and then the host family ends up eating the same thing for the next couple of days or distributing it to neighbours and domestic staff in the justification that they are not wasting food. Well, why not just make less of each with the idea that if one dish finishes there will always be something else to eat.In my opinion, the appetisers or finger food and the dessert should be the main focus. The main course could be very light or just a one-pot wholesome dish for those wanting something more. People are hungry when they arrive. So they tend to load up on appetisers.A good idea is to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger foods which people can have while playing cards.Try out some healthy appetisers like sweet potato chips with beetroot/pea and mint hummus or curried peanut dip which you can make in advance. These are regulars on my party menus by popular demand. You can also make them for your post-Diwali visits or bhai phonta gatherings as, by then, people are really done with all the heavy eating of the season.So go on, get cracking to make your festivities super special.Wish you all a shining and enjoyable Diwali!The dining table can be a highlight; decorate it in the traditional way with diyas, flowers and banana leavesCurried Peanut Dip www.cucinamiabynatasha.comCURRIED PEANUT DIPThis is a new addition to my recipe stash with an interesting desi touch of spices, peanuts and coriander.Ingredients1tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion chopped1tbsp garlic, mincedtsp coriander powdertsp turmeric powderRed chilli flakes to taste2 large carrots, finely chopped cup toasted peanuts4tsp fresh lime juice1tbsp soy sauce1tsp brown sugar1tbsp crushed peanuts (for garnish)1tbsp chopped fresh coriander (for garnish)1tbsp crumbled feta cheese (optional)MethodIn a pan, heat some oil and cook the onion and garlic.Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and red chilli flakes.Add the carrots with salt and pepper and saute until carrots are half-cooked.Add in the toasted peanuts, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.

Here to anchor a sports show, Rice's Instagram account is overflowing with posts showcasing her strong love for India. She even dressed up in a sari for one photo.The one thing that has genuinely caught the attention of the five-time world-record holder is India's #MeToo movement, which is growing in power with each passing day. In India for nearly a month now, Rice has been reading about the disturbing tales of sexual harassment being shared by Indian women on various social media platforms. The movement has seen several women working in the media, corporate sector and the Indian film industry speaking out and recounting their anger against the exploitation they faced.Rice, who is also involved in several public awareness campaigns back home in Australia and the US, where she coaches, feels that that it's India's moment to stand up to its women and make them feel strong.""The #MeToo movement globally has definitely allowed women to have a voice and to be heard. In India, it's equally important as well, especially for a female, to speak up against the sexual crimes. I think outside of all the ins and outs of the gender equality and sexual harassment remains the fact we are able to set the foundation of doing certain things properly. The whole movement has shown that people can't get away with it anymore and that's a really good thing,"" Rice told TOI in an exclusive chat on the sidelines of the 'Ekamra Sports Literary Festival' - Asia's first such theme-based lit fest - organized by the Odisha government on Friday.The Australian spoke about the cultural differences between India and the west. ""What I know from my time in India is that culturally things are very different to that in the US. For a woman to come out and be vocal about the harassment here, it's different to America. So, that opening up has strengthened the movement and I think it might take some time to have proper ramifications,"" she added.For Rice, the life after retirement from swimming in 2014, has allowed her to excel in her other areas of choice. Apart from her impressive swimming credentials - she is also a two-time World championships silver medallist --Rice is a reality TV show winner, a TV show presenter and a successful entrepreneur, running her own swimming coaching programme for young kids.""I always wanted to be the best in what I do. My strife for excellence has allowed me to succeed in swimming but also in TV and business. When I was a swimmer, I used to do the same thing like train for seven hours every day. Now, I like to do things differently. I am loving the new person in me,"" added Rice, who just about managed to make it to the fest after flying in from the US this morning.Talking about her love for India, Rice plans to open swimming academies where she could personally train the young kids looking to build a successful career in the sport. ""I really want to do academies, some serious work here and not like just coming for one day. I hope to develop the sport of swimming in India,"" she said."

They rued that they had not been informed about the border closure on time.Avinash Yadav, a truck driver who headed to Narela in Delhi, said that he had to stay put till the border opened as taking the EPE would be futile. It will not serve my purpose. I will have to drive an extra 60-70 kilometres and after reaching Kondli, I will be stopped again from entering Delhi. I should have been informed about this move before entering Agra, so that I could have gone back and not headed towards NCR, he said.Drivers complained that there was no direct link to EPE for those travelling to Delhi via the Yamuna Expressway. We should be able to access the EPE after taking the direct link road from the Yamuna Expressway , said Dharmendra, a truck driver who is transporting rice from Mainpuri to Delhi. Some drivers claimed that their transporters had asked them to stay put but they had no food or water. Dalbir Singh, a transporter whose trucks run on the Yamuna Expressway, said that those approaching Delhi from Haryana could take the EPE, but those travelling from UP cities such as Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow via the Yamuna Expressway, had been hit by the move.Meanwhile, traffic police said that the trucks would be shifted to an empty space near Gaushala Road on Saturday. With respect to the demand for transit to EPE from the Yamuna Expressway, SP (traffic) Anil Jha said that a link road was being planned from near Jewar toll by YEIDA.In neighbouring Ghaziabad too, the traffic department has put a diversion plan in place. Vehicles meant to transport goods to Delhi have no option but to wait in Ghaziabad till 11pm on November 11. However, we are allowing transportation of vehicles carrying essential goods such as medicines or food. Vehicles meant for states other than Delhi are being diverted through the EPE. These vehicles have been allowed to access the expressway either from Duhai or Dasna, said Ghaziabad SP (traffic) Shyam Narayan Singh."

We survive only on chicken biryani, says U.P.-born Parag Raj Vaish, who became a non-vegetarian thanks to limited options available for vegetarians earlier.For Gaurav Das Swer, from Meghayala, finding mild flavours he is accustomed to is difficult. Only curd rice tastes homely, he quips.As for food trucks now lining up many roads to sell burgers, hot dogs and ice creams, Krishna attributes it to Pelli Choopulu , a 2016 romantic comedy film that made the concept popular.MNCs become popularThe students often flock to McDonalds, KFC and Subway, and refer, curiously, to items served by the multinational companies, which stepped into the city after the bifurcation, homely. Even local cafs offering Italian and Mediterranean dishes satiate them. But, for Vijendra Ranjilal, a Rajasthani who sells toys and balloons at the Benz Circle here, tiffin centres and small restaurants are yet to offer cheap cuisines familiar to him.Whenever I am in rush, I grab two samosas. Everything else tastes spicy, says Vijendra, of the Bagaria community, adding, I mostly prepare food at home. Even my neighbours ask for rotis I make.Even so, the city is beginning to welcome diverse tastes, says 47-year-old Poonam Mootha, a Rajasthani who grew up here. When I was in school, only Bhaiyaji Panipuri Walla in One Town sold North Indian street food. Now, you get pav bhaji and chole bhature everywhere.The change is more noticeable in terms of availability of non-regional fruits and vegetables to common people at Rythu Bazaars and with street vendors, says Karam Singh, a Punjabi who spent her early childhood here and has been in the city for 13 years as a consultant with an overseas education firm.I remember in my childhood when my father, returning from New Delhi, used to bring eggplants in sacks and distribute them among relatives fond of baingan bharta (mashed eggplant curry). Now, he doesnt have to do that. We now easily get carrots and radish too. Earlier, they were available only in supermarkets."

The procurement definitely will exceed the target this year too,"" the official told .There will not be any impact on procurement, though crop in Punjab, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh has been affected by deficient rain during September-end, he said.Asked about private procurement, the official said a pilot was to be taken up in Jharkhand but the companies have not shown interest and not placed any bids so far.""Wheat is easier to procure. In case of rice, they have to buy paddy and get it milled and stored. Many issues have to be kept in mind...,"" the official added.As per the latest data, rice procurement in Punjab reached 10.86 million tonnes, Haryana at 3.88 million tonnes, Telangana at 9,96,779 tonnes, Chhattishgarh at 3,02,319 tonnes and Uttrakhand at 1,71,098 tonnes so far this marketing year.Tamil Nadu has procured 1,10,771 tonnes of rice, while in case of Kerala it stood at 49,813 tonnes and Maharashtra at 17,880 tonnes in the said period, the data showed.Procurement is yet to begin in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The official said that Punjab and Haryana have completed 60 per cent of the their rice procurement. The buying is underway in other states like Chattishgarh.The paddy is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). State-run FCI and state agencies undertake procurement operation.For the current year, the government has fixed paddy MSP of 'common' grade variety at Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of 'A' grade variety at Rs 1,770 per quintal.The government has pegged rice output to be 99.21 million tonnes in the kharif season of the 2018-19 crop year (July-June), as against the actual output of 97.50 million tonnes in the same season last year.

Swaminathan commission recommendations. They are also seeking land rights for farmers and compensation for farm labourers.The march started with 5,000 farmers from Thane, around 23km from here, and will culminate on Thursday in Mumbais Azad Maidan where they will be joined by another 15,000 farmers.Eight months ago, farmers led by the All-India Kisan Sabha had walked 180km from Nashik to Mumbai with similar demands. The march then had received widespread support from Mumbai residents.The farmers are carrying 2kg of rice and 1kg of dal. They will camp in Mumbai till the demands are met, said Pratibha Shinde, general secretary of the Lok Sangharsh Morcha.The government had assured that the Recognition of Forest Right Act would be implemented in six months. Out of the 3.64 lakh claims, only 5,448 claims have been disposed of. It is still a long way to go for the farmers and tribals, Shinde added.The march comes at a time when a drought-like situation has aggravated agrarian distress in the state. With the general election and the state Assembly polls both scheduled for next year, the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state cannot afford to ignore the farmers demands.The state government should provide compensation to the farmers in the drought-hit areas for buying foodgrain. They have lost their crops and need compensation, Shinde said.Water conservationist Rajendra Singh, who joined the farmers, said the gap between schemes on paper and their implementation was widening.There are many schemes dogged by faulty implementation. Water is diverted to cities while the farmers dont get enough for irrigation, he said."

With the latest detection, the department has been successful in checking bogus billing of about five lakh bags of paddy and rice in the ongoing Kharif marketing season.Food and civil supply minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said district manager Ferozepur on November 21 detected abnormal purchase at Jiwan Arain and Panje Ke Uttar Mandis by arhtias, Reet Enterprises. The minister said that they had made bogus purchases of 86,939 bags of paddy in connivance with Sunrise Rice Mill, against which payments to the tune of Rs 5.6 crore have been taken.According to Ashu, the Punsup held a meeting of its district mangers on November 20 to track the movement of paddy and rice from other states to Punjab. In the meeting, district managers were specially instructed to re-check the purchases of paddy and rice and verify those figures with the stocks in the premises of the millers.The minister further added that the miller was planning to buy paddy from other states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where it is much cheaper than the minimum support price (MSP) and then deliver it during the milling to make a quick profit.Ashu said that the investigation has revealed the money trail  funds were diverted from the bank account of Reet Enterprises, owned by Jaswinder Singh, to AM Industries Jiwan Arain owned by Harpreet Singh who is the brother of Jaswinder Singh. AM Industries further distributed these funds to SS Industries, GS Trading Company, MJ Industries, Harpreet Kaur and Amandeep. According to Ashu, further details are being collected from the banks.The food and civil supplies department has lodged an FIR against Reet Enterprises owned by Jaswinder Singh, Jagdish Chander and Sons, owned by Sandeep Kumar, Dhruv Commission Agent, owned by Rishu Mutneja, Sunrise Rice Mill, owned by Jasmeet and mandi inspector Hansa Singh."

Sanjay K JhaInterviews are sometimes cut short because some questions make those interviewed uncomfortable.The roles were reversed at Khasrod village in Madhya Pradeshs Raisen district, around 50km from Bhopal.Questions about the so-called national issues  the temple, the tallest statue, the quality of the political discourse, the distortion of history  burst the dam on the everyday challenges.The flood that cascaded down centred on one issue: lack of employment opportunities in spite of some families breaking centuries-old barriers and sending out their children to study.So much so that eventually, almost every national question was met with an instance of how an educated sister is stuck at home and how a graduate son found out that farm labour pays better than a private company. The narrations ended with an appeal: Please write about the need to create jobs.The interview ended abruptly because every question was triggering traumatic accounts of lives spent in the hope that the system will deliver if the citizens fulfil their part.Rajkumar Uike, a tribal youth living in the village, had agreed to speak to The Telegraph on one condition that itself spoke volumes about what matters: the questions should be limited to the problems he faced as a farmhand.Rajkumars little home falls in the Bhojpur Assembly constituency, named after Raja Bhoj, one of the most celebrated Indian kings who ruled Malwa and was known for patronising the arts and science in the 11th century.This newspaper could not verify some of the specific information listed by Rajkumar as officials are busy with preparations for Wednesdays elections. But signs of abject poverty were visible everywhere and there was little reason to doubt the young man.Excerpts from the unfinished interview follow:Q: You are a farmer?Rajkumar: No, farm labourer. I look after somebodys farm.Q: How much do you earn in a month?Rajkumar: (Smiles and gives a blank look. Wretched poverty displayed all over, on clothes, on the hut, on the utensils.)Q: What are the problems you face in looking after the farm?Rajkumar: DAP (fertiliser) price is up. Electricity comes from 2.30 at night to 6 in the morning. I have to wake up at night to start the pump. We want electricity from 10am to 6pm.Q: But the chief minister says 24-hour power supply is ensured.Rajkumar: For 24-hour supply, they charge Rs 32,000 for four months. We pay Rs 15,000 for four months.Q: You get the MSP decided by the government for your produce?Rajkumar: Got Rs 1,750 for wheat, MSP is Rs 1,840.Q: Got money for building a house?Rajkumar: No, nobody got it in our village. Only one house under the PM Awas Yojana, nobody under the state scheme. Officers say no scheme for your village.Q: But you didnt follow it up?Rajkumar: Officers dont listen. So many documents they ask for. Even in banks, Aadhaar has become another problem. Chappal toot jate chakkar lagate (the footwear gets worn out, going around in circles).Q: But Modiji says he opened bank accounts for the poor.Rajkumar: Anybody who had money could have opened an account anyway. Whats the benefit of a zero balance account?Q: But you are at least allowed to enter banks.Rajkumar: (Points to another person who had just arrived.) Ask him if the accounts could be opened earlier. He is Harlal Gaur, a big farmer.Harlal: I opened my account 30 years ago. Earlier, you had to fill up one slip, now they torture you by asking for endless sets of documents.Q: Did you get fasal bima (crop insurance) benefits?Rajkumar: Not one paisa. Neighbouring villages Ashapur and Nimkheda got it. Here we dont have good quality dhan (paddy) but they put us in that category. Our dhan was bad but we didnt get anything. Nothing for wheat.Q: Did you benefit from the Ladli scheme for daughters?Rajkumar: Nobody so far. They registered girl children but they will get Rs 1 lakh only when she passes Class VII after reaching the age of 18 years. Over 80 per cent of girls drop out after fifth or sixth as there are no schools in the village. A few who will get will have to wait till they turn 18.Q: But you get wheat and rice for Re 1 a kg?Rajkumar: Yes, I do.Harlal: I dont, only BPL cardholders do.Q: Will the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government come back?Rajkumar: (Silence)Harlal: No way.Q: So, do you feel proud Modiji enhanced the prestige of the country in the world?Rajkumar: There are no jobs. It is becoming a big problem.Q: But you got the biggest statue of Sardar Patel worth Rs 3,000 crore.Rajkumar: I am a BCom (graduate). Private companies give Rs 6,000 a month. Thats why I chose to be a farm labourer.Q: Arent you proud Hindu leaders are in control now?Rajkumar: My sister is also a BCom (graduate). We studied in Obaidullahganj (the nearest town, 8km away).Harlal: My two sons did MCom from Bhopal. Both are sitting at home. Should I call them?(The floodgates open. Several people start recounting their plight.)Rajkumar stepped out of his home to remind the reporter: Write something about employment creation. Thats the main issue.His sister, the commerce graduate who assists him in farming and looking after the cow, was peeping from behind a curtain. She belongs to a rare tribal family that cared to educate its children despite facing extreme social and financial difficulties in this remote village.On the day the interview was conducted last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in the state explaining how Rahul Gandhi and Kamal Nath were seeking Muslim votes. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was also campaigning here, saying the Congress needed Ali not Bajrangbali."

This comes at a time when farm loan repayment has dipped by 10% as farmers seem to be in wait-and-watch mode.Paddy procurement in MP began on November 15, but the response has been dismal, admit officials. According to government sources, about 71,000 metric tonnes of paddy had come into mandis by November 26 last year. This year, its a mere 11,000 metric tonnes, they said.Paddy is procured by two agencies in MP  marketing federation and MP civil supplies corporation. The buzz in mandis is that farmers are waiting for the next government to be installed. Anil Yadav of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, Those who have sold their crop in mandis were the needy ones, who had to repay loans urgently.These days, payment for paddy procurement goes directly into farmers cooperative bank accounts, and loan repayment deduction is automatic as well. Farmers told TOI if they sell their crop now, they will lose a chunk of the money in loan repayments as EMI will automatically get deducted. Farmer Bisahulal Mahule in Balaghat, known as MPs rice bowl, said: In case of transfer of power, I will have more money in my account.The bureaucracy is tight-lipped. However, a senior official agreed to speak on condition of anonymity and said, Yes, there has been decline in paddy arrival. It could be because of the Congress announcement. Farmers feel that if they delay selling their produce in mandis, they will save a lot, otherwise their loan repayment will be deducted from their paddy proceeds.In poll-bound Chhattisgarh, too, paddy procurement is down by 50%. BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal, however, denies there is a drop in procurement and accuses Congress of misinformation."

The State goes to the polls on Wednesday.The BJP is hoping for a straight fourth term in a State that has traditionally been a stronghold of the Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliates. But the Congress is banking on an anti-incumbency mood due to 15 years of uninterrupted BJP rule.Welfare politicsThe BJP is heavily depending on welfare schemes to deliver the goods. Schemes such as Lakshmi Ladli that provide financial assistance to a girl child up to the age of 21, free pilgrimage for senior citizens from economically weaker families and rice and wheat at Rs. 1 a kg to BPL families are popular in rural and semi-rural families that make up nearly 70% of the States electorate.For the BJP, a robust grassroots organisation, support from the Sangh in mobilising voters and the continued popularity of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan are the positives. But there is visible anger and an anti-incumbency mood against sitting MLAs. To counter this, the party dropped 47 MLAs and replaced them with new faces. But that has created a large number of rebels who may eat into the BJPs votes. And unlike the 2013 Assembly polls when the BJP was riding a wave after it announced Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial nominee, there is no visible wave.People of Madhya Pradesh had decided that they will negate this time Modi ji [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] and Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji . They have seen through the veil and seen what the BJP is all about, trying to dupe people and giving out false promises. This time, there will be no Modi ji or Shivraj Singh ji magic, Congress campaign chief Jyotiraditya Scindia earlier told The Hindu .The Congresss campaign revolved around issues such as agrarian distress, joblessness, price rise, alleged scams such as Vyapam and law and order, especially crimes against women. And the Mandsaur firing of June 6 last year that claimed the lives of six farmers was the turning point in the partys aggressive farmers outreach.Loan waiverParty chief Rahul Gandhi promised farmers a loan waiver within 10 days of the party coming to power.If he dithers, the Chief Minister would be changed ... The farmers in the State, for the first time in 15 years, will feel that they are in power, Mr. Gandhi said at a rally in Ujjain earlier this month.However, the Congresss failure to stitch together an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Gondwana Gantantra Party could prove to be a big setback. In 2013, though the BJP won 164 of the 230 seats and the Congress 58, the difference in vote share between the two parties was 8.32%.Adding the BSPs 6.29% vote share, Congress leaders said their seats could have gone closer to the three-figure mark.The stakes are high for the BJP as winning in the Hindi heartland will build a momentum for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by demoralising the Opposition camp. The party can also hope to corner the 29 Lok Sabha seats from the State, the reason Prime Minister Modi gave an extra push to his partys efforts in the last few days of campaigning.Accusing the Congress of dragging his mothers name into the campaign (Congress MP Raj Babbar had referred to her), the Prime Minister hit back at a public meeting in Chatarpur on Saturday. The people in the Congress, you do not have the strength to fight Modi. In the last 17-18 years, I have challenged you at every instance and defeated you. And you are dragging my mother into politics, he asked."

When the heroines mother mentions Nagapattinam, Nagesh, the comedian, says: Is a cyclone arriving? That donkey comes every year anyway!For a music lover and cultural enthusiast, the composite Thanjavur district, now trifurcated into Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, always conjures up images of great composers, musicians, dancers, bronze idols, and majestic temples built by kings, particularly the Cholas. The writings of T. Janakiraman, which capture the cultural milieu of Thanjavur, further strengthen my bond with these districts. I have visited these districts several times for stories on musicians, musical instruments, bronze statues and temples, and occasionally to report on an agrarian crisis.Cyclone Gaja, which has ravaged Nagapattinam and parts of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur, painted a different picture of these districts for me. I forgot all about temples and music when I travelled the length and breadth of these districts.It looks as if the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu is being transformed into a drought-hit area, with its great past being buried in the process.The cyclone has changed the lives of the people there forever. The poor are left with nothing, and the middle class and the rich have become poor. Villages and towns look like the sets of a Hollywood war film. Only concrete structures have survived; huts and tiled roof houses are beyond repair. Electric posts and cell phone towers lie twisted. Not a single electric post has been left untouched by the speeding winds. It may take at least a month to fully restore power supply. Sea water has spoilt the groundwater in the area. The delta region has been left without drinking water and is now dependent on water supply from tankers.People have been put up in camps or in temporarily created structures at the entrance of their villages, which are connected to the main road. This draws the attention of those distributing relief material. When I visited, I saw many of the affected stopping vehicles and pleading for help. When they came across media vehicles, they requested journalists to visit their villages so that the extent of the damage could be reported and could reach the ears of the administration.The bird sanctuary in Point Calimere (Kodiyakarai in Tamil) looked like an area that had suffered heavy aerial bombing. While many birds have deserted the sanctuary, thousands have died. The trees there looked bald without their canopy. It may take months for them to look alive.At the entrance of Point Calimere stands the temple of Kodiyakarai Kuzhagar, which has been sung about by the Shaivite saint Sundaramoorthy Nayanar. Writer Kalki, in his novel Ponniyin Selvan, describes the temple in such a captivating way that I have always wanted to visit it. In a hymn, Nayanar wonders why Lord Shiva prefers to stay in a forest when there are so many places where large numbers of devotees can visit regularly. Nayanar curses himself for seeing such the pathetic sight of the Lord in the forest. I cursed the cruelty of the cyclone and left the place without visiting the temple."
5ce6112be8e3fc56af4117bb,Destruction in the delta,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/destruction-in-the-delta/article25638775.ece,2018-12-01,"When T. Govindarajan, 51, began growing coconut saplings alongside the groundnut crop on his 1.5 acre plot in Orathanadu, Tamil Nadu, nearly two decades ago, he thought he was making a safe bet on his future. A decade later, as the tall trees completely replaced the groundnut crop, his portion of land, though not large, began to provide a stable income that allowed him to dream of better things for his family. I have two sons. One in class 11, and the other in class 6. Both go to a private school. Every other investment I have been able to make is thanks to this coconut plantation.Standing under a cloudy sky that now casts a forbidding pall over the Orathanadu region near Thanjavur district, Govindarajan can only look on helplessly as his coconut farm lies flattened. It was just another casualty of Cyclone Gaja which ripped through the delta districts of the State about 10 days ago.As farm hands work to clear away fallen leaves and tree trunks, he trades stories with other farmers whose plots adjoin his. They talk about B. Sunderraj, a farmer, who is said to have committed suicide over the loss of his coconut trees. And of the plight of N. Karunanidhi, also from their village, who was planning to sell an acre of his coconut farm in order to conduct a grand wedding for his daughter but can no longer do so. They speak with an anxiety about the future, and about the possibility of planting hybrid varieties of coconut saplings that would provide yields quicker. As they talk, they cannot help but acknowledge a grim reality  that they too are not safe from the agrarian distress that has affected paddy farmers in the region.Blown awayIn the deluge of reports about the destruction wreaked by Cyclone Gaja, there is one statistic that stands out, and is also viscerally evident  that it felled 60-80% of all coconut trees in the region. Initial estimates by the State government show that around 75 lakh coconut trees were damaged either fully or partially in the gale winds.Initially, Gaja was forecast to affect the area around Chennai and Puducherry, but made landfall further south on Tamil Nadus east coast, covering the districts along the States famous East Coast Road. The districts affected most severely include Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam. The last three make up what is known as Tamil Nadus delta region, encompassing the lower reaches of the Cauvery river. Of these, Nagapattinam, the worst affected, falls on the coast line, with Gaja making a direct line inward over Tiruvarur and Thanjavur. Famous for rice farming, these areas have also begun contributing up to a quarter of Indias total coconut production, with the highest yield per hectare.In field after field of coconut trees across these districts, which have been either uprooted or stand tilting dangerously, the same story repeats itself: of marginal and small farmers affected by changes in climate and weather patterns. It has been difficult for them. When the frequent failure of the monsoons forced them to diversify their crop patterns, recurring cyclones could threaten to blow all their work away.About 30 years ago, farmers from various towns in the region, including Pattukkottai, Thambikottai, Peravurani and Orathanur began the switch to coconut plantations. The move was prompted by uncertainty over the release of water from the Mettur dam following the dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over the sharing of Cauvery river water. In subsequent years, as rainfall patterns became more erratic, farmers with smaller holdings also wanted an alternative. Says V. Narayanaswamy, a schoolteacher who also started growing coconuts on his two acre plot some years ago, For many of us, apart from the water issue, paddy farming was just too labour intensive. Regardless of how much we made on the paddy, we could still end up with a loss after paying for the labour. Farmers in the region also took a collective decision: first to grow trees such as jackfruit and coconut along with the regular crop, and then to move into coconut farming wholesale.The States granaryThis region, famous for its fertile soil, has always been known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu. But the character of its landscape is changing as fields of green paddy now share space with an expanding number of groves and orchards. To go with the burgeoning coconut plantations, farmers in towns like Vedaranyam, Katipulam, Chembodai and Pushpavanam in Nagapattinam district were also expanding farms with fruit trees such as mango, cashew nut and tamarind. However, it was coconut that made the most economic sense. Unlike paddy crop, which provides a yield every six months and is water intensive, coconut trees, which are a perennial crop, provided fruit every two months. A raw coconut would fetch anything between Rs. 12 and Rs. 18, explains Narayanaswamy, with the husk being sold at Rs. 1 a piece and the shell also being sold separately. Though the soil in this region is a bit saline and despite being away from the coastal region, the coconuts thrived. Even for a farmer with about 1.5-2 acres of land, the trees would provide upward of 3,000 coconuts every two months, Narayanaswamy says.Despite the growing supply, there was never a shortage in demand. Quite the opposite, in fact. Earlier this year, it was reported that while the demand for copra (dried coconut kernels from which oil is obtained) was growing at nearly 8% per annum, the supply of copra had been growing at just 2%. All the farmers in Thanjavur district cite the company, Marico, which makes oil under the Parachute brand, as a regular buyer. A news report from earlier this year says that the company even stepped in to help farmers, bringing in agricultural experts to advise those whose trees were not yielding enough fruit either due to pest infestation or unscientific crop management.In contrast, the fortunes of paddy farmers have continued to fluctuate. Last year , for instance, was one of relative drought, with the Southwest and Northeast monsoons failing. There were crop failures in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, and sporadic reports of farmers ending their lives. It is not hard to see why coconut farming is more attractive and appealing as a sustainable and profitable enterprise  a virtual failsafe. On the issue of cyclones, several farmers in the region say the idea of insuring their crop did not occur to them as they had never even imagined that a cyclone could cause so much damage.Those who still have vivid memories of the past recall the last major cyclone in the region, and one of a comparable magnitude  in 1952. Yet, the frequency is worrying. A report in the Down to Earth magazine says that Gaja has been the 10th major cyclone to affect Tamil Nadu in the past 16 years. The number of cyclones that hit the State between 1891 and 2002 was 54, which works out to 0.49 cyclones per year. Between 2003 and 2018, this went up to 0.63 per year, a rise of 30%.The States action plan for climate change identifies cyclones as a major concern. In the past two years alone, it has seen the effects of three devastating cyclones that have caused major losses to life, property and tree cover. These are Ockhi, which struck in Kanyakumari in June last year, Vardah, which hit Chennai in late 2016, and now Gaja. This is quite apart from the fact that the Tamil Nadu coast has always been one of the most cyclone-prone regions in the country. Back in 1968, in the Tamil blockbuster, Thillana Mohanambal, the heroines mother mentions the place name Nagapattinam. In response, Nagesh, the comedian, quips: Is a cyclone coming?Waiting for reliefDespite the region being cyclone-prone, the State government has hardly taken note of the fact that most houses in the villages of Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur are thatched roof structures. Landless labourers make up about 31% of the population of these districts, and are the worst hit in times of both drought and cyclones. This is one of the few regions in Tamil Nadu which has remained predominantly agrarian. It has not seen the expansion of industry or the trend of land being sold for real estate. Those old enough to remember the cyclone of 1952 recall similar destruction, but not much seems to have changed since then.In the immediate aftermath of Gaja, officials admit that the extent of damage has been beyond their comprehension. This despite their having taken active measures to establish emergency control centres in six coastal districts. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, an official in charge of rehabilitation in Thanjavur district, says the damage to property and infrastructure is 10 times more than what was caused by Cyclone Thane, which had hit the eastern coast along Puducherry and Cuddalore in 2011. At that time, Thane had become a reference point for disaster management officials, who had to contend with the loss of tree cover and destruction of numerous electrical posts and transmitters. If the overall damage to property in the delta districts is significantly worse, a big element of this is the destruction of virtually every thatched roof structure in these villages.Two weeks after Gaja hit, people are still camped out in temporary shelters, all along the main roads in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur, waiting for relief materials to be handed out. These camps, each comprising 20 to 30 people, display signs that announce their having been affected by Cyclone Gaja and in need of assistance.Many of them use the relief rations to cook food for people in the village. They are able to manage just one meal a day. The damage caused to the power supply means that there is no drinking water in many of these villages.In several villages, for example, Rayanallur Katakam near Tiruvarur, most residents have had to sleep in some of the concrete structures that have escaped damage. In most of the houses, the roofs have either collapsed or the floors are too damp with heavy rains continuing in the area. In almost every camp, villagers say that relief workers travel along the main roads, refusing to move inside the villages and judge the extent of damage to the smaller houses.In its report to the Centre detailing the damage caused by Gaja, the Tamil Nadu government has estimated the number of people rendered homeless to be 3.7 lakh, and houses destroyed at 3.4 lakh. The State has submitted a memorandum to the Centre seeking about Rs. 15,000 crore for restoration, rehabilitation and mitigation, and another Rs. 1,431 crore for immediate relief work. These funds are imperative in order to re-establish a basic framework of normality  getting people back to their homes and restoring the supply of drinking water and electricity.Across the cyclone-affected areas, perhaps the only sight as common as fallen coconut trees are damaged electrical transformers. According to figures available with the State government, the cyclone has damaged 201 power substations, upended 886 transformers, and snapped 53,21,506 electricity connections.The Central government has sanctioned Rs. 200 crore to overhaul power networks in the region. Nearly 25,000 workers of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) are on the job. Trucks with teams of electrical workers are a common sight now across districts in the delta region. They are often accompanied by large truckloads of concrete pillars (to reconnect the wires) that have come in from neighbouring Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Cyclone Gaja has so far claimed over 40 lives, but the toll could have been much worse had it not been for the early evacuation of 2.5 lakh people. Given the extent of damage to property, it is clear that the State needs to come up with a more comprehensive disaster preparedness plan. This should start, first of all, with the rebuilding of houses to make them more weather-resistant. A step in this direction was taken when Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced on November 29 his governments decision to build one lakh concrete houses for those who had lost their huts in the cyclone. This is a start, but much more needs to be done.He also announced that relief materials such as rice, oil and clothing would reach those would have been affected within the next five days. So far, however, the distribution of relief materials has been sporadic at best, with some in the camps claiming that they get daily rations of rice, while others in the interior areas saying that they have to wait for hours just to receive even a couple of biscuit packets.Question of compensationThere is also the larger question of damage to farm property and how the region will move forward. While paddy crop remains a huge risk, given the erratic monsoons, they can nonetheless be sown again the next year if affected by unseasonal weather. Coconut saplings, on the other hand, will need about seven or eight years to take full root and start providing a harvest. Most farmers in the region are still unclear about the level of compensation that the State government will offer for their crop.The coconut producers union in Thanjavur says that it has asked the Coconut Development Board to raise the issue with the Union Agriculture Ministry and seek compensation to the fullest possible. The union says that the damage to coconut trees as estimated by the State government is about Rs. 3,000 crore. While farmers want between relief of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 25,000 per coconut tree, petitions are being filed in district courts that seek an amount of up to Rs. 50,000 per tree. In neighbouring Nagapattinam, mango farmers, who claim that each tree used to yield a tonne of mangos in a year, are likely to demand more.Going forward, crop insurance is likely to be a key factor in encouraging farmers to rebuild all that they have lost. Unfortunately, there is very little awareness about this except among paddy farmers who are more accustomed to the process of filing for insurance.According to the Pudukkottai MLA, N. Rangarajan, who is also a farmer, the issue is being studied. There are loan schemes for coconut crops from the Coconut Development Board and under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance scheme), which has a coconut palm insurance scheme. Both offer very low amounts as compensation, he says and farmers in the region are looking at alternatives.Rangarajan adds that he plans to encourage farmers to go in for cashewnut crop instead of coconut as they have low-lying branches and less likely to be affected by strong winds. For the regions near the coast, however, there is no choice but to opt for coconut again despite the risk of another cyclone, he says, as the soil type is best suited for coconut farming.Institutes such as the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, which had initially advised and helped many of the farmers to switch to coconut farming, can also play a role in offering help and advice, he adds.For the regions near the coast, there is no choice but to opt for coconut again despite the risk of another cyclone.N.

5ce6180fe8e3fc56af411a6e,Turning over a new leaf,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/turning-over-a-new-leaf/article25639490.ece,2018-12-01,"Rishim Sachdeva wants to visit Copenhagen. He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)"
5ce5f36de8e3fc56af41073b,Cutting through the smog,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cutting-through-the-smog/article25667099.ece,2018-12-05,"Incidents of stubble burning  following the harvest of paddy crop in Punjab and Haryana  cannot be averted by imposing fines, or giving notice or giving farmers capital subsidy. Instead, the issue requires long-term vision and strategic policy interventions.Air pollution is a worry especially in north India. Stubble burning is said to be a key factor behind the formation of a dense cover of smog in this part of India though its contribution is less than 20%. Farmers are held responsible for the crisis but what is at fault are the flawed and short-sighted policies of the Central and State governments.Policy of rotationIn the 1960s, wheat-paddy crop rotation was encouraged in Punjab and Haryana to make India self-sufficient in foodgrain production. Large public investments in irrigation and adoption of high yielding varieties under the Green Revolution helped achieve the goal and make the nation food secure. However, the negative externalities in terms of land degradation, adverse soil health due to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and plummeting water tables have surfaced.The share of paddy (rice) in the gross cropped area in Punjab has increased from 6.8% in 1966-67 to almost 36.4 % in recent years, while it has increased from 4.97% to 20% in Haryana. The increase has undisputedly been at the cost of the area under maize, cotton, oilseeds and sugarcane. The policy of minimum support price for crops, in tandem with their assured procurement and input subsidy, have left farmers with no option but to follow this rotation. Besides, Punjab enacted a water conservation law in 2009 which mandates paddy sowing within a notified period (some time in June instead of the earlier practice in May). A shorter period of sowing days prohibits transplantation before a notified date, which in turn limits the window available for harvesting paddy to between 15 and 20 days. As a result, farmers who are pressed for time to sow wheat and maintain crop yield find stubble burning to be an easy and low-cost solution.One possibility to curtail the practice is to ensure that the government encourages crop diversification towards less water-intensive crops by extending price incentives and better marketing facilities. In some districts, farmers have started growing kinnow fruit but are often dissuaded due to high price volatility and the absence of a market. The policy of a price deficiency system  as initiated in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh  should be adopted to strengthen the production and marketing of alternative crops. Another option is to replicate the Telangana model of providing farmers an investment support of Rs. 8,000 per acre each year and withdraw price-based support.Punjab faces another serious problem: labour shortage. In the Agricultural Census 2011, average land-holding size has increased from 2.89 hectares in 1970-71 to 3.77 hectares in 2010-11  higher than the national average of 1.5 hectares. Paucity of labour for various farm operations is substituted by machines for which the government extends financial support.A road mapFarmers have already made investments in seed drill machines for sowing wheat after paddy harvest. Increasing pressure by the government on farmers to purchase the happy seeder to abate stubble burning adds to the cost incurred by farmers. Even if the machine is available at a subsidised rate of nearly Rs. 1 lakh, it would remain idle the whole year and become a liability in terms of maintenance. It is not a viable option for small and marginal farmers who hardly earn Rs. 60,000 in a year. Imposing a fine for burning straw is again unreasonable. The fine imposed per hectare is much lower than the cost incurred on a happy seeder.A feasible remedy could lie in the setting up of custom hiring centres or inviting companies to make investments for rental purposes. If the state provides an app-based support system, to rent out tractors and farm implements and earn additional income  there are examples of this in Nigeria and also in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  it would be akin to the Uberisation of agriculture. It would avoid stubble burning and at the same time make farming more mechanised, cost effective and a source of employment.Another far-sighted approach could be in effective use of paddy straw. Unlike wheat residue, which is used as fodder, paddy straw is non-palatable to animals as it has high silica content. Farmers, who have already been sensitised to refrain from burning residue, should be given options such as biomass generation. Now, hardly 20% of straw is managed through biomass power plants, paper and cardboard mills. The government should use geospatial techniques to identify areas where stubble burning is severe and encourage installation of biomass plants at such locations. This will not only reduce transportation costs for the firm or village entrepreneurs but also help the government achieve its target of generating 227GW based on renewable energy sources by 2022. Farmers can also be incentivised to sell the residual for additional income. The residual has uses, such as in paper, cardboard and packing material making and also hydroseeding (defiberised rice straw can be used in hydroseeding for erosion control).Seema Bathla and Ravi Kiran are Professor and Research Scholar, respectively, at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi"
5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

promise",http://www.newindianexpress.com/elections/chhattisgarh-elections/2018/dec/11/raman-singh-doling-out-rice-and-mobiles-he-saw-entertainment-in-rahuls-loan-waiver-promise-1910111.html,2018-12-11,"By PTIRAIPUR: Climbing the populism ladder, the BJP's longest-serving chief minister Raman Singh gave rice, mobiles and even medical advice almost free to a large population, but his bid for another shot at ruling Chhattisgarh saw him touching feet of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath and dismissing Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's aggressive campaign as mere ""entertainment"".He also took jibes at his predecessor Ajit Jogi's alliance with Dalit leader Mayawati for polls in his state with a large population of tribals and other backward castes, saying 'A plough-carrying farmer' does not need an 'Elephant' -- referring to the party symbols of the two leaders who had joined hands to present a third force in an otherwise direct fight between the ruling BJP and the challenger Congress.In the end, the election results showed that farmers, as also tribals and other voters of his state, did not want even 'Lotus' of the saffron party and decided to support the 'Hand' of the Congress.The results, while bringing Congress back to power in this state, also end the rule of the 66-year-old BJP stalwart, who has earned several monikers during his 15-year-long tenure -- 'Doctor Saheb' being a trained Ayurvedic medical practitioner, 'Chaur Wale Baba' for his popular rice scheme and the 'Mobile Wale Baba' for giving free smartphones to 50 lakh women and students.The last time the Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh was in the first three years of the state being carved out of Madhya Pradesh, after which it was Singh who was at the helm -- that too for 15 out of the state's overall history of 18 years.He started as a councillor in his native Kawardha (Kabirdham) district in 1983 before becoming an MLA in 1990 in the undivided Madhya Pradesh and then a Lok Sabha MP in 1999 by defeating Congress veteran Motilal Vora from what became his bastion, Rajnandgaon.Singh, who was inducted into the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government as Minister of State for Commerce and Industry in 1999, was sent back to state politics to lead the BJP in the 2003 assembly polls and steered the saffron party's bid to dethrone the Jogi government of Congress in 2003.While the then Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo, a former royal, was a front-runner for the CM's post at that time, a controversial sting operation extinguished his chances and Singh was put on the hot seat.Singh again led his party to victory in 2008 and 2013 and earned the distinction of being the longest-serving BJP CM since the party was formed in 1980.The only time he suffered a personal poll defeat was to the Congress' Yogeshwar Raj from Kawardha in the MP Assembly polls in 1998.While the Congress has regularly attacked him over issues of corruption, mainly focusing on the civil supply scam, the chit fund scandal and allegations of his son and BJP MP Abhishek Singh holding accounts in foreign banks, he managed to hold on to his own in the state with a slew of populist welfare measures.The BJP's campaign in the run-up to the two-phase assembly polls on November 12 and 20 this year totally centred around Singh, who had started his political journey has a member of the erstwhile Jan Sangh and then of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since the very beginning of the party.Born on October 15, 1952 in a Rajput family in Kawardha town in undivided Madhya Pradesh, to Vighnaharan Singh Thakur, a prominent lawyer of the town, and Sudha Singh, a housewife, Singh obtained a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree from Raipur's Government Ayurveda College in 1975.Party functionaries say that, as a doctor, Singh either charged a nominal fee from his patients or none at all.The Congress, however, has continually alleged that the state's public distribution scheme was defrauded of Rs 36,000 crore and a CBI probe led to several officials being booked in 2015.The party has also routinely raked up allegations that Singh's son, Abhishek, a Lok Sabha MP from Rajnandgaon, was mentioned in the Panama Papers leak, a claim he has denied.Left-wing extremism, however, remained the 'Achilles' heel' for the state, with the Congress claiming that 15 years of BJP rule had worsened the Naxal menace, even as Singh continued to claim that Naxalism was on life-support in the system and the affected districts would soon see peace.Singh's government came under fire when a coordinated attack in 2013 on a Congress convoy in Jhiram Valley in Sukma left several senior party leaders including Nandkumar Patel, Vidyacharan Shukla, Mahendra Karma and Uday Mudliyar dead.While the opposition and some from his own party have been critical of his working style and the behaviour of state bureaucrats, Singh, with his amiable, soft-spoken demeanour, generally managed to win the day against dissidence.In the end, political pundits say, it was Congress president Rahul Gandhi's promise of farm loan waiver that turned the elections away from Singh, despite his claims that farmers in his state were already been given zero-interest rate loans.In the meantime, there were also talks about Singh returning to the central politics though he ruled it out saying, 'Abhi Dilli Door Hai (Delhi is far away as yet)'.During the election campaign, while talking to PTI, Singh had also dismissed any impact of Gandhi's extensive campaign in the state and said the Congress chief was ""sort of an entertainment"" only for people in the state and they do not take him seriously."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: When the poll results came in on Tuesday, one thing was clear: BJP had taken a hit in rural areas. And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."
5ce5594ee8e3fc56af40b895,Invisible people: Aadhaar versus particularly vulnerable tribal groups,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/invisible-people-aadhaar-versus-particularly-vulnerable-tribal-groups/cid/1679711,2018-12-24,"More than 40 per cent of respondents in a recent survey reported Aadhaar-related problems such as ration cards being cancelled for lack of Aadhaar linkage, children being refused admission for lack of Aadhaar, NREGA wage payments being rejected, and so on (PTI)Particularly vulnerable tribal groups, earlier known as primitive tribal groups, are the sort of people you may never meet unless you take the trouble to look for them. In Jharkhand, they live in small hamlets scattered over the nooks and crannies of the states undulating forests. Without a purpose and some local guidance, it is unlikely that anything will take you there.Last month, the Sahayata Kendra (help centre for rural workers) in Manika block of Latehar district completed a house-to-house survey of all the PVTG families in the block, and also in the adjacent block of Satbarwa in Palamu district. We found 325 PVTG households  spread over 18 hamlets  in these two blocks, compared with 256 listed in the Socio-Economic and Caste Census of 2011. All of them belong to the Parhaiya community. They came across as uprooted people, who have been deprived of their traditional resources and are now struggling to latch on to new sources of livelihood.PVTG families in the area used to subsist mainly on forest-based activities such as hunting, gathering, selling minor forest products (roots, berries, wood, mahua, tendu, lac, herbs, among others) and manufacturing simple items from straw, bamboo and such. Not so long ago, the forests of Jharkhand were dense with flora and teeming with wildlife, but recent environmental degradation has taken a toll. Today, most PVTG families in Manika and Satbarwa subsist on a little farming, casual labour, and residual forest-based occupations such as making ropes or baskets. Some of them work as seasonal labourers in the rice fields or brick kilns of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and occasionally migrate to more distant places.Public facilities in PVTG hamlets are abysmal, in spite of some recent progress. None of the 18 hamlets we visited seemed to have a well-functioning school. Few had their own anganwadis, keeping child development services out of reach of most PVTG children. Health centres, banks and administrative offices are far away and public transport is nil. Government officials rarely visit these hamlets. Isolation, poverty and low education levels have turned PVTGs into sitting ducks for exploitative contractors and middlemen.In this situation, PVTG families depend critically on two entitlements for their survival: social security pensions and food rations from the public distribution system.Under a Supreme Court order of May 2, 2003, in the right to food case, Antyodaya ration cards are to be distributed to all PVTG households. This entitles them to 35 kgs of foodgrain per month from the PDS at a nominal price; in fact, for free in the case of Jharkhand. Among the 325 households we surveyed, 87 per cent were on the Antyodaya list. Further, Antyodaya households reported that they were receiving the bulk of their PDS entitlements: about 33 kgs per month on an average. This is good news of sorts in a state where PDS grain used to be siphoned off with abandon by corrupt dealers. Even the reduced levels of pilferage, however, are unacceptable, and a significant minority of PVTG households is still deprived of Antyodaya cards.Turning to pensions. All PVTG families in Jharkhand are entitled to a pension of Rs 600 per month  if not under an existing old-age, widow or disability pension scheme, then under the state governments special pension scheme for PVTGs. The survey, however, reveals that only two thirds of all PVTG households in the area are receiving a pension. One reason for this is that many pensions have been discontinued in recent years owing to Aadhaar-related problems. The main problem is that all pensioners in Jharkhand are now required to meet the e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) banking norms. This means that Aadhaar must be seeded in their bank account and also that the seeding must be verified through biometric authentication. In the absence of biometric facilities at the bank, pensioners have to go to a Pragya Kendra (customer service centre) for authentication, take a certificate from there to the bank, and then hope that the bank will complete the formalities in good time. Lapses, errors, glitches and delays abound. For pensioners, especially for the elderly, these hurdles are daunting. Many of them do not know what they are supposed to do or how to seek assistance if a problem arises. None of this has changed  so far  after the recent Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar.In our small sample of 325 households, 28 pensioners were currently deprived of their pension, mainly owing to Aadhaar-related problems. Another 30 or so had been temporarily deprived of their pension for several months, sometimes more than a year, at the time when they were struggling to meet the e-KYC norms. In cases of temporary discontinuation, there are no retrospective payments for the gap months after a pension is resumed.The discontinuation of pensions is just one among a long series of Aadhaar-related problems that emerged from the survey. Examples include inability to get an Aadhaar card because of blindness or deformed hands, ration cards being cancelled for lack of Aadhaar linkage, children being refused admission for lack of Aadhaar, NREGA wage payments being rejected, bank accounts being frozen for lack of e-KYC, and problems of biometric authentication at the Pragya Kendras. More than 40 per cent of the respondents had experienced problems of this sort.Aside from the pathologies of Aadhaar, PVTG families have to contend with merciless harassment from local exploiters. In Uchvabal village, a para-teacher, Krishna Ram, was caught trying to siphon off childrens scholarships. In Sewdhara, a PDS dealer, Dinesh Rai, measures food rations using a recycled tin instead of a weighing machine, pruning them to 31 kg per month instead of 35 kg. Pragya Kendra operators routinely take bribes for services, and one of them (in Namudag) tried to extort Rs 2,000 from an illiterate woman who needed help to apply for a pension. Another one, in Rewat Khurd, even siphoned off a Rs 56,000 housing subsidy from the account of an elderly widow who blindly lent her thumbprint for this purpose.These and other acts of exploitation were brought up at a public hearing held in Manika on December 13. Block-level officials, however, did their best to protect the exploiters. The block supply officer, for instance, acted like Dinesh Rais well-wisher. Hopefully, the district administration will crack the whip, but who knows, crooks often have patrons in high places.The experience of the Parhaiyas in Latehar and Palamu confirms something we have already learnt from other states: the PVTGs need special support and it is perfectly possible to help them. The existing support systems, however, are patchy and inadequate. Indeed, in spite of receiving some assistance from pensions and the PDS, the Parhaiyas continue to live in the shadow of hunger. Almost half of the respondents said that some members of the households had to sleep hungry at some point in the preceding three months, and as many as 10 per cent said that they had gone hungry many times in that period. The situation was better among households that had a ration card and a pension, but even they were not exempt from food insecurity. There is a strong case for raising pension amounts and expanding Antyodaya entitlements without delay. Strict action against those who exploit PVTGs would also help. Taking a longer view, PVTG hamlets need better public facilities, especially well-functioning schools and anganwadis. Failing that, PVTG children are unlikely to live much better than their parents when they grow up.The author is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University"

People from all over the world are here. The occasion is the 715th urs of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya , which began on Monday.For Sufis, death is the end of mortal life and union with the almighty. Urs is a celebration of that. Hazrat Nizamuddins urs began with the fateh dua (prayer), followed by a qawwali performance and langar distribution.This year, a delegation of about a hundred people has come from Pakistan to take part in the urs. Only last week, the Pakistan High Commissioner had visited the dargah to present a chaddar.Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia preached and practised the principles of humanity and brotherhood without any discrimination. That is why people irrespective of religion, caste and creed come here in large numbers. You will find that 70% of the crowd here is non-Muslim, said Syed Aziz Nizami, the sajjada nashin.Kanwal Narain Sharma (84) has been distributing tea among the devotees for the past 65 years. The desire to serve tea here every day is my hunger, Sharma said, handing out biscuits to the younger crowd. People come here when they feel troubled or face any problem. And I wholly believe in his (Nizamuddin Aulia) power to heal, Sharma said as someone standing behind him added, Badshahon ka badshah (king of kings).Syed Mohammad has come all the way from Kabul. I come every year. The whole experience brings me great inner peace, he said.There are many from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who come here every year despite difficulties. The difficulties seem worth it at the end. I visit without fail every year, said Mohammad Hasan, a driver from Bihar.At the dargah, the music of qawwali melds with voices of people lining up to receive the days langarbiryani. Nizami says the qawwals arent hired by the dargah but they all volunteer22 or 24 groups, all famous ones from all over the country. At the Urs Mahal outside, musical performances are held separately.Its chilly outside, but hot tandoors and grills cooking naans and kebabs provide some warmth.The urs celebration would continue till December 28, beginning every day at 11am. The qawwalis would continue till late into the night as would the langar and tabarruk, a kind of prasad in the form of sweet rice or gram flour chappati.The nearest metro station to reach the dargah is JLN Stadium."

He asked people if ""some people were being troubled because of a tradition of allowing the middlemen.""When the gathering responded with applause, Modi said for the prosperity of the nation, some pain has to be borne to keep middleman at bay. He also lauded the Union telecom ministry for launching a digital pension project, saying it would benefit pensioners immensely, reflecting the citizen-centric approach of his government.""This is our approach to minimum government and maximum governance,"" the Prime Minister said. People can now track the pension status on their mobile phone and don't have to made rounds of offices for pension-related issues.Referring to strides taken in different sectors under the present regime, the Prime Minister said internet connectivity had increased to 65 per cent in the past two years and India now had 50 crore active internet users. This, he said, was special because the growth of internet was equally big and significant in villages.Under his government, he said, 1.25 lakh panchayats have been connected by broadband of which 29,000 villages are in Uttar Pradesh.Purchases by government departments had been shrouded in doubts and charges of favouritism, he said, adding government's e-market place (GEM) can enable the smallest of traders to sell their products. ""This is the best platform for the MSME sector,"" Modi said.Online loans up to Rs 1 crore are now being disbursed in 59 minutes without any red-tape or exploitation, the Prime Minister said.The quality of Ganga water has considerably improved as tested by scientists. He said while schemes had been made for long, the Ganga remained polluted, but not any longer. ""Jab niyat saaf hai to Ganga bhi saaf hogi (if the intention is clear, the Ganga will be cleaner),"" he said as people applauded and raised slogans of 'Har Har Mahadev'.Talking about the industry in Varanasi and nearby areas, Modi said there were 1.5 lakh weavers and 70,000 power looms in the region, and that right from funds to facilitation in marketing their produce, the state and the Union government were working out things for the weavers. ""We will keep extending job opportunities through such schemes,"" he said.Uttar Pradesh's MSME Minister Satyadev Pachauri informed the Prime Minister that so far loans worth Rs 5345 crore had been given to 65,000 artisans in the state and that Rs 75,000 crore loans will be disbursed by banks in the state.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stones for 14 infrastructure projects and inaugurated 12 projects, totalling Rs 279 crore.Earlier Modi inaugurated the International Rice Research Institute and interacted with scientists."
5ce4ff78e8e3fc47cee084f3,Monthly income support programme: PM Modi's alternative to farm loan waivers?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/31/monthly-income-support-programme-pm-modis-alternative-to-farm-loan-waivers-1918771.html,2018-12-31,"By BloombergPrime Minister Narendra Modi is studying three options, including a cash handout for farmers, people with knowledge of the matter said, as his administration seeks to ease agrarian distress and shore up popular support ahead of next years general election.The government is weighing options including a monthly income support program for farmers, a cash handout plan for the shortfall between the actual sale price and state-set procurement rate and a revamped crop insurance program, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as they arent authorized to speak to the media. The final program could be one of these or a combination of all three.The plan for the handout comes soon after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was voted out in key state elections this month, forcing Modi to draw up a course correction before federal polls due by May. The government, which has already exceeded the annual budget gap aim, has little room for spending in the current year, having forgone some tax revenue on goods and services following the defeat.The income support program involves a certain amount as monthly payout to farmers and could benefit as many as 150 million farm households, a key bloc that can influence the election outcome.Distress SalesIn July, the government raised support prices of crops such as cotton, soybeans and paddy rice to ensure farmers get at least 50 per cent more than the estimated production costs. While that has largely failed to shield farmers from distress sales due to lack of sufficient state procurement, the government now plans to pay cash to farmers if their produce sells at a discount to the government-set rates.Another alternative being considered is a revamp of the crop insurance program. The changes could include a reduction in premium paid by farmers, inclusion of more crops to avail state incentives and bringing tenant farmers under the cover.Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik didnt respond to two calls made to his mobile phone. An agriculture ministry spokeswoman declined to comment.Modi, who is seeking a second term, has to win over farmers before the election. They have been hit by falling crop prices and rising input costs, forcing them to hit the streets seeking debt waivers and protection from distress sales. Add to it, the pressure from opposition Indian National Congress which waived off farm loans after wresting power from the BJP in three states earlier this month.The income support program could help reduce poverty in a country thats home to a third of the worlds poor and still spends less than 2 per cent of its gross domestic product on social security.With the government already exceeding its budgeted annual deficit in October, any sops will need to be balanced with possible reductions in spending to achieve the fiscal gap target of 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product."
