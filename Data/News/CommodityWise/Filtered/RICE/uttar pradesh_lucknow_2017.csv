Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

However an average Rs 20-30 drop has been observed in dal prices.Whole sale dealers and vendors say that inflow of daal into the state from Andhra Pradhesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradhes and Uttar Pradesh has increased causing a crash in price. The price has already decreased by over Rs 20 among all dal varieties. Were expecting the price to drop even further as the market is also getting weaker, said Rama Murugan, a wholesale dealer.At retail outlets, one kg of toor dal that was sold at around Rs 120 now sells for Rs 90-100, green dal faces a similar drop. Urad and dal and Bengal which sold at around Rs 140 has come down to Rs 120.Rice price, on the other hand, has seen an overall increase as the availability within the state is receding. The rice that is circulated within the state is the one that comes from Kancheepuram as the farmers had a failed crop. This has particularly increased the price of idly rice that grows there, said the owner of a rice mandy in Red Hills. The availability of rice is so low that we are bringing rice from Kolkotta, he added.Ponni rice that was sold between Rs 48 and Rs 50 now sells between Rs 54 and 56. Sona rice that was sold at around Rs 48 is being sold at around Rs 52. Idly rice which was sold at Rs 30 on average has now shot up to Rs 36 and Rs 38. The rice dealers are expecting the price to shoot up even further as Pongal comes closer."

Her body was found half-buried in a drain at an isolated spot behind the Golden Nest Complex in Bhayander on Thursday.Around 8pm on Monday, the 24-year-old main accused, who used to load goods in the tempo of the victim's father, purchased a bar of chocolate from a grocery store and used it to lure the girl.

For three hours a day, he also works at another bakery. Express Photo by Arul Horizon Ansari at work at his bakery near the Pune Railway Station. For three hours a day, he also works at another bakery. Express Photo by Arul HorizonHe was 11 when he ran away from home in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh along with his elder brother. The year must have been 1997 or 1998, he doesnt remember exactly. The siblings came to Pune and found employment at Imperial Bakery  one of the biggest bakers in the city at the time  and started working as helps at a salary of Rs 300 a month.It was a novelty for me this whole bakery business. I had never seen the inside of a bakery before. This one was huge. They used to process 300 gunny bags full of flour everyday. I found to my surprise that I had a talent for baking, for handling the dough. And from the second month itself, my salary increased to Rs 350. The owner, Parsee, was impressed, says Tabaraq Ansari, around 32 and a father of four.Ansari is a khameer baker  he makes pav, doughnuts, breads, buns, and toasts. I dont know anything about biscuits or cookies. We have another cook for them, he adds.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAs per an estimate of those in the business, Pune and its outskirts have over 1,500 bakeries. Almost all those working as cooks and helpers here are migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and areas around Delhi. Ansari estimates that he has worked in over a dozen bakeries in Pune since landing here two decades ago.On December 30, six people suffocated to death at Punes Bakes N Cakes bakery in Kondhwa as the two exits were locked from outside. All six, who were in their 20s and all from Uttar Pradesh, were sleeping in the loft. Of them, one was visiting his brother employed at the factory.Ansari says that almost all bakeries, depending on their size, employ four to eight people who, without exception, stay and sleep on the premises.While its the responsibility of the Labour Commissioner, which grants operating licences to business establishments, to check the working conditions, Ansari cant recall a single instance when any official  from the Labour or any other department  visited any of the bakeries where he has worked. Even after the Kondhwa incident, no checks have been announced.The bakery that currently employs Ansari, for Rs 240 per day, is among the busiest in the area if not the biggest. As its close to the Pune Railway Station, its open for business day and night. The shop is on the ground floor while baking is done on the first floor. The space in the large kitchen is almost completely occupied by stacks of greasy black baking trays, and imposing bakery equipment such as moulders, mixers and ovens.Its in between these trays, or on the kitchen platform, even on the exhaust hood, that Ansari and the seven other workers sleep. Those sleeping on the floor use mattresses, others blankets or bedsheets. We use whatever is provided by the owner, says a young worker.As the staff work in shifts, at any given time, half of them sleep as the other half work around them. Two others and I work from 11 in the night till dawn, and go to sleep around 7 am. Another cook takes over in the morning, says Ansari.His day begins around 10.30 am, when he gets up and freshens himself in the dingy toilet on the ground floor that the bakery staff share with workers of a neighbouring hotel, which is also run by the bakery owner. There is no power in the toilet and bathroom block  a kuchcha structure and dark even at noon  and no water. The staff carry water in buckets from outside.The workers of the hotel sleep not far from the toilet. They dont mind the darkness, they say; it helps them sleep after their late-night hours.After freshening up, Ansari and the others who have worked at night head for tea and breakfast to a hawker outside. The lunch and dinner they cook themselves, in the hotels kitchen.Ansaris first shift lasts from 11 am to 3 pm, when the manager gives him a list of the items that need to be replenished in the shop below, and he starts work on them.After lunch, around 4 pm, Ansari cleans himself up and steps across the road to another, much smaller, bakery. He works there for the next three hours, earning Rs 150. Given the low wages, he says, he needs every penny.Ansari says his employer doesnt object. Most of us work at other bakeries. The owners dont say anything as they can silence us whenever we complain with, But we let you work at the other place too.After returning, Ansari has the food, mostly rice and daal, which is cooked by the bakery staff in turns. He lies down now in a corner of the bakery to catch some sleep.Its at 11 pm that his main work shift begins. For the next six hours, he makes buns, bread and other products to make sure there is enough maal (consignment) for sale till the next evening. He has to meet the demand slip that he got from the manager earlier in the day.Ansaris village lies about 50 km north of Gorakhpur. He and his brother, two years older, left home after some trouble in the family, he says. Neither had ever been to a school; with six children, their farm labourer father struggled to keep the family afloat. Few children in the village ever studied, Ansari adds, with most boys just waiting it out till it was time for them to leave for Pune or Mumbai to earn a living like the elders.By the time Ansari and his brother made their first visit back to the village 17 months after leaving it, Pune was home.This is how it is for most of us from UP who work here, be it in the bakery or the catering line, Ansari says. If you are unmarried, you visit once in 16-18 months. If you are married, you go once in four months.On his second visit home, when he was 16, Ansari got married. He was earning Rs 600 a month at the time. Humaare yehan shaadi jaldi hoti hai. Tab bhi, aur abhi bhi (Marriages happen early among us. It was the same then, and now), says Ansari.His brother worked with him at a bakery for the first two years. After that, he returned home and sat around doing nothing. Later, he left for Saudi Arabia and started working there, Ansari says.The 32-year-old fears there is no future for bakers like him who dont know modern baking techniques or about the exotic breads and cakes that have captured the market. He also feels bakeries now rely more and more on machines than on men with knowledge.I get Rs 240 a day despite my experience. Also, theres no job security. As long as the owner likes the taste, its alright. If I go wrong somewhere, he will sack me, and the next day Ill be on the road, he says.He also complains that the youth now are not willing to learn. They work for a month, collect their salaries, and the next day, disappear. The manager has to then go hunting for fresh boys, says Ansari, who has to train the new staff at his bakery.Ansari often visits his village, where his four children and wife stay with his elder brothers family. While his eldest child is 16 years old, the youngest is nine. Whenever I get bored, I go home and stay there as long as I want, says Ansari.He is determined though to ensure that all his children study, he says. I want my daughter and three sons to have a proper education. As a parent, that is my responsibility. Although we cant control what they will get in life  its destiny  its our duty to try help them secure a good future.His family has never been to Pune, and he has never thought of bringing them here. Its beyond my capacity. If I stay alone, I can do some adjustment, live in cheap places, save as much as I can and send home. If I bring them here, I will have to borrow money just to meet the daily needs, he says.The December fire that killed six bakery workers doesnt worry him too much, Ansari adds. It was a one-off incident, and death can catch you anywhere, he shrugs. That was their fate. If you are destined to die, you can die walking on the road or sitting in an AC office. I havent seen many accidents in my 20 years in this business.Since their bakery is open round the clock, it is never locked, unlike in the case of the six who died.Well past midnight, half the bakery staff start preparing to retire for the day. As the trays bang around them, the dough moulders thunder on, the staff still at work shout over the machine hum, and in a corner, a dough lump is slammed against a stone top, the tired workers dont stir.No burn marks were found on the six who died in the bakery fire, police found. They suffocated to death, in sleep.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The term from Hindustani language means traditions. Talk about the colourful traditions of couture and cuisine of India. Talk about much-remembered dishes from Awadh, Dilli, Punjab and Hyderabad. Its at a food festival that you can relish all at the same table. Rivayaat, the food festival, by Trident Hyderabad at its restaurant Kanak is highlighting authentic recipes from different parts of the country.Noteworthy about the food promotion is that none of dishes are overpowered by spices or oil. The taste is balanced much like ghar ka khana that makes you feel asking for that extra helping of Punjabi Matar Pulao. The rice was done with butter and crushed fried onions. It tasted well with Puran Singh Ke Dhabe Wali Chicken Curry. The curries served had neither too thick nor too thin gravy. Mahi Kaliya  a preparation of bekti fish of Bengal was prepared in onion and tamarind gravy along with other spices. The result was a succulent and juicy fish piece.The Lucknowi Dal served along side the rice was roasted and then cooked which gave it a smoky flavour and home-like taste. Baigan Ka Bharta was simple as was Sarson Ka Saag which we enjoyed with Makke ki Roti. In the appetizers you must not miss Kumbh Ki Gilavat as its quite a challenge to find out that its not a mutton kebab, but is made from mushrooms. The taste is as good as the mutton kebab that dissolves in mouth. The festival is on till January 25. Time: 7 pm  11:30 pm. Charges: for the set menu is `2,100+ per head"

The demand for Chutkas variety of manjha  the abrasive string used in kite-flying contests  has skyrocketed for the first time in years.The reason? A number of prohibitions placed on nylon strings made by the competition, the most recent being an interim ban by the National Green Tribunal, has come as a godsend for Chutka and others like him in the locality.The demand for Bareilly ka manjha has increased since last year, when these bans came into effect, and we hope the NGT action boosts it further, says Inam Ali, a kite trader in the old city area, adding that he doesnt use any prohibited ingredient  nylon, glass or metal powder  to make his product.The String Story Manjha manufacturers date back to over two centuriesAt least 30,000 people are involved in the manufacture and trade of manjha in the cityMost of the families involved in the business dont have any other source of incomeThe trade has an annual turnover of around Rs 50-60 croreBareillys manjha is crafted through a relatively natural processThe morning ritual of most manjha manufacturers in Bareilly is boiling pots of coarse rice into thick pasteThe end-product is a sturdy manjha capable of holding its own against rivals in tough kite-flying competitionsThe nylon manjha  made with synthetic materials  is banned in several states, including Gujarat, Maharastra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It is also called the Chinese manjha, presumably because it was first introduced in the Indian market by traders from the neighbouring country.The nylon manjha was banned in Maharashtra in 2014. So, from 2015, we began coming here to buy our wares, remarks Dheeraj Sahu, a manjha trader from Nagpur.Sahu is not the only one. Over 200 of my biggest clients are from places outside Uttar Pradesh, says Ali.Read | Child killed by manjha couldnt even shout, died in fathers lapThe Bareilly ka manjha, on the other hand, is crafted through a relatively natural process. The morning ritual of most Muslim households near Hussainebagh  a major manjha production area in Bareilly  comprises boiling pots of coarse rice into thick paste. The grain is then kneaded with psyllium husk, stone powder, surma (kohl), colour and a few herbs into luddi (dough). In the next step, the luddi is smeared over cotton strings tied between two wooden poles and then left to dry for a few hours.The end-product is a sturdy manjha capable of holding its own against rivals in tough kite-flying competitions.There was a time when powdered glass was included in the luddi, but not anymore, says Asib. Now, powdered marble or ceramic fragments are used instead.So, how are the cotton strings coated with marble? First, the hard stone is crushed into miniscule grains by hand, using a mortar and pestle. It is then sieved to obtain even finer pieces. These fragments are then re-ground using mechanical or electric machinery until a smooth powder is produced. This is sold to manjha manufacturers, who use it to strengthen the string.A labourer works at a manufacturing unit in Bareilly. (Sachin Saini/Hindustan Times)Though Bareilly ka manjha is what traders from other states covet the most, the nylon version is also in high demand. It has dominated the local market ever since its introduction in 2009. While one gitta (yarn) of nylon manjha costs Rs 200, the price of the same amount of Bareilly manjha comes up to Rs 600. This is why people prefer to buy the nylon version, says Haji Puttan, a trader from Kila area.There is another reason why the nylon manjha continues to be a hit with kite flyers. According to Kamaal Asib, president of the Manjha Majdur Hath Karigar Samiti, it has fared much better than its Bareilly counterpart in lab tests as far as strength is concerned. When experts at the North India Textile Research Association laboratory rubbed a strand of Bareilly manjha with a standard string, it broke after 96 smooth cuts. The nylon manjha took 18,000 cuts to break, he says.Read | Killer manjha: Delhi govt bans kite-flying thread after 3 deaths in two daysHowever, this very strength is also why the nylon string is considered dangerous by the authorities. The rise in its popularity was accompanied by an increase in manjha-related mishaps, with over 30 such instances being recorded in Bareilly alone. Finally, the Allahabad high court issued a ban on the sale of nylon manjha in November 2015.However, due to the authorities laxity in implementing the ban, nylon manjha continues to be sold openly. Two children were killed in neighbouring Delhi last August, when their throats were slit by strings of kites being flown as part of a competition.We have our limitations what will be eat if we do not sell these strings?Traders say they cant stop selling the nylon manjha just because of the ban. Majboori hai, nahi bechenge tho khayenge kya? Agar sarkar me himmat hai to ye manjha bane wali company ko band karwa de (We have our limitations what will be eat if we do not sell these strings? If the government has the courage, it must ban the firms that produce nylon manjha), remarks Ali.One can see the logic in his statement; the bans talk only of selling nylon manjha, not their manufacture. In fact, Karnataka  which banned the sale of the product in July 2016  happens to be its manufacturing hub. The biggest synthetic manjha maker  Mono Kite  is based in state capital Bengaluru.Mono Kite general manager Yogesh Saxena admits that Uttar Pradesh is their biggest market, but denies reports that their product is dangerous. Our manjha is completely biodegradable. We care for nature as well as our customers, Saxena tells HT over the phone, adding that their nylon string is manufactured with machines imported from Germany in adherence to strict research and development guidelines.Though sales have taken a hit after the bans, the company still produces six to eight tonnes of nylon manjha every month. The ban is on the sale of manjha, not its production, he says.Read | When manjha was just about kite-flying"

The price of the popular brand, which was Rs. 32 a kg last month, has touched Rs. 42 a kg in the retail markets.Crop failure of this paddy variety has been blamed for the shortage and the next crop is due for harvest only in April.The commodity mainly arrives from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana though Tamil Nadu and Karnataka partly meet the demand.The crop has failed in the latter two states too following drought. This could compel merchants in the southern districts to depend on rice varieties from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, which are not popular among consumers.Varieties from Uttar Pradesh sell around Rs. 32 a kg and that from Punjab Rs. 33 a kg in the retail markets. Andhra rice, which was earlier used only in Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and parts of Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts, is now gaining popularity in Ernakulam and Thrissur too.Rice merchants here said on average three trains carrying 30,000 sacks of Andhra Pradesh rice used to reach Kollam a week. Now, only two trains have come in the past two weeks.Retail merchants, who source rice from wholesalers, said since the past two or three days they were unable to get the required quantity. Wholesalers said they had to meet the demand of their clients and there was a shortage of stock.There is also uncertainty over the stock position of the Jaya variety rice in Andhra Pradesh. There are concerns that the rice variety may go out of stock in the wholesale market if a train carrying the commodity fails to arrive this week.Dealers said the situation was critical. Such a shortage of Andhra rice in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram was witnessed last in April 2008, the wholesalers said."

Rahul, who picked the famous Urdu saying to get back at Modi, was not present in the Lok Sabha when the Prime Minister gave the speech in which he defended the demonetisation drive and criticised the Congress governments and the Nehru-Gandhi family. The Congress vice-president was in Meerut to address a campaign rally with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. After tweeting the saying, Rahul took to the social networking site again to say: ""PM mocks the tragedy of Uttarakhand and insults freedom struggle but has no answers to the opposition questions."" The Prime Minister had referred to last night's tremor in Uttarakhand to heap scorn on Rahul for saying earlier that there would be an earthquake if he spoke on his allegation of personal corruption against Modi. ""The earthquake finally reached Delhi. If someone sees service in SCAM, even mother earth gets angry,"" Modi had said. The Congress sought to turn the tables on Modi by alleging he had been insensitive to the people of Uttarakhand. Harish Rawat, the chief minister of the election-bound state, said: ""The Prime Minister should be ashamed for making fun of the earthquake in Uttarakhand. Despicable statement."" Turning Modi's comments into a poll plank, the Congress posted several messages on its official Twitter handle. ""Modi using natural calamity like earthquake to make a political point shows the depths to which he will descend to. The Prime Minister thinks even Parliament is an election platform. Has no respect for parliamentary dignity,"" a tweet said. The party held a media conference where spokesperson Gaurav Gogoi said: ""Our prayers and sympathy are with the people of Uttarakhand, who are still recovering from the shock of the earthquake. The people will feel hurt and humiliated by the Prime Minister's tone of humour and mockery."" Gogoi lamented that the Prime Minister had not expressed any sympathy for those who lost their lives because of the demonetisation. Many Congress MPs alleged Modi had ""failed miserably"" to defend the demonetisation. Rahul posted five questions for the Prime Minister: ""Amount of black money recovered after November 8, 2016? Economic losses to the nation and number of jobs lost? How many people died due to demonetisation and has compensation been paid? Who all did the PM consult on demonetisation; why were experts, economists, RBI not consulted? Who all deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in bank accounts in six months preceding November 8?"" Congress members kept interrupting the Prime Minister during his speech, asking questions on alleged corruption involving the BJP like the Vyapam scam, the Vijay Mallya default and escape, the mining scam in Rajasthan and the graft over rice distribution in Chhattisgarh."

As Pusa Institute is situated in Delhi, there has been continuous development of agriculture in the adjoining States like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Two more agricultural research institutes, in Assam and Jharkhand, have been opened for the holistic development of agriculture nationwide, he said.Because of the adoption of crop varieties developed by Pusa Institute, meaningful and multiple changes had come about, he said. Earlier, we depended on other countries for grain, but now we are helping other countries by providing [them] food security. With the cultivation on 10 million hectares of wheat varieties developed by the IARI, 50 million tonnes of wheat was being produced. Basmati rice accounts for Rs. 22,000 crore in the agricultural exports totalling Rs. 1 lakh crore, and of this, the Basmati varieties developed by Pusa Institute account for 90%, he said.A state-of-the-art automated phenomics facility, established by the IARI, would be useful in studying the environmental stress. This facility will be used for developing plants that yield more by consuming less water and fertilizer, he said.Mr. Singh said the ICAR-IARI had developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective technology for making waste water pollution-free and useful for irrigation."

The last meeting is scheduled in Guwahati on February 15, sources said. Other places where the consultations were held are Delhi, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Bengaluru.With India having lakhs of people suffering from micro-nutrient deficiency related health disorders such as neural tube defects, blindness and anaemia, food fortification has been on the government radar for long as a viable option to address these problems.Past medical research in India suggested that fortifying food with multiple micro-nutrients or iron improved the level of biological markers like iron and haemoglobin. Multiple fortification was recommended over single fortificants because of increased health benefits.Members of the new FSSAI panel are Ambrish Mithal from Medanta Hospital; C S Pandav and R K Marwaha (Retd) from AIIMS, Delhi; Anura Kurpad from St Johns Medical College, Bengaluru; Yogeshwar Shukla from Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow; HPS Sachdev from Sita Ram Bharatia Institute of Science and Research, Delhi; K M Nair from National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad; P Ramachandran from Nutrition Foundation of India; Sumit Arora from National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal; Sirimavo Nair from the M S University, Baroda, and Abhya Harsulkar from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Pune."

In 2016-17, it was proposed to cover 39,600 students, according to an official UP government data on planning.With nearly 20 crore people, Uttar Pradesh remains a populous state.

58f6e5f77be9e031f13bdb04,Muslim voters hold the key to Rohilkhand title,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/muslim-voters-hold-the-key-to-rohilkhand-title/articleshow/57116491.cms,2017-02-13,"LUCKNOW: With seven out of 11 districts of Rohilkhand going to the polls in the second phase on February 15 having more than 30% Muslim population, it will be a real test for an aggressive minority outreach by both Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party, facing an anti-demonetization sentiments among voters, would be banking on a split in minority votes as a consolidation may spell trouble for it in this phase.Rohilkhand has always been dominated by Muslims and a number of constituencies out of 67 foing to the polls in Phase 2 have more than 50^% population of the community. In districts like Rampur (50.6%), Moradabad (50.8%), Bijnor (43%) and Amroha (40.8%), the share of the community almost reaches the halfway mark. In 2012, when the Muslims voted en mass for SP, it won 35 out of 67 seats while BJP could win just 10. The BSP had 11 seats in this region and now if it has to return to power in Lucknow, it will have to consolidate its position among Muslims to form a winning caste chemistry of the Dalits and the Muslims.Both BSP and SP have started claiming support from Muslim clerics and ulema to send a message among the community voters that they are the best placed to defeat BJP. While Ulama Council, shia cleric Kalbe Jawad and Delhi Jama Masjid's Imam Maulana Bukhari pronounced their support for BSP, a large number of clerics and ulema, led by the principal of prominent seminary Nadwa-ul-Islam, Maulana Saeed-ur-Rahman Azami Nadwi and imam of Aisbagh Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali met CM Akhilesh Yadav and extended their support to him.For BJP, this region is most difficult to win as it faces the distraught workers of small-scale and unorganised trades and Muslims united against the party. With thousands of poor working in the zari , wooden furniture and flute-making industries in dark and dingy lanes and bylanes to make two ends meet on one side and farmers prospering from paddy, sugar cane wheat and milk production on the other, Rohilkhand region, going to polls in the second phase of voting for the 2017 assembly elections presents a picture of contrast.Demonetisation has, however, hit the haves as well as have-nots of the region. If a large part of the manpower is sitting idle in the unorganised sector and the furniture and zari cottage industries, lakhs of farmers are hit hard too as they are finding no buyers for their farm produce. ""We have no orders though the marriage season is at its peak,"" lamented Suresh Agarwal, owner of a cane furniture shop, recalling how he had to hire additional workers to deliver the orders of furniture in the previous season.Badaun district in this region is a spot of prosperity for the white revolution being largest producer of milk in the region, while in Bareilly , Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Lakhimpur and Shahjahanpur, the impact of green revolution has over the decades changed the socio-economic condition. A good number of Sikh families of Lakhimpur and parts of Shahjahanpur have siblings in the US and Canada. The farm houses and resorts in this terai belt of the state have best of electronic gadgets and cars in their possession. More than two-third of 120 sugar mills are in this part and with highest production of sugar cane and paddy it is also called the rice bowl and sugar belt.But delving deeper, the economic condition of those making a livelihood out of zari work and kajal (kohl) manufacture has not improved in the past 40-50 years and they are still dependent on daily wages. This is the reason petty workers in the unorganised sector of Rohilkhand are worst hit by the demonetisation.For the ruling Samajwadi Party too, the challenge is to protect its citadel. The party has now allied with the Congress which won just three seats. The prestige of Dharmendra Yadav, Samajwadi Party MP from Badaun and cousin of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is at stake in the region. Like in many places, the ruling party is facing stiff resistance from rebels.Captain Arjun Singh , who was well placed in US and a professional pilot was roped in by Akhilesh Yadav to join his party and contest election. But he was denied ticket because his father Narendra Yadav is a Mulayam loyalist. Now, Arjun Singh is contesting from the Dataganj assembly constituency independently and challenging the SP-Congress alliance.After Badaun, the party's prestige is at stake in Rampur a district represented by powerful minister Mohammed Azam Khan who is contesting this time along with his son, while Azam's wife is already a Rajya Sabha member. Azam is so tied up in his home district for his and his son's elections that even so close to the third phase of polls he has not yet stepped out of his home to campaign for other candidates of the party.Across Rohilkhand, the Congress hopes hinge on its firebrand leader Imran Masood of Saharanpur. Masood has worked hard in the district and adjoining constituencies and Congress had gave him free hand in ticket distribution. Former Union minister Jitin Prasada is also contesting from Tilhar assembly while the sitting MLA of the party Sanjay Kapoor is seeking his re-election."

5923bd457be9e01fcef058f8,Our language crisis,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596592/our-language-crisis.html,2017-02-15,"Our language crisisBy Vikas Kumar, Feb 16, 2017, 0:12 ISTThe post-colonial elite of India favoured English in the educational and economic spheres, while the state and politicians were nominally committed to Indian languages. As a result, more than seven decades after independence, the question of the medium of instruction in educational institutions remains unresolved. And, we continue to struggle with poor learning outcomes, high drop-out rates, and the lack of inclusion of the masses in higher education because of, among other things, our inability to provide quality education through mother tongues.The association of English with material success in the popular imagination and the neglect of intellectual activity in Indian languages have not only allowed the former to thrive at the expense of our languages, it has also made millions believe that our languages (as well as the knowledge ingrained in them) are worthless. I am reminded of a young student leader, whom I met in a remote town of Nagaland. Without any prompting, he told me that his grandparents were backward because they did not know English (I asked him if Europeans should be considered backward because they do not know Naga languages).Nagaland was the first state to adopt English as its official language and the medium of instruction in schools. However, five decades after Nagaland aligned its state policy with the elite preference, a majority of its people are not proficient in English even as their own languages remain neglected. The condition of other states, where private institutions took the lead in introducing English in schools, is not better.In fact, irrespective of their states language policy, people have been going out of their way to learn English. An acquaintance of mine in Etawah (Uttar Pradesh) approached a chemistry teacher, who was barely conversant with English. He was given to believe that the teacher, who could effortlessly pronounce names of chemical compounds, was best suited to help him pick up spoken English.Phas Gaye Re Obama, a 2010 Hindi film, takes us through the world of spoken English courses exemplified by Tyagi English Coaching Class. The photos of US presidents, sportsmen, entrepreneurs and film stars adorned the Coaching Class, whose tagline was English seekho amerikaa jaao (Learn English, go to America). The English teacher warned the students against using Hindi in the class in the following words: This English coaching, not a local language... You together thinking, English speaking like a rice plate eating. No. Never. Not. English speaking not a children play. English speaking like a undertaker play.I was reminded of this film while travelling through Jammu and Kashmir, where I found thousands of posters advertising English medium schools with names such as YES Dubai Grand School International, Ever Onn Public School, KLM International School, JK Montessorie British School, and DRS Kids.I came across only one advertisement listlessly calling attention to the existence of some Urdu academy that nobody seemed to care for and also a poster meekly inviting students to learn Arabic. Eighth Schedule languages such as Kashmiri and Dogri seemed to be entirely absent from the advertisement space.Chasing the mirageThe decline of non-English media schools and the growth of strangely-named English medium schools, is not restricted to Jammu and Kashmir though. Until the 1990s, there used to be good Hindi medium schools in Kanpur that ranked ahead of English medium schools. Today, none of them commands the same respect. They did not lose patrons because of a decline in teaching standards. They just failed to fulfil the demand for English.People are chasing the mirage of English because those who do not know the language are denied both voice and space in (urban) India. A recent Hindi film, English Vinglish (2012), poignantly captured this. In this film, the lack of acquaintance with English affected the standing of a housewife, both in the society and sadly even within her family. Her daughter, who studied at an English medium school, and husband treated her with contempt. She redeemed herself by learning English. The director could not imagine other means of redemption.The reel and real life characters mentioned above stand for millions who cannot speak English. Those who somehow manage to learn the language feel on cloud nine. Parents feel proud of their children, when they get better grades in English than in Indian languages. The children innocently proclaim that they hate Indian languages (qua subjects, I hope).However, even in the best case, most first generation English learners belatedly realise that they have picked up the wrong English, namely, British or Indian one, whereas the elite has moved on to American English. These people constitute a large and growing part of our society that is neither India nor Bharat.English, which was retained after independence to avoid linguistic conflict within the country, has introduced a new linguistic divide that is aligned with, and thus reinforces, the class divide. But, our self-absorbed Anglophone elite continue to be oblivious of the damage English has done to the society.A decade ago, then prime minister Manmohan Singh proudly informed his audience at the Oxford University: Of all the legacies of the Raj, none is more important than the English language Today, English in India is seen as just another Indian language. English is not just another language. It is, as Ram Manohar Lohia warned as early as the 1950s, a key marker as well as determinant of socio-economic privilege in post-colonial India.It is time we paid attention to the language problem, which is at the heart of our education system. An education system based on the neglect or hatred of ones own languages cannot promote the pursuit of knowledge. Unfortunately, instead of confronting the problem we have abandoned ourselves to market forces that are steering us into an ever tighter embrace of English and compounding the language crisis.(The writer teaches at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru)"

The State of Global Air 2017 study, conducted jointly by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, quantifies further what has been reported for some time now: that the concentration of the most significant inhalable pollutant, fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5), has been growing in India. The rise in average annual population-weighted PM2.5 levels indicates that the Centres initiatives to help States reduce the burning of agricultural biomass and coal in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi have failed. The directions of the National Green Tribunal to Delhi, which were reviewed last year, could not end open burning of garbage and straw, or curb the urban use of diesel-powered vehicles. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the weighted national PM2.5 level estimated in the international report rose from 60 micrograms per cubic metre in 1990 (the acceptable limit) to 74 in 2015, with a steady rise since 2011. Weak policy on pollution is leading to the premature death of an estimated 1.1 million Indians annually, and the number is growing, in contrast to Chinas record of reducing such mortality.Several studies show long-term evidence of a steady deterioration in air quality in many countries, and South Asia, dominated by India, is today among the worst places to live. Although the central role played by burning of crop residues in causing pollution is well-known, and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute proposed steps to convert the waste into useful products such as enriched fodder, biogas, biofuel, compost and so on, little progress has been made. Last year, helpless farmers in the northern States who wanted to quickly switch from rice to wheat burnt the waste in the fields, in some cases defying local prohibitory orders. The government has no one to blame but itself, since it has not been able to supply affordable seeder machinery in sufficient numbers to eliminate the need to remove the straw. In a country producing about 500 million tonnes of crop residues annually, the issue needs to be addressed in mission mode. Easy access to cheap solar cookers and biogas plants will also cut open burning, and help the rural economy. Yet, there is no reliable distribution mechanism for these. On the health front, it is a matter of concern that in the most polluted cities, even moderate physical activity could prove harmful, rather than be beneficial, as new research indicates.

Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections.Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, national parties  the Congress and the BJP  have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state.In the past few days, Ive travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban or notebandi (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue.The notebandi has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems theyve faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the BJPs betrayal.Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. Notebandi is the biggest issue here, says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers, runs the family hardware store. The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems.But there were lots of problems. Isnt he ashamed of lying? he asks angrily. Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed.Theres a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them. His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: Traders are very angry with Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money.Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many dont have bank accounts or credit cards. The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP.In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. Since November 8, theyve not been able to find work even for one day, he says. I ask him how they are managing. Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. Thats how we are managing.A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to poison for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. Normally we sell a kilo of rice for Rs 14, but this time we had to sell it for Rs 8 or Rs 9. We couldnt buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of the looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here.It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning, says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Modis announcement. Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially about 90% of the industry was affected since all their transactions happen in cash.Looms still shutWe had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.Varanasi has eight assembly constituencies, and Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. Why would anyone now vote for Modi? he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Hasims brothers loom, agrees. Hes the sole breadwinner for his family of eight.Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a major disaster. The ban, he says, couldnt have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year its been a wipe-out. A long-time BJP supporter, Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Modi will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state.Its an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the partys chances of winning at 101%. He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nations interest. We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.That, he says, is because people have faith in the man whos taking the decisions - the prime minister. On this count, hes right - Modis personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Modi because he is doing good work and that the note ban was a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term.Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Modi has not had much luck in state elections and hes desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Modi and his party.But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances? When the votes are counted on March 11, we will know whether it was a masterstroke or a miscalculation.International New York Times"

(If, as work done by Akhilesh Yadav government shows, there is a 50% vacancy in teacher posts in UP, where will the children of the poor get education?)Fact: Modi is partially right.As many as 23% teacher posts in elementary grades (up to Class 8) and 50% posts in secondary schools ( Class 9 and Class 10) are vacant in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaSpend reported in December 2016.Of six million teaching positions in government schools nationwide, about 900,000 elementary school teaching positions and 100,000 in secondary schools  put together, a million  are vacant, according to data tabled on December 5, 2016 in the Lok Sabha.Teacher vacancy in UP is the second worst in India for secondary schools and sixth worst for elementary schools.States with most teacher vacanciesCLAIM 2:Hindustan mein sabse jyada..daliton par atyachaar agar kahin hote hai, to us pradesh ka naam hai Uttar Pradesh. (If there is a region in India where crimes against lower castes are the highest, it is Uttar Pradesh)Fact: Modis claim is wrong.Though crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) were the highest in UP at 8,358 cases, with 8,460 people affected in 2015, UPs crime rate, or crime per 100,000 SC population, was 20, less than Gujarat (26), Madhya Pradesh (37) and Goa (51), according to data from the National Crimes Records Bureau.As many as 11 states and a Union Territory registered worse crime rates against SCs than UP.Among the other large states, Rajasthan registered the highest crime rate against dalits: 57 crimes per 100,000 SC population, followed by Andhra Pradesh at 52, Bihar at 39, Chhattisgarh at 31 and Maharashtra at 14.While the crime rate in Gujarat has always been above 25 per 100,000 SC population, it has always been below 20 per 100,000 SC population in UP.The crime rate against dalits in UP consistently fell during the tenure of former chief minister Mayawati and gradually increased during the tenure of current chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.CLAIM 3:Uttar Pradesh mein kisano ki paidavar sirf 3% khareedi jaati hai (Government procures only 3% of the farm produce in UP).Fact: The figure quoted by Modi is right for wheat but wrong for rice.Government agencies, such as the Food Corporation of India and state government agencies, procured 2.5% of wheat produced in UP in 2014-15 and 10.5% of rice produced that year in the state. Most of the farm output was sold by farmers to traders and commission agents in agriculture produce markets (APMCs).In Chhattisgarh, procurement of 60% of farm produce is done by the government at the minimum support price (MSP). In Madhya Pradesh, too, 60% is bought by the government, while Haryana is at 70% and Rajasthan at 50%, Modi said.The figures are true for Chhattisgarh for rice, close to reality for Madhya Pradesh for wheat, and close for both rice and wheat in Haryana.Modi was wrong about Rajasthan. Rajasthan farmers sold 18% of their wheat to government procurement agencies in 2014-15, not 50% as the PM claimed.CLAIM 4:Humne aisi Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana laaye hai ki agar prakrutik karano se kisan buaai nahin kar paaya, to bhi usko bima milega. Aisi koi yojana dekhi hai? (We started such a crop insurance schemenamed Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme  where, even if natural reasons affect the crop at sowing, the farmer will be insured. Has anybody seen such a scheme before?).Fact: Modi stretched the truth.While the PM claimed that this is the first time crops are being insured against weather-related vagaries, an earlier insurance scheme had a sub-scheme named Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS), which was limited to some geographical regions but insured crops against drought, excess rains and even frost.The crop-insurance spending included three parts: National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS), Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) and WBCIS.The PM Fasal Bima Yojana amalgamates two old schemes, NAIS and MNAIS. WBCIS is still distinct from the PM Fasal Bima Yojana.The WBCIS component was piloted in 2003 for the summer crop and in 2008 for the winter crop. The Modi government spent more than Rs 1,000 crore in its first two years 2014-15 and 2015-16 on WBCIS even before Fasal Bima Yojana was rolled out.The government, under PM Modi, more than doubled the spending on crop insurance to Rs 13,200 crore  the highest everin 2016-17 (revised estimate), to cater to increased crop failures after consecutive drought years. The spending in 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 9,000 crore.CLAIM 5:Jahaan BJP ki sarkarein hai, chahe Gujarat ho, Maharashtra ho, Haryana ho, Rajasthan ho, Chhattisgarh ho, Jharkhand howahaan 60-70% kisanonka (fayda) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana se ho chuka hai..aur Uttar Pradesh..sirf teen percent kisanonka bima hua (In BJP-ruled states, about 60-70% farmers have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, while only 3% farmers in UP have benefitted).Fact: Modi is correct on the data for Maharashtra and Rajasthan, while he exaggerated the numbers for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. He is wrong about farmers who benefitted from the Fasal Bima Yojana in UP.In Modis home state of Gujarat  a state with one of the highest rain deficits in the largely normal monsoon of 2016, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016  a fourth of farmers have benefitted from the flagship crop-insurance scheme, not 60-70% as Modi claimed.Abhishek Waghmare is an analyst with IndiaSpend."
58fce3cd7be9e06c937109d2,NREGS fails to reach women with disabilities,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/feb/26/nregs-fails-to-reach-women-with-disabilities-1574918.html,2017-02-26,"BHUBANESWAR: Bharati Pradhan (name changed), a 46-year-old orthopaedically-challenged woman of Kanas block in Puri district, gets a monthly pension of Rs 300 under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana and a few kgs of rice from the State Government. The money just meets her medicine requirements. The youngest among five siblings, she was born with disability and could manage to study till Class V. Her parents, daily wagers by profession, could neither afford her treatment nor education. Though wheel-chair bound and unskilled, she is keen on being self-reliant but that is a dream.Securing livelihood has never been an easy task for women with disabilities like Bharati who live in rural areas of Odisha despite implementation of several government schemes including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). They continue to have limited access to livelihood opportunities, be it direct employment or self-employment.The MGNREGS was implemented to ensure 100 days of wage employment in unskilled manual work for people in rural pockets. According to the Panchayati Raj Department sources, only 5,362 different-abled persons worked under MGNREGS in 2016-17 financial year. Less than five per cent of this labour force constituted women with disabilities. Similarly, the total number of disabled people working under MGNREGS stood at 5,586 in 2015-16, 3,352 in 2014-15 and 3,587 in 2013-14. Although there are no reports on the number of women with disabilities employed in these three financial years, Project Directors of all the 30 District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) in the State, who are responsible for implementation of the scheme, admitted to low participation from this vulnerable group due to lack of awareness and a disabled-friendly environment.As per the 2011 Census, the total population of persons with disabilities in Odisha is 12,44,402 out of which, 6,74,775 are males and 5,69,627 are females. Sources said at least over two lakh women with disabilities, majority of them illiterate and residing in rural areas, are living below poverty line (BPL) and are in need of gainful employment. The Census points out that a majority of women with disabilities in Odisha suffer from movement-related disability, blindness and hearing impairment. Although their empowerment is only possible by economic independence, that has not been the case so far.Disability activist, Asha Hans said so many women with disabilities still living below the poverty line points to the fact that there is problem with implementation of employment schemes including the MGNREGS. Providing employment to these women becomes more necessary as almost 90 per cent of them are dependent on their family members for finances. Studies have shown that disabled women are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts in securing livelihood as they face gender discrimination, she said, adding that women with disabilities are still considered unfit to don the role of wage earner.Apparently, the MGNREG Act operational guidelines have a dedicated chapter on jobs outlined for differently-abled women. These include less stressful works like making drinking water arrangements at the work site, plantation, looking after children of workers, land levelling and sprinkling water on newly built walls. However, not many differently-abled women are coming forward to even take up these works, officials admit. The primary reason for this is lack of awareness and facilities. MGNREGS is considered labour intensive and no efforts are being made to bring them under the scheme or make them aware that they can do less strenuous work and earn the same wage that an abled person does, said former Odisha State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, Kasturi Mohapatra.She added that the entire approach towards women with disabilities in MGNREGS is a faulty one. While not many women are aware about the nature of work meant for them under MGNREGS, getting to the work site and security remain the other concern areas. Their family members cannot always accompany them to the work site, she added. The meagre number of women with disabilities, who are coming forward to work under MGNREGS, are mostly employed in plantation work during monsoon.Visibility of women with disabilities in the employment guarantee schemes is negligent in districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and some Western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Balangir and Nuapada.However, Joint Secretary in the Panchayati Raj Department, Bhumesh Behera said since MGNREGS is a demand driven programme, the department provides work to any differently-abled person including women who seek work. It always depends on their nature of disability. We have to also take into consideration that they cannot do all kinds of works, he said.Apparently, the Odisha Government does not yet have clear data on the number of women with disabilities getting 100 days' employment under the MGNREGS. The MIS (Management Information System) developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to keep a record of the workers does not include data on the number of such women taking part in the scheme, the Project Directors pointed out. Hence, it is difficult to find out if MGNREGS is actually helping women with disabilities or not, said an officer requesting anonymity.In fact, every livelihood programme being run by both Centre and State including the skill development and vocational training programmes, has no clarity or data on involvement of women with disabilities. Disability activists feel it is high time the government thinks of gender and disability audit in such schemes.In the absence of employment, women mostly depend on social security coverage. The State Government provides Rs 300 as pension to disabled people under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana but the amount is too meagre in todays time. To avail the pension, they have to produce disability certificates. Ironically, no differently-abled woman has been provided a disability certificate since 2014. According to reports of Department of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, of 5.6 lakh differently-abled women in the State, only 41,929 women have received disability certificates so far, thereby denying the rest facilities like education, employment, pension, concession and other benefits. Unlike States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, Odisha Government does not provide unemployment assistance to people with disabilities.Sanyas Behera, president of Odisha Association of Blind and a visually-challenged activist who has been demanding consideration of a differently-abled person as one separate family unit when job cards are issued under MGNREGS, said there is no clear notification yet by the Odisha Government on the nature of work that can be done by differently-abled men and women even as the Union Government had circulated an order in 2008 regarding work that can be allotted to this category of the labour force. When jobs are being issued to a household, a differently-abled person is overlooked and an abled person in the family is provided the work. Due to gender discrimination, differently-abled women are entirely left out from this scheme,"" he said.Under the Odisha Livelihood Mission, some district administrations have taken the initiative of bringing together women with disabilities and form self-help groups that can churn out things like phenyl, agarbati, jute bags and eatables. However, Sanyas alleged that the number of such SHGs is too less and funds sanctioned by the Centre for vocational training of such women are returned unutilised every year. ""Sometimes, the authorities give equipment to these SHGs to produce articles without training them properly in a bid to complete their official reports. As a result, such SHGs do not survive for a long time,"" Sanyas added."

Representatives of a consortium of 26 primary cooperatives formed by Consumerfed are currently holding negotiations with Food Corporation of India officers and rice mills in West Bengal, Surendran informed the Assembly on Tuesday.The negotiations are expected to conclude by Thursday. The consignments will arrive by March 10, he said. Consumerfed had difficulties in procuring rice from Andhra Pradesh as mill owners were reluctant to supply rice due to delay in payment in the past. The agency had run up massive dues, forcing mill owners and middlemen in Andhra Pradesh to cut off supply.The LDF Government has paid Rs 52 crore to 241 suppliers after assuming office. The ar rears now stand at Rs 157 crore and steps are being taken to clear the arrears, Surendran said. Also, the shortage in supply of Jaya and Surekha, the popular varieties in Kerala, prompted Consumerfed to knock at West Bengals doors.Even as rice prices were climbing past Rs 45 per kg, the minister informed the Assembly the hike in rice prices was a national phenomenon. In Andhra Pradesh, the prices ranged between Rs 46 and Rs 49 per kg, while in Gujarat it stood at Rs 30-34. The prices ranged between Rs 29 and Rs 32 in Uttar Pradesh. The price of Kuruva variety stood at Rs 29 to Rs 32 in Tamil Nadu and Rs 32 to Rs 36 in Andhra Pradesh, Surendran said.The price of Matta variety was between Rs 28 and Rs 33 in Karnataka, he said."
58fcf2247be9e06c93711c36,Employment scheme blind to women with disabilities,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/feb/26/employment-scheme-blind-to-women-with-disabilities-1574918.html,2017-03-01,"BHUBANESWAR: Bharati Pradhan (name changed), a 46-year-old orthopaedically-challenged woman of Kanas block in Puri district, gets a monthly pension of Rs 300 under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana and a few kgs of rice from the State Government. The money just meets her medicine requirements. The youngest among five siblings, she was born with disability and could manage to study till Class V. Her parents, daily wagers by profession, could neither afford her treatment nor education. Though wheel-chair bound and unskilled, she is keen on being self-reliant but that is a dream.Securing livelihood has never been an easy task for women with disabilities like Bharati who live in rural areas of Odisha despite implementation of several government schemes including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). They continue to have limited access to livelihood opportunities, be it direct employment or self-employment.The MGNREGS was implemented to ensure 100 days of wage employment in unskilled manual work for people in rural pockets. According to the Panchayati Raj Department sources, only 5,362 different-abled persons worked under MGNREGS in 2016-17 financial year. Less than five per cent of this labour force constituted women with disabilities. Similarly, the total number of disabled people working under MGNREGS stood at 5,586 in 2015-16, 3,352 in 2014-15 and 3,587 in 2013-14. Although there are no reports on the number of women with disabilities employed in these three financial years, Project Directors of all the 30 District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) in the State, who are responsible for implementation of the scheme, admitted to low participation from this vulnerable group due to lack of awareness and a disabled-friendly environment.As per the 2011 Census, the total population of persons with disabilities in Odisha is 12,44,402 out of which, 6,74,775 are males and 5,69,627 are females. Sources said at least over two lakh women with disabilities, majority of them illiterate and residing in rural areas, are living below poverty line (BPL) and are in need of gainful employment. The Census points out that a majority of women with disabilities in Odisha suffer from movement-related disability, blindness and hearing impairment. Although their empowerment is only possible by economic independence, that has not been the case so far.Disability activist, Asha Hans said so many women with disabilities still living below the poverty line points to the fact that there is problem with implementation of employment schemes including the MGNREGS. Providing employment to these women becomes more necessary as almost 90 per cent of them are dependent on their family members for finances. Studies have shown that disabled women are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts in securing livelihood as they face gender discrimination, she said, adding that women with disabilities are still considered unfit to don the role of wage earner.Apparently, the MGNREG Act operational guidelines have a dedicated chapter on jobs outlined for differently-abled women. These include less stressful works like making drinking water arrangements at the work site, plantation, looking after children of workers, land levelling and sprinkling water on newly built walls. However, not many differently-abled women are coming forward to even take up these works, officials admit. The primary reason for this is lack of awareness and facilities. MGNREGS is considered labour intensive and no efforts are being made to bring them under the scheme or make them aware that they can do less strenuous work and earn the same wage that an abled person does, said former Odisha State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, Kasturi Mohapatra.She added that the entire approach towards women with disabilities in MGNREGS is a faulty one. While not many women are aware about the nature of work meant for them under MGNREGS, getting to the work site and security remain the other concern areas. Their family members cannot always accompany them to the work site, she added. The meagre number of women with disabilities, who are coming forward to work under MGNREGS, are mostly employed in plantation work during monsoon.Visibility of women with disabilities in the employment guarantee schemes is negligent in districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and some Western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Balangir and Nuapada.However, Joint Secretary in the Panchayati Raj Department, Bhumesh Behera said since MGNREGS is a demand driven programme, the department provides work to any differently-abled person including women who seek work. It always depends on their nature of disability. We have to also take into consideration that they cannot do all kinds of works, he said.Apparently, the Odisha Government does not yet have clear data on the number of women with disabilities getting 100 days' employment under the MGNREGS. The MIS (Management Information System) developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to keep a record of the workers does not include data on the number of such women taking part in the scheme, the Project Directors pointed out. Hence, it is difficult to find out if MGNREGS is actually helping women with disabilities or not, said an officer requesting anonymity.In fact, every livelihood programme being run by both Centre and State including the skill development and vocational training programmes, has no clarity or data on involvement of women with disabilities. Disability activists feel it is high time the government thinks of gender and disability audit in such schemes.In the absence of employment, women mostly depend on social security coverage. The State Government provides Rs 300 as pension to disabled people under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana but the amount is too meagre in todays time. To avail the pension, they have to produce disability certificates. Ironically, no differently-abled woman has been provided a disability certificate since 2014. According to reports of Department of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, of 5.6 lakh differently-abled women in the State, only 41,929 women have received disability certificates so far, thereby denying the rest facilities like education, employment, pension, concession and other benefits. Unlike States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, Odisha Government does not provide unemployment assistance to people with disabilities.Sanyas Behera, president of Odisha Association of Blind and a visually-challenged activist who has been demanding consideration of a differently-abled person as one separate family unit when job cards are issued under MGNREGS, said there is no clear notification yet by the Odisha Government on the nature of work that can be done by differently-abled men and women even as the Union Government had circulated an order in 2008 regarding work that can be allotted to this category of the labour force. When jobs are being issued to a household, a differently-abled person is overlooked and an abled person in the family is provided the work. Due to gender discrimination, differently-abled women are entirely left out from this scheme,"" he said.Under the Odisha Livelihood Mission, some district administrations have taken the initiative of bringing together women with disabilities and form self-help groups that can churn out things like phenyl, agarbati, jute bags and eatables. However, Sanyas alleged that the number of such SHGs is too less and funds sanctioned by the Centre for vocational training of such women are returned unutilised every year. ""Sometimes, the authorities give equipment to these SHGs to produce articles without training them properly in a bid to complete their official reports. As a result, such SHGs do not survive for a long time,"" Sanyas added."

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

Chhoti jaat ke logon ke liye karma Mahabrahmin he karte hain (only a Mahabrahmin performs the rituals for the Dalits), says Das.For upper caste Hindus, a purohit  a superior Brahmin  can perform the rituals. But for the Dalits, only a Mahabrahmin can perform the rites.Mr. Sharma, a Mahabrahmin, points to a set of miniature temple-like structures, or pitra sthana (a place for ancestors). ""This is where the Dalits build their pitra sthanas, says the priest.Farther away, there is another set of pitra sthanas. ""Those belong to the upper caste Hindus,"" he says.Status of priestsSuch is the extent of marginalisation of the Dalits that the association of the Mahabrahmins with the Dalits has earned the priests a lower status in their own Brahmin community. The Mahabrahmins function at the temple with the permission of the head priest.Ashok Nath Bhardwaj, an office-bearer at the Ganga Ram Samaj  an association of Mahabrahmins in Haridwar  said: ""The taboo associated with the Dalits is so intense that it affects us too. We perform rituals for the Dalits, so we too are treated as Dalits by other Brahmins They [other Brahmins] perform prayers for the upper caste Hindus, so they are superior, but we perform rituals for the Dalits, so we are inferior.Question of equalityThe segregation, however, goes challenged. Rajendra Ghagat, a Dalit from Haridwars Valmiki community, said: ""The practice [within the temple] is so old it has gained acceptance in the name of tradition... but, there should be equality within the temple.""For now, it seems that a person's caste will follow them into their afterlife."

But it appears this has not stopped him from announcing populist programmes aimed at wooing both rural masses and the urban poor. He, however, belied the hopes of farmers as well as opposition parties on their demand to waive farm loans.He has also not announced any major infrastructure project, especially for Bengaluru.In his last full-fledged budget before Karnataka goes to polls in 2018, the chief minister has made it a point to continue to please the Ahinda community (Kannada acronym for backward classes, Dalits and minorities), considered to be his major vote bank.The total subsidy burden on the government in this budget goes up by Rs 6,000 crore, which is about 33% more than the current financial year.Siddaramaiah appears to have taken a cue from various states to unveil populist schemes: Saviruchi canteens from the Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu, free water supply and waiver of power bills from Delhi and free LPG connections from the Centre which became a big hit in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, he has increased the quantum of rice under his pet Anna Bhagya scheme to 7 kg from 5 kg per beneficiary and decided to give milk to government school students on five days a week instead of three days. Siddaramaiah brought cheer among moviegoers by announcing a cap of Rs 200 on entry ticket to all multiplexes. The chief minister has also proposed making it mandatory for all cinemas to screen Kannada and regional language movies during prime time.The CM has tried to appease over six lakh state government employees by setting up the seventh pay commission. He has also tried to please employees in the private sector by proposing to increase their retirement age to 60 from 58.Siddaramaiah also announced the formation of 49 new taluks. Though he has not imposed any major taxes keeping the 2018 election in view, he has proposed hiking the additional excise duty on Indian Made Foreign Liquor. This will make liquor dearer.High-end two-wheelers will also cost more with the motor vehicle tax being hiked.The additional resource mobilisation due to these two levies is estimated to fetch the state exchequer Rs 1,060 crore. The chief minister has set a moderate revenue target in the coming financial year in anticipation of the implementation of Goods and Services Tax.No farm loan waiverFinancial constraints, including a shortfall in state resources by Rs 1,624 crore, is said to have restrained Siddaramaiah from announcing a farm loan waiver.In his effort to present a please-all budget, with a total outlay of Rs 1,86,561 crore, Siddaramaiah has brought down revenue surplus position to an alarming Rs 136 crore. This has, in turn, taken a toll on capital expenditure, which is crucial for infrastructure development. Namma canteens will be launched in each of the 198 wards of BBMP where breakfast (Rs 5), lunch and dinner (Rs 10) will be provided.The chief minister has allocated Rs 100 crore for this scheme. At the district level, Saviruchi mobile canteens will be set up through zilla stree shakti okkutas.Subsidy of Rs 1,600 for LPG connections to five lakh eligible poor families not selected under the Centres Ujjwala scheme, free water supply up to 10,000 litres per month for slum dwellers living in 20x30 sites and waiving their pending bills are some of the other sops on the anvil."

The next one is expected to be a vote-on-account.He announced the setting up of Saviruchi mobile canteens in all 30 districts through the Stree Shakti self help groups, a mid-day meal scheme for 12 lakh pregnant women, milk supply to the over a crore school and anganwadi children five days a week and eggs to the malnutrition-hit anganwadi children twice a week.""Darkness will not cast on the future of the land where women and children are the focus of development.This is a simple truth which I have found out by experience,"" he said. There was much thumping among the treasury benches for the proposed laptops for 1.5 lakh students entering government and aided medical, engineering and degree colleges, but the loudest cheers were reserved for the announcement of 49 new taluk, welcomed with celebrations across the state.Siddaramaiah, however, did not announce the much-anticipated loan waiver for the drought-hit farmers, though he gave in to the demand to increase free rice under the flagship Anna Bhagya scheme from 5 to 7 kgs.""Let Yeddyurappa (state BJP chief) and Jagadish Shettar (opposition leader) fight for the state's rights at the Centre. I asked the PM (Narendra Modi) to waive 50% of commercial bank loans and said I would match it in cooperative loans.If they can waive farmers loans in Uttar Pradesh, why can't they do it here?"" he asked, in a combative post-budget press conference.He came down harshly on the PM's demonetisation drive. ""Any public policy, apart from the purpose of achieving the intended target, should also be very efficient in its execution.Demonetisation caused huge amount of distress to the public but the Union Government is yet to disclose what outcome has been achieved by it.""Siddaramaiah, who had earlier stated that black money constituted hardly 0.002% of the country's economy, said: ""While the need for demonetisation itself is debatable, I think that the Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India could have at least foreseen the exigencies and could have put in practical and robust systems in place to insulate the common man from these hardships.""He announced policies in line with the Centre's decision to implement the GST and do away with the distinction between plan and non-plan expenditure."

The group keeps a record schedule in which students and other professionals come to help the farmers on a shift basis.Though the farmers still have not received any written assurance from the central government but somehow they are getting support and day to day help from the Delhi Tamil community.Hundreds of students from different university, working people, housewives, business persons and few Tamil actors such as Abhi Saravanan come together to support the farmers by raising fund, providing food, tablets, money daily needs of farmers.The farmers give food to us and I cant see them as beggars now, will not let them beg on the streets of Delhi.

593aebc37be9e00e1ecd4969,Strain on 'buffalo power',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170403/jsp/nation/story_144240.jsp,2017-04-03,"INDIAN EXPORT SHRINKS, PAK SMELLS CHANCE Beef exporters like Priya Sud have started to chicken as meat shops were targeted in Uttar Pradesh in the past week after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to crack down on illegal abattoirs. ""There is unease within the industry... our local supplies have been cut off. Our importers want to know what is happening in this country,"" says Sud, a partner at Al-Noor Exports that prides itself as one of the oldest and largest exporters of frozen buffalo meat in the world. India accounts for nearly 56 per cent of the world's buffalo population and racked up exports worth Rs 26,685.44 crore in 2015-16. Exports of carabeef - the meat of the water buffalo - were 17.5 per cent higher than basmati rice exports of Rs 22,718.44 crore. In the first nine months of this year (April-December), carabeef exports topped Rs 20,000 crore, around 1.4 per cent of overall exports from the country. Uttar Pradesh is the epicentre of the country's $4-billion meat export business with 43 of the 79 central government-approved abattoir-cum-meat processing plants located in the most populous state, churning out nearly half of India-labelled meat sold abroad and a fifth of all meat produced in the country. The state has over 300 registered slaughterhouses and 41 export-oriented meat processing plants run by some of the top meat exporters in the country, including Allanasons, HMA, M.K. Overseas, AOV Exports, Al Kabeer, Mirha Exports and the Al-Noor Group. Despite their Arabic-sounding names, many of these companies are owned and operated by Hindus. A sense of fear hovers in the air and everyone involved in the meat business - farmers who rear cattle, middlemen, factory owners and transporters - is uncertain about the future of the industry itself as hotheads scout for targets and the state government comes under pressure to come good on its poll promise to close down the abattoirs. Sources say nine of the 41 export-oriented meat processing plants in Uttar Pradesh have closed down since the new government came to power in the state. The others are operating at barely 10 to 15 per cent of their capacity. The campaign against meat consumption has resonated in other areas with Gujarat tightening its law on Friday by prescribing life imprisonment for those found guilty of slaughtering cows, calves, bulls and bullocks. Although buffalo meat processing is not covered by the legislation, meat factory owners live in fear that they could become soft targets as rabid rhetoric finds violent expression in the northern parts of the country. Already, the Shiv Sena has enforced a ban on meat and fish consumption in Gurgaon, one of north India's largest industrial hubs and home to several technology and financial services giants. ""The crackdown on the meat retailers and the closure of several small units have forced exporters to adopt a wait-and-watch attitude. Nobody is taking fresh orders and many are weighing the option of shifting their units to other states like Punjab,"" said S.P. Sabharwal, secretary-general of the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters' Association. Punjab is emerging as a new centre for the meat trade after Uttar Pradesh and the Andhra-Telangana region. While India's largest meat exporter, the Cdr Satish Subberwal-run Al-Kabeer, is located in Medak in Telangana, Punjab's Derrabassi in Mohali district is fast turning into a new centre for meat processing with the earlier Akali government and the current Congress one supportive of the meat business. Most of Punjab's modern abattoirs are processing buffalo meat but the government is working on a pig meat processing plant with an eye on the market for pork, both within the country and abroad. ""India's Hindi-speaking, north Indian cattle belt is also the country's buffalo belt as well as sheep and goat belt, which is why most of the large, modern factories exporting meat are located in Uttar Pradesh, with a spillover in Haryana and Punjab. ""Direct cargo flights from Delhi to West Asia, which is an important market for us, is another reason why the meat processing industry is located here,"" said Vishal Johri, a merchant banker who advises exporters. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, along with Andhra and Telangana, have the largest livestock population in the country. The antipathy towards meat consumption in the north has coincided with the electoral fortunes of the BJP, sparking fears of a backlash against those who resist attempts to force people to adopt a lifestyle that doesn't offend Hindu sensibilities. ""The current mahol (atmosphere) against meat-eating is strange because 71 per cent of Indians are non-vegetarians,"" says Hafiz Mohammed Sahid, a Delhi-based meat trader and exporter, quoting a 2014 census of food habits in the country carried out by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner. Data show that Telangana has the highest number of non-vegetarians at almost 99 per cent, followed closely by Bengal (98.55 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (98.25 per cent), Odisha (97.35 per cent) and Kerala (97 per cent). But the rise of Hindu extremism has coincided with the gradual decline in meat exports and the fortunes of the industry as a whole. Meat exports have fallen by 15 per cent from $4.78 billion in 2014-15 to $4.07 billion in 2015-16. Data sourced from the Registrar of Companies show that the turnover of Al-Kabeer Exports declined to Rs 469.75 crore from Rs 761.76 crore in the previous year, largely the result of a decline in exports to Vietnam and Egypt. Net profits of the company also shrank. Indian buffalo meat is preferred because of its competitive cost. It is especially sought after in West Asia and regions with a high Muslim population since many factories use the halal or kosher techniques in their slaughterhouses, which religious Muslims and Jews prefer. While India accounts for 12 per cent of all halal or kosher meat exports worldwide, its next-door neighbour Pakistan accounts for 8 per cent. In the West Asian market, the two are keen rivals. ""Pakistan has always been our rival in the Middle East, but India has wider acceptance globally as a source of hygienically processed, quality meat,"" said Johri. However, Pakistan has been working to increase its livestock to compete. Between 1996 and 2006, it has managed to increase its buffalo population from 20.3 million to 27.3 million. India, of course, remains the bigger ""buffalo power"" with some 108 million buffaloes, up from 83 million in 1992. ""The so-called 'pink revolution' of meat processing and exports has been possible because of our ever-expanding livestock population, which again is a result of our white revolution. If we reduce our exports, competitors like Pakistan and Brazil will weigh in; that's natural,"" Johri said. Older buffaloes, which stop yielding milk, and male buffaloes are the ones that are sold to slaughterhouses as farmers primarily rear cattle, buffaloes as well as goats for milk in India. ""The meat industry is the byproduct of the dairy business. If there is a threat to the meat industry, the dairy trade will also collapse and farmers will be the biggest losers. India is at the top in the dairy business because it tops in meat production,"" said Fauzan Alavi of Allana Group. Alavi, who is also the general secretary of the All India Meat & Live Exporters' Association, said licenced slaughterhouses or export-oriented units have to comply with at least 21 permissions, both from the Centre and the state, to operate and that the government should not ignore the importance of the sector. The meat factories in Uttar Pradesh provide direct jobs to around 5 lakh people. If one plant closes down in the state, 1,500 jobs are at risk. Sources say the government has clarified that it is not against legal slaughterhouses but the word has yet to percolate down to lower-level officers. So, several plants have been shut on flimsy grounds. ""If some minor lacuna is found, the government should give the industry some time to resolve the matter,"" Alavi said."

Except for vegetables, no produce is arriving at the APMC yard. Similarly, transportation of vegetables from the yard to neighbouring states is unhindered.Supply of tur dal from Kalaburagi, Bidar and Gujarat, bengal gram from Madhya Pradesh, and rice from Raichur, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal has been stopped. In the same way, the transportation of horse gram from the yard to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other states has been stalled. There is no change in the supply of water, medicines, milk and vegetables. However, over 1,500 trucks have been parked at various places, including the truck terminal at Bandipalya, Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed and at the Old RMC yard.According to sources, the truck owners have refused to lift cement and fertilisers from the Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed, 230 loads each, which have arrived by goods trains on Saturday. Goods Shed Lorry Owners Association president Abdul Khader Sahid said, they have received requests to lift the loads, but the association has clarified that the loads cannot be lifted until the demands of reduction of insurance premium and RTO fees are fulfilled.Sources said, the supply of gas (LPG) will not be affected in the city. LPG is supplied to the city from Mangaluru through pipelines. So, the truck protest will not have any effect on the LPG supply, said the sources. However, Petroleum Distributors Association S K Dinesh said, the association is morally supporting the protest. If the governments do not fulfil the demands, petroleum tankers will also join the protest, he said.In-charge Deputy Director for Food and Civil Supplies C L Anand said, the stocks of provisions, slated for distribution in fair price shops to ration card holders, is sufficient for April month quota. The public distribution system of the department will not be affected by the strike, he said.The district administration is learnt to have made arrangements to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against the lorry owners and is awaiting the State governments directions, if the people are inconvenienced."

Then he stirs the mixture, heats it up, adds leaves of mint, and then offers it to the people present. The resulting taste is simple and delicious.Risotto is an Italian dish, but they dont make it sweet, says Ranveer. It is more a savoury, like mushroom risotto. But I decided to make something new.Ranveer had been specially invited by Mercedes Benz for their customer engagement initiative called Luxe Drive.But this is not the first time that Ranveer has come to Kerala. Eleven years ago, he had come for a friends wedding and became enamoured of Kerala cuisine. I loved the avial I ate at the function, he says.Thereafter, he started studying Mappila food, Syrian Christian recipes and the menu of the Nampoothiri Brahmins. The fascinating part about Kerala cuisine is the way it changes across regions, he says.And he lists his favourites. The biriyani that the Mappilas make is awesome, says Ranveer. It is not refined and sophisticated. Instead, it is rustic but tasty. Similarly, the practice of sadhya was started by the Nampoothiris as a way to feed the Brahmins. I also enjoy the Syrian Christian fish curry but this is something I would like to have the next day, because it tastes good only after a day of fermentation.Asked to compare Kerala cuisine with other parts of India, Ranveer says, It cannot be compared, because for 2000 years there have been so many influences: the Romans, Arabs, Dutch, Portuguese, and British. It is a unique cuisine.And thanks to his Global Menu television show, on the Foodz channel, Ranveer is always coming across unique cuisines. The show goes off the beaten track and has focused on places like North and South Korea, Sri Lanka, Romania and Mongolia, he says.The Mongolians have a dish called Khorkhog. Chicken or lamb is cooked with vegetables and stones in a closed container. When you eat it, you can detect a slight earthiness from the stones, which makes it very tasty, says Ranveer.Apart from his TV show, Ranveer runs restaurants in the USA, Canada and India. Last year, he brought out a cookbook called Come into my kitchen. His Mumbai-based premium patisserie, English Vinglish serves fusion desserts, breads and bakes.Ranveer has done a mini-video series on Twitter titled Ranveer On The Road, which featured his culinary sojourn through Australia, apart from being a judge on Season 4 of Masterchef India.And this passion for food began in the unlikeliest of places. When he was a child, growing up in Lucknow, his grandfather Jagir Singh would take him to the gurudwara. A restless Ranveer would run around and end up at the langar. That was when I saw cooking for the first time, he says. Soon, Ranveer began helping around.At age 16, he did the unthinkable for a son of an aeronautical engineer. He ran away from home and worked at a roadside kebab shop run by a man called Munir Ahmed for eight months. However, later, he graduated from the Indian Institute of Hotel Management at Lucknow.Asked the secret to a good dish, Ranveer says, Our five fingers have five rasas: sweet, sour, salty, savoury and spicy. So, when we cook with the hand, the rasas go into the food. And when we eat with our hand, the rasas go inside us. It is important to cook honestly and sincerely because food transfers emotions. So, you are always giving a part of yourself in every dish."

Since then, it has affected marriage ceremonies and most social and religious gatherings, the latest being Hazrat Ali's birthday, a centuries old tradition.Families in Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Aliganj, Alambagh, Charbagh, Mahanagar and Hazratganj had prepared vegetarian dishes as they could not get mutton or chicken. Families in Chowk and Nakkhas had prepared single dish of mutton and that too in a small quantity, whome some in Maulviganj and Aminabad had prepared chicken dish in sufficient quantity.The crackdown on meat has led to loss of livelihood of not only those involved in meat trade but also of biryani rice, the sale of which has dipped more than 50%. As there is no meat available in market, people are not buying the special variety of rice. The worst affected varieties of biryani rice are 'Khus', 'Gulab', 'Hari-patti', 'Nafees' and 'Nawazish'.Rafi Hasan approached several shops for mutton but didn't find any in his area. ""I searched three localities for meat but not a single shop was open, so I asked my wife to prepare vegetarian food, much to our disappointment,"" said Rafi a resident of Rustamnagar, Chowk.""I had asked a meat seller in my area for 5kg chicken on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, he gave me only 1kg and had no option but to accept whatever little there was,"" said Sameer Abbas.Similarly, Mahanagar resident Sadiq said, ""There is another celebration on April 15 of Rajab 17. If the crisis continues, Muslim families may join the protest of meat sellers on April 20.""""I got 1kg mutton and distributed 500 grams to my friend and that is how we celebrated the occasion,"" said Ameer Khan, a resident of Lalbagh."

(HT Photo)The canteen was set up for patients and their attendants visiting the hospital but it soon became popular with the poor, especially the labour class, who do not have the resources to buy costly food.Akhilesh said the food was cooked according to the tradition of the Nath sect and ingredients like garlic and onion were not used.Yogi Adityanath is of the view that low cost quality food should be the right of the poor. Before moving to Lucknow, he himself used to inspect the quality of food and took stock of cleanliness on a regular basis. He felt satisfaction by offering quality food to the needy, he said.Mithilesh Kumar, a rickshaw-puller said, Such facilities are a boon for us. Earlier, I used to pass my day on tea and samosa only and that too cost me Rs 20-30. I have been coming here for the last three years as I get good food for Rs 10 only.MD, Gorakhnath Hospital, Dr Mayank said the food provided at the canteen was nutritious and healthy."

They wait for the hour-long lunch break that day with keen anticipation.All 28 of them rise ten minutes before the clock strikes 1pm, go to their chambers for a quick change and then proceed towards the common dining hall where a delectable three-course meal awaits the lordships.The lip-smacking cuisine from a particular part of the country is not sourced from a restaurant or hotel, but is home-cooked.A sitting SC judge hosts the weekly common lunch. The dishes are part of the host judges home state, prepared at his residence.A minimum of five food items have to be served in the main course and paan  as per each judges choice  is a must to end the lunch. Sources said judges sometimes call cooks from their native place to prepare dishes with the right local flavour.On other working days judges eat lunch in their own chambers.This Wednesday the judges tucked into home-made traditional food from Madhya Pradesh that was cooked at Justice Arun Misras residence. Pumpkin soup, bharvan bhindi and baingan, malai-kofta and paneer lababdar were on the menu. More than the main course, the dessert was much appreciated. The roasted kheer, pineapple kesar halwa and maalpua were just to die for, a judge told HT.Last week Justice RK Agrawal from Uttar Pradesh was the host. Dry green peas, kadhai paneer and dum aloo flavoured with local spices were laid out at lunch time.THE JUSTICES ARE SERVED In a charming tradition, Supreme Court judges meet for lunch every week, with each of them taking turns to bring ghar ka khana from his or her home state 1 Jagdish Singh Khehar 2 Adarsh Kumar Goel 3 Deepak Gupta 4 N.V.

Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the delicacy that afternoon.And before that the judges had Rajasthani delicacies from Justice AK Sikris kitchen - bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi.Vegetables from Justice Kurien Josephs own kitchen garden were used to cook traditional dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, followed by neatly chopped pineapples. The unusually long ripe bananas from the state were served after the meal.Justice J Chelameswar, who stirred a controversy with his decision to skip collegium meetings, too was a good host when it was his turn. His lunch treat of spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi left the judges licking their fingers.An unwritten rule is strictly followed at these lunches  only vegetarian cuisine is served to respect the sentiments of those who do not eat non-vegetarian food. The host is selected according to the judges seniority.Justice AK Patnaik, who retired in June 2014, fondly remembers how the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had added a new rule not to convert the lunch into a competition between judges. He introduced a penalty for those who exceeded the number of dishes fixed by him, Justice Patnaik recalls.Behind every successful meal is a judges wife, a senior judge told HT. But not for Justice R Banumathi  the lone woman judge  who would have to supervise the lunch herself when her turn comes.The Wednesday lunch not only gives judges an opportunity to taste a variety of Indian cuisines, but also shows their bonhomie. Work is never discussed and judges leave their differences at the door. Food is the only topic of discussion with some of the judges boasting about their local cuisines.A senior judge is appointed as the marshall and he penalises any judge who breaks the rules. At present Justice Bobde is the marshall. An argument with the marshall can aggravate the penalty.A marshall is like a class monitor to whom a complaint is made if a judge is seen breaching the rules. He is also the one who announces the end of the dinner that follows a standing ovation for the host judge, a sitting judge told HT on condition of anonymity.Retired judge Justice Kuldeep Singh who suggested the idea of the weekly lunches in the early Nineties gets nostalgic when asked about what triggered the idea. Justice Ranganath Misra was the Chief Justice then and he agreed for the weekly lunch so that we could all get together. It gave a personal touch and became an exciting event which everyone looked forward to, Justice Singh said.It was an opportunity to unwind and relax over food. Therefore, the rule that work should never be discussed. When we left our gowns in the chambers, we also left our work behind. I always looked forward to meals from south, Justice Singh recollects.Justice GS Singvhi who retired three years ago also has fond memories to share. Those were the only moments when we never discussed work. The lunch ensured that we brushed up our knowledge related to food cooked in our houses he told HT.Nor can he forget the south Indian dishes he had at these lunches. Home-made paisam (dessert), rasam and brown rice of Kerala were my favourites. I never eat sweets due to my sugar problem, but I could not resist the home-made paisam served by a brother judge from the south, he says.Yes, it was difficult for judges to avoid home-cooked preparations, despite health issues. When it was my turn I got two types of dessert ready, which included a sugar-free dessert. To my surprise nobody touched the sugar-free sweet and I always thought that judges were too old, muses Justice Patnaik who enjoyed the variety of chutneys his brother judge from the South got for lunch.A judge recollects how Justice Aftab Alam in his farewell speech on April 18, 2013 described the Wednesday lunch as a congregation of mini India. He said the one thing he would miss post retirement would be the weekly lunch, the judge recalls.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha holds a similar view. The Supreme Court is a mini India. You have judges from all over the country. The lunch used to a gastronomical delight of regional cuisine, he told HT.Justice Lodha had served dal-bati when it was his turn to host the lunch. It was soaked in ghee and I remember that after the lunch session all the judges felt so sleepy. Justice Singhvi, who also got dal-bati, says his preparation was different from Justice Lodhas family recipe. Dal-bati is cooked differently in the Jodhpur region and in the Jaipur region of Rajasthan. That is the beauty of Indian food, he explains.The lunch is laid out on a large rectangular table presided by the CJI. The host sits on his right and gives a brief introduction about the dishes. The rest sit wherever they like.However, the seating arrangement keeps changing. During former CJI HL Dattus tenure, the judges used to sit around circular tables and places were decided as per the lucky draw. A judge recollects how the present CJI JS Khehar ended up sitting next to Justice Dattu thrice. And when the former CJI asked him what conspiracy he was up to, CJI Khehar said it was the lucky draws fault!"

The evergreen revolution involves the integration of ecological principles in technology development and dissemination."" He has made this observation in context with the 50 years of Green Revolution in the country in an article written by him that was published in the Elsevier Journal.The former director general (DG) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) had worked closely with noted American farm scientist Norman E Borlaug to introduce high yielding varieties (HYV) of wheat in Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh.""The major problems associated with the Green Revolution are related to environmental factors like depletion and pollution of groundwater, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. It is these deficiencies that can be remedied through the 'evergreen revolution' pathway developed by me over 30 years ago. Therefore 50 years later we should work for a transition from the green to an 'evergreen revolution', leading to an enhancement in productivity in perpetuity without ecological harm. The technology involves the mainstreaming of ecological factors in technology development and dissemination,"" Prof Swaminathan has mentioned in his article.He further stated that to achieve the goal of food security by ending hunger and to promote sustainable agriculture, it is important that in the field of social protection as well as the scientific measures needed for achieving food and nutrition security, we should move from the green to an 'evergreen revolution' approach.The 91-year-old plant geneticist, who also served the DG of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Manila, has stated, ""Also agriculture, nutrition and health should be brought together in terms of design and delivery systems relating to public health and agriculture production. Anticipatory research for climate change adaptation and mitigation, participatory research for integrating farmers' wisdom with modern technology and translational research to fill the gap between knowledge and its application are all important for global food security."""

For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice.The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems.Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste.Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjabs agriculture department.We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops. Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules.The states pollution control board will take action against farmers who dont follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters  which harvest both wheat and rice  till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw, he added.In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May, said AK Bihnoi, director at the states agriculture department.With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies.Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryanas agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesnt see any need for a central subsidy for such steps.The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said."

He then learned that all the groceries and utensils were kept at the pradhan's house instead of the school. The only dish that was ready for the midday meal was made of potatoes instead of pulses, which is a must on the menu.Next , Yadav inspected the toilets. He found that of the two toilets, one was locked while the other one was in a dilapidated condition, This was an indication that the students were not using the toilet and were going in the open to answer a call of nature.Several other irregularities came to Yadav's notice. He found that 70 students of the 205 enrolled at the school were absentThe upset minister immediately spoke with the DM and CDO , asking them to improve the standard of education and other things . He instructed them to send him pictures of the kitchen, toilets and midday meal to him. He asked the teachers that they motivate their wards to use the toilet regularly.Chief development officer Indramani Tripathi said, ""A few irregularities were detected during the inspection. Teachers told the minister that the midday meal groceries are kept at the pradhan's house to prevent pilferage of foodstuff. The toilets are locked but opened when any student wishes to relieve himself.""After the inspection, minister Yadav attended the Ganga Swachchhta Sankalp Divas programme and administered an oath to all those who were present to make the Ganga clean. He assured the people that both central and state govt have prepared a plan to keep the Ganga clean. It would start bearing fruit within the next two or three months."
593ad9d37be9e01228650162,"Green tribunal wants report on crop burning from Punjab, Haryana &amp; Uttar Pradesh",http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/green-tribunal-wants-report-on-crop-burning-from-punjab-haryana-uttar-pradesh/story-yjDeHViCnBIjKxUuVwdBEK.html,2017-05-03,"The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday asked Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to file status reports on actions taken by the respective state governments to stop crop burning.Agricultural fires in the fields of neighbouring states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, are a major contributor to the deteriorating air quality of Delhi.A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar on Wednesday came down heavily on the three states after fresh incidents of summer-crop burning were brought to its notice on Wednesday.Let them file an affidavit saying how many machines have been purchased with complete details, the farmers who received the machines either freely or against a nominal charge, where was the crop residue being treated and the quantity of biomass produced, the bench directed.The counsel of Punjab claimed that the state has distributed at least 600 machines for sowing wheat without any burning of rice residue and at least R 86 crore have been spent on the machines.The bench, however, lashed out at him saying, It is a plain and simple lie. Everybody is a foul person. Show us the investment proof. Bring in the farmers who received the machines.The NGTs order came on a plea by environmentalist Vikrant Tongad who had sought a ban on burning of agricultural waste and remnants in open fields.The pollution caused by these fires travel to Delhi because of the westerly winds, causing major health concerns among people, say environment experts.Apart from the lungs, the smoke also affects the brain, eyes and the nervous system, say doctors.A study by IIT Kanpur has listed stubble burning as the third highest contributor to Delhis winter air-pollution, after construction dust and vehicular fumes.The green court had earlier fixed the environment compensation amounts per incident of crop burning to be paid by small land owners having less than two acres of land at R 2,500, medium land owners holding over two acres and less than five acres at R 5,000 and those owning over five acres at R 15,000.It had also directed the state governments to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters of crop residue burning and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers.It had said that the five states -- Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi -- which have issued notifications prohibiting agriculture crop residue burning should ensure that these are enforced rigorously and proper action is taken against the defaulters.The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA) in April had also expressed concern over the crop burning gaining pace in the northern region. The EPCA, which has been spearheading crucial anti-pollution measures, warned the state governments of the northern states to stop being in denial and get their act together.According to satellite data, as pointed out by EPCA, the agricultural landscape of Punjab and Haryana is dotted with fires billowing out pollutant-laden smoke as farmers have set fire to the residues of the Rabi crop to usher in the Kharif season."
5922e1b17be9e01fc7f5b1bb,Here's how Wajid Ali Shah made the Kolkata biryani,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heres-how-wajid-ali-shah-made-the-kolkata-biryani/articleshow/58622647.cms,2017-05-11,"You could take the Nawab out of Lucknow, but could you ever take Lucknow out of the Nawab? Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."
5922e2177be9e01fc7f5b242,IPS officer's father found murdered in his Ghaziabad house,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ips-officers-father-found-murdered-in-his-ghaziabad-house/articleshow/58635413.cms,2017-05-12,"GHAZIABAD: An IPS officer's 65-year-old father was found dead with a gunshot wound on his head on Thursday morning in his house in Ghaziabad 's Raj Nagar. One of his five sons, 27-year-old Anuj who has been under treatment for schizophrenia, was booked for the murder.Police said Ishwar Chand Tyagi was shot in his sleep. He had retired for the night on a divan in the living room of the single-storey house, and that was where his lifeless body lay when his wife Rajkumari walked in around 6.45am.On the basis of a complaint filed by Tyagi's nephew Amit later in the day, murder charges were filed against Anuj (Dabbu) at Kavi Nagar police station. No arrests have been made yet.SP (City) Akash Tomar told TOI, ""The wife of the deceased has corroborated the allegations made in the police complaint and confirmed that Anuj had indeed shot at Tyagi. We have formed three teams to nab the accused while efforts are under way to trace his location. The body was sent for an autopsy and its report is awaited.""Anuj, who used to live in a separate house in Kavi Nagar had come to his father's place on Wednesday evening and stayed overnight.Since the shooting, he has gone missing and switched off his mobile phone. The others present in the house at the time of the murder included Amit, a domestic help Manish and Tyagi's daughters-in-law. Police said Tyagi's elder brother Ranveer had also visited the residence on Wednesday but had left at night.Anuj and Tyagi's youngest son Kapil live in Ghaziabad. Of Tyagi's three elder sons, Pravin and Kuldeep live in Mumbai while Sanjiv is a cop, a UP-cadre officer now posted in Lucknow as SP (cooperatives) cell. Tyagi owned a rice mill. The family is originally from Morta village in Ghaziabad.Police said there were differences between Anuj and Tyagi, which had led to quarrels between the two. Anuj is believed to have suffered huge financial losses in a company in which he had invested as a partner around three years ago. A source said he had a history of violent behaviour and had been jailed in the past for opening fire inside a park. Anuj has been undergoing treatment at Vimhans in Delhi for the past few years.Dr Neerav Tyagi, superintendent of Pulmonic hospital that examined Tyagi's body, said, ""The victim was brought to the hospital around 8.30am. There was a single lacerated wound at the top of his skull. He was dead by the time his body was brought to the emergency ward of the hospital.""The hospital issued a memo about the death to police around 9.30am. Teams of policemen thereafter reached the hospital as well as the Tyagi residence for investigations."

The nine-time MP from Bihar was recently in the news for urging restaurants to specify food portions on their menus. Last week, he also slammed Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for speaking out against the government. Thackeray had accused Paswan of forcibly getting a sentence  that NDA will fight 2019 elections under the leadership of PM Modi  added in an NDA resolution.RAM VILAS PASWAN: When I took charge of the ministry, the Food Security Act had already come into force (July 5, 2013) but was implemented in only 11 states. Today, the Act is in force in all 29 states. 67 per cent of the countrys population or 81 crore people are getting rice at Rs 3 per kilo and wheat at Rs 2 per kilo. The Centre bears the subsidy cost, but the state governments claim that they are paying for it. They dont pay a single penny.We want to make use of modern technology to make transactions cashless. Of the 23 crore ration card holders in the country, 19 crore have been linked to Aadhaar. The benefit of this process is that 14 crore ration cards were found to be fake. If it (Aadhaar) is integrated in more states, a lot of money can be saved.On the issue of food portions, we have not told restaurants how much to serve and how much to charge the customer. What we have said is that the consumer should know what they are getting for the price they are paying. If I am paying Rs 700 for a bowl of soup, I should know what quantity of it is being served. (Last month the minister had suggested that restaurants specify on their menus the amount of food they serve per portion.)ANAND MISHRA: Some of your old socialist friends are now forming a mahagathbandhan with the Congress to name a common Opposition candidate for the presidential polls. They are also trying to put up a united Opposition front for the 2019 elections.These people (opposition parties) are wasting time. Look, it is the Oppositions job to propose their candidate. It is not surprising at all. But I see no coordination and understanding between the opposition parties. In Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav are not on the same page. Mulayam says there will be no tie-up with the Congress, and Akhilesh is talking about an understanding with them. Then there is the Left, Mamata Banerjee (TMC), Congress and Arvind Kejriwal (AAP). The Opposition is fragmented and divided. For the first time, there is no Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The Opposition can come together and nominate their candidate for the presidential polls, but nothing will come of it.ANAND MISHRA: In the past, socialist leaders and splinter groups of the Janata Dal came together with the Left to form an Opposition front against the ruling Congress. They are coming together now as well.At the time when the opposition parties came together against the Congress, there was no one with the Congress. But now, when the BJP-led NDA is in power, there are many parties that have joined hands with the BJP. Like in the Janata Party government, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was foreign minister. In 1967 in Bihar, when the Janata Party formed the government, the BJP was with us and so was the Left. But today, the situation has changed.See, the biggest thing is credibility. During that period, the Opposition had never been in power. So people thought that when the Opposition comes to power, there would be new vision and direction. But today members of the Opposition have already had opportunities to run governments, and people have seen them. So what is the point of forming the mahagathbandhan?COOMI KAPOOR: The Supreme Court recently ordered that Lalu Prasad will stand trial in all fodder scam cases. Do you think it will affect the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar?There are two things here  mass perception and actual impact. The mass perception has been formed. First it was the Mohammad Shahabuddin episode, when he was granted bail. Then he was sent to Tihar. Now, an audio tape has emerged where a criminal like Shahabuddin is heard instructing Lalu Prasad, who is himself a convict, regarding a superintendent of police. The (Bihar) government is responsible for this and they must now clarify.Then there is the controversy over land deals involving his sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi. And now we have the Supreme Court judgment asking Lalu to face trial in all fodder scam cases.There is an ongoing cold war between Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar claims to be the face of sushasan (good governance), but so far he has remained silent over these issues.Many people claim that the (state) government is behind this, and some are even pointing to the role of RJD leaders who have been upset with Lalu Prasad. Nitish Kumar wants Lalu Prasads party to remain weak and surrounded by controversies. The RJD has more seats in the Bihar Assembly than the JD(U). The RJD has 80 seats (the JD-U has 71). One has the crown and the other has the power.ABANTIKA GHOSH: You have been a minister in both UPA and NDA governments. Whats the difference in their working styles?There was lack of decision-making in the UPA government. This could have been because it was a coalition government. Taking decisions was tough in the UPA government, there was no clear path. The government remained confused.The BJP-led NDA government has a majority in the Lok Sabha. Narendra Modi is currently the tallest leader in the BJP as well as in the country. He gets praise for the governments work and faces all of the criticism. Even if a decision is risky, the present dispensation takes a call.Take demonetisation for instance. The UPA government could have never taken a decision on the matter, but this government took the risk and was ready to face the consequences.The other difference is the lack of corruption. Its been three years and there is no corruption taint on this government. During the previous government, there were corruption charges every month.This government has only one centre of power. In the previous government, there were two centres.ANAND MISHRA: There are reports that ties between the BJP and Shiv Sena are strained.What can the Shiv Sena do? In Maharashtra, except for Mumbai, the BJP has won all the civic body elections. Even in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, there was a very small difference between the two parties. The Sena thinks that if it does not oppose the BJP in Maharashtra, it will lose ground. During the recent NDA meeting, we told them not to raise issues with the BJP in public.For example, it was unanimously decided at an NDA meeting that Narendra Modi will be our PM candidate in 2019. However, the Sena later claimed otherwise. All allies were of the view that Narendra Modi is the tallest leader in the country and thats why we took the decision.VANDITA MISHRA: Do you agree with the BJPs decision to appoint Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh?This issue concerns the BJP. The party got a massive mandate and it has a system in place to make such choices. Who are we to say anything on their choice for the CMs post.ANAND MISHRA: Whenever there is an issue between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad, it is speculated that Nitish will return to the NDA fold. Is that a possibility?Nitish Kumar has a double card. He is apprehensive of Lalu Prasad taking over the reins of the government. The RJD has 80 seats and the Congress has 27, which gives them a total of 107 seats.Nitish fears that in case their alliance breaks, Lalu will manage to get support from some of the JD(U) MLAs. That is why he keeps sending signals to the RJD that if you withdraw support I have another way to get the numbers.Nitish needs to make up his mind on whether he wants to stay in the Mahagathbandhan, resign and seek mid-term polls, or if he wants to join the NDA.So, first he needs to take a clear stand and only then will the NDA decide on whether to support or oppose his inclusion in the alliance.ABANTIKA GHOSH: Recently, the PM backed generic drugs. You have held the Chemicals and Fertilisers portfolio. What are your views on it?I have been pitching for generic drugs since 2007. I also support printing of names of drugs in regional languages. Names of drugs are mostly printed in English and sometimes in Hindi too. I had told M Karunanidhi, when he was the Tamil Nadu chief minister, to push for printing of names of medicines in Tamil.SANDIP DAS: Aadhaar seeding in the Public Distribution System (PDS) has been slow in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. How do you want to pursue it?They are yet to give us names of at least 10-15 lakh beneficiaries. The state government picks all the stocks and yet we get several complaints of the poor not getting grains. When we seed Aadhaar numbers with ration cards, it will stop people from picking up ration from multiple locations under one name. It will stop pilferage.The Central government stores food grains at FCI godowns. From there the state government picks up the stock. We tried to computerise the entire process and asked state governments to pay 50 per cent of the expenses. But the entire process has yet not been fully computerised.ANAND MISHRA: You were part of the all-party delegation to Kashmir in both the UPA and NDA governments. You have also met separatist leaders from the Valley in past. At the moment, the BJP is in favour of a muscular policy to handle the issue. What, in your opinion, is the way forward?We had met separatist leaders such as Yasin Malik and Syed Ali Shah Geelani. But the situation is completely different now. I dont think that these leaders are influential anymore. In fact they are now using the language of terrorists to keep themselves relevant. The first issue is that certain people give youths stones to throw at security forces, and in response, the forces open fire. On both sides our people die, and those responsible remain safe.The other issue is of terror activities. There is no dispute between political parties and other sections of the society on the fact that such activities are supported by Pakistan. We have asked the government to adopt a tit-for-tat policy and give complete freedom to the Army.ANAND MISHRA: Can you elaborate on the tit-for-tat policy.We only want an equally strong reaction to Pakistans actions.HARISH DAMODARAN: What are your views on the Supreme Courts order to arrest Justice C S Karnan.It is a justice verses justice matter. I wont comment on the issue.HARISH DAMODARAN: Do you support reservation in the higher judiciary?We want an Indian judicial service on the lines of the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service. In such a system the judges will be selected through competition, putting all questions about the collegium system to rest. No one can doubt the efficiency of IAS and IPS officers because they are selected through a competition. Similarly, no one will raise questions on judges if they are selected through a competition.I fully support the idea of an Indian judicial service, conducting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together, State funding of political parties, and keeping a record of foreign funding (to NGOs).SRIJANA MITRA DAS: With Mayawati losing Dalit votes and the BJP reaching out to the community, dont you think Dalit identity politics is being marginalised? Also, what are your views on the politics around beef?Mayawati falsely claims to be a Dalit leader. Dalits stand for Scheduled Castes. There are many castes among the Dalits  Paswans, Pasis, Jatavs etc. She was the leader of only one Dalit caste, but claimed to represent the entire community. She only inherited the legacy of Kanshi Ram. Has she participated in any Dalit welfare movement? Where was she during the Mandal Commission movement?She just believes in vote-bank politics. First she suffered a massive defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and now in the Assembly polls. She will have to form an alliance even to secure her seat in the Rajya Sabha next year.Because of social awakening across the country, one single leader does not represent an entire community anymore. No Brahmin represents the entire community, no Rajput represents the entire community. Likewise, no leader can claim to represent all Dalits. In Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswan has the support of Dalits, but he cant make similar claims in Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, Lalu Prasad is the leader of Yadavs in Bihar, but he has no say in Uttar Pradesh; Mulayam Singh Yadav is zero in Bihar. The BSP cant win a single seat outside Uttar Pradesh.SRIJANA MITRA DAS: And what about beef politics? People are being killed because of it.Beef, triple talaq, Article 370 and Ram Janmabhoomi are issues raised by political parties, but it cant be part of the governments policy. Have you ever heard anything from PM on Article 370 (that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir)?VANDITA MISHRA: But BJP-ruled states are bringing in stricter laws against cow slaughter.When they bring in any such law, you can ask for my views. Recently, in Uttar Pradesh, there was a controversy surrounding closure of slaughterhouses. We looked into that issue. Those were illegal slaughterhouses.ANAND MISHRA: Should the government talk to separatists in Kashmir?The mass perception is against any talks with the separatists when our soldiers are being killed. The mass perception is also that terror activities should stop and separatists must cut all ties with terrorists.As soon as separatists disown terrorists, we will initiate talks with them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593ae9e87be9e00e1ecd4530,Liquor cuffs on Dal leader kin,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170515/jsp/bihar/story_151620.jsp,2017-05-15,"Sasaram sub-divisional police officer Alok Ranjan (seated in centre) briefs reporters after the special operation against bootleggers in Rohtas on Sunday. Picture by Sanjay Choudhary Two relatives of the national president of the JDU youth wing were among six people arrested on Sunday in connection with the seizure of 120 cartons or around 1,036 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) in Rohtas district. The arrest of the JDU leader's kin is likely to come as a major embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar-led government, which has made war against liquor the cornerstone of its politics. Confirming the arrests and seizure, Rohtas superintendent of police (SP) Manavjit Singh Dhillon said: ""Investigations are going on in the case. We won't be able to provide much details about the case."" However, sources in the police said the people arrested from Kargahar, around 160km southwest of Patna, included Ramchandra Rai and Sadanand Singh, the father-in-law and the brother-in-law of Sanjay Kumar, the national president of Yuva (youth wing) JDU. ""We came to know about their connection only when they started dropping Sanjay's name. We found the relations to be correct. All the arrested are being interrogated and would be produced before a magistrate later on,"" a senior police officer told The Telegraph. The Telegraph could not contact Sanjay despite several attempts. However, JDU spokesperson and Legislative Council member Neeraj Kumar said: ""Sanjay is not involved in the case because he lives in New Delhi. How would he know what his in-laws are doing in Bihar? People can see that the rule of law in the state does not even exempt relatives of top leaders. If they commit wrong, the law will take its own course as in this case."" Manoj Gupta, Shashi Kumar, Chandan Kumar and Rasbihari Yadav were the others arrested in the case. They all belong to different parts of Rohtas district. The police officer said investigations were on to ascertain whether or not Sanjay colluded with those arrested in their operations. All the bottles belong to Royal Style brand and their labels show that they were manufactured and bottled in Chandigarh. Sasaram sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Alok Ranjan said: ""The seized liquor bottles were hidden in a distributary of Sone river at Karpura village under Kargahar police station area in the district. The distributary (water distributing channel) was dry."" ""The arrests and seizures were done on the basis of our increased surveillance across the district in light of prohibition. We were probing a case related to the seizure of around 900 litres of IMFL from a container truck here by the economic offences unit on January 30 this year, when the involvement of the people arrested today (Sunday) came to light. We were conducting technical surveillance and the mobile numbers of Ramchandra and Sadanand cropped up. They procured IMFL illegally from other states and distributed in Rohtas,"" Alok added. Sunday's seizure was also made on the basis of mobile surveillance of the accused, sources in the police said. Sadanand supplies broken/residual grains of milled rice to distilleries in Punjab and Haryana. The police believe he started dealing in illegal liquor in Bihar by using his connections in those states. Rohtas has seen around six major seizures since total prohibition was implemented in Bihar on April 5, 2016. Its location along Bihar's border with Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand helps bootleggers and liquor mafia, who have opened several channels to smuggle in liquor."
593557a67be9e061b1736c0a,Surprise checks on schools for midday meals,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surprise-checks-on-schools-for-midday-meals/articleshow/58674348.cms,2017-05-15,"NAGPUR: From the upcoming academic session, zilla parishad officials will be cracking down on schools that fail to implement midday meals (MDM) scheme properly.Nilesh Waghmare, district in charge for MDM said, ""There will be increased supervision and lot of surprise checks at schools to ensure that children are getting nutritious, tasty and hygienic food.""Waghmare's statements comes two days after a baby snake, also known as a 'snakelet', was found in the food served to students in a school in Uttar Pradesh. The academic session for state board schools in city, where MDM is served, will begin from either June 26 or 27. The task for Waghmare will definitely be tough because there are over 2,000 schools in district serving MDM and the staff dedicated for this task is less than a dozen. As per MDM guidelines, the primary responsibility for checking the food lies with the school's principal.Waghmare said, ""Safety of children is our main goal and we will ensure that they get good quality food as per the guidelines. Nagpur district has lakhs of students benefiting from the MDM scheme and it is a huge responsibility. I am drawing up plans to ensure that random checks will be held in schools on a regular basis.""In city, schools get raw rice in bulk quantity from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns based on requisition sent to Waghmare's office. The rice is delivered directly to school campus by contracted transporter. But other items like pulses, vegetables, oil and spices have to be purchased by schools and then the bill is reimbursed by ZP.In the last two years there have been only two cases of food poisoning reported in the district. Waghmare said, ""Starting surprise checks does not mean that we are accusing anybody in particular. It's just a method of double checking how things are being implemented at the ground level. We will act both on information received from public and random geographical selection of schools.""He added that neglecting to adhere to guidelines is considered a serious problem. Waghmare said, ""This puts the lives of hundreds of kids in danger, so we are looking at a major problem. In food poisoning cases anyway the police get involved and we also conduct a separate inquiry into the incident."""
59284b7f7be9e0137c77c937,Beef export: unethical slaughter for money,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612138/beef-export-unethical-slaughter-money.html,2017-05-17,"Ritwick Dutta, May 17 2017, 23:51 ISTThe massive growth of the meat export industry in India in the last few years has ushered in what is infamously called the Pink Revolution. This revolution has today become the centre of public debate and political discourse, principally because of the crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of India.Viewing the ongoing controversy over slaughterhouses only from the lens of the right of the people to decide what they want to eat or of religious intolerance, overlooks many fundamental questions.Should a country like India promote the export of meat? Have we really considered the environmental, social and ethical issues while focussing on the export earning and jobs provided by slaughterhouses? At a time when even rivers, lakes and glaciers have been considered as legal and living entities by a high court, should animals continue to be treated as inanimate sources of protein and revenue?The fact is that we must make a distinction between meat for domestic consumption and meat for export. The irony is, today India is the worlds largest exporter of beef; its total export is valued at Rs 26,000 crore and is slated to grow further.Indias legal beef export consists essentially of buffalo meat called carabeef. As of now, beef has surpassed Basmati rice as India's top agricultural export. India's buffaloes are being largely slaughtered not to add protein or satisfy the taste buds of its citizens, but of the people of 65 countries where it is exported.The country has been eager to tap the Chinese meat market; the worlds largest. China had, till recently, not allowed the direct import of Indias beef due to the prevalence of the foot and mouth disease here. It was only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China in 2015, that the Chinese government decided to send inspectors to visit India's abattoir to ascertain their conditions. In January, 2017, China finally allowed the import of Indian beef.India sees buffalo meat export as a means to reduce its massive trade deficit with China. Thus, while the ruling BJP actively advocates against the Pink Revolution, the Union government under the leadership of the same party has succeeded in opening a direct export channel for beef with China.Legal or illegal, slaughterhouses and the promotion of meat industry for export have serious environmental and social consequences. From an environmental standpoint, large-scale export of meat itself is a precious drain on the countrys natural resources.Meat industry is highly water-intensive: for producing just a kilo of meat, roughly 15,000 litres of water is required (UN World Water Development report, 2012). Thus, when India exports meat, it is not just exporting meat, but also large quantities of scarce water. Thus, a virtual trade in water takes place. Lax regulations and low wages make Indian meat far cheaper than other competing countries.Cruel industryThe export of meat raises an important question: do we have the moral and ethical right to kill in the most brutal and cruel manner to meet our foreign exchange requirement? Buffaloes are reared, transported and slaughtered in the most unthinkable manner. In a slaughter house, every effort is made to ensure that the animal suffers unimaginable pain. In the whole process of meat export, a live animal with emotions is reduced to an inanimate lifeless resource.Just because an animal is not the holy cow, does it legitimise it being subjected to excruciating pain and torture? It would not be amiss to say that the torture we inflict on meek and helpless animals in slaughterhouses is akin to the sufferings of people in the concentration camps under the Nazi regime.As a countrys living standards improve, activities that are hazardous and promote pollution are increasingly resisted by the local people; a classic example of Not in My Backyard syndrome. As quality of life and liveability index become important yardsticks in peoples lives, slaughterhouses, with their high polluting nature, have no place in the urban and rural landscape.A few years ago, the Sup-reme Court prohibited the export of iron ore from Goa and Karnataka. The export earnings from mining did not, according to the court, reflect the true social and environmental impact. Indias meat export is no different. It is an extractive industry given the nature of natural resources it uses.Slaughter houses, despite their high pollution load, are not subject to any Environmental Impact Assessment. The impact on the ecology as well as the people are never ascertained scientifically. No cost benefit analysis is done. No public hearing takes place. The public has no say in deciding whether slaughter houses should be allowed or not.We need an impartial debate on whether India should continue in its path as a global giant in meat export. India has many skills it can use to its optimal capacity to earn a place as a global economic giant. It will be sad indeed if the worlds largest democracy is one day known globally for its skill in raising and killing animals for consumption.(The writer is an environmental lawyer)"

Its managing director Sudhir Kumar Dhingra termed Thursday's ceremony a significant day for the textile industry in eastern India.""When we met the chief minister last year, he wanted a labour intensive industrial sector which can stop the migration of state's unemployed youth,"" Dhingra said. Drawing comparison to the textile industry of Bangladesh, Dhingra said the industry, if nurtured well, can give competition to Bangladesh.The Medicant Group of Hospital (Bokaro Sewa Trust) got land to set up a 500-bed hospital in Bokaro at a net worth of Rs 150 crore. Its managing director Majid said, ""We have hospitals in New Delhi, NCR and Jammu & Kashmir. But unlike other states we got everything here on a single plate. What surprised us was the pace at which roads were built here to improve connectivity between cities.""Entrepreneurs from the food processing sector also sounded upbeat. Uttar Pradesh-based rice bran oil manufacturer Chandra Prakash Agarwal said, ""Investors with smaller capitals are always looked down in other states. However in Jharkhand, the chief minister himself took the initiative of laying the foundation stone of our plant (in Ranchi). In other states, CMs only lay foundation stones of public-sector projects.""The positive feedback from the entrepreneurs will help the state government to build on its new image of an investor-friendly state in future, officers of the state industries department said. ""The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted with the objective of assuring investors that the government is committed to promises it made at the summit,"" an officer said.The ground-breaking ceremony was envisaged by the Das government as a confidence building measure among the investors who inked memoranda of understanding (MOU) worth Rs 3.1 lakh crore. The Das government went into overdrive soon after completion of the summit. The CM directed senior officers of the department to provide land and environmental clearances to several projects within six months. Senior officers went around hunting for land in the outskirts of Ranchi and zeroed in on 150 acres of land in Oremanjhi, Nagri and Tupudana areas."

Express Photo by Partha Paul Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. Express Photo by Partha Paul50 years ago, on May 25, an uprising in this North Bengal block changed the politics of the country, and continues to agitate it. But where it all started, the original rebels have little strength left against a new breed of landowners, the land mafia, allowing BJP a foothold in its ideological battle against the Left. Esha Roy goes to the ground.In March 1967, after years of oppression by landlords, the peasants of Naxalbari village in North Bengals Darjeeling district rose up in revolt, in one of the countrys most defining uprisings. Under Charu Majumdar, Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal, the Naxals, as they came to be known, seized land from the jotedars (landlords), grains from their godowns and distributed it among the peasants.The State retaliated by torturing villages, leading to May 24, when thousands gheraoed a police party at Jharujote. Inspector Sonam Wangdi was killed, three officers were injured. The next day, at Bengai Jote, 11 villagers, including eight women and two children, were shot dead by police. The firing would trigger an armed guerrilla resistance that, 50 years later, continues to inspire other such movements in the country, including in neighbouring Nepal and the Maoists. Today, as tea workers pick the First Flush of Darjeeling in Naxalbaris lush tea estates, the blood bath is a distant memory.Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)As the CPI (ML) Liberation and other fractured smaller Left parties prepare for the 50th anniversary of the uprising, the preparations are low-key. The headlines have instead been hijacked by the BJP, after its president Amit Shah chose Naxalbari to begin his tour of the five states where the party is yet to make his mark including, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana. Addressing party workers, Shah said, This is the place where violence had started. Now this is the same Naxalbari where Modijis Sabka Saath, Sabka Bikash slogan can be heard. I have full faith that development will defeat the violence.On May 29, says Naxalbari block BJP president Dilip Barui, the party unit will be inducting 220 new members. Asserting that the party presence in the region once dominated by the Left is steadily growing, Barui says, Local leaders and workers from the CPM, Congress and TMC from Naxalbari, Matigara, Bagdogra, Batasi will be joining us.Barui also points out that in the last panchayat elections, held in 2014, the BJP won one or two seats in every panchayat. In the 2016 Assembly polls, its candidate came in third, close on the heels of the TMC. While the Congress-CPM joint candidate won, the BJP leader says the gap is closing. This is a Left-dominated area. But people know there is no point supporting the Left any longer. The BJP is the future.Abhijeet Majumdar, the Darjeeling district secretary of the CPI(ML) Liberation and the son of Charu Majumdar, says there is more to the BJP campaign than the tussle for Naxalbari. Amit Shah knows that there is only one faction that can stand up to the huge Hindutva surge in the country. After the BJPs victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections, he did not celebrate. Instead his statement was that the BJPs golden era would come only when Bengal and Kerala are taken. He knows it is only with the death of the Left that Hindutva can flourish in the country.The six gram panchayats that make up the Naxalbari block are a patchwork of old tea estates, but now there is a new rush in the air. The National Highway that cuts through the area is being widened to a six-lane road, flyovers are being constructed, hotels and flashy malls have sprung up. And once again, real estate is at a premium.However, unlike that time half a century ago, with its call of Langor jaar, jamin taar (land belongs to those who till it), the battle for land today is more insidious. There are no loud protests or gunfire as the new breed of landlords, the land mafia, mops up chunks. Mani Mahatos 22-year-old primary school for tribal children in Jharujote, a stones throw away from where Inspector Wangdi was killed, shut down in 2011. Well-respected in the area, he no longer teaches, instead selling chaat from a small stall.Mahato recalls how they had all got land after the 1967 movement. But several years ago, people claiming to be descendants of our landlords came, propped up by the land mafia. The mafia told us to give up our land in return for compensation. They also said we would have to fight long-drawn battles in court. We were all scared. So most of us gave up our land. I got Rs 2 lakh for my 1.5 bighas, he says.Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul)He adds that many descendants later turned out to be fake but, when the real ones came, they too struck a deal with the land mafia. The mafia has been selling off land to people from Manipur, Nagaland and Shillong. Nepali families who cant buy land there have come here to settle down. The land grab means that members of the 50-odd tribal families who live in the village and had tilled the land earlier are now daily wagers. Most people have left. They have gone to Kerala, Gujarat and Chennai in search of work, Mahato says.He admits he supported the BJP candidate in the last panchayat polls (he lost by a mere 40 votes). The CPM did nothing for us, nor did the TMC. When they first came to power, I thought maybe this new party will help. We have tried the Congress, the Left, the TMC. Let us give the BJP a chance.Among the early members of the Naxal guerrilla force was Kandra Murmu, 62, who continues to live in Bittan Jote, once a part of the Naxal liberated zone. Like his village, his life is sedate now. Hailing from a family of bhagchashis (share croppers), Murmu tills his one bigha of land. He used to grow paddy, now he grows jute. His son helps. But the battle for land has returned.Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul)When the andolan was over, Charu Majumdar made sure we all got land. Jotedars were eliminated and we got pattas. But it turns out that in legal government documents, the land still belongs to the landlord. I registered my complaint to the panchayat but nothing changes, he says. After a pause, he adds, Its not possible to take up arms again. That atmosphere is just not conducive.Murmu joined the Naxals when 12, and spent many years underground. He is sad at the fate of the agitation he gave some of his best years to. If it wasnt for Naxalbari, zamindari would still exist in the country. But farmers still dont have land rights. It is a different kind of battle now, more difficult. But the government and the political parties are self-serving.Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. We have received reports of this. But the government has issued pattas to tribal families to cultivate these plots and if they are selling these on their own volition, there is nothing we can do, she says, adding their hands are tied without a complaint. We have come to know plots are being sold to outsiders at Rs 3-4 lakh a plot. At some point, we will take action, she adds.Shanti Munda, 74, one of the most well-known faces of the Naxalbari movement, who joined the protests as a young mother with her newborn, says the situation is the same in her Hathighisa village, neighbouring Naxalbari village. There are no jobs here. People cant eat. In order to sustain themselves, they have sold off their land. As many as 16 tea gardens have shut down in the Dooars. In this area alone, four tea gardens have shut down. The government says it is providing rice at Rs 2 a kg for the affected tea garden workers. But you need to be able to earn to even pay that Rs 2, she says.Munda, who unsuccessfully contested the local elections in 1982, winning just 3,500 votes, adds that Modis people keep visiting her. They came one-and-a-half months ago, just before Shahs visit. They said, We will do the work here, what you tried with the bullet, we will bring with the ballot. Another time they came to me and said that they would construct a new village at Hathighisa, make it a model one.Nantu Ghoshs family has owned a Hero cycle dealership for over 35 years in Naxalbari town, which is like any other flourishing Indian town. Rows of shops selling electronics, garments, sweets, furniture jostle for space. The town was never that affected by the Naxals, Ghosh says. There is a BSF camp here, so they mainly steered clear. Nevertheless there was an atmosphere of fear.Now, the 60-year-old believes, the Naxal movement is finished for good. Nothing good can happen in India. There is so much corruption, all parties are the same. If the Naxals couldnt bring about changes, nobody can. We have a Congress MLA here but he won because of the alliance with the CPM. But the Left is waning too. We feel that if there is a party that can compete with Mamata Banerjee now, it is the BJP.Ghosh understands that much of what parties do is petty politics. But adds, The Naxal leaders are all dead Kanu Sanyal died in abject poverty. In this day and age, one has to look after ones family, you have to survive. You cant be a revolutionary.Naxalbari Sharada Shishu Tirtha Vidyalaya was established in 1999 by RSS swayamsevak Sujit Das, who is also the schools Pradhan Acharya (principal). It began as a single rented room in Naxalbari village, but by 2002 had amassed enough funds to buy a two-acre plot in a quieter part of Naxalbari town. The school now caters to 539 students, mostly from Rajbongshi (SC) and Adivasi (ST) communities, and has expanded up to Class VIII. It is one of the largest primary schools in Naxalbari and Das says the aim is to grow up to Class X. He says he has applied for registration with the Education Department. When we started, Naxalbari had just one government higher secondary school and some private primary schools. People wanted to send their children to school. They just didnt have anywhere to send them, says Das.Apart from regular schooling, the students learn yoga, moral science and music, where they are taught patriotic songs. Das says they are encouraged to eat vegetarian food.At shivir camps at the school, children stay for two-three days to learn the correct lifestyle, and are also taken to tribal areas and tea gardens to distribute clothes and food to the underprivileged. We have many such social activities. When Panighata tea garden shut down, we provided food to the 11 tea garden families for a month and a half, says Das.It helps that about 60 per cent of North Bengals votes lie in its tea gardens. Das is also the advisor to the RSS shakha which operates in Naxalbari town. While he does not reveal numbers, he says membership to the RSS is growing. Seventeen of Naxalbaris young swayamsevaks just left for Muslim-dominated Malda district for a camp.The Left realises the danger it is facing. Outside the office of the CPI(ML) Liberation, a large sign says: Resist the onslaught of BJP-RSS combine. As part of the Naxalbari Golden Jubilee Celebrations, the CPI (ML) Liberation has planned marches and a large public event at Siliguri, where Communists from across the country are expected to come. Seventy-five cultural activist troupes from across the country will perform.Sitting inside, beneath photos of Left icons such as Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong, Abhijeet Majumdar, laments that the Left remains disjointed to take on the BJP onslaught. Right after the BJP came to power in 2014, we held a Central Committee meeting in Delhi. We resolved that keeping in mind that the BJP had a corporate-fascist agenda, it was imperative that all the Left parties come together and form a united front. We even invited the Aam Aadmi Party. The first person to respond to this was Prakash Karat. But the initiative remained still-born.The vice-president of the TMCs Darjeeling district unit, Amar Sinha, insists they are not worried about the BJP. In Naxalbari, the BJP is basically the RSS. They are playing their usual dirty communal politics. We conduct awareness campaigns, explain to people what this is. No doubt, some are swayed by the BJP. But many are not.West Bengal Congress general secretary O P Mishra calls Shahs visit nothing more than good optics for the BJP. The Congress-CPM combine is strong here. Mishra also claims that the land mafia in the area is controlled by the TMC. Naxalbari is close to Siliguri and located at the foothills of Darjeeling. So the land prices have been going up. This is being exploited by the land mafia. But when the administration and police are partisan, it becomes difficult for us to do anything. With the tea gardens shutting down, the economic situation has worsened, making people more desperate. Shanti Munda says it may be too early to write the Left obituary. People believe that the Naxals are irrelevant, this is not true. It is not over yet. We will be back.Agrees CPI(ML) general secretary Partha Ghosh. Our numbers may have come down, the Naxals may have been wiped out, but every one who resists is a Naxal  the student in JNU who stood up to Smriti Irani, the Maruti factory worker who resists oppression, those in the movements against POSCO.To read this article in Malayalam, click hereFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

For anybody who has spent his childhood in the North Indian plains, the two abiding memories of his summer perhaps would be the deliciously awaited mangoes and summer vacations.In the peak of summer afternoons, when going out was prohibited by the grown-ups, one remembers the greedy, slurpy helpings of delicious Dussehries and Langdas, all floating in a bucket of water, in verandas that were cocooned with 'chiks'. Just like now, there was a short span of a few weeks when the fruit vendors and bazaars were overwhelmed with a virtual glut of delicious and soft yellow Dussehries and greenish yellow Langdas. Yes, there were others, the Alphonsoes and the Totaparis and a couple of weeks later the Ratauls but delicious as they were, they had their niche fans-like the Talat Mahmoods and Hemant Kumars but the Dussehries and Langdas were the Rafi and Kishore--the bread and butter delicacies of everyday. Nothing could beat the sheer pleasure of sucking on a mango and then peeling and devouring its insides with sticky fingers.Cutting them into pieces and using spoon and fork was reserved only for the occasional guests. An mango shake was a delicacy alright but it lacked the easy spontaneity of eating a mango in its natural form.The other memory of those distant summers is that of the much awaited school vacations. I still remember that due to some strange reason, my government school had a vacation of 50 days, till the last week of June, while all the other schools used to enjoy vacation till early July. The pain of going to school in those last weeks of June, year after year, when my sister could still enjoy 10 more days of summer vacation, rankles to this day! Mostly, most of my friends and we would stay in our homes for large parts of those vacations, even when none of us had ever heard of terms like `staycation'. This was partly because the father didn't have summer vacation, unless he was a school teacher himself, and also because of the money that was required to go for an extended holiday anywhere. In those days, going on vacation usually meant going to a grandparent's house, maternal or paternal, sure in the belief that the grandchildren would always be welcomed with open arms.So, we would be travelling on the Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express chair-car to Kolkata. In those days, the Rajdhani Express ran only to Kolkata and Mumbai.They were, unlike today, the acknowledged pride of the Indian Railways and had a chair-car for an 18-hour journey. The plush coaches with piped music and covered tube lights, attendants in sharp uniforms, tea served in thermos, foil-wrapped chapatis and rice and chicken curry were a class apart. I can still feel the tingle of excitement, re membering how we used to await the journey, standing at the platform of New Delhi railway station, amid the din and heat and dust, waiting for the coaches to arrive. The thought of discomfort of sitting through an 18-hour journey never crossed our tiny minds. We just couldn't imagine anything more in those days and you can't miss what you can't even imagine! Today, too, the summer vacations have started, not for me, but for my daughter and perhaps one would go for a short trip in air-conditioned vehicles to one of the overrated hill stations, stay for a few days in an overpriced hotel and perhaps even enjoy it but the excitement of those childhood summer vacations, with their mango-filled aroma, long train journeys and chik-covered verandas would always remain with me as the most cherished of memories!(The writer is a Lucknow enthusiast and an IAS officer.

""I have got information from credible sources that Tewari could be a victim of the foodgrain smuggling mafia.This is what middle-level officials in Karnataka are talking,"" she said in the letter.Tewari's family has alleged that he was about to expose a food scam.Speaking to TOI, Karandlaje, who was the food and civil supplies minister from 20102012 in the state's BJP government, said: "" A lot of corruption happens in transportation of rice from the food and civil supplies department godowns to fair price shops. I have some ground-level officers telling me that he was looking into these irregularities.""Karandlaje claimed she had no reasons to suspect that anyone in Uttar Pradesh wanted to kill him. ""I have asked for a CBI probe as the case involves two states and it cannot be investigated by the Special Investigation Team of Uttar Pradesh alone,"" she added. With the CBI commencing probe, the state Congress government's Rs 4,400 crore per annum flagship programme Anna Bhagya, covering 1.08 crore families, may also come under the scanner. T he scheme envisages giving 7 kg rice per person to BPL families at Re 1 per kg.An RTI application filed in 2016 had pointed out to discrepancies in payments regarding procurement of rice for Anna Bhagya during 2013-2014. While the Chhattisgarh government claimed to have supplied rice worth Rs 346 crore to Karnataka which maintained it paid Rs 383 crore. The CBI is likely to look into more such lapses including pilferages during transportation of rice from godowns to ration shops.Officials, however, said that Tewari was barely a month into the food and civil supplies department to understand the public distribution system and associated pilferages to comprehend a scam as claimed by his family .Food and civil supplies secretary Harsh Gupta, who was Tewari's immediate senior, said he's not concerned overtly about the complaint lodged by his family . ""It's a sad situation. The cops will do their job and investigate. The truth will be out there for everyone to see,"" he said.Food and civil supplies minister U T Khader said, ""Our department does not have any opportunity for a Rs 2,000 crore scam as claimed by the officer's family . And even if there was one, he could have brought it to the notice of Governor, CM or me. Where is the evidence for the CBI to probe?""Chief minister Siddaramaiah has welcomed UP government's decision to recommend for a CBI probe in IAS officer Anurag Tewari's death. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, the CM said, ""We had written to UP CM Yogi Adityanath for a thorough probe."" Meanwhile, a section of the bureaucracy feared that the BJP-led Centre could use the CBI to indulge in witch-hunting in Karnataka on the pretext of trying to ascertain if Tewari was about to expose a scam. ""We want the truth but don't want parties to politicize his death,"" a senior IAS officer said. TNNLucknow's Mahanagar forensic science laboratory will not handle viscera and other samples collected from the crime scene and Anurag Tewari's body.Conceding to the demands of Tewari's family, Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar on Monday assured them that the exhibits will be sent to reputed medical science institutes elsewhere.Tewari's brother Mayank raised doubts on credentials of Mahanagar laboratory, its director and some of his subordinates. ""A joint director-level officer of Mahanagar laboratory tried to influence the panel of doctors who conducted autopsy, so we have apprehensions. The joint director wanted to show Anurag's death as natural and argued with doctors at the KGMU mortuary. Senior administrative officials know about it but have not done anything,"" said Mayank.Kumar said he will write to Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU and AIIMS and get the examination done. ""If need be, I will also approach the Central Forensic Science Laboratory,"" he said."

He said the alleged multi-crore scam in Anna Bhagya programme of Karnataka government was probably the reason behind his alleged killing.Vijaykumar said he mentioned these facts in a letter written to the union cabinet secretary on Monday. The letter also had detailed information about the scam and similar attempts on him when he tried to blow the lid off scams involving senior IAS officers in Karnataka, he said.A former principal secretary-level officer, Vijaykumar was penalised with compulsory retirement for indiscipline just three days before his tenure was to end in April 2015.Timeline May 17: Anurag Tewari found dead under mysterious circumstances on the road near the State Guest House at Meera Bai Marg.May 18: SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar constituted a five-member SIT to probe into the case and submit its report within 72 hours after the opposition raised the issue during the assembly session.May 19: SIT collects video footage of a Hazratganj restaurant where Tiwari had his last meal.May 21: The SSP extended the time limit allotted to the SIT to file its report.May 22: The state government recommends the case to CBI after Tewaris family met CM Yogi Adityanath and lodged an FIR of murder against unknown persons with Hazratganj police station.May 23: The special investigation team (SIT) questioned Tiwaris batch mate Prabhu Narain Singh, who was staying with him at the State Guest House.While talking to HT over phone, he said he had approached Tewaris family and suggested that they demand proper preservation of the viscera, blood and other samples collected from the deceaseds body and send them to a reputed international forensic laboratory for detailed examination.Vijaykumar said he suspected that Tiwari was murdered by a drug that induces heart attack or leads to sudden increase of blood pressure. He said a similar attempt was made to eliminate him in December 2007, when he was found unconscious in his office as a result of his medicines being tampered with.He emphasised that the Indian forensic laboratories cannot unearth drug-induced murders, so the examination of samples must be done at some international lab. In the letter, the retired officer mentioned about the alleged scam in Anna Bhagya programme.Tewari, who was posted as the commissioner of food & civil supplies and consumer affairs department in Bengaluru, though reluctant initially after being confronted with some documents related to the anomalies, had informed his junior colleagues about the threat perception to him before he went for mid-career training in Mussoorie, he said.Vijaykumar said many were arguing that Tewari, having worked for less than 40 days in food & civil supplies department, could not have exposed any major scam. But for an IAS officer with integrity and courage, 30 days is more than enough to unearth major scams buried by his predecessors, he emphasised.He said he had shared this information with authentic documentary evidences with the chief secretary, DGP, some IAS and IPS officers of UP with a request to bring the content of the letter to the notice of Tewaris family members.To recall, 2007 batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer Anurag Tewari, a resident of UPs Bahraich district, was found dead under mysterious circumstances on his birthday (May 17) near the State Guest House at Meera Bai Marg in Hazratganj. Anurag and his batchmate Prabhu Narain Singh (posted as vice-chairman of Lucknow Development Authority) had come to Lucknow after attending a mid-career training programme at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie.Read more: IAS officer Anurag Tiwaris family says his honesty proved to be his nemesisBefore Anurags untimely death, they had been staying together in room number 19 of the State Guest House for three days. The Karnataka government launched its much-awaited ambitious Anna Bhagya programme in 2014 to supply 30 kg of rice at 1 per kg to nearly 10 million below poverty line (BPL) families across the state.The scheme cost 4,400 crore to the state exchequer annually.Talking about the alleged Anna Bhagya scam, Vijaykumar said huge money was being looted in rice procurement for the programme in food and civil supplies department using three methods.Firstly, the scamsters procure sub-standard rice and pay higher price to pocket huge commission. Secondly, they procure rotten rice at higher price and replace the good rice with rotten rice and sell the good rice to earn money illegally. Thirdly, the good rice is deliberately allowed to rot to procure funds to purchase fresh rice to get more commission, he explained.Vijaykumar said on August 21, 2014 he had written a letter to the Karnataka chief secretary with copies to other senior officers vested with the responsibility of preventing such scams. He said he had not been informed of any action taken on the complaint.Read more: UP govt recommends CBI probe into IAS officer Anurag Tiwaris mysterious death"

We even heard Tewari saying to some seniors over the phone that he will not let go of that file till he takes it to its logical end. We do not know with whom he was talking, but he was very furious.According to sources, Tewari was after the foodgrain purchase mafia.BJP MP and former minister Shobha Karandlaje, who has written letters twice to Adityanath, said soon after Tewari took charge as the commissioner, he started inquiring with the ground level officers on the quantity of rice and wheat that were purchased and transported to ration shops.He had sensed all was not well in the system and he knew about a scam in the foodgrain purchase. Shobha said, Tewari had prepared a report on the same and was about to submit it to CBI. But before he could do that, he was killed. I have learnt that his reports, the files that he kept for inquiry and CCTV footage of a godown have all been destroyed.A senior official from the department denied any scam. We purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India for `3 per kilo. Every month we spend around `145 crore for the same. The FCI is a Union government agency. We do not buy rice or wheat from the open market. Only in 2013, was there a shortage of rice.Then we purchased rice from the Chhattisgarh government. We have not purchased from any private agency. Where does the question of a scam or mafia come from? It is just a rumour that people and the media are spreading, he said.Tewaris brother Mayank Tewari met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday."

Tewari was a committed officer and had a good rapport with Gupta. He had not unearthed any scams as there are no scams at all, Gupta added.About the allegations that there was a scam in the purchase of rice for Anna Bhagya scheme from Chattisgarh, he said rice was purchased from Chattisgarh government in 2013-14 as per norms, after the approval of Karnataka Cabinet.After 2013-14, rice was not purchased from any state as Karnataka procured it from the Union government at a subsidized rate."

It is as much about eating as it is about fasting. Sehri (a pre-dawn meal) and iftar (an evening meal to break the fast) are the two meals every day during this holy month when Muslim families across India relish delicacies, some of which are especially made during Ramzan.The idea of the sehri meal is to eat food that is high in protein, is easily digestible and does not leave you thirsty for the rest of the day. Khajla (a kind of pancake) and pheni (a vermicelli dish) are integral to this meal in North India. Bakeries in Muslim localities make special breads during Ramzan, to be eaten with milk for sehri. Big bowls containing salan (non-veg curry) with pieces of chapatti mixed in it are part of the pre-dawn meal of Muslim families in Delhi and Lucknow.The iftar meal is the one to which believers look forward; preparing which women in the families spend their afternoons. Except dates which find a mention in Islamic history (it is believed that prophet Mohammad used to break his fast with dates) and are common in iftar meals across the world, rest of the delicacies eaten for sehri and iftar are influenced by a given region or states history, culture and cuisine (read the accompanying stories).Fruits and smoothies such as Baebri Boel (a popular drink in Kashmir) are consumed primarily for their nutritional value while snacks such asunnakaya (Kerala), haleem (Hyderabad) and bhajiya (Kolkata) reflect the Indian fondness for all things spicy.HYDERABAD: HALEEMHaleem is much in demand in Hyderabad in the month of Ramzan. (HT Photo.)The one festival that Hyderabadis across faiths wait for is Ramzan. This is the only time when they get an opportunity to relish their favourite local food item  Haleem.Haleem, made of meat, wheat, dry fruits and spices, is now incredibly popular because Hyderabad haleem, was given the Geographical Indication certification in August 2010.After fasting throughout the day, Muslim families look forward to having haleem for dinner.Hyderabadi haleem is made of meat  preferably that of goat or sheep and pounded wheat (not exactly atta) The two are then cooked together in pure ghee.The meat and wheat mixture along with spices are cooked in a bhatti (a cauldron made of iron and inserted in a kiln made of brick and mud) on a low flame, with cooks stirring the mixture continuously using wooden paddles or sticks for 10-12 hours.It is garnished with fried onion, coriander and slices of lemon. Occasionally, boiled eggs are also served with haleem.It is believed that haleem originated in Iran, but became popular in Hyderabad during the reign of the Asaf Jahis or Nizams in the 18th century. Since then, it has gained prominence in the Deccan.According to Ifteqar, a steward at a popular Irani restaurant at Mehdipatnam, haleem is not only tasty, but also highly nutritious. It has carbohydrates in the form of wheat, proteins in the form of meat besides spices, which are good sources of minerals and vitamins. At the same time, it is very soft on the stomach because of prolonged cooking, he said. For vegetarians, there is vegetarian Haleem. The ingredients and recipe remain the same minus meat.

(HT Photo.)Visit any corner of Kerala during the holy month of Ramzan and you will be struck by the mouth-watering aroma of spices, ghee and coconut oil that wafts through the air. Unnakaya  a sweet dish made of banana and grated coconut  is a part of Keralas iftar platter. Some prefer having the rich sweet as a dessert after the main course, which usually comprises biryani, a dish of rice and slow-cooked meat.Banana, the main ingredient in this delicacy, is a good source of vitamin C and potassium. It helps the body fight infectious agents; controls heart rate and blood pressure; and coconut is high in dietary fibre and improves digestion. Unnakaya is more popular in northern Kerala than other parts of the state.Depending on the availability of time and ingredients, some people prepare fresh Unnakaya minutes before sunset, the time at which Muslims break their fast. Those who cannot, especially office-goers, are often buy it from eateries.Recipe:Steam the banana in a pressure cooker with the peel. Remove the peel after steaming.Heat a pan. Add a little sugar to water and boil it. Add grated coconut and stir. Add cardamom, raisin and stir. Set aside.Grate the steamed banana. Once it becomes a paste, shape the paste into small balls. Smear your palm with coconut oil and stuff the coconut-sugar mix into the balls, wrapping banana paste around the filling. Keep wrapping and shapinfg until you are left with the shape of a spindle.Put oil in a pan and heat it. Fry the spindle-shaped banana fillings. Once it turns golden brown, its ready to be served.

""That is the reason it was decided to set up IRRI's centre in Varanasi,"" said the experts, adding that the institute has its headquarters at Manila, Phillipines.The IRRI is devoted to enhancing rice production through use of lesser water and introduction of drought and flood resistant varieties produced in China. ""India is the largest exporter of rice and the agenda now is to exceed production in China which does not have yield quality varieties like Basmati,"" said Singh.Both agriculture experts of Indian origin are working towards popularising rice in Africa and to introduce new varieties that can sustain odd weather.""Eastern India depends mostly on rains and has a very small irrigated area, so the region is most vulnerable to frequent floods and droughts and that is why IRRI has taken up the cause of introducing weather resistant varieties of rice in the region,"" said Gautam. He lamented that despite major effort and government intervention, not more than 50% agricultural land is irrigated while the remaining is rain-fed.Singh said that Central government has shown keen interest in improving the yield and has supported the IRRI project of setting up a research Centre in Varanasi. It has in principle been approved by the agriculture ministry too and a cabinet meeting will finally approve the opening of its centre. ""Though IRRI is a world organisation funded by the public and NGOs don't have any research centre anywhere in the world we are happy to start a research centre in Varanasi,"" he said"

There is enormous paper work that goes with it.Two goals are sought to be achieved: First, buying cattle for slaughter from cow markets, even for legal abattoirs, is now impossible; second, trade and transportation of cows for dairying, too, will become restricted, spelling doom for cow markets.Dairy cycle disruptedThe normal dairy economy assumes the life span of a milch cow to be 8-9 years, after which output tapers off and becomes uneconomical. The farmer thereafter sells his aged stock and uses the money to renew his livestock. In the normal cycle, the ageing stock goes to the abattoirs as meat for exports and skin for the leather industry. However, with a ban on slaughter in most states in place and abattoirs being forced to shut down, the dairy farmer is staring at a huge financial crisis: the resale value of cows has plummeted, and the farmers ability to renew and create a healthy stock is under serious strain; on the other hand, being forced to tend to uneconomical cattle has brought him to the brink of financial collapse.By the blanket ban on slaughter, the once prosperous dairy economy has been fractured. Besides putting thousands of butchers out of work, rearing of cows and bullocks has been on the decline. In Maharashtra, the average price of the milch cow has fallen to less than `50,000 a head compared to `65,000 two years ago. It has also led to abandoned herds of ageing cattle wandering about facing slow starvation and cruel death. With farmers increasingly turning to the buffalo, the recent government measures, far from preserving the cow, may in fact lead to its slow extinction.Exports hitBesides dairying, bovine meat and meat products are central to the countrys food chain and economy. India has the largest bovine  cattle and buffalo  population in the world, accounting for 200 million heads or 14 per cent of the worlds bovine stock. Nearly 80 million people consume beef in the country with domestic consumption touching two million tonnes.Though No 5 in the world in beef consumption, India became the highest exporter of beef (almost entirely buffalo meat) in FY15 trading 2.4 million tonnes (20 per cent of world exports), and dislodging Brazil for the top slot. Export earnings accounted for $4.8 billion in FY15, more than the country got from basmati rice exports! Beef exports dipped in FY16 on account of the lower global orders. Exports could decline further, if anti-beef campaign gains momentum. In Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of Indias exports, the closure of abattoirs and the general clampdown will have serious implications for export earnings and jobs.For the leather and fashion accessories industry, too, it is now going to be a grim future.Abhishek Waghmare, writing for IndiaSpend.org, estimates that the fall in global demand and short supply of hides, has led to the shutdown of 128 of Kanpurs 400 tanneries. Kanpur district is still a leading producer of leather and leather goods with a quarter or 268 of the countrys footwear factories and 40 per cent of Indias leather exports; but since 2014, leather exports have fallen 11 per cent.Dairying, beef production and exports, and leather and leather goods have been a rapidly growing segment of the farm and industrial economy. Unfortunately, vigilantism and regressive legislation is turning the clock back.(The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com)"

This year, the festival is being held on Thursday, 8 June. On Vat Purnima, women observe a day-long fast, tying thread around a banyan tree. Generally a three-day festival, some women extend their fast to all three days. As per the Hindu calendar, the Vat Savitri Vrat is observed on Jyestha Purnima or full moon of Jyestha month. Vat Savitri Purnima Vrat Puja 2017 muhurat begins at around 4:16 pm on June 8 and will continue till 6:39 pm on Friday, June 9. Vat Savitri Purnima was first referred in the epic Mahabharata in relation to Savitri Satyavan mythology.Go on to read more about the significance and importance of Vat Savitri Purnima or Vat Purnima (Wat Purnima) Vrat here.The festival Vat Savitri Purnima was first mentioned in the legend of Savitri and Satyavan in the Mahabharata. Rishi Markandeya first refers to the couple Savitri-Satyavan while narrating a story to Yudhistra, the eldest Pandava. Yudhistra had apparently asked the sage if any other woman is as devoted and dedicated to her husband as his wife Draupadi.The legend goes: Savitri, the beautiful daughter of the King of Madra Kingdom - Asvapati, sets out on a pilgrimage to find a husband for herself. She chooses Satyavan, the son of blind king Dyumatsena of Salwa Kingdom who's living in exile. She later comes to know that Satyavan will die after a year but nonetheless goes on to marry him. She assumes the life of a hermit and lives in the forest with her husband and in-laws.Three days before the predicted death of Satyavan, Savitri goes on a fast and performs severe austerities. On that day, Savitri accompanies her husband Satyavan, who's blissfully unaware of his impending death, to the forest. While chopping wood, something happens and he lies down, putting his head in his wife's lap. God of Death, Yama, comes to take away Satyavan's soul. Savitri follows Yama. Impressed by her dedication, wit and pure nature, he once again grants life to Satyavan.The fast that Savitri observed for three days later came to be known as Vat Savitri Purnima.On Vat Savitri Purnima, women worship Savitri as the goddess, offering nine kinds of fruits and flowers including rice grain, pulses, mangos, bananas, etc, as Bhoga. They also tie the sacred thread around the banyan tree."
593c71f57be9e00ed19a34eb,Opinion| Farmer protests:&thinsp;Rewrite the rules to stop this cycle of agrarian dist...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farmer-protests-rewrite-the-rules-to-stop-this-cycle-of-agrarian-distress/story-ahjhxzLpA2CtCSRTOjVUHM.html,2017-06-08,"The farm protests in Madhya Pradesh that left five people dead this week is symbolic of a wider agrarian distress engulfing India. Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5a0439229855b76bf13bcf9d,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."

(Source: Reuters) A shoe-maker poses for a picture in an underground workshop in Agra. (Source: Reuters)In the backstreets of Agras Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community.The election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred.Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry.Last month the Modi government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts  including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks.Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.Social TensionsMuch of Indias meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of Indias Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100.The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of Indias poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh governments move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industrys image.Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad.Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread, says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.Muqeems monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.Impossible TargetLike meat, Indias leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment.India is one of the worlds top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.Modi government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion  more than double todays level  by 2020 as part of a job creation push.But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production  a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.Companies say the governments leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow, Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.There were no comments on the same by the commerce ministry.In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.Sitting in his one-room shop in Agras leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.Modis election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits, he said in Lucknow, the state capital.Wider Industry HitIn the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpurs Small Tanners Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpurs leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent.Qureshi, from the butchers organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear, said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduisms social hierarchy once called untouchables are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month  down from 25,000  because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a months inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeems cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.He now earns 3,000 rupees  or $47  a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his fathers income supports three sisters and his mother.I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Zara did not respond to requests for comment.India is one of the worlds top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.Modis government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion  more than double todays level  by 2020 as part of a job creation push.But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production  a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.Indias environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.Companies say the governments leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow, Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment. Indias commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment.In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.Sitting in his one-room shop in Agras leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.Modis election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits, he said in Lucknow, the state capital.WIDER INDUSTRY HITIn the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpurs Small Tanners Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpurs leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear, said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduisms social hierarchy once called untouchables are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month  down from 25,000  because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a months inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeems cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.He now earns 3,000 rupees  or $47  a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his fathers income supports three sisters and his mother. I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Ashok Sinha The monsoon will take another three-four days to hit Bihar, the Met department said on Thursday. Earlier, the rains were expected to arrive in the state between June 12 and 14. The monsoon usually arrives in Bihar by June 10. Though rain lashed Patna early morning on Thursday for nearly 45 minutes from around 5.30am, there was no respite from the scorching sun and high humidity - that made the temperature seem higher than it actually was - throughout the day. ""It feels like a heat wave,"" said Santosh, who works at a electronic goods shop on New Dakbunglow Road. ""It seems we have to make some offering to God to please him so that it rains here."" Patna Met director Sumendu Sengupta said: ""Monsoon has been delayed in the state by three to four days. Now it is expected to hit Bihar after June 17. We were expecting monsoon to arrive in Bihar by June 13 as a very strong low-pressure area was witnessed in the Bay of Bengal. However, the warm westerlies changed the direction of the trough line of the monsoon."" A trough line is an imaginary line that generally extends from west to east. Weather-related activities like rainfall and thunderstorms are very common in and around the region a trough line passes through. Sengupta attributed the early-morning showers to localised factors and a cyclonic circulation prevailing over the state. ""In this season (pre-monsoon), local systems develop frequently. This was the reason behind today's short spell of rain in the state capital,"" he said. The monsoon has not yet covered the entire country as it still eludes Bihar and Jharkhand, he said. ""We can say that the system responsible for the onset of monsoon is lying on the Bihar border and it will take another couple of days to break in the state,"" he added. A forecast by private weather agency Skymet said: ""A cyclonic circulation is embedded on the trough over east Uttar Pradesh. Due to these systems, good rain is likely to occur over Bihar and the foothills of east Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile Gangetic Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha may also witness thundershower activities during the next 24 hours."" A Met official said a western disturbance was seen over Jammu and Kashmir. ""Its induced cyclonic circulation is over Punjab and adjoining areas. It will rain over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Showers today in some parts of Bihar can be attributed to this factor also,"" the official said. At other places in the country there was excess monsoon rain, the official said, including over north-eastern states such as Assam and Meghalaya.As per Skymet, during the past 24 hours, the country received 49 per cent surplus rain. While the south peninsula is surplus by 29 per cent, central India has seen 42 per cent more rain than usual. ""The timely onset of the south-west monsoon is crucial for sowing of kharif (summer) crops such as paddy, and a deficit in rainfall may hit rice output,"" said Gopal Sharma, a farmer in Rohtas district."
5a03a06a9855b76bf13b8944,"Column | Once again, Punjab Agricultural University is under the knife",http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/column-once-again-punjab-agricultural-university-is-under-the-knife/story-f2NaX3dhBa5YIAIu0efyqO.html,2017-06-17,"The concept of state agricultural universities was based on generating wholesome integrated knowledge, understanding and application of science in improving productivity and production of field crops, horticultural enterprises and livestock in respect of both quantity and quality. In Punjab, farming is quite diversified. Mixed farming incorporates field crops, fruits, vegetables and livestock.With an objective to providing integrated solutions to problems faced by the farm sector, agricultural universities were set up in every state on land grant pattern of US universities. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was the second such university after the one at Pantnagar in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962. PAU played a leading role in ushering in the Green Revolution, especially in Punjab, and contributed in making the nation food self-sufficient.The university carved its place among the countrys leading institutions and has been recognised at the international level for its research output, quality of education and contribution in the development of the farm sector. In recent years, it has developed less-seeded kinnow, improved Bt cotton variety, high-yielding short-duration varieties of rice and the first zincated variety of wheat.In 2006, PAU came under the political knife, and a veterinary and animal husbandry university (GADVASU) was carved out of it, maiming it by one-fourth. Ridiculously, even the fodder section was transferred to the new university on the plea that animals eat it. One wonders why then by the same argument wheat, rice, corn, vegetables and fruits production should have not been transferred to the medical university because humans eat these products! However, the financial position of the government permitting, there could have been no objection to setting up a new university separately, which could compete, supplement and complement the research at PAU. Yet, to take away its departments, and divide assets, infrastructure and budget hit the very vitals of this academic institution, negating the integrated concept of growth and development of the farm sector.ANOTHER SURGICAL STRIKE?Now, once again, it seems some person(s) with access extraordinary to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is/are planning another surgical strike on the PAU, mooting a proposal to carve a horticultural university out of this institution, which, if pursued, will render the PAU a non-entity. Research and education in horticulture crops will need most of the same department as for other field crops such as genetics, bio-chemistry, molecular biology, entomology, plant pathology, food technology, farm machinery, soil and water engineering, agricultural economics and marketing, agriculture business management, agricultural extension etc. How can these departments be divided without debilitating the agricultural institution beyond repair!Stretching the same logic, should there be an independent vegetable university, fruit university, cereal crops university and pulse crops varsity? Though PAU as a premier institute catering to agricultural research and education in the state has been ranked number two by the Union ministry of human resources and development, the university itself needs strengthening financially rather than weakening through bifurcation.BETTER, VIABLE OPTIONSFor impetus to horticulture in Punjab, there are better and viable options. The first is to strengthen the fruits and vegetables departments along with other related departments through additional funding and staff positions. A centre of excellence in horticulture crops can be created within the university, which would complement the research activities of the above departments by focussing on basic and strategic research in horticultural crops. No additional infrastructure will be required. For a fund- starved state this is a better option.Another option is to strengthen specialised horticultural research in production areas. There is a northern belt where kinnow and vegetables are grown and the second is the south-western belt where mainly kinnow is grown. In these regions, PAU has its research farms that can serve as specialised centres of research. These should be research centres focusing on seed and nursery production of fruits and vegetables. The state government may provide additional land and funds for this purpose to the PAU.Yet another and the most important viable option to strengthen horticulture research in the state is to expedite the setting up of the Postgraduate Institute of Horticultural Research and Education (PGIHRE) in Amritsar, which has been approved by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The setting up of PGIHRE was announced by the Union finance minister in 2015. The institute is to be funded by the Centre and only land is to be provided by the state government.For research, land at Attari (Amritsar) and Abohar have been marked. This institute requires 10 acres near Amritsar for an administrative complex and residences. PGIHRE has the provision of more than 200 scientific positions for horticultural research and education. Funds earmarked for the institute by ICAR are held up due to delay in land acquisition for building the campus near Amritsar.This is the best option for the cash-strapped Punjab government. Under this option, long-term financial sustainability of the institute is also ensured.The state government must not commit the blunder of acceding to vested interests to carve out a horticulture university out of one of the top-ranking agricultural universities of the country and weaken agricultural and horticultural research in the state.It is hoped that the powers that be are listening.(The writer is the chancellor of Central University, Bathinda, and a noted farm economist.

5a052bc69855b76bf13bff88,No proof required: Battle of the elites,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-congress-narendra-modi-nehru-dynasty-demonetisation-farmer-riots-no-proof-required-battle-of-the-elites-4707752/,2017-06-17,"The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Convicted for the dowry death of his wife, he has spent 18 years of his life in jail, 13 of which at Sampoornanand Shivir, an open-air prison in Uttarakhands Sitarganj.Set amid lush green fields, the jail was established in 1960 over an area of 5,965 acres.Sampoornanand, then chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh of which Uttarakhand was a part, promoted the concept.Balbir attributes the transformation in him to the unfettered life in the shivir, which is among the 28 unique open jails of India.General jails are cramped, there is no individual space and inmates there are mostly depressed. Here we are already part of the mainstream, he said.But all is not well at this unique jail. Its area has now shrunk to just 640 acres as a vast swath of its agricultural land was given away to the Sate Infrastructure and Industrial Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of inmates, referred to as shivir wasis, too dwindled from 500 in 2000 to 44 in 2017. We have urged the inspector general of jails to shift 50 prisoners from other jail to this camp so that the number of inmates is increased and we can have more hands for agricultural work, superintendent of the shivir TD Joshi said.The area of the jail has now shrunk to just 640 acres. (HT Photo)Giving some respite to those who are striving to protect the unique concept, the Uttarakhand high court, Nainital, recently ordered that not an inch of the land belonging to the shivir should be given to any agency for any work other than building of hospital or school.But inmates are not fully assured. Besides, there are many problems that still persist.There is no doctor on the campus. The 15- day home leave to inmates was withdrawn by the government five years ago.Inmates at the shivir live in huts on the fields and guard the crops at night. Sugarcane, wheat and rice are grown over around 200 acres of land by them.The inmates are categorised as pucca and kachcha shivir wasis. The pucca shivir wasis live in the fields as they are trustworthy. They can, however, move only within the fields of the jail and not beyond the open boundary. They are allowed to keep with them their families for a week in a month and are provided daily quota of rations. They have to cook their own food. The kachcha shivir wasis are considered less trustworthy and are kept in unlocked barracks."

It's just not milk or cooking oil, prized spices too are heavily adulterated, according to officials of National Institute of Nutrition ""Many times, papaya seeds are grounded and mixed with synthetic gum to make it seem like black-pepper.This happens as pepper is costly and mixing them with papaya seeds makes it cheaper for miscreants,"" Dr V Sudarshan Rao, a scientist from the Food Safety Division of NIN , told TOI.Following black pepper, the next most adulterated food item is fennel, which is mixed with sodium hydrosulphite. ""This is then blended with sawdust and brick dust and sold in the market as masala powder,"" said an official from Nutrition Society of India.Not just food meant for daily consumption, even cold drinks and ice-creams are mixed with high quantities of glycerol monostearate, an emulsifying agent, which is meant to be used in moderate amounts as prescribed by Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI).""People are not aware that in current times, everything we eat could be adulterated. Earlier, the practice was limited to mixing rice with stones to fudge weight. Now, it has become modern with miscreants using chemicals. Even mustard oil is sold by mixing it with a low-grade oil.

Till punishment is harsh, you cannot expect to have safe food,"" he said.TIMES VIEW:While its a welcome move that cops have finally launched a sustained crackdown against adulteration of spices and other food items in the city, efforts must be made to ensure that these traders do not get back to their old practice. Authorities should also ensure that these offenders get strict punishment and are not allowed to get away with minor penalties for playing with lives of people on a daily basis."

(Source: Indian Express) The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and affects children. (Source: Indian Express)The first case of Japanese Encephalitis in the city this year, detected in a ten-month-old baby, has put the health department on high alert. This is the second such case in the state. The infant, who hails from Kondhwa, is in a stable condition and has been admitted to a private hospital in the area, said Dr Kalpana Baliwant, in-charge of the Insect Control Cell at the Pune Municipal Corporation.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that the serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and primarily affects children.However, Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, These are sporadic cases and our surveillance network has been able to pick up the cases. The first one was from Raigad district and the second case this year is from Pune.The virus that causes JE is transmitted by the culex species of mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields as well as in water-logged areas of urban regions. The disease has assumed epidemic proportions in pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal, with sporadic cases reported from Maharashtra.According to Awate, the problem-prone areas in Maharashtra are Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia. Last year, 12 cases of JE, and one death due to the disease, were reported from the state; two of the cases were from Pune.As many as 100 houses around the society at Kondhwa have been surveyed for the culex mosquito, said Baliwant. We conducted the container surveillance for the last four days and have not been able to find the mosquito. The parents had taken the baby to Mumbai 10 days ago, and its likely that the infection was picked up from there, she said.Awate said field officers from the state entomology section had carried out their own survey. We are waiting for the report but in all probability, it is a sporadic case. Most JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms. However, one in 250 infections result in severe clinical illness, according to the World Health Organisation. JE is a serious virus infection resulting in the inflammation of the brain. The disease is characterised by the onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, coma, seizures and spastic paralysis, he said.This year, 111 JE virus cases and 20 deaths have been reported from across the country. A majority of the cases are from UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. Last year, there were 1,676 cases and 283 deaths in the country, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.Meanwhile, PMC officials have urged local residents to take preventive measures and ensure there are no mosquito breeding sites nearby. While carrying out the container survey PMC officials found the dengue causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito breeding site at a swimming pool in the same society.

It was then that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury came up with a plan  get the signatures of the leaders of 17 parties on Kumars nomination papers at the meeting venue itself before venturing out of the room after the press conference.Shemin Joy, New DelhiSharmishtas strikesPresident Pranab Mukherjees daughter Sharmishta Mukherjee has not minced words in criticising West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her governments mishandling of the Darjeeling agitation. Blaming her for triggering a huge crisis during peak tourist season in the hills, she reminded the chief minister that the language issue had to be handled carefully. In a newspaper article, Sharmishta recalled several instances when row over languages even led to creation of a new country, like Bangladesh, and trouble over Hindi left a divide in the south in the 1950s and 1960s.Sharmishtas piece has come as a surprise to many. Only two months ago, Mamata was not averse to backing her as a Rajya Sabha candidate from the state if the Congress nominated her. Considering that West Bengal CM has had close ties with her father, Sharmishtas criticism of Didi has set tongues wagging. So far, Sharmishta had confined herself to Delhi politics. But is she considering her home state of Bengal for future course of action?SI, New DelhiRice blackmailWith rumours of plastic rice spreading on the social media, the owner of a hotel in Chennai claimed that a few persons, supposedly from the media, threatened to spoil the image of his restaurant if he did not take care of them. Two persons argued with Kumar, the restaurant owner, and said that the food they had bought from his restaurant was of bad quality. The hotelier apologised and returned the money. However, the duo returned that evening with two others, who claimed that they were from the media. They said that the rice used by the hotel was plastic rice.Though Kumar reasoned with them that even the government had clarified that there was no plastic rice, one of the mediaperson started bargaining. He demanded money from me and threatened that if I fail to offer, he would publish a news against my hotel, Kumar said. It was only when Kumar said he would lodge a complaint with the police, that the four left the place.R Sathyanarayana, ChennaiSenas recordVeteran Congressman Narayan Ranes son Nitesh Rane, had taken a dig at the Shiv Sena by writing to the Guinness World Records to feature a place in the record books for the most repeated threats to withdraw from a government. In the letter, Rane Jr, an MLA from Kankavli in Konkan, said: We would like to register a record on his (Uddhav Thackerays) behalf for announcing a number of times that his party Shiv Sena would withdraw support to Maharashtra government.The Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray is an ally of the BJP in the Devendra Fadnavis government. The two parties have been in an alliance for close to 25 years, but there has been a blow hot-blow cold kind of a relationship between them.Mrityunjay Bose, Mumbai"

DH photoThe state BJP will launch Vistarak (expansion) programme from July 1 wherein party workers will spend 15 days at places assigned to them and work towards strengthening the party base.A meeting to finalise the modalities of the programme was held at the BJP headquarters in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Speaking on the occasion, BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa said that as many as 20,000 workers will participate in the programme and all the 54,431 electoral booths in the state will be covered.The booth reach-out initiative is said to have been one of the factors that helped the BJP win the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.The workers will visit places they have been assigned and stay there for 15 days. They will interact with voters, create awareness about the programmes of the NDA government, expose the misdeeds of the state government and visit local leaders, Yeddyurappa said.Yeddyurappa accused the state government of claiming credit for programmes initiated by the Centre. The state government was providing rice to the poor under the Anna Bhagya scheme utilising the grains provided by the Centre. He said the Centre was procuring rice from the open market at Rs 32 per kg and providing it to states at Rs 3. However, the state government took full credit for the Anna Bhagya scheme without even mentioning the subsidy provided by the Centre.MP and former state BJP president Pralhad Joshi charged the state government with not cooperating with the Centre in implementing the Ujjwala Yojana, of providing free LPG connections to the poor."
5a0b40f79855b76bf13cd781,Why Indian farmers are distressed?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/info-nomics/why-indian-farmers-are-distressed/,2017-07-07,"On the eve of Uttar Pradesh (UP) election, Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi promised if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins then farm loan will be waived. BJP won, and the farm loan was waived-off. Sensing a case of political opportunism other states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka  joined the farm loan waiver bandwagon. Farmers usually take loan to grow crops and to buy farm equipment. However, waiving off farm loan does not makes sense economically. The cause of farm distress lies somewhere else. We find reasons for a farmer not realizing the market price has to do with inefficient supply chain management, with farm distress getting augmented because of lower farm size holding and lack of irrigation facilities.Between 2012 and 2015 over 10,000 farmers committed suicide. Globally, India has second largest amount of arable land (next only to USA) but less than 35 per cent of this land comes under irrigation. Fluctuation in Indias agricultural output is due to supply-side shocks resulting from inadequate rainfall. Investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification, rain water harvesting, and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures. Additionally, other factors such as lack of reforms to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power resulting from small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities are also important.If various state governments can addresses these issues it will be beneficial for the farmers than waiving-off farm loan.In India, not only percapita agricultural income is low, and but at times it is not possible to sustain this low income. Also, agricultural output fluctuates more than the outputs of the industrial and services sectors. Official output data shows that during the period between 1991-1992 and 2013-2014, the coefficient of variation for agricultural output is 191.34, in comparison to 50.48 for industry, and 22.03 for services sector. This has led to unequal income distribution in India with rural-urban wage gap at 45 per cent in comparison to around 10 per cent for China and Indonesia. Some 850 million people still live in rural India. India has around 260 million people living in poverty and 80 per cent of them live in the countryside. Increasing and sustaining farm income is important if India wants to reduce poverty.Majority of farming(65 per cent) is rain-dependent. Volatile rainfall patterns lead to lower farm income. The median annual wage for a farmer in India is around US $290 which is barely two months minimum wage in Mumbai  the commercial capital of India. Because of lack of proper irrigation facilities, and weather insurance schemes, farmers typically get stuck to growing low-value crops such as rice and wheat, although there is an ever increasing demand for high-value stuffs such as fruits, and vegetables.Inefficient supply chain management equally contributes to farm distress.In India, if farmers are to sell their produce, they have two options. First is to sell directly to the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in government outlets such as Food Corporation of India (FCI). MSP is the minimum price for a product established by the government and supported by payments to producers in the event of the market price falling below the specified minimum. The second option is to take their produce to the nearby government-designated mandi (market)where in front of state officers they can auction produce to the brokers. Mandis are the markets in smaller towns and cities to which farmers from nearby villages bring their agricultural produce to sell. There are around 7700 government designated mandis spread across India.Typically, MSP is higher than the market price, and one would assume that farmers gain every time the government announces the MSP. However, farmers are seldom able to sell their produce at the MSP. Every village does not have government outlets. FCI has a minimum presence in other major rice and wheat producing states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa. Compared to all-India average of 7340 farmers suicide committed between 1995 and 2010, only West Bengal has higher suicides numbering 19331 between 1995 and 2010. The corresponding figures for Assam, Bihar, and Orissa are 3566, 1235, and 4460, respectively. And, even if there is a FCI outlet, the government may not procure if the farmers bring their produce before/after the dates of procurement. The farmers are at whim of local traders and are forced to sell their produce in the informal market.In India, as much as 83 per cent of the farmers are smallholders, with less than 1 hectare of landholding. These marginal farmers do not have access to cold storage, and have no option but to sell their produce to the middlemen or traders. It is impossible for them to get a space in the state storage facilities without any political connection, and also because the smaller farmers do not have wherewithal to book crate in warehouses. Lack of reforms in the APMC Act prevents these small farmers to sell directly to supermarkets, exporters, and agro-processors. This prevent contract farming which otherwise can entail better price realization for these farmers.Rather than waiving-off farm loans there is a need to rise above party-politics and ensure reforms in the APMC Act. According to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report move to waive-off farm loan is likely to cost various state exchequers a whopping $40 billion (around 2% of Indias GDP).Timely procurement through MSP and training for increasing agricultural productivity will also help. Indias neighbor China produces more wheat and rice in spite of having lesser area of land cultivated in comparison to India. Finally, instead of spending on blanket subsidies (favoring the big farmers), investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification,rain water harvesting and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures."
5a0662fd9855b76bf13c5f47,MGNREGA wages less than minimum farm wages in 15 states: Panel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mgnrega-wages-less-than-minimum-farm-wages-in-15-states-panel-4743412/,2017-07-09,"Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image) Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image)THE COMMITTEE for revision of wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarentee Act (MGNREGA) has found that minimum agricultural wages are higher than MGNREGA wages in 15 states. An upward revision in MGNREGA wages is estimated to require a Rs 4,500 crore increase in its budget.Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month.As per data being examined by the committee, the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers are significantly higher than MGNREGA wages in Karnataka, Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The other states where MGNREGA wages fail to match up are Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the minimum wages are marginally higher than MGNREGA wages.In the 15 states where MGNREGA wages are lower, we tried revising it to bring it on par with the minimum agricultural wages paid by the respective states. Where MGNREGA wages are on par or higher, we decided to protect it as it is. If a revision is done as per this formula, it is estimated that a Rs 4,500 crore addition to the existing MGNREGA budget would be needed, said an official from the Ministry of Rural Development.The Indian Express had earlier reported that despite official claims of this years MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore being the highest ever, the wage revision, at 2.7 per cent, was the lowest ever. It meant a per day, per person wage hike of merely Re 1 in some states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Rs 2-Rs 3 in several others.This was because the finance ministry, on account of financial implications, rejected the recommendations of the S Mahendra Dev committee, which had proposed to bring MGNREGA wages on par with minimum wages paid to unskilled agricultural workers in the states. The expert panel had said that the Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the current consumption pattern of rural households, should be the basis for revising MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL), which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983.The basket of goods for calculating CPI-AL comprises mainly food items. With the implementation of the National Food Security Act, rice and wheat is available for as cheap as Rs 2-3 per kg. CPI(Rural) gives lower weightage to food items, and hence, is found to be a better indicator of wage increase, said a ministry official.The Nagesh Singh panel has found that based on the second recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, if the existing MGNREGA wages are revised as per CPI(Rural), it would mean another Rs 600 crore increase in the budget.CPI(R) should be used to revise the wages every year instead of CPI(AL), as the former is more representative of the current rural consumption basket. Also, wage revision should take place every six months, in keeping with the practice for other trades and occupation, said Ankita Aggarwal from the peoples organisation, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha. Aggarwal said that with such low wages and delays in payments, MGNREGA fails to provide the livelihood security for which it was enacted.Jharkhand Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma had recently written a strongly-worded letter to the Ministry of Rural Development protesting against the growing divergence between the states minimum wage, which is currently Rs 224 per day, and MGNREGA wages of just Rs 168 per day after the wage hike.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The entire forest which was segmented according to its resources, used to be leased out to contract for harvesting hone, medicinal herbs and wood among others for an annual revenue of Rs 30 crore.Everyone was dependent on the forest. Contractors for their money, administration for the revenue and locals for their day to day needs, said Mohammad Zagir, a local environmentalist.Very few people cropped paddy in their fields, they used to buy rice and wheat from the money earned from selling wild fruits or their salary from the forest contractor they used to work for, he said.All that changed after June 2014.The forest guards stopped villagers from entering inside the forest. We were going into the forest to collect grass for our cattle when the guards stopped, said Dinesh Verma 38, a farmer of Pipariya village, who was arrested for trespassing, something uncommon for villagers.Since then, conservator of forests VK Singh said 109 villagers have been arrested (mostly in the first year) for trespassing and it was important to deter them from entering the forest.There has been no poaching between 2014 and 2017. A burgeoning big cat population  up from 28 to 54  also meant that tigers have started moving out of the core areas.Despite the danger of lethal attacks, many of the villagers sneak into the reserve to collect forest produce for sale. And they are now up in arms against the national animal.Because of the shape of the reserve, the animal passes through human habitation while moving from one part of the forest to other. This has led to several attacks, Singh said, adding that three deaths reported early this year happened between two sections of the forest having high human habitation in between.The reserves 670km boundary is interspersed with farms mostly in the regions of high tiger kill and is fragmented by three national highways, two state highways, 47 district roads and over 20 smaller roads. In many places, the buffer between farms and reserve is as thin as 10 metres and poor farmers like Nankhi Devi, who was allegedly killed by a tiger on July 1, cannot afford a fence for their minuscule land holdings.Neither can the forest department.The cost (Rs 26 crore for 670km) is almost 80 times of our annual revenue. We do get some funds from the government but it is not enough. We do not have enough money for it, divisional forest officer of the reserve Kailash Prakash said.The locals find forest department suggestions like not entering the forest and making loud noises while working in fields weird.They tell us to visit our farms in groups, not go near the forest, make loud noises while working and this and that...why dont they control their animals. If they cant do it we will make arrangements for these tigers. We know how to protect ourselves, said Pankaj Kumar, 22, whose father was killed by a tiger while working in his farm on June 20.Experts say unless the green corridor connecting Pilibhit reserve with Surai national park of Uttarakhand and Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary of Uttar Pradesh is improved for easy passage of excess tigers, the conflict will continue."

A cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the IRRI regional centre in Varanasi aimed at boosting paddy production in eastern India, parts of Asia and Africa.Varanasi is parliamentary constituency of Narendra Modi and is also located in the eastern UP .Speaking to TOI, IRRI consultant Mukesh Gautam that Union government had approved the regional centre and most probably the prime minister would inaugurate it soon. Gautam added that the IRRI will help introduce new varieties of rice, increase production and encourage rice cultivation in countries like Africa where it is not produced.The IRRI consultant explained there are some states in the eastern parts, including eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa which failed to benefit from the Green Revolution as these parts had no irrigation facilities like in Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. The productivity of paddy in the eastern part is low compared to northern and central regions and the IRRI regional centre would introduce flood and drought resistant varieties for them. IRRI would assist the farmers overcome weather challenges, said Gautam.This is another major international intervention in Uttar Pradesh in the Yogi government as earlier during the visit of the prime minister to Israel, UP Jal Nigam had signed an MOU for checking pollution in rivers and water management in the state."

A higher crop output is anticipated following increased sowing of rice and pulses when compared with the last season.The latest Union Agriculture department data showed that across the country, kharif crops have been planted on 563.17 lakh hectares till now, as against 521.80 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year.Increase in acreageWith the sowing of crops apace during the past few days across the country, paddy (rice) has been sown in 125.77 lakh hectares in the current season till July 14, which is marginally higher than the 120.32 lakh hectares recorded in the 2016-17 season. The acreage under pulses has been recorded at 74.61 lakh hectares till now, as against the 60.28 lakh hectares of the corresponding period for the last season.The sowing of coarse cereals is up as well, at 113.06 lakh hectares against the 98.79 lakh hectares of last year. But the total oilseeds sown has come down to 103.92 lakh hectares, when compared with 115.75 lakh hectares of last year.Cotton acreage is up this season at 90.88 lakh hectares, against 73.93 lakh hectares last year in the corresponding period. Sugarcane, too, continues to see an increase in acreage and has been planted in 47.94 lakh hectares against the 45.22 lakh hectares last year. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), conditions are favourable for further advancement of the monsoon and overall rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over the next two weeks, from July 13 to July 26.Conditions favourableSowing of kharif crops has gained momentum during the past few days as the monsoon is progressing well. Paddy transplanting, though, has been a bit sluggish in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but it is likely to pick up in the coming days. Sowing of pulses is apace in the key growing states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, which is an encouraging sign, Anand Sharma, regional co-ordinator of the IMDs agricultural meteorology told, The Hindu .Apart from western parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the monsoon rains have covered most parts of the country, he added. The monsoon rain delivers about 70% of Indias annual rainfall and is critical for millions of farmers as nearly half the countrys farmland lacks irrigation and is dependent on rain."

Seeding of Aadhaar cards of all family members with the ration card was meant to enable any member collect rations by getting his/her fingerprints read. Beena and Munna, working for the Sarva Janara Prarthanalaya, which describes itself as a gypsy charitable trust, said almost 150 families in the colony have been affected due to an erratic public distribution system.""Only 50-odd families of the 208 are successfully receiving rations. It's not as if they don't know the procedure for seeding, yet they are suffering. Aadhaar has made their lives difficult by excluding them from the benefits of PDS,"" said Beena.Maligehu, 56, said she hasn't been getting her monthly allocation of rice for five months now; her four-member family is entitled to 20 kg of rice. ""The person at the ration shop told me that my card has been cancelled. I went to the nearest BangaloreOne centre and the food and civil supplies office in Rajajinagar, but in vain. I haven't eaten properly in months. Sometimes, we rely on our neighbours and don't know where the next meal will come from,"" she said.Residents of the colony say life was much better earlier, when all they had to do was show their ration cards to get supplies. Before Aadhaar seeding, Vajara, 28, and her husband Ramakrishna, 37, used to get 20kg rice per month, five each for the couple and their two kids. But for the last few months, the PoS machine at the fair price depot has been unable to read her and her husband's fingerprints. Result: they have been losing out on half the allocated amount of rice.Some residents also claimed that not collecting ration for even a month resulted in cards being declared 'dead'. Most residents of the colony travel as far as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra to sell their wares. Reetha, a doll-maker, travels frequently for work and is away for several days at a stretch. In her absence, her friend would take her daughter Archana to the fair price shop to collect rations for the family. However, six months ago, Reetha's family, which couldn't collect rations for a couple of months, was told that their card is no longer valid. Rajendra Bai , another resident entitled to 20 kg rice, too hasn't been receiving anything from the shop. She was told her card has been cancelled.""We have to buy rice from other provision stores for Rs 30-40 per kg. The average income of most families in the Hakki Pikki Colony is Rs 3,000-5,000 per month. How can we buy overpriced rice when we can barely sustain ourselves with what we earn,"" asked Rajendra Bai. Also, in some cases, only the ration card-holder's fingerprint is considered valid. Ration shops too are open only for a few days a month when supplies come. If residents miss that window, they are helpless till the next month, said Bai. And then there are some like 32-year-old Chandra who, despite raising a request for Aadhaar seeding, hasn't received the activation message from the food office.""If rice is not meant for the poor, then where is it going? The owners must be hoarding and selling them for higher rates,"" said Sumalatha, another resident."

The deities, Sri Kalabhairava, Sri Amma and Naga, were worshipped at the shrine. The rituals were being conducted by a family belonging to the Jogi community (Natha sect) since centuries.He said that though there was a historical relation of this shrine with the nearby temple, the conduct of rituals at the shrine was the exclusive preserve of the Jogi community. There is a connection between the shrine and the Halavari Mutt (affiliated to Gorakhpur Moola Mutt) located at Yeddamogge, about seven kilometres from the shrine. Till recently, the shrine used to receive 10 murras of rice from the Halavari Mutt.At present, Basava Jogi and his son, Raghavendra Jogi, are looking after the shrine. Since Basava Jogi was old, Raghavendra Jogi takes care of the shrine. A few years ago, the latter began taking devotees who came to the village to the shrine. This was the source of livelihood for the family, he said.But as the shrine started attracting more devotees and adventure tourists, the temple authorities installed a hundi (money box) for temple renovation, he said and added that the family did not object to it. But recently, the temple authorities went a step ahead and appointed salaried workers to guide the devotees to the shrine. This affected the earnings of the family.When the family questioned the temple authorities and tried to resolve the matter amicably, they were ignored. We approached government officers and Gopal Poojary, Byndoor MLA, but they washed their hands off the issue. We want our rights to be preserved. The hundi and temple guides should be removed, he said.The samiti would hold a Guppi Guhalaya Chalo at Kamalashile on Saturday. If the matter is still not resolved, we will intensify the agitation and even approach Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Mr. Koteshwar said."
5a0f05789855b76bf13d53f0,Refashioning development,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/625260/refashioning-development.html,2017-07-28,"R Balasubramaniam, Jul 29 2017, 0:53 ISTA few months ago, the Chhattisgarh government made an announcement that it will now provide 35 kg rice at the doorstep of each tribal family. A thousand kms away, the Karnataka government was grappling with solving the issue of land that the tribals from Diddadahalli had occupied and were claiming as their rightful due.Around the same time, we had Prime Minister Narendra Modi announce just after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections that he would like to see a new India arise where the poor and marginalised had access to opportunities and not mere government doles.While each of these give conflicting signals, one is sad that despite 70 years of independence, the country is still grappling with how to strategise and undertake development of indigenous tribals who constitute a little more than 8% of the nations population.Article 366 (25) of the Constitution refers to Scheduled Tribes (STs) as those communities which are scheduled in accordance with Article 342 of the Constitution. The STs are mainly the indigenous population that the Government of India identifies as socially and economically backward and in need of special protection from social injustice and exploitation.The tribals are identified by the government based on a communitys primitive traits, distinctive culture, shyness with the public at large, geographical isolation and social and economic backwardness.Tribal communities live in about 15% of the countrys areas in various ecological and geo-climatic conditions ranging from plains to forests, hills and inaccessible areas. There are 705 ethnic groups notified as Scheduled Tribes in India who live across 30 states and Union Territories. Tribal groups are at different stages of social, economic and educational development.While some tribal communities have adopted a mainstream way of life at one end of the spectrum, there are 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) at the other who are characterised by a pre-agriculture level of technology, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy and a subsistence level of economy.The central government created the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the year 1999 to give focused attention to the social and economic development of these indigenous communities and has planned to spend close to Rs 5,300 crore in the current fiscal year on tribal development.While millions of rupees are being spent by the government, the non-government organisations and the corporates under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes across the country, one finds it difficult to explain why the development of the se indigenous communities has not been to the levels expected.To understand this, we need to appreciate that programmes are currently designed by non-tribal people who seem to be deciding on what tribal development should be. It is unfortunate that many of these experts and bureaucrats are designing and delivering programmes that many a time seems to be disconnected from the ground realities.Across India today, the tribals are at the crossroads and are neither able to move away from their dependence on traditional economies nor are they able to integrate with the demands of the market. They are wrestling with change  both at the individual and at the community level and are neither able to let go off the past nor are they able to embrace the present.Programmes that are thrust on them are forcing them to accept lifestyles that are unsustainable socially, economically and culturally. Caught between the devil and the deep sea, they are left vulnerable to the forces that continue to exploit them and are living a life of merely coping with the poverty that surrounds them.To make matters worse, most tribal areas are also rich in natural resources and they suffer the collateral damage created by large irrigation projects and extractive industries.Interventions to develop the indigenous communities needs to begin with an understanding of the tribals themselves. One needs to appreciate that these are communities who have traditionally lived in communes under the leadership of chieftains and have operated in the traditional economy.Moving from a hunter-gatherer situation to a mixed economy is culturally jarring and can have shocking consequences if not handled sensitively.The states planning and executing machinery has little time, patience or competence to understand the dynamics and power structures in the tribal areas and little appreciation of attitudinal and behavioural dimensions.Shoddy implementationThis results in shoddy implementation of schemes and does not provide enough space for meaningful participation of the people. What is further disturbing is that all these schemes are not dynamic or responsive, and seem to be urban solutions to tribal problems.Precious little consideration is given to the skills, knowledge and practices that could help in addressing tribal issues through grassroots perspectives. Seven decades of rapid acculturation and shoddy integration into the mainstream culture has left these communities in confusion.Forest conservation laws that they can neither understand nor find relevance in, has left them at a crossroad with neither a coping mechanism nor an alternate lifestyle.Economic and social demands of mainstream culture and life is forcing them to abandon their traditional methods which kept things simple and sustainable and adopt more expensive, government and NGO-driven coping strategies which are neither culturally appropriate nor contextually relevant.These indigenous tribals can neither go back to the past nor have they successfully integrated with the present. The skills that they traditionally had no longer meet the demands of modern existence. All that exists is an insensitive and patronising system that talks of their development bereft of the dignity that they deserve.(The writer, founder of Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, has lived and worked with indigenous tribal communities for more than three decades)"

But weighed down by three successive years of drought and mounting debts, he found it impossible to put the money aside for the wedding.So, when a brick kiln unit offered to lease an acre of his land for three years, the farmer thought he had struck gold. When he was offered three times more than what he earned from his crops, he immediately gave his nod to the proposal.The farmer at Kodiyaganj Village in West Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh district was the first in his village to lease out fertile land to a brick kiln owner for Rs 45,000 a year.Today he regrets the day he said yes. For what he didn't know was after the unit had dug out four feet of the top soil, the land was no longer as fertile as it used to be.""The land I got back was less fertile. I tried to grow some crops but they were of poor quality and the yield was also low,"" Ghayasuddin said.With a construction boom across India, brick-making is a lucrative business in Uttar Pradesh villages, with hundreds of furnaces baking millions of bricks day and night.The story of Ghayasuddin turns the spotlight on many such hamlets in the region. Over 250 farmers in six villages Kodiyaganj, Sikanderpur, Akrabad, Sakra, Gabhana, Dadaun and Pilakhana - in Aligarh have leased out about 200 acres of land to around 100 brick kiln units in the last four years.Some farmers said they were forced to do it because the prolonged drought had pushed them to the brink of starvation.""The proposal by the brick kiln industries came when we were in desperate need of money. We were making Rs 12,000 per acre by growing crops and for the same acre we were paid Rs 45,000-60,000,"" said Imran Khan, a farmer from Sikandrabad who grew rice and wheat alternately on his field.A few farmers said they were forced to lease out their land when their surrounding fields were dug out, leaving their field at a higher level, which led to their soil being washed off to the neighbouring, quarried fields.Those who still held on found it increasingly difficult to irrigate their elevated land.Ramesh Singh, a resident of Pilakhana village, said he was against leasing out his land to brick kiln units but had to yield to them when his crops started dying because water couldn't reach his raised land.""On all three sides, there was quarried land, which made it impossible for water to reach my field. I know the degradation the quarrying will cause to my land, but I am helpless as my crops are dying either way,"" Singh said.Singh leased out four acres of land to Kamal Udyog for three years for Rs 50,000 per acre per year.The owner of the industry, Kamal Agarwal, however, stressed he was helping farmers of the area.""Without our industries, farmers would have starved. We are paying them nearly three times of what they would have got by selling their crops. Moreover, each brick kiln industry gives employment to at least 50 labourers,"" Agarwal said.The brick kiln industries operating in these six villages manufacture around 70-80 lakh bricks per month, he said.Smoke emissions from brick kilns contribute 9 per cent of the total emissions in India, studies say.""There is a huge environmental cost involved - from smoke emission and local air pollution to the loss of valuable topsoil,"" said Khurram Ahmed, a social activist.India, the second largest producer of bricks in the world after China, manufactures nearly 200 billion bricks a year, a 2015 CSE report said.About 70 per cent of these bricks are produced in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which have one of the world's most fertile alluvial plains, Punjab State Council for Science and Technology said in a 2009 report.""Brick fields are mostly situated on riverine fertile agricultural land as they need clayish, silty, loamy, clay loam or silt loam soil with good texture,"" Ahmed added.After the brick kiln industries have excavated the top soil, farmers are forced to grow either rice or millet, crops that require more water. Because of water-logging in their fields, they find it difficult to grow vegetables and other crops such as wheat and corn on their once fertile land.""Water logging in the quarried land is a common problem.farmers are forced to grow crops that require excess water. In some cases, water logging makes it impossible for them to grow any other kind of crop,"" Ahmed said.Building construction in India is estimated to grow at a rate of 6.6 per cent per year between 2005 and 2030 providing a steady demand for bricks. The brick making industry is utilising 2.5 crore tonnes of coal and other biomass fuels per year, government reports have said.Brick kiln industries consumed 25,20,000 cubic metres soil during 1995-2010, said a 2015 report in the International Journal of Innovative Research Development. The industry has been closed in many big cities of India for polluting the environment but has started mushrooming in the countryside.Although the government is encouraging the use of ecofriendly fly ash bricks, it will be a while before red bricks are replaced because of lack of awareness about the harmful effects of brick kiln units on the environment, he said.""The construction boom is feeding the brick kiln industries across the country but the cost being paid is too high. Shrinking of agriculture land is pushing us towards a dooming agrarian crisis and there is a dire need to switch to more environment-friendly options,"" Ahmed said."

Express BJP president Amit Shah, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and others have lunch at Sonu Yadavs home, in Lucknow on Sunday. ExpressA day after he asked his party workers to induct Yadav and Jatav voters into the party to increase its community base, BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday had lunch at the residence of Sonu Yadav, party chief of Badi Jugauli polling booth, an area in Lucknow Central dominated by Yadavs. While in the past Shah had dined with Dalits during his tours to different states, this was the first time that his host was a Yadav OBC worker.State Law Minister Brijesh Pathak, who is the local MLA, however, denied any political angle in the decision to dine with a Yadav family. He (Sonu Yadav) is a dedicated party worker associated with the BJP for a long time. The party national president has said that people from all communities are welcome in the BJP.On Sunday afternoon, Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who also joined him for lunch at Yadavs home, drove through the narrow lanes of Badi Jugauli area to reach Yadavs double-storey and well-furnished house. Just opposite Sonu Yadavs house was a plaque stating that the road that Shah and Adityanath took was developed by Samajwadi Party chief and former CM Akhilesh Yadav.Inside the house, preparations were still on to welcome the guests, which also included deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, party national vice-president Om Prakash Mathur, national general secretaries Arun Singh and Anil Jain and joint general secretary (organisation) Shiv Prakash.Sonu Yadav, 33, said he got word of the leaders plans only on Sunday morning. Another party office bearer, however, said he was informed Saturday night. Either way, the whole Yadav family was engaged in preparations, so much so that a source said they couldnt dine with the dignitaries themselves.My mother and wife cooked dal, sabji, raita, roti and rice for the guests, Yadav said. Chhach was also served.Sitting on the ground, Yadav served food in wooden disposal plates and kulhad to the guests.Shah also spoke to Yadav about his family, met them and even obliged with requests for a photograph. The dignitaries stayed there for nearly 40 minutes.Yadav said that he has been with the BJP for 14 years. He said that there are around 1,250 voters in Badi Jugauli polling booth and nearly 800 of them are Yadavs.The Yadav community is considered a strong vote base of the Samajwadi Party, which has been reduced to just 47 seats in the 403 seat-strong Assembly.Now when the SP is weak, this is the ideal time to attract Yadav voters and convince them that the BJP is the party for every section of the society, said a BJP leader.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

I graduated from the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Nagpur, in 2000 and then a six-month training with Le Meridien, Pune, sealed my entry into the industry.Later, I moved to Mumbai where I worked in two different places for around four years before moving to Dubai, where I worked in an Indian restaurant for another two years. I went back to Hyderabad. But soon I moved to Singapore, and 18 months later flew to Dammam, Saudi Arabia, where I cooked Italian, Chinese, Indian, and of course, Lebanese dishes. And now I have been with Le Royal Meridien, Chennai for the last three months.Though I have been to so many places and cooked a variety of cuisines, my speciality is definitely Indian cuisine. I have always loved Indian food. Firstly, this is what we have been eating in our families from our childhood, so it is familiar food. Secondly, in Indian cuisine, there is a burst of flavours in every single dish. Since I have worked abroad in Indian kitchens, I have seen the kind of love and respect people have for Indian food, and especially when there is a fusion of Indian and another cuisine.I am very particular about the ingredients I use. In Singapore, 40% of the people are Indian, so finding our ingredients wasnt difficult. But in other places, the ingredients would be shipped down to us. Like I said, flavours are very important in Indian cuisine; even if you miss out one, the taste will change, and you dont want to compromise on that.My best dishes have to be my Galouti Kebab  a lamb preparation, Paneer Kurkure Tikka, Awadi Murgh Kali Mirch and of course my biryanis. My favourite however is the Lucknowi biryani. What I love most about it is that the flavours are so mild. Unlike the Hyderabadi biryani which is spicier and has a richer infusion of ingredients, the Lucknowi biryani has no vegetables in it, but just the chicken or meat and rice, but still it is full of flavours.An important thing about cooking is checking the temperature. You can be a good cook, ifyou know how to make that judgement. For example, when making biryani, the rice needs a low temperature to cook but the lamb needs to be cooked at a high temperature. So the magic truly is in the balance.Though my speciality is Indian food, I have also worked with other cuisines...I would love to explore more of the Spanish cuisine. I know a couple of popular Spanish dishes  Spanish Ratatouille, Chorizo, Spanish Omelette etc. but I would love to learn how to prepare more dishes. Out of the guests who visit the hotel, around 20% are non-Indians and sometimes they ask for Spanish food. I dont like refusing any of my guests."

The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

Endemic to the Indian subcontinent in 119 districts in four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal), India itself accounts for half the global burden of the disease. If untreated, kala-azar can kill within two years of the onset of the ailment, though the availability of a range of drugs for almost a century has meant that less than 1 in 1,000 now succumb to the disease. According to numbers from the Union Health Ministry, 2016 was the first year that no kala-azar death was reported in India. Experts, however, note that like malaria and several other vector-borne diseases in India, the government only considers lab-confirmed and officially registered deaths and therefore, frequently underestimates both caseload and mortality.Historically, a 20-day treatment schedule with sodium stibogluconate (SSb) injection and the spraying of the malarial insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethan (DDT) in houses and surroundings were the only weapons against the disease.When DDT was used as part of the malaria eradication programme, very few cases of kala-azar were reported. When the use of DDT was stopped a few years later, there was an increase in the number of kala-azar cases.Over a period of time, resistance to the only drug (SSb injection) led to frequent outbreaks and fatalities and the Union Health Ministry, which had committed to eliminating kala-azar by 2010, revised it to 2015. Bangladesh, India and Nepal committed to eliminate the disease from the region, where elimination (as opposed to eradication) is defined as no more than one case per 10,000 population at the upazila level in Bangladesh, sub-district (block PHC) level in India and district level in Bhutan and Nepal.Since 2003, Indias National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is in charge of coordinating with endemic States to eliminate the disease. With funds from a World Bank-supported project (2008-2013), the NVBDCP now funds consultants at State and district level and Kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS) at the States blocks (or clusters of village panchayats) to conduct active surveillance. That means local village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs) are entrusted with constantly visiting houses and looking for patients who may present symptoms of the disease and alert health authorities.Several new medical advances have aided the fight against kala-azar. A rapid diagnostic test, called rK39 can  with a pinprick of blood  indicate the presence of the parasite. With SSb injection on the decline, there are now two mainline drugs, miltefosine  originally conceived as an anti-cancer drug and taken orally  and liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), a drug that once needed to be injected at regular intervals over four weeks but now only requires a single shot. These, besides an array of genetic tests that have obviated the need for painful jabs to the spleen and liver to confirm the presence of parasites, and global and national political commitment in terms of funding research and drug dispensation, has meant that kala-azar may be on the verge of being stamped out. However the 2015 elimination target was missed and postponed to September 2017, again a deadline that wont be met. This, in spite of the number of kala-azar patients plummeting from 36,000 in 2005 to 2,969 in 2017, according to Central government figures.At the campSarkar is one of 57 residents whove made it to the Habibpur hospital as part of biannual medical camps organised as part of the active surveillance process. About 160 were expected but a bus strike has thwarted attendance. West Bengal, like the other endemic States, was to have eliminated kala-azar in 2015, but is set to miss the deadline this year too despite the number of patients in the State coming down from 2,700 in 2005 to less than 50 as of this July.Among the camp attendees, seated on the rows of wooden benches that made up the capacious common hall of the hospital, Sarkar was the only one who presented the typical symptoms  the emaciation, anaemia and signs of a puffed spleen  that have helped doctors quickly ferret out kala-azar cases for almost a century. More than Sarkar, however, what worried the visiting doctors were 20 outwardly healthy occupants of those benches. Most were once kala-azar patients and, as the doctors who screened them found, are stricken in various degrees by a mixture of blotches and ulcers on their hands, legs, backs and, sometimes, on their faces.Painless and never known to trigger the fevers and pains typical of parasitical diseases, the blemished skin is the only sign of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It isnt the kind of disease that prompts villagers of Habibpur block, who besides kala-azar also live under the constant threat of malaria and tuberculosis, to skip farm work or forego a days earnings from manual labour, to line up outside hospitals. One of the patients with PKDL told me that the only reason he wanted treatment was because he was looking to get married, says Dr. Mitali Chatterjee, a medical doctor and researcher at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGME&R), Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital, Kolkata, which is known informally as the PG hospital.PKDL results from the parasites left over from a kala-azar infection that couldnt be slain by the chemical cocktails used to treat kala-azar. Though harmless, the pigmented skin can provide harbour, says Chatterjee, to the parasites and they can make their way onto other sandflies. Like the anopheles mosquito, the sandfly needs human blood to nourish their larvae and in the process can pass on parasites to new people and trigger a kala-azar infection. Roughly a tenth of those with a history of kala-azar will go on to develop PKDL and, potentially, seed a fresh outbreak. The precise reason for this isnt known yet. In the 1970s or early 80s, VL [kala-azar] had almost disappeared and then there was suddenly an epidemic, says Srija Moulik, a research scholar at IPGME&R, it was later traced back to a single case of PKDL. Theres a paper on that.Case and cure filesThe earliest empirical evidence for a link between PKDL as a silent agent provocateur for kala-azar outbreaks and DDT sprays came in the 1990s from C.P. Thakur, a physician and now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP. He reported an unusual trend in kala-azar cases in Bihar. Between 1970 and 1989, 530 individuals were confirmed with PKDL at the Patna Medical College (PMC), with the number of cases rocketing from two in 1970 to 59 in 1989. This was in contrast to no cases of this disease being reported at the PMC from 1958-1970. In the period 1977-1990, there were 3,01,076 cases of kala-azar reported in Bihar alone, with a mortality rate of over 2% (compared with 31,074 cases and a mortality rate below 0.4% for the rest of India). It seems possible, that once DDT spraying stopped, the re-establishment of large sandfly populations and infection of these vectors, largely as a result of them feeding on cases of PKDL, provoked the resurgence of kala-azar, Thakur and co-author K. Kumar reported in the June 1992 edition of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology .Even though this link between kala-azar and PKDL was hinted at since 1922, it wasnt until 2005 that the World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan (who together account for 90% of kala-azar cases) began concerted efforts to eliminate PKDL, as part of kala-azar elimination strategies.In a round-up of the countrys progress in dealing with the disease, at a conference in Bengaluru earlier this year, Chatterjee showed a slide illustrating that in spite of the rapid dive in kala-azar cases across endemic States, PKDL cases in Bihar, which bears 70% of Indias kala-azar burden, had risen to 500 from nil in 2013; from 300 in 2013 to 900 in 2017 in Jharkhand and 50 to 250 in West Bengal, in the same period. To Chatterjee, however, the rise in cases indicates States increased efforts to find kala-azar patients and hidden PKDL cases becoming manifest.At the IPGME&R, one of the nodal research medical labs in Kolkata thats part of the kala-azar surveillance-detection-and-analysis network, scientists are finding out through DNA analysis that the leishmaniasis parasite is an extremely resilient entity and can be dormant in the body and seed infections even after as many as five years.The group of mostly-women scientists, who are trying to cleave apart the mysteries of the parasite, are located a five-minute walk away from a modest building that once hosted the laboratory of Sir Ronald Ross, the India-born British Nobel Laureate who established that mosquitoes were responsible for transmitting malaria. Ross was also the one who christened the kala-azar parasite as Leishmania donovani , after the scientist duo that discovered them.Over the days spent peering through blood samples and skin biopsies from medical camps such as at Malda, Moulik points to yet another possible chink in the governments artillery to weed out kala-azar. The single injection of LAmB, which is now used to treat kala-azar, dramatically reduces the number of parasites in the blood and can cure the infection. However, when PKDL patients were subjected to the same medicine (targeting the same parasite), it didnt completely clear the parasite load. On the other hand, prior to LAmB, the treatment of choice for kala-azar was miltefosin, which is an oral pill taken over 12 weeks. It usually brought about nausea and other discomfort because of which several patients would quit treatment midway. However Moulik points to data in the lab that shows miltefosin did a superior job in flushing out the parasites from PKDL patients. There is a catch though. The ultra-sensitive probes that Moulik employs can spot parasites only if there are at least 10 of them in a microgram of DNA. It is quite possible that a patient might be well and disease-free for a few years but have a miniscule amount of parasites that will multiply at an opportune time in, say, five years, and then radiate the vicious cycle of outbreaks and epidemics that has undermined anti-kala-azar programmes through the years. I believe that if parasite loads go down to 10, the bodys immune system should ideally stave off infection but this is indeed the million-dollar question: How long till we are sure that the parasite loads never increase enough to pose a threat? says Moulik.The ground realitiesThe Habibpur hospital, from where IPGME&R gets a significant number of patient samples, is as large as a single-screen movie hall with X-ray machines, photocopiers, beds and a handful of trained nurses. To get to it, one must cross a stream of stagnant water that, according to local residents, swells up during the monsoon. Within several areas of the hospital, debris is piled up. There is a mossy pool of garbage alongside a water cooler that is inaccessible to the most flexible of gymnasts.The block medical officer is a busy man who must, alongside coordinating a kala-azar camp, dragoon the same set of field workers to fan out into the villages looking for tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy patients. Since 2015, when the government authorities woke up to the urgency of eliminating PKDL, patients are being given financial incentives. All those who complete the course of treatment will get Rs. 2,500 (and the medicines made available through the WHO network) and the village field staff, consisting of ASHAs and KTSs, stand to get Rs. 500 for every such patient. If financial incentives are given, then we get patients, says a doctor who has been part of several field camps, but almost never has a district medical officer accompanied us. They are supposed to.English Mohanpur, an inexplicably-named village a few km away from the hospital, is a slushy hamlet between rice fields. Several tribal communities populate its interiors and Koel, an ASHA worker, says some of the tuberculosis and kala-azar patients also battle alcoholism. Few houses have concrete roofs and fewer still comply with the government directive to spray the houses with the insecticide synthetic pyrethroid, the replacement for DDT. These sprays are needed at regular intervals and need a thorough application in every room including the kitchen. The problem is that the spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell, says Chatterjee. There is also a cluster effect. Families stay very close together and one infected person can spread it to the others.Sripad Mandal, 42, a daily-wage labourer and village resident, was bedridden for three months because of kala-azar. He says he visited the block hospital and was given a course of medicine but that didnt work. He wasnt given a second round of medicine at the hospital and finally had to get himself admitted to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. He now claims to be well. His disease, however, manifested before the government announced financial incentives for completing the treatment. This is the disease of the poorest of the poor. Unless socio-economic conditions are improved and better sanitation is available, I dont see just medicines and drugs completely eradicating kala-azar, says Chatterjee.The problem is that the pyrethroid insecticide spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell.Dr. Mitali Chatterjee,Doctor and researcher, Kolkata"
5a5314609855b770e037d151,China's Waging a Water War on India,http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-is-waging-a-water-war-on-india/story-6jqgabEffcatPFzJ6fQ6eJ.html,2017-08-22,"Tibet, a treasure-trove of natural resources, including water and precious metals, is a great strategic asset for China in its pursuit of an often improvident style of economic growth. The sprawling Tibetan plateau also arms Beijing with water leverage over downstream countries because it is the starting point for most of Asias great rivers, many of which are being heavily dammed just before they cross into neighbouring nations.China is sharpening its leverage with co-riparian India. Water indeed has emerged as a new divide in Sino-Indian relations, as Beijing quietly and opaquely builds dams, barrages and other structures on rivers flowing to India. It spurned then Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs 2013 proposal that the two countries enter into a water treaty or establish an intergovernmental institution to define mutual rights and responsibilities on shared rivers. The flash floods that ravaged Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the unannounced releases from rain-swollen Chinese dams and barrages.At a time when the Doklam face-off has entered its third month and the risk of a Chinese military attack on India is growing, there is more troubling news: Beijing is fashioning water into a political weapon by denying India flood-related hydrological data since May, even as major flooding has hit the region from Assam to Uttar Pradesh. Data on upstream river flows is essential for flood forecasting and warning in order to save lives and reduce material losses. Chinas data denial crimps flash flood modelling in India.By embarking on a dangerous game of water poker, Beijing has demonstrated how the denial of hydrological data in the critically important monsoon season amounts to the use of water as a political tool against a downstream country. Indeed, even while supplying data in past years, Chinas lack of transparency raised questions. After all, like rice traded on the world market, hydrological data comes in different grades and qualities  from good, reliable data to inferior data and broken data.Chinas latest action actually violates two bilateral MOUs of 2013 and a 2014 accord, which obligate it to transfer hydrological data to India from three upstream monitoring stations in Tibet every year from May 15 to October 15. No data has been transferred thus far this year, although India, in keeping with the MOUs, paid for the data in advance. While China sells hydrological data to downriver countries, India provides such data free to both its downstream neighbours  Pakistan and Bangladesh.China has long displayed contempt for international law. No bilateral accord seems to have binding force for it once its immediate purpose has passed, as Beijing recently highlighted by trashing the 1984 Sino-British treaty that paved the way for Hong Kongs handover in 1997. China said that pact had lost practical meaning because 20 years had passed since Hong Kongs return. Yet it selectively invokes a 19th-century, colonial-era accord to justify its Doklam intrusion, while ignoring its own violations  cited by Bhutan and India  of more recent bilateral agreements not to disturb the territorial status quo.India should not be downplaying Chinas breach of commitment to supply hydrological data from May 15. Yet, for two months, the ministry of external affairs hid Chinas contravention, which began much before the Doklam standoff. When the ministry of external affairs (MEA) finally admitted Chinas breach of obligation, it simultaneously sought to shield Beijing by saying there could be a technical reason for non-transfer of data (just as MEA sought to obscure Chinas August 15 twin raids in the Pangong Lake area by gratuitously telling the Financial Times that no commonly delineated boundary exists there). How can a technical hitch explain data withholding from three separate stations for over two months? Had China been in Indias place, it would have promptly raised a hue and cry about the commitment violation and linked it to the downstream floods and deaths.More fundamentally, the Doklam standoff, the Chinese hydro-engineering projects to re-engineer cross-border river flows, the denial of hydrological data, and Chinas claims to vast tracts of Indian land are all a reminder that Tibet is at the heart of the India-China divide. The 1951 fall of Tibet represented the most far-reaching geopolitical development in modern Indias history, with the impact exacerbated by subsequent Indian blunders. India must subtly reopen Tibet as an outstanding issue, including by using historically more accurate expressions like Indo-Tibetan border (not India-China border) and emphasising that its previously stated positions were linked to Tibet securing real autonomy.Brahma Chellaney is a geostrategist and authorThe views expressed are personal"

It was his brother, Haleem. The building has fallen. I am under the debris and am having trouble breathing, was all he could manage. Mr. Saleem, a railing craftsman, and his three siblings were residents of the six-storey Husseini building on Pakmodia Street near JJ Hospital that collapsed on Thursday. Fortunately, all three were among the first to be rescued within 10 minutes of the collapse.The ground floor was occupied by commercial establishments including a caterer and a tailors. Tawakkul Sweets, located adjacent to the building, employed five workers including Sagir Ahmed, 31, an Uttar Pradesh native, his brothers Raees, 29, and Naseer, 24, and nephew Kayyum Mansoory, 19. All were sleeping when the building collapsed; only three could be rescued. The tailor died and his daughter was seriously injured, said locals.I was in a light slumber near the door. I remember hearing a loud crash and the next thing I know, I was being dragged out by several people, Mr. Ahmed said. Raees, a father of two, was later pulled out dead, while there is still no word on Naseer and Kayyum. We came to Mumbai 10 years go from U.P., looking for employment; this building was our only home.The collapse, which claimed 22 lives, left many families broken, including the Zafars. Reshma Zafar, who lived on the third floor, survived with serious injuries, but her husband and son were killed. Similarly, all members of a family on the fifth floor died with the exception of a young boy, who had been sent to buy bread for breakfast.I woke up early and had started cooking when the walls started shaking. I rushed out. When I turned around, the building came crashing down. My two brothers and three other colleagues died, Mohammed Sartaj said. Numb with grief, he continued standing near the massive pile of rubble, hoping to recover his monthly salary of Rs. 14,000 from the ruins.Locals rush to helpPakmodia Street residents poured out on the streets within seconds of the tragedy, rushing to help anyone who could be rescued. Eateries came together and cooked dal and rice in large quantities, and a makeshift kitchen was set up across the lane from the site of the collapse by afternoon. Residents moved from person to person, be it firemen, policemen, NDRF personnel or locals helping with the rescue operation, informing them that hot food was available. Local social and political workers were roped in, and carton after carton of bottled water was rushed to the site. Bheed mat karo, jinka kaam hai unko kaam karne do (Dont gather, let the people work), local resident Mohammed Ilias, 60, called out with a handheld public address system, while others helped him disperse crowds of onlookers who were getting too close to the site. Young boys kept fetching water for the elderly volunteer, who refused to take a break till evening.Around 3 p.m., Aftab Ali, another local resident, arrived at the site looking for blood donors for the victims admitted to JJ Hospital. Mr. Ilias immediately began calling for volunteers on the PA system, and Mr. Ali directed donors to the hospital. As the azaan for the third namaaz sounded, Mr. Ilias asked people to head to the local mosque and pray for the souls of the departed and speedy recovery of the injured."

Companies and traders were bullish about sugarcane and cotton , which have seen an increase in acreage by 9% and 18%, respectively, this year.Floods in parts of Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and weak rainfall in south India have hit crops. Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi met on Saturday authorities of the energy and irrigation departments and directed them to ensure optimum power supply and to arrange for the necessary level of water to flow into paddy fields.The chief minister was informed that Agra, Hathras, Amethi, Ghaziabad and Bulandshar districts received highly deficient rains, less than 15% , while in the entire Bundelkhand region comprising Jhansi, Lalitpur and 16 other districts, rains were below 40%. 20 other districts of the region have also received deficient rains. In 48 districts comprising more than 50% of the state's geographical area, rain was deficient this year and if the dry and humid spell continues for the remaining days of September, there may be a crisis for farmers, as majority of them are depending on rains for their paddy crop.During the review meeting, the chief minister was presented a report by the irrigation department on its efforts to bolster flow of water into the agriculture fields, particularly for paddy and other crops of the Kharif season. State energy minister Shrikant Sharma said rise in demand for electricity all over the state was primarily because of deficient rains.Principal secretary irrigation Suresh Chandra told TOI he had issued necessary directions for optimum supply of water to canals for irrigation and he added that he had asked electricity department officials to ensure regular and adequate power supply to run tube wells. Agriculture director Soraj Singh said amid deficient rains in Bundelkhand, seeds and other aids to farmers are being supplied for the Rabi season.Paddy is sown in 59 lakh hectares agriculture land. Last year, rice production was 143 lakh metric tonnes as rains were normal but this time, with below average rain, not only paddy, most Rabi crops, mainly wheat will suffer because of lack of the requisite moisture level."

According to the first advance estimate released today by the agriculture ministry, the production of all kharif crops - rice, pulses and coarse cereals - is projected to decline from the record 138.52mt last kharif. Harvesting will start from next month. According to the latest data, rice output is likely to fall by 1.9mt to 94.48mt this year from the record 96.39mt in the previous kharif. Pulse output could drop to 8.71mt from the record 9.42mt because of depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur is estimated to be lower at 3.99mt from 4.78mt, while urad output may rise to 2.53mt from 2.17mt in the last kharif season. Coarse cereal output is also seen lower at 31.49mt, against 32.71mt in the gone-by kharif season. Maize output is pegged at 18.73mt against 19.24mt a year ago. Oilseed output is estimated to be down at 20.68mt compared with 22.40mt in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22mt against 13.79mt last kharif. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the earlier 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69mt, from 306.72mt before. Production of jute and mesta is estimated to decline to 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) from 10.60 million bales last year. The overall monsoon was projected normal, but till the first week of this month, it was less by 5 per cent. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced a dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states. The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting. Sugar production The government is expecting about 24 per cent increase in the country's total sugar output to around 25 million tonnes in the marketing year beginning next month on likely higher output in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra following good rains, an official source said. This is an initial projection based on the inputs of the state governments. The estimate, however, is in line with the industry body ISMA's projection. The country's sugar output in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) is estimated to be lower at 20.2 million tonnes because of poor rains. India is the world's second biggest sugar producer. In a meeting with state cane commissioners called by the Union Food Ministry, official sources said state governments have submitted the sugar production figures after assessing the likely sugarcane output and recovery level. Based on their inputs, the country's overall sugar output is expected to be around 25 million tonnes in 2017-18 marketing year, the sources said."

There is opposition to the move from state farmers, and the mandi board is at the centre of it, because it manages procurement of grains and other produce through a network of 1,700 mandis.The corresponding levy is lower in states such as Rajasthan (1.6%) , Uttar Pradesh (2.4%), and Madhya Pradesh (0.2%).One of the options on the mandi boards mind is to hike the fee only for the dominant crops, wheat and paddy. We will implement the governments decision, but we will see that farmers interests are not harmed, said the boards chairman, former Congress minister Lal Singh. In the board meeting of October 11, we will decide whether to implement the hike on all crops or just wheat and paddy.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said the enhancement is unjustified because, though the fees are levied on the purchaser of the farmers produce, the burden actually falls on the farmers. He added, This will lead to increase in the costs and dissuades traders from buying from the state, he said.The funds collected as fees go to the Punjab Rural Development Board for infrastructure, including link roads, which, the government argues, is for the benefit of the farmers.However, with the cotton crop ready, farmers in south-west Punjab prefer to take it to mandis of Sri Ganganagar (Rajasthan) and Dabwali (Haryana), where the levies are lower. Next, basmati growers are worried and already demanding a rollback as the crop is set to arrive in mandis by the end of October.The Punjab Basmati Rice Millers Association has said that said big mills set up under the mega project category have been exempted from the market fee, so the business will shift to those. In 2013, the government had abolished both the fees on purchase of basmati, but it was levied again in 2015.Wheat and paddy produce are bought mostly by state agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on behalf of the Centre, while other crops are primarily procured by traders."

On Thursday, the lab announced that while half of them had low levels of the good cholesterol or HDL, two in every five had high levels of bad cholesterol of LDL.In Chennai, more than 8% of the people have very high levels of cholesterol and at least two out 10 are on the borderline. What was more worrying was that nearly one in ten has either high or very high levels of the bad cholesterol.Metropolis Healthcare head Dr Kirti Chadha said lifestyle, lack of exercise, junk food, increased stress level and smoking has pushed up risk of heart diseases.Most senior doctors say they aren't surprised by the numbers. ""High levels of cholesterol have been one of the leading causes of heart diseases in the country,"" said diabetologist Dr RM Anjana. ""Nevertheless, the numbers will be far higher in epidemiological studies compared to data from labs, where many people could be on medications,"" she said.Meanwhile, another survey by Suffola life 2017, which aimed to understand the barriers to heart health, among 1,306 respondents across Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata found long working hours, work stress, lack of sleep and long travel were key reasons.In Chennai, 85% of people said temptation for food comes in their way of putting efforts towards having a healthy heart. Studies have also shown that most people in the city eat high amount of carbohydrates such as rice and sugar and low levels of protein-rich food. While 80% also complained that long working hours and work stress prevent them from making efforts towards healthy practices such as exercise, 72% of them blamed it on distraction from phones and tablets.But more than 6 out of 10 people pointed out that the city does not have adequate space walking or exercising. Mumbai-based endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi said while there is a rising awareness about heart health, compliance and action is a big area of concern in India.Studies have shown that active lifestyle, which includes daily chores at home like cleaning, moping and gardening can reduce the risk of heart diseases and death."
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

The BJP had in a similar manner raised the issue of alleged impropriety by Congress president Sonia Gandhis son-in-law Robert Vadra.We will walk that extra mile to expose the true face of the BJP. We will take this issue to each household and every nook and corner of the country. Justice may be poetic. The jury is out.The people of India will decide, Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said.The party sought Shahs resignation as the BJP chief till the probe was over in line with past precedents, citing BJP veterans LK Advani and Nitin Gadkari as examples. Apart from demanding an inquiry into the matter by sitting Supreme Court judges, it also wanted the Prime Minister to break his silence on the issue and immediately sack Shah.On Monday, the Congress held news conferences on the controversy in 12 cities across the country. While Anand Sharma held the fort in Delhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala and Sachin Pilot attacked the BJP in Jaipur.Raj Babbar raised the issue in Lucknow, RPN Singh in Ranchi, Rajni Patil, Pawan Khera abd Bhupesh Baghel were deputed to Raipur, Ajoy Kumar and Prasad Harichandan to Bhubaneswar, Gaurav Gogoi to Kolkata, Ripun Bora, Tarun Gogoi and Debbrat Saikia address the press conference in Guwahati, Prithviraj Chavan and Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil in Mumbai, Jairam Ramesh in Ahmedabad, Virbhadra Singh, Ranjeeta Ranjan and Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu in Shimla.On Tuesday, Babbar, Pritam Singh and Indira Hridayesh will address a news conference in Dehradun, Deepak Babaria and Arun Yadav in Bhopal, RPN Singh and Ashok Tanwar in Chandigarh, M Veerappa Moily in Mangalore, Surjewala and Nilesh Awasthi in Jabalpur.The Youth Congress is also organising a protest on the issue on Tuesday. We demand CBI and ED investigations on the matter. We also demand resignation of Amit Shah and want the PM to come out and give a statement on the issue, Youth Congress spokesperson Amrish Ranjan Pandey said.In the past, the Congress had sought to put the BJP on the mat by demanding the resignations of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Raman Singh over a multi-crore exam-rigging scandal, better known as Vyapam, and the rice scam respectively.It had also demanded the resignations of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhra Raje for helping former IPL chief Lalit Modi get travel documents in the UK.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had launched an investigation against Modi in 2010 following the allegations of misconduct, indiscipline and financial irregularities, and banned him for life in 2013 after a committee found him guilty of these charges. He later moved to London.The Congress had also attacked the NDA government over the escape of liquor baron Vijay Mallya. He had left India in March last year after defaulting on repayment of loans worth several hundred crores that Kingfisher Airlines, now defunct, owed to banks.The party sought to Link the escape of Mallya and Lalit Modi to Modis failure to deliver his poll promise to bring back black money stashed abroad, alleging that the government had allowed them to flee the country and swindle thousands of crores of public money."

My passion for food led me to Bengaluru, where I completed hotel management course in 1990s. I started my career from Ludhiana as kitchen executive in 2000. After two years, I moved to Shimla, where I worked for two years. From Shimla, I moved to the UK for three years and from there to Bangkok for a year.After years of exploring international cuisines, I decided to come back to India and came straight to Hyderabad, where I worked for two-and-a-half years. From there, I moved to Fairmont Hotel in Jaipur, where I worked for five years and then joined Inter Continental, Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort, as executive chef.I have been learning and cooking a lot of different cuisines ranging from Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, Peshawri, Asian, Continental and so on. Because of my extensive travels to different regions and countries, I got various opportunities to learn newer cuisines. My cooking style has improved so much. The more you travel, the more you learn about the flavours, ingredients and the culture of the food itself.Whatever cuisine I cook, I am particular about using fresh ingredients and also maintain the authenticity of the flavours and the cuisine itself. Earlier acquiring the right kind of spices and ingredients were a bit difficult, but today everything is easily available in every place.Its fascinating how one dish can be cooked in different ways, depending on the region it comes from. In Hyderabadi biriyani for instance, the raw meat and raw rice is cooked together and it is spicier. Whereas in Lucknowi biriyani, the chicken and rice are cooked separately, after which it is layered. And the flavouring is little bit on the sweeter side they use ingredients like saffron, star anise and cinnamon, hence giving a sweet flavour to it. My favourite biriyani is Hyderabadi because.I cook a lot of Asian as well, and that is one of my favourites  Chinese, Thai, Sichuan, Cantonese, etc. If you ask me my favourite dishes, it has to be the Hon Shimeji, Baby Sea Bass and Pan-fried Chicken Shanghai. Authentic Chinese food too differs in terms of flavouring and ingredients depending on the region  using of wild herbs or using a different method to cook like pot-roasting or stewing, etc. Flavours are altered according to the taste the people prefer.There have been several embarrassing mistakes I have made. One in particular was during my initial days of training when I was on a night shift. I was supposed to boil potatoes that night for the next day. So I put them in the container for boiling and I just stepped out for a bit, only to return four hours later and realise that I had left the potato. By then, it was too late!

Sandip Daundkar NICU ward of Thane District Civil Hospital. Sandip DaundkarJust as Nashik civil authorities were dealing with the public outcry over 55 infant deaths in August, 80 km away in Jawhar, a tribal area three hours drive away, Hira Dambale lost the battle to save her 28-day-old baby. Blind in one eye due to a childhood measles infection, Hira battled anaemia during her pregnancy and gave birth prematurely, at just 24 weeks, to a child who weighed only 490 grams.Doctors at the sub-district hospital in Jawhar tried in vain to save the baby that had been kept in the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) for nearly a month. Hira has a seven-year-old boy who is moderately malnourished. She lost another baby two years ago and her third one could survive for less than a month. Hira required blood transfusion due to her low haemoglobin count. During my pregnancy, the doctors gave me tablets to increase my blood count but I did not take them. There was too much acidity, says this tribal woman whose staple meal is rice grown in a small patch near her hut at Talasri village.For 22-year-old Anita Budhar, who is from Mokhada taluka in Palghar district, it was her second delivery on September 2. The baby weighed only 700g and has been admitted to the SNCU at Jawhar hospital. Like Hira, she too had required blood transfusion due to her low haemoglobin count. At the government-run 100-bed cottage hospital at Jawhar, admits medical superintendent Dr Ramdas Marad, at least 30 new mothers undergo blood transfusions after deliveries every month.Low birth weight, one of the main reasons for a large number of infant deaths in Maharashtra and other states, is linked to factors like nutrition and anaemia. An anaemic pregnant woman is more likely to deliver a baby lighter than normal, and 49.3 per cent pregnant women across Maharashtra were anaemic according to the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4). Among the non-pregnant women too, 48 per cent of them in the age group of 15-49 were anaemic.Jawhar and Mokhada, along with adjoining Vada and Vikramgad talukas in Palghar district, have reported several cases of children with malnutrition. According to a National Human Rights Commission report, at least 600 children died due to malnutrition in Palghar district last year. The 100-bed cottage hospital at Jawhar caters to 1.5 lakh people and gets referrals from tribal pockets of Mokhada, Vikramgad and others. There are at least 180-200 admissions of sick babies every month at the 12-bed SNCU. Most of the babies weigh between 800 grams and 1 kg. From April to August, a total of 748 sick babies were admitted at the Jawhar SNCU, of which 27 died. While malnutrition related deaths are high in these tribal pockets, the cottage hospital has set up a Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre where every month a minimum of 20 children are admitted, says Marad.At Nashik civil hospital, which was in the eye of a storm with 55 deaths in August this year, about 250 to 300 sick babies are admitted to the 28-bed SNCU every month. Nearly 25 per cent of the 700-odd women who give birth at the hospital every month suffer from anaemia.While majority of the women have mild or moderate anaemia that is treated with injections, those whose haemoglobin count less than 7 need blood transfusions and at least two out of ten such women require it every month, says Dr Suresh Jagdale, Civil Surgeon, Nashik district.At Thanes 336-bed district hospital, Civil Surgeon Dr B C Kempi Patil admitted that out of 738 admissions at the 16-bed SNCU, there were 47 deaths of neonates between April and August this year. These are extremely critical babies referred from other centres. However, the death rate is 6.37 per cent and we have been managing these babies. In fact, a team from Uttar Pradesh recently visited the hospital to take tips on how we were managing the babies, says Patil.Maharashtra registers about 20 lakh deliveries annually. Between April and August this year, a total of 22,692 babies were admitted and treated at the 36 SNCUs across the state. About 16.62 per cent of the babies that were admitted to these SNCUs weighed less than 1,000g, while 29.33 per cent weighed between 1,000 and 1,499g. In 2016-17, a total of 50,373 children were admitted and treated in the SNCUs. According to the state analysis, a total of 15.31 per cent babies at the time of admission had weighed less than 1,000g, while 29.45 per cent had weighed between 1,000 and 1,499g.The state health department will now introduce National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) to address anaemia that includes providing supervised biweekly iron folic acid supplementation for all under-5 children and weekly tablets for adolescents in the age group of 10-19 years. The challenge, public health experts say, is huge. Fauzdar Ram, former director of Indian Institute of Population Sciences, Mumbai, who is a co-author of the Million Death Study published in September in The Lancet, told The Indian Express that the total number of childbirths in India had declined only slightly from 28 million every year to 26 million between 2000 and 2015.Our challenge is now to meet the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) for child and neonatal mortality. The child mortality rates have halved from 2.5 million child deaths in 2000 to 1.2 million child deaths in 2015. Neonatal deaths that were 50 per cent of all child deaths in 2000, however rose to 58 per cent in 2015. We will now have to address several challenges and will require an average annual decline from 2015 onwards of 4.1 per in child mortality and 5.3 per cent in neonatal mortality. The biggest target is to reduce neonatal mortality due to prematurity or low birth-weight deaths, especially in poorer states. These are strongly linked to factors like antenatal care, anaemia, education and nutrition, says Ram.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5a1516a49855b76bf13ead82,Food for reform,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-food-prices-inflation-indian-economy-food-for-reform-4898307/,2017-10-20,"Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

There are hundreds of units that produce veneer, plywood, and block boards, located mainly at Vengola, Rayamangalam, Vazhakulam and Asamannoor panchayats and in Perumbavoor municipality. Except quality control, most skilled and unskilled work is carried out by migrant workers, notes the study conducted by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) with support from Thummarukudy Foundation.Skilled workersEngaged informally at the units are workers from Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam, while the skilled workforce mostly comprises workers from Assam.The monograph on migrant workers in the district, jointly written by Benoy Peter and Vishnu Narendran of CMID, records their presence in the construction industry; hospitality sector; furniture industry that is thriving at Nellikuzhi where eminent craftsmen from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh known for their wood carving skills function; textile and apparel units around Kizhakkambalam; cement factories on Willingdon island; fishing industry at Thoppumpady, Munambam, and Vypeen; rice mills at Kalady, and other industries at Airapuram, Angamaly, South Vazhakkulam, Edathala, Edayar, Binanipuram, Nellad, and Kalamassery.They are also engaged as housekeeping staff in luxury hotels (the only exception being men and women from the northeast manning lobbies of hotels), fuel stations, restaurants, malls, and hospitals.Work at quarriesSeveral workers from Odisha and West Bengal have been engaged as gardeners. Quarries spread along the district also have migrant labour.The study has identified Nagaon-Ernakulam and Mushidabad-Ernakulam as the two arterial, and the longest, migrant corridors that have emerged in India in the past two decades.It also throws light on the education facilities available for wards of migrant labourers in the district."
5a149e2c9855b76bf13e62a3,Surface ozone is damaging wheat and rice crops across the country: Study,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surface-ozone-is-damaging-wheat-and-rice-crops-across-the-country-study/story-ATrw25PIoFHlYeQsqG7YDJ.html,2017-10-31,"Surface ozone, a plant-damaging pollutant could be destroying up to 15% wheat crop and up to 6% rice yield every year across India, a first-of-its kind study based on ground observations of ozone, has revealed.A multi-institute study comprising 14 scientists and led by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, under the Department of Space, has estimated that every year, surface ozone is likely to wipe out 4.014.2 million tonnes (MT) of the total 95 MT of wheat produced in India, and 0.36.7 MT of the total 105 MT rice grown.Surface ozone  also called a secondary pollutant  is generated through chemical reactions between primary pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight. The sources of these primary pollutants are power plants, vehicles, industries, and bio-mass burning.With a projected rise in man-made pollution including surface ozone, researchers said the findings are important since a decrease in crop yield in India, which is the second populous country, will have a serious impact on its food security and economic growth.Wheat and rice are important crops for India since they form a staple diet, said professor Shyam Lal, principal investigator, PRL. Photosynthesis takes place during the day. When ozone molecules, which are generated in the presence of sunlight, get into the plant cells, the plant gets affected and can get damaged.Previous studies have calculated the annual loss of wheat crop in the range of 5% to 30%, and between 2.1% and 16 % for rice yields. However, these high estimates were based on either limited observations  restricted to some states only  or regional and global chemistry transport models.Ozone is a very new phenomenon in India now, and ozone levels are rising. The findings are important, as we now know from different sources of the impact of surface ozone on vegetation and crops, in addition to health. This means that pollution is ultimately reaching food security, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, who was not involved in the study. Ozone reduction strategies have to become an important policy focus now.The present study, drawn from data on surface ozone recorded at 17 locations across India, has found that general pattern of ozone variability shows higher ozone in AprilMay, lower in August and again increasing in October November.This is because high pollution levels and strong sunlight especially between March and May results in high levels of surface ozone damaging crops. Low surface ozone levels recorded during winter months when pollution levels are high but sunlight is low will either not damage crops or the loss is less.Though there is a permissible human exposure level for surface ozone set by the Central Pollution Control Board, there are no safe levels prescribed for plants.For the study, researchers used two internationally adopted methods to assess the exposure of crops to surface ozone  average ozone levels for seven hours during the day for three-month cropping period and second, accumulated ozone levels that exceed 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) over the same period.[S2] In the present study, exposure to wheat in the north and west-central regions of India crossed the average surface ozone 40 ppbv threshold between January and March. The North Indian region includes Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, while west-central regions comprise Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Average ozone levels during the wheat crop duration of three months were highest in the west/central region at about 47 ppbv followed by north India at about 41 ppbv. The corresponding accumulated ozone levels recorded in the west was 16,300 ppbv*hr and it was about 7,200 ppbv*hr in the north. However, a major part of the wheat crop is grown in north India only.The damage to rice though lower was also pronounced in northern and western-central parts of the country. The seasonal average ozone levels in the north and west-central were 33 ppbv and 27 ppbv  and the corresponding accumulated ozone levels in both these regions were 4730 ppbv*hr and 3400 ppbv*hr.Researchers said as compared to wheat, crop loss for rice is less because surface ozone levels are lower as the main harvesting period is soon after the summer monsoon. Also average surface ozone levels are lower in the eastern and southern regions of India where large quantity of rice is grown.India has two cropping seasons  Kharif and Rabi. Sowing for rice, a kharif crop, takes place between June and July, and its harvested from September to October. Wheat is a rabi crop that is sown between November and December, and harvested from February to April.North India logged the highest annual loss of about 9 MT of wheat. For rice, the maximum loss of about 2.6 MT every year was recorded from the countrys eastern region of Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Assam, and Jharkhand.With pollution levels set to rise further including levels of surface ozone, international studies have predicted higher losses for wheat and rice for India by 2030.Ozone is a very reactive gas, and while it is very harmful for health it also has a huge impact on vegetation. Ozone will increase if emissions of gases from combustion of sources such as vehicles and industries increase. If you have to control ozone, then need to control emissions from nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, said Roychowdhury.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that wheat, 73% of which is cultivated in north India alone, should be sown as early as possible starting November so that it is grown in the period when ozone is relatively lower.Wheat and rice cultivars, which have resistance to ozone damage, need to be developed. We would like to suggest policy makers to work out plans to reduce air pollution, particularly in the northern India. This will take care not only of the losses of the crops but also health of the public, read the study.."

Action will certainly be taken on the basis of the report.The move came just weeks after Rawat issued marching orders to Kumaon regional food controller VS Dhanik in connection with the Rs 600 rice scam.Incidentally, the civil supplies department is among the departments which will face special audit, a source said. Other departments include Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd (UPRNNL), State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Ltd (Sidcul), Technical University and state cooperative bank.Cabinet minister Madan Kaushik confirmed that the order was issued. The order was issued after complaints were received against those departments, he said, confirming that UPRNNL is one of the departments to face audit.The order for a special audit of construction works carried out by UPRNNL was issued after the government received complaints, Kaushik said, denying the reports that such steps were initiated with an eye on the local body polls and the Lok Sabha election.The anti-graft measures we have been taking are in line with the CMs stated policy of zero tolerance to corruption. As it is, the general election is more than a year away.The government was duty bound to initiate action on all kinds of complaints, including those related to corruption, he asserted.The old constructions carried out by UPRNNL would be audited as the venture was banned in Uttarakhand. A decision to ban UPRNNL was taken after we got complaints relating to construction works it carried out, parliamentary affairs minister Prakash Pant had said.Political observers took a different take on the issue. I have no doubt that the anti-corruption measures being taken by this government will benefit the BJP in all elections, Prof MM Semwal of HNB Garhwal (Central) University said. But, he said, the government has to be consistent in initiating anti-graft measures.It introduced the law but its effective implementation in terms of providing timely services to people is yet to be carried out, Semwal said, citing the example of the Right to Services Act."

The number is reducing every year as the department is trying to take measures, he said.A senior official from the department, on anonymity, said that on an average, every year in Karnataka, 200 new boilers are added.These boilers need routine inspection. The wear and tear also cause damage. We can prevent accidents, provided it is routinely checked and maintained.The owners focus more on production than maintenance, official said.Further, an official said, though there are 3,000 boilers, there are hardly 10 officials, including the Joint Director, Assistant Director. Normally the inspection is conducted by inspectors, with one inspector for every 300 to 400 boilers. How can one person inspect so many boilers in one year? Some boilers need inspection twice a year to get certified. We need people to conduct a routine inspection. The department is planning to hire three more people, but even then it wont be enough, he said.When contacted T G Manjunath, Director of Factories, Boilers, Industrial Safety and Health, said, there is a shortage of inspection staff but they are trying to manage. The government of India has also given some relaxation on inspection.All these years, it was a department official. Now, third-party inspection is also possible, where an external private agency is given authorisation to do a periodic inspection. This will certainly lessen the burden, added the official."

We have done the weighing and I am happy to announce that this is the new Guinness World Record, weighing in at 918 kilograms, said Paulina Sapinska, a Guinness World Record judge. The minimum quantity required for making a record was 500 kilos, she said.The khichdi was cooked in a specially made stainless steel wok that weighed around 300kg and had a capacity of 1,000 litres. The wok full of khichdi was lifted with a crane to measure the total weight.The cooked dish was later served to hundreds of people at the venue and also distributed for charity .Earlier in the day, yoga guru Baba Ramdev added tadka (tempering of spices) to the dish at the India Gate lawns, where the three-day festival is being organised by the ministry of food processing industries.It is a proud moment for us. Now khichdi, the Indian dish, has earned global recognition, chef Sanjeev Kapoor said.Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Union minister of food processing industries, also lent a helping hand while the the dish was being cooked, suggested that khichdi be declared International Super Food. Union minister of state Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and chefs Imtiaz Qureshi and Ranveer Brar also helped in the cooking the dish that was made with 125 kilos of rice, 50 kilos of moong dal (beans), 200 kilos of solid ingredients such as millet, jowar and ghee and 700 litres of water.Khichdi is not just nutritious but it also symbolises unity and diversity of India, as it is consumed in one or the other form across the country, yoga guru Ramdev said.After weighing, the dish was sent for distribution to 10,000 children in Uttar Pradeshs Vrindavan through Akshay Patra Foundation, an organisation which serves meals to underprivileged children, and also as langar served at gurdwaras of Delhi to commemorate Gurpurab. The khichdi was one of the offerings at the Great Indian Food Street at the festival that features street food from 20 states.Even before being cooked, khichdi had taken the centre stage at the food fair. The buzz started when it was announced that the dish would be showcased as Brand India food . The dish was selected as it symbolised Indias unity in diversity and is eaten by both the rich and poor.Khichdi started trending on social media right after the announcement, with people whipping up a debate. On Thursday, Harsimrat Kaur Badal put an end to the rumours and tweeted, Enough khichdi cooked up on a fictitious National Dish. It has only been put for a record entry in #WorldFoodIndia.."

Thank heavens. Not that I have anything against khichdi. Indeed, its my dish of choice on rainy days, accompanied by deep-fried pakoras, papads and prawn pickle. But khichdi as national dish? Thats like saying drab is my favourite colour.My objection is to foisting one national dish on a country that displays such culinary diversity. (For that matter, I believe its difficult to impose anything by diktat in a temperamentally-anarchic society like ours.) As food historian Pushpesh Pant says, its a sad, bad idea to nationalise cultural heritage. People should have a sense of ownership, unprompted.Thats what legacy is all about. Two, I love my greens but dont see why our national dish should be vegetarian. Which is why I hugely enjoyed all the sarcy memes and jokes that were sparked by the reports of the chawal-dal mix being singled out for national honour, and was just gearing up for a candle march to Jantar Mantar in protest when Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur clarified that khichdi was just being celebrated as a dish that represents Brand India; nothing more, nothing less.Now that a few days have passed since the outrage and I know we dont need to click our heels and salute every time khichdi turns up at the table, I think the minister and celebrity Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who cooked over 800 kg of the stuff in a 1,000-litre capacity kadhai at the World Food India event in the capital on Saturday, to symbolise Indias great culture of unity in diversity at its best, may be onto something. Because after much mulling over our regional cuisines, the humble khichdi does seem to be the only dish that finds expression in kitchens across the country.Sweet, salty, spicy, vegetarian, non-vegetarian, we have khichdis in all flavours. Theres pongal in Tamil Nadu and bisi bele bhath in Karnataka. Hyderabad has the spice-laden keeme ki khichdi. In addition to the watery gruel cooked for patients, Uttar Pradesh has the amla khichdi that must be had on Makar Sankranti; Bengal the ghee-soaked khichuri packed with cauliflower and peas, and Odisha the yummy mix thats served as bhog to one lakh pilgrims a day at Puris Jagannath Mandir.In the West, Maharashtra has the sabudana khichdi and Gujarat the sola khichdi with vegetables, cream andwait for itmincemeat. Like other signature Indian dishes like the samosa, biryani and halwa, the khichdi too evolves, triggered by regional and seasonal imperatives like availability of produce and local palate, explains Pant.Not just geography, the dish works across history and religions as well. Historians mention Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya dipping their fingers in it while Moroccan traveler Ibn Batuta talks about having kishri, containing rice and beans, during his travels in India around 1350. Later books have Aurangzeb chomping on Alamgiri khichdi, containing fish and boiled eggs, while Wajid Ali Shahs favourite is said to have been a rich khichdi packed with almond slivers and pistachio. I wonder which version Minister Kaur likes personally.Shampa Dhar-Kamathshampa@newindianexpress.com"
5a155d1e9855b76bf13eda70,Demonetisation fails to bring any cheer for farmers,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/uMBxJKAeoC4n26DxmLdngP/Demonetisation-fails-to-bring-any-cheer-for-farmers.html,2017-11-07,"Demonetisation created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch in a the agriculture market driven by cash transactions. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."

PM Modi demonetised Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8, 2016.Narendra Modi has revealed his Tughlaq face. Claiming to wage war against black money, he has gone to war against the middle class and the poor, who constitute a majority. By demonetising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes, he has mocked them as cheats and dubbed as thugs people without a morsel to eat. This special edition looks at many aspects of his demonetisation madness.Bizarre stories made the rounds on social media last week. Some claimed the new Rs 2,000 note would have a nano chip to enable the government to monitor how the money was being spent. The income tax authorities, or so the stories said, would use satellites to locate and raid those hoarding new notes. The stories claimed the notes could be tracked even if they were buried 120 metres below the earth. Zee News in Hindi and a Kannada channel zealously put out imaginary stories. One of the anchors was bouncing up and down in delight like the pontiff of the Pejawar math. The woman presenter who seconds him went to the extent of proclaiming the note featured a picture of the Mars mission to indicate how satellites would keep an eye on the currency.The stories spread like wildfire. Last week, when I boarded a train to Hubballi, all my fellow passengers were talking about the chip. Taken aback at their naivete, I said, Its all a lie. Theres no such chip in the note. Two middle-aged men, sceptical about me, said the news had appeared on TV. Not everything that appears on TV is true, I said. They countered me: they had heard such notes were already in circulation in the US. Who told you? There are no such notes anywhere in the world, I said. What is the use of demonetisation then? one of them asked. Give it some thought, I said. A young man on a top berth butted in: You know what use it is? Big industrialists have borrowed money and are not paying back their loans. The banks have no money. That's why they are out to make people deposit their money. And people are taking their old notes to the banks, afraid they will turn out worthless otherwise.You mean this wont solve the black money problem? one of the men said. It will take care of fake currency for a while. But its extent isnt big. Within months, they will start making counterfeits of the new notes. The corrupt keep their wealth in jewellery and property, not cash. Only a small amount gets demonetised. In any case, we will never get, as Modi had promised, Rs 15 lakh in each of our bank accounts, I said.Oh, we thought Modi was on to something big. Looks like he has just put his hands into our pockets, a man said, sighing.The State Bank of India has just written off loans it had advanced to 63 companies. Know how much they owed? A whopping Rs 7,016 crore. This includes the Rs 1,201 crore owed by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. It isnt difficult to guess on whose side Modi is: the affluent who borrowed for their fancies and whose loans he has waived or the millions of hard-working people standing in long bank queues to deposit money they have earned.Modi has not been able to bring black money stashed away abroad. He hasnt even been able to name the secret account holders. His election promise of Rs 15 lakh in each citizens account remains a pipe dream. Even if we put up with such scams, how can we look on as he snatches away the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class?An elderly man waiting to take out money for his daily expenses has died. And how did a BJP vice-president respond to it? Big deal. People die even in ration shop queues.When it dawned on Modi that a majority was frustrated with his insane actions, he didnt say, Please bear with me. I will fix the problem in a few days. Instead, he said, Im doing all this for the nation. People who have ruled us for 70 years are conspiring against me. No one in his party told him, But sir, when did these people, struggling to withdraw their own money, ever rule in these 70 years? How can they conspire against you?The middle class and people in the media, who had hailed demonetisation as Modis masterstroke, now see the machinations behind it. They are aware the new note holds no magic. It cant banish black money, and Modis eccentricities are causing them misery.Modi continues to say we must put up with all this in the interest of the nation, but the problem wont go away anytime soon. Common people will have to scrape and scrounge for cash at least for four months. Business has been affected badly. With no customers, fisherfolk and traders in West Bengal are in the doldrums. In Punjab, farmers have no cash to buy seeds. If they dont sow now, the prices of rice and wheat will go up soon. No money in hand, nothing to eat either is the fate of millions. All this thanks to Modi.The BJP is feeling the heat of the peoples anger. Party president Amit Shah has instructed MPs to put up flex boards praising Modis surgical strike against black money. They usually follow his instructions to the letter, but this time they arent paying him any heed. Except for an MP in Gujarat, no one has put up laudatory flex hoardings.Even people in Gujarat have turned against Modi. Assembly elections are coming up. Expecting praise, party workers holding pamphlets went towards citizens standing in a bank queue. They received blows instead!Allies such as the Akali Dal in Punjab and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are also turning their back on the BJP. Quite a few BJP leaders are openly criticising Modis actions in the presence of the media, though they are unwilling to speak on record. Even Modi is coming to know of the attrition he has generated. That is why he comes across as so fidgety on his tours.About 25 people have died across the country because of demonetisation. In Uttar Pradesh, a couple with old notes was turned away from a hospital and their daughter died as a consequence. A woman in Gujarat with old notes couldnt feed her two children; she hanged herself.In Kanpur, a young man had been trying for months to sell his property. On November 8, he finally received Rs 70 lakh in advance. When he heard of demonetisation the next morning, he suffered a heart attack and died. A woman in Telangana, who had sold her land for her husbands medical treatment and her daughters wedding, was told the cash was worthless. She committed suicide. In Udupi, a man standing in a long queue, waiting for his bank to open, died of a heart attack.Not one of these was a thug. Not one of them was an Adani, Ambani, Tata or Birla. They were honest middle-class people, farmers, homemakers, all earning their livelihood from honest toil. They ended up as victims of Modis grandiose war against black money. He is responsible for their deaths.In fact, Modi has launched no surgical strike against black money. What he has done is push helpless people to death. What better can we expect from Modis Tughlaq dispensation?[Excerpted from The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, edited by Chandan Gowda, and published by DC Books and Navayana, Delhi.Chandan Gowda says, The book brings together select political and cultural writings of the courageous activist-journalist.

5aeac4b59855b7179ad6e7e3,Capital crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/capital-crisis/article20006950.ece,2017-11-09,"Delhis air quality deteriorates with unfailing regularity at this time of the year, with large swathes of north India in the grip of a suffocating smog, but the State governments that can make it easier for millions to breathe do not act with any sense of urgency. That it has turned into a public health emergency in the capital, with the air quality index touching extremely hazardous levels in some parts, necessitating the closure of primary schools, has further lowered its standing. It is unconscionable for governments, through indifference and inaction, to subject citizens to such toxic air, and cause extreme suffering especially among people with respiratory ailments and impaired lung function. The smog that envelops the region is exacerbated by the burning of biomass in Punjab and Haryana, and the winter atmosphere is marked by weak ventilation. An analysis of local sources by IIT-Kanpur last year pointed to construction dust, vehicular pollution, and domestic and industrial emissions as other major factors. Clearly, the burden of such chronic problems has outweighed the benefits conferred by measures such as the ban on Deepavali crackers, and in the past, the shift to compressed natural gas for commercial vehicles and restricting car use to odd and even number plates on alternate days. A comprehensive solution demands that the governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, assisted by the Centre, address farm residue burning and construction dust.The post-monsoon  as opposed to pre-monsoon  burning of rice and wheat residue releases maximum aerosols that contribute to the volume of PM2.5, which gets embedded in the lungs. Automation of farm operations leaves root-bound crop waste after machine harvesting, running to millions of tonnes, requiring a solution of scale. Sustainable residue removal cannot be achieved by the farmers alone, and requires help from the state machinery. Here, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should be commended for his initiative to discuss the modalities of joint action with the Punjab and Haryana governments. The national capital needs a major greening effort. Unpaved surfaces raise dust levels as in all Indian cities, but civic agencies ignore the problem. There is every reason to think that even the Ministry of Environments orders issued in 2015 under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to comprehensively green Delhis road margins and open spaces were not pursued seriously. Shifting more of the citys travel to comfortable public transport can cut fine particulates in congested areas and improve the air for residents. Many such initiatives were taken up by China in its cities to reduce exposure to PM2.5 that produces morbidity from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and leads to premature death. Only a determined response to the crisis can spare Delhi of its infamous tag as one of the most polluted cities on the planet."
5a0cf24f9855b76bf13d0002,Hole in farm finance forcing sharecroppers to end lives,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/nov/11/hole-in-farm-finance-forcing-sharecroppers-to-end-lives-1698243.html,2017-11-11,"BARGARH:Its private credit rather than institutional finance to blame for the spate of farmer suicides across the State. While the benefits of bank credits are availed by land owners, the sharecroppers fall back on private lenders who provide loans at the doorsteps without the hassles of paperwork but charge a high rate of interest. This turns fatal for the landless or marginal farmers in case of crop loss.At a time when Kisaan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, launched in 1998, offers easy loan and flexible repayment option which even tenants and sharecroppers can avail, suicide by farmers under debt burden has become a baffling trend. But there is more to it than meets the eye.A senior bank official revealed that 90 per cent of agriculture loans disbursed under Kisaan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been placed under non-performing asset (NPA). He further said the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 has excluded agricultural land. Hence, it ensures that banks cannot keep, seize or auction agricultural land in case of default in agricultural loan.According to sources, the land owners avail the bank loans but are not interested in paying it back. With political parties choosing farm loan waiver for electoral gains, these land owners wait for this benefit to be announced. Moreover, there are middlemen who know the trick to facilitate agriculture loans from banks and they do it on a 50:50 sharing basis. The land owners do not mind sharing the loan as they do not have to repay it or lose their land.More than the original land owners, who are distancing themselves from agricultural activities due to lack of adequate workforce, courtesy the State Governments `1 per kg rice scheme, the sharecroppers are into cultivation. With the proposed Land Tenancy Act hanging fire, the sharecroppers, mostly landless, small or marginal farmers, get into verbal agreement with the land owner and have to pay seven to 12 bags of paddy each weighing 75 kg. At times, they take the pain to dispose of the paddy in Market Yard and pay the land owner in cash as per the prevailing minimum support price. However, the truth is that there is no written agreement between land owners and sharecroppers, which deprives the latter of the benefits being rolled out under KCC.Hence, the sharecroppers are forced to depend on non-institutionalised credit as they hardly have enough liquid cash to purchase seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and harvest the crop. With no other income source other than agriculture, crop loss leaves the sharecroppers devastated as they cannot escape from repaying loans to private lenders or settling the dues of the land owner.Sources in the banking industry said just like `1 per kg rice scheme which has hit the rural economy, farm loan waivers are affecting agriculture and the banks. Several States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have written off loans of the farmers in the past. With voters aware that the general elections are slated in 2019, farmers in Odisha are hopeful of yet another round of waiver."

5a531c399855b770e037d61d,"Now that the smog has not cleared, what can be done about it?",https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/voices/now-that-the-smog-has-not-cleared-what-can-be-done-about-it/,2017-11-13,"What Faiz Ahmad Faiz said on the eve of independence Ye daagh daagh ujala, ye shab-gazeeda seher// Wo intezaar tha jiska ye wo seher tau nahi may as well be said about the North Indian cities in winters. Over the past few days, PM2.5 levels in Delhi breached 700-800 micrograms per cubic metre  a level which is hazardous by both WHO and Indian government standards. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in these cities was highest in the world, even clocking maximum level that can be recorded on the scale, i.e. 999. In fact, the smog in Delhi and majority of North Indian cities has reached a level where doctors have suggested evacuation, CMs have ordered shutting of schools, construction has been halted, power plants have been momentarily shut, diesel-generators are banned, cloud seeding is seriously considered, among other such coping but knee-jerk reactions.The primary reason behind this Great North Indian Smog is burning of straw from rice paddy crops by farmers before they begin wheat plantation in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This year the situation worsened on the back of unfavourable weather conditions which have trapped the smog over Delhi and the rest of North India. Measures such as odd-even policy on cars, ban on burning of leaves and garbage and others mentioned above, have had only limited positive impact. As the political bickering begins over this issue, it is time for us to find long-term, low-cost and scalable solutions.It is tempting to draw parallels between Beijings and New Delhis air pollution issue. Both are capitals of the worlds biggest countries that jointly resisted the wests stringent CO2 emission cuts, exemplify shift of economic vibrancy to Asia and are among the worlds largest cities. However, there are fundamental differences between pollution in these two cities. Beijings pollution is fueled by vehicular and factory pollution whereas Indias pollution is mainly driven by stubble burning. Other small factors contributing to pollution in India include emissions from vehicles, industry and construction. Therefore, the solutions that worked in China to an extent cannot be replicated on the ground in India.Instead, India should learn from Singapores handling of its annual haze concern. The Singapore haze problem is an outcome of palm oil plantation burning in Indonesia, mainly in the Sumatra region.Another interesting similarity is how little Singapore can do on its own to prevent this annual curse. Singapore and Indonesia are both part of the ASEAN  Association of South East Nations  a regional association long hailed as the successful model for (sub)-regional cooperation based on minimum common values. Given the conflicts in South-East Asia when ASEAN was conceptualized, one common value jointly agreed upon was non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other ASEAN countries. This value has long been attributed to be the success of ASEAN; but the same ties Singapores hands in bringing Indonesia to table for taking concrete actions.Likewise, in India, the States are answerable to their local constituencies and have limited say in influencing/limiting farmer burning straw of rice fields in other states. In this regard, more solutions should be derived from Singapore than from Chinas example.First, Singapore tried to identify, shame and even penalize private firms burning forests in Indonesia. In the same vein, the Indian government in collaboration with states can identify the key sub-regions within states that are primarily responsible for such mass-scale burning. The local administration and region should be named and shamed to highlight their apathy towards their fellow countrymen. This identification can be done by hot spot mapping and tracking massive land-clearing activities.Second, the states and center need to come together to discuss this issue in detail and create binding solutions. NITI Aayog  in all its effort to foster cooperative federalism  is uniquely placed to convene all the concerned stakeholders and initiate evidence-backed discussion. One of the solutions of such a collaboration effort could be to use a challenge method to solicit scalable, cost-effective and innovative solutions to clear farms. The source of such optimism is the successful use of technology to mitigate smog issue in other parts of the world  Hong Kong, Philippines, Mexico and also in China.Third, the states and center can mandate installing screens at major public places and ask television and newspapers to display/publish the air quality index. Singapore being a city state has managed to do the same by managing the dedicated website: www.haze.gov.sg/.This is expected to yield three benefits. First, every state has a set of go-to measures in response to increase in pollution levels. Such information will prevent any catastrophic delay in their response.Second, such a display of information will continue to keep the public and civil society informed and any adverse movement in the index will lead to public pressure on the administration and legislators to get their acts together. Third, in states mainly responsible for crop burning, Delhi and other states should publish information linking how the farm activity in such states is impacting air pollution in their home states. They should also publish the AQI of cities in other developing countries which are still sub-50/100 level. This is bound to increase the empathy, accountability and fellowship in farmer community to limit their farm burning efforts.Fourth, unlike in Singapore, in India the states and central governments can explore the option of buying the crop residue from the farmers and using it as a fuel for Waste-to-Energy (incinerators) plants. These plants have massive fuel requirements and feeding such residue could create a possible win-win situation for all.Fifth, states should use softer elements of nukkad natak, graffiti art, wall paintings, messages on packaging of key agriculture inputs of seeds and fertilizers, radio and television messaging before winter cropping season begins and block-level target of crop residue procurement to limit stubble burning.The above measures will be able to create long-term and sustainable solutions to mitigate this annual smog concern. I would like to end this piece by highlighting two caveats. First, all major cities in the world, at some point of time have faced similar deteriorating air quality concerns and they largely overcame the issue with continued economic growth, technological development and policy perseverance. Second, the measures on controlling vehicular, industrial and construction driven pollution should be continued with as much determination as the overall pollution level cant be ignored. With these measures, Delhi will one day come close to Faizs vision of the future."

The Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to an average reading of 308, even as the city government extended the ban on the entry of trucks till further orders.Officials said light rain is expected on Wednesday, which might intensify the fog but could clear the smog.Delhi has been experiencing dense smog for about a week, forcing the authorities to enforce emergency measures in the National Capital Region.Here are the highlights:9.37pm: Gadkari says electric transportation could ease the situation in Delhi a bit like Nagpur which has 200 electric taxis that are going to swell to 1,000 next month.9.35pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari urges farmers to produce ethanol and biofuel from stubble instead of burning them. These can fuel vehicles including motorbikes on flex engines that will be launched shortly. A tonne of rice straw can produce 430 litres of ethanol, he says.9.33pm: 50% pollution from automobiles in Delhi will be removed after these projects as vehicles from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will not be required to enter Delhi, says Gadkari.9.30pm: Eastern Peripheral Expressway that will be completed by January and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project and other projects worth Rs 40,000 crore to decongest Delhi will contribute significantly in curbing pollution, says Gadkari.9.27pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari says he has written to environment minister Harsh Vardhan to look into Delhis pollution problem and get it studied by experts including international consultants.9.25pm: If vehicles are stopped or converted into electricity, still there is no guarantee that the pollution will stop completely. Climatic changes are also behind it and there is need of a holistic approach, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.22pm: Delhi pollution is not related to only automobile pollution. It is not such a case that the problem of pollution will be solved if odd even is introduced, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.20pm: Union minister Nitin Gadkari says the odd-even car rationing scheme or a ban on automobiles are no solutions to Delhis pollution problem.9.15pm: This year when the people are suffering badly and an accumulated fund of Rs 775 crore lies at its disposal, the Kejriwal government has not found it worth spending on improving the environment, says Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.9.12pm: The AAP government collected Rs 775 crore as environmental cess in the last three years, says Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari.9.10pm: The BJPs Delhi unit accuses the AAP government of failing to act on environment protection despite having ample resources, asks it to share details of spending of the environmental cess.9.08pm: Delhi government notification asks Delhi Traffic Police and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi to prohibit the entry of heavy and medium goods vehicles, except those carrying essential commodities, in the national capital.9.06pm: Delhi government says the ban on the entry of trucks in the national capital has been extended till further orders due to the fluctuating levels of air pollution.9.04pm: We are not relaxing anything as of now. The CPCB task force will meet tomorrow (November 15) and the day after (November 16) and suggest future course of action as drizzle is expected, says CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar.9.02pm: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakar says Delhis air quality may further improve on Wednesday as light rains are expected, which will help in flushing suspended particulates away.9.00pm: Delhi HC says stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana alone cannot be blamed for the poor air quality in the national capital.8.58pm: Delhi HC tells AAP government: Entire city is unable to breathe. Look at your concern in the areas of education and health facility. We want the same for public transport.8.56pm: All the authorities have opined that the major cause for air pollution was vehicles. So the Delhi government should make an effort on war-footing to bring in more buses. Public life has to be protected as Delhi is unable to breathe, says Delhi HC.8.54pm: Delhi HC says if the Delhi governments odd-even scheme is to benefit the people, there is a need for a better public transport facility.8.52pm: Delhi High Court says there is a grave urgency for more buses in the city and the AAP government needs to address it on a war-footing.8.50pm: The IMD has forecast that weather conditions in Delhi NCR are likely to become more favourable for dispersal of pollutants over the next 2-3 days. Hence, air quality is expected to improve further, says environment minister Harsh Vardhan.8.48pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan appreciates the discipline shown by the public. He says the improvement in the air quality was achieved largely due to efforts of various government agencies and voluntary participation by the public.8.45pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan says all government agencies need to maintain the highest level of alertness and continue their efforts to check pollution.8.42pm: Union environment ministry asks all state pollution control boards to intensify action against violators, especially in the industrial and construction sectors, to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR.8.40pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel appeals to farmers not to burn crop residue. For this, the government is providing them equipment on subsidy basis. The fertility of land is also decreasing because of the burning of crop residues as this would cause loss to farmers in the coming days, he says.8.35pm: Action taken against 369 farmers in Fatehabad, against 79 in Hisar, 54 in Jind, 138 in Kaithal, 357 in Karnal, 184 in Kurukshetra, 6 in Panchkula, 40 in Panipat and 301 in Sirsa, says minister Vipul Goel.8.30pm: Haryana minister Vipul Goel says even in Delhi, crop residues were being burnt by farmers, but the Delhi government has not taken any action.8.25pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel says action is being taken against farmers indulging in stubble burning, and at the same time, they are also being sensitised not to burn the stubble.8.22pm: In view of the National Green Tribunal orders, the Haryana government is quite serious in dealing with the issue of pollution, says minister Vipul Goel.8.20pm: In Haryana, cases have been registered against 244 farmers and fines of up to Rs 18.65 lakh have been recovered from 695 farmers, says minister Goel.8.18pm: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board acted against 1,586 farmers across the state to curb air pollution due to stubble burning, the states environment minister Vipul Goel says in Chandigarh.8.15pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel hits out at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, saying he has not taken any such steps but was doing politics in the name of smog and pollution in the capital.8.08pm: Since the winds are coming from Punjab and Haryana with good speed, the pollutant there would first settle due to rains, so the winds entering Delhi would be pure and then speed would disperse the smog here, says Charan Singh of IMD.8.06pm: Charan Singh, chief weather forecast officer at IMD, says there are fair chances of drizzling tonight (Tuesday) or early morning on Wednesday, November 15 in parts of Haryana and Punjab.8.03pm: The major reason for the emergency situation in Delhi was stubble burning. The winds coming from Punjab were carrying pollutants and then there was moisture coming from the east. Both winds collided at low height in Delhi causing smog. We do not see improvement, says Usman Naseem.8.00pm: Delhi is out of emergency but not out of danger. In the coming days by November 16 and 17, the conditions are expected to get better. Unfortunately we are happy even though the air quality is very poor. In many countries there is an emergency-like condition at this air quality which we are cherishing as improvement, says Usman Naseem, researcher at Centre for Science and Environment and member of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).7.31pm: Ban on entry of trucks in Delhi, except those carrying essential goods, extended till further orders due to pollution levels: Delhi govt official.7.25pm: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to ANI: I fail to understand why the Delhi chief minister is trying to force his hand, knowing well that any such discussion would be meaningless and futile.7.15pm: According to latest AQI data, Haryanas Vikas Sadan Gurugram is at 262, Sector16A Faridabad at 240, both fall in Very Unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.7.07pm: The latest AQI data for Delhis Punjabi Bagh is at 262, Dwarka at 244, ITO at 244,Anand Vihar at 287; all fall in Very unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.5.55pm: Delhi government requests NGT to direct neighbouring states to also implement odd-even scheme.5.52pm: Delhi government requests NGT to exempt two-wheelers and women drivers for one year or till 2,000 additional buses are engaged.5.50pm: Delhi government files fresh review petition before NGT in connection with odd-even policy: ANI4.50pm: The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi improves to an average reading of 308, according to CPCB data. However, even at this level, the air quality remains very poor.4.49pm: If electric bus system is introduced in Delhi, it will reduce pollution.

Her family says she had not eaten for five days. The state government is investigating whether the family was denied their monthly quota of cheaper food-grain because Shakina, who was paralysed, could not be present at the ration shop for her fingerprint authentication for Aadhaar.Shakina's husband Mohd Ishaq says they begged the ration shop owner for grains when she was paralysed.The Yogi Adityanath government says its initial inquiries suggest Shakina died of an illness, not starvation.The family alleges that it had been denied ration under the Public Distribution System for November, because Shakina - marked as the head of the family in the ration card - was too unwell to be even taken to the shop in a rickshaw, as she was every month.""My wife died because of hunger. She was very ill. We used to take her there in a rickshaw. This time she was very ill. We begged the Kotedar (ration shop owner), but he said he would not give anything without the biometrics,"" said Mohd Ishaq, Shakina's husband.The ration shop owner insisted that Shakina come for her biometric identification using a fingerprint machine at the ration shop, says the family.The family is entitled to 35 kg of subsidised wheat, rice and sugar each month under the central government-sponsored Antyodaya scheme for the poorest.Seema Tripathi, the official in charge of foodgrain supply in Bareilly, said there is no order to deny food if anyone can't be present to authenticate their biometric data.""We found out through the newspapers. She had an Antyodaya card. We are trying to find out the exact cause of the death. There is no provision of the government that people will be denied rations because of an Aadhaar card. We have alternative systems in place. If the person in whose name the Antyodaya card is cannot go, then there is a provision for other relatives to be given ration,"" Ms Tripathi said. Sources in the local administration also question the starvation allegation because they say Shakina had about Rs 4,000 in her bank account. However, they have no answer to the question of why the ration shop insisted on Aadhaar biometrics to provide their share of food.In September, an 11-year-old girl died crying for ""bhaat, bhaat (rice)"" at her village in Jharkhand, allegedly because her family had been denied ration for not linking it with an Aadhaar ID. The state government ordered that no one should be denied food benefits for want of Aadhaar-linking."

Photo: PTINew Delhi: Thousands of farmers protested in Indias capital, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts, underscoring the challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces before elections in his home turf Gujarat next month and nationally in 2019.Representatives from 184 farmer organizations squatted on a road leading to the parliament building in the heart of New Delhi, demanding a nationwide waiver of crop loans on the lines announced by some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, higher prices for their produce and lowering seeds and fertilizer costs.The protest is the latest challenge for Modi who promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and ensure a 50% profit over the cost of production. The number of farmers committing suicides climbed about 42% to 8,007 in 2015 from a year earlier, according to a farm ministry statement in parliament in February.I am struggling to take care of my family and considering the current situation, I dont think I can get out of this mess without any help from the government, said Jayesh Bhai Hurabhai, a farmer from Gujarat. We have come here with a lot of hope as farmers from all parts of the country have joined hands this time to protest.Some farmers travelled for more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from different parts of the country to reach New Delhi to participate in the two-day protest that ended on Tuesday. As many as 300 widows of farmers who have committed suicides in the past years due to high farm loans also took part in the protest, with some holding placards that read Farmers are Robbed.Dwindling incomesAbout 800 million people of Indias 1.3 billion depend directly or indirectly on farming, with agriculture accounting for about 16% of the economy. The country is the worlds top grower of cotton and the second-biggest producer of wheat, rice and sugar.The farming community is agitated over falling food prices and high debt levels. Bumper harvests, boosted by a normal monsoon last year after back-to-back droughts and good rain this year, have hurt prices of crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Depressed prices, combined with poor arrangements for government-assured purchases, have triggered these protests.I have heard that the country is becoming prosperous. But what am I getting out of it?, said Pintu Patil, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. Rising input costs and household expenses are making it difficult to manage a seven-member family with an annual income of just about Rs2 lakh, he said.Indian farmers are likely to fetch about Rs36,000 crore less this crop season due to lower market prices of top seven commodities, including paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and some pulses, than what they would have received by selling at government-set minimum purchase prices, according to All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Minimum support prices for cotton, paddy and sugar cane have risen between 7% and 16% in the year ending in March 2018 from the start of 2014-15 when Modi came to power, according to government data.The government procurement agencies, which are mandated to purchase some agricultural commodities at fixed rates to support prices and supply to the government for its welfare programs, buy only a small portion of a commoditys total output, leaving million of farmers across the country to sell at the market-determined levels.

When cultivated, the land, which is around 10.3% of the area used for food crops in the state, is expected to increase Goas agricultural production.Satisfied with the project, the bureau now plans to conduct a similar exercise in other parts of the country, including Maharashtra After the project got sanctioned in 2015, a special task force of the bureau constituted in Nagpur carried out an extensive study for one-and-a-half years using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the bureaus report Characterization and mapping of land resource of Goa submitted this year, the Goa government is planning to introduce contract and organic farming to boost the states farmers and overall agricultural produce.The identified fallow land area is part of the khajan land (lying between the sea and the hills). This is an area which time and again is affected by seawater and fresh water of Mandovi and Zuari rivers draining the state from hills to the coast. Khajan land is considered as the best potential area for rice cultivation but currently is not being used by the farmers to its full potential, said Surendra Kumar Singh , the director of NBSS&LUP.As per the mapping, most of the fallow land lie in Tiswadi, Bardez and Salcette talukas of the state.Singh added that the land is affected by extensive erosion taking place due to the two rivers. The productivity of these lands has also declined due to flow of sediments from mining, he said.During the release of the report on December 5, which was also the World Soil Day, Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar announced that introducing contract farming in fallow lands will increase the states agricultural production and double farmers income by 2022.For this, the bureau is also preparing a land use plan. For contract farming, the government will be calling corporate investors. The contractor, will raise the crops and also provide employment to landless farmers, added Singh.Now, the bureau envisages to investigate and map fallow lands in different parts of the country. There is a lot of potential in North-Eastern states, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and many other places. With good data and management plan, fallow lands could be used to expand land for agriculture purposes, said Singh.Recently, the bureau had prepared a geo-spatial digital map identifying areas holding high potential for organic farming in the country."

The local labourers are unable to do the work as their physical structure cannot withstand the work required for paddy plantation, he added. Another farmer K Sai Reddy said that demand for labourers per day is increasing in every village and even small farmers are seeking them for cultivating paddy.

How green is the green here, in faraway Tamil Nadu, for the migrant labourers?On the occasion of International Migrants Day, to commemorate the Universal Declaration of Migrants Rights that was adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly of United Nations in 2000, a few migrant workers in the construction, hotel and spinning mill industries in Madurai district shared their experiences with Express.Nithesh (23), who is a cook in a hotel, said, I belong to a remote village in West Bengal and have been working here for the past three years. Nearly 100 people from our village came here looking for work. We are all illiterate and could not find jobs in our home States.How did they land up here in Madurai? We can cook Chinese items that seem to be in great demand in the hotels in Madurai. There are agents who brought us here. In fact, in every village, there are agents who offer us work outside our home base. They promise to get us jobs that will get us Rs 15,000 a month. Of course, the salary would vary, depending on the work. The agent will receive the salary and deduct 50 per cent as his commission. The arrangement may vary from agent to agent. Basically, there is no connection between the hotel employer and us, said Nithesh.About the working conditions, Nitesh said, From morning till the hotel is closed, we need to remain standing. Every day, I go to home with severe leg pain. I get a maximum of Rs 10,000 as monthly salary. I send Rs 8000 to my parents every month. I use the remaining amount for my expenses in the temple city.Accommodation is usually provided by the employer, continued Nithesh. Those working in the same hotel usually stay in one house together. We are given one months leave every year and we go to our native place. Those who work as cleaners and servers get very poor salaries, around Rs 3,000 a month. We dont get other benefits like Provident Fund, bonus and insurance. Though we have problems of language, discrimination, and poor working conditions, we take the job since it is helping our families get three meals a day.Lakshmi (18), a spinning mill worker in Madurai district, said, I come from a small village in Bihar. I am the first of five daughters. My father was an agriculture daily wage labourer. I dont have mother. About a year back, my father met with an accident and could not continue working. I took over earning for the family. I could not find any decent job in our village as I am uneducated. Nearly 80 girls in the 15 to 23 age group came here to work.I came with them. For the past eight months, I have been working here. The company has given us accommodation within the premises. They provide ration rice and some grocery, but they are not of good quality. There is no specific working time. We have to report to work whenever the supervisor calls us. Every month, we get Rs 3,000 as salary. We send Rs 2,000 home. We do not know the exact salary that we get and whether and how much the agents take.Sharma (35), a construction worker, had a similar tale to share. About 1000 workers from Uttar Pradesh came here with our families. We used to stay in a hut near the construction site. There were just no basic facilities. We do all sorts of work. If the employer paid the local labourer Rs 500 a day, we would get only Rs 400. Out of this around Rs 150 would go as commission to the agent, he narrated.Speaking to Express, K L Kumar, President, Madurai District Hotels Association, said, The agents supply labourers from the other states. They are in charge of everything. Nearly 10,000 migrant workers are employed in various positions in Madurai district hotels. We ask for their identity proof and share their details with the local police.We do not pay any commission to the agent. We hand over the salaries to the agents. Workers give a share to them. Depending on the nature of the work we pay the workers.But there are some other issues. Some mischief making, taking small amounts of cash from the cash counter and so on. If it happens, we approach the agent who arranges for a replacement. The agent takes care even when a worker goes on leave and we need a temporary replacement, explained Kumar."

Paul, then head of the paediatrics department at AIIMS, submitted its report.""The recommendations are unlikely to be accepted. The suggestion of reducing the cereal content may be politically upsetting,"" a top official source said.A meal for students of primary classes (I-V) now contains 5gm of ghee or oil. For upper primary students (Classes VI-VIII) the ghee or oil content is 7.5gm.Besides, each meal includes 100gm of rice or wheat for primary students and 150gm for upper primary students, apart from vegetables and pulses.The panel, set up in July 2015 to suggest changes to improve a meal's nutritional value, recommended reducing the food grain content to 90gm for primary students and 125gm for upper primary students. It found that children were often unable to finish the rice and wheat they are served.The proposed changes would have led to an increase in the cost of each meal from Rs 4.13 to Rs 6.18 at the primary level and from Rs 5.88 to Rs 8.88 at the upper primary level.Ten crore children in 11.5 lakh government and aided schools are served midday meals every day.Dr Abhay Bang, a public health expert and chairperson of the Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health that works in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra, supported the Paul committee's recommendations.Bang said 5gm of oil for 100gm of rice or wheat created an imbalanced diet. Rice and wheat don't have protein, so the oil content should be increased, he said.""If there is less fat content, the food is not palatable and the child cannot finish it. The committee's recommendations were in the right direction,"" Bang added.Food rights activist Ashok Rao quoted from a study to say that 82 per cent of schoolchildren in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, came to school on an empty stomach and felt sleepy after a rice- or wheat-based meal.""It affects their cognitive development. The government should rather divide the meal into some snack in the morning and a light meal in the afternoon. For that, the government's approach must change,"" Rao said.He said 46 per cent of children suffered from malnutrition, while 30 per cent of girls were anaemic, and argued for flexibility to serve cereals like millets to suit local tastes or other food items."

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: The central government, in consultation with states, proposes to launch a new price support scheme for farmers to prevent distress sales at prices below the minimum support price (MSP).Under the proposed market assurance scheme, states will be free to procure all crops from farmers for which MSPs are announced, except rice and wheat, which are already being procured by the centre for the public distribution system.Under the new scheme, the centre will compensate states for any losses capped at 30% of the procurement cost. It will be the states responsibility to dispose of the procured crops.The proposed scheme will ensure an assured price for the farmer, mitigating the price risks faced by farmers after harvest. Together with a prolonged spell of inadequate rains and two years of drought it has contributed towards rural distress.If successful, it will also politically benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), though it could place fiscal pressures on the Union government; in the just-concluded assembly election in Gujarat, one reason contributing to the BJPs less than usual performance was farmer angst triggered by rural distress.The system, as it exists now, under which only rice, wheat and small quantities of pulses and oilseeds are procured by the centre, leaves much to be desired, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by Mint. The new scheme proposes to strengthen the procurement mechanism to ensure that farmers do not suffer from marketing inefficiencies, as commonly reflected in the prices ruling lower than notified MSP for many commodities, it said.States will take ownership of the scheme, including which crop to procure and in what quantities, when wholesale prices drop below MSPs. State governments will be free to use the procured crops for targeted nutrition-support programmes such as mid-day meals for schoolchildren, or sell them in the open market.We have written to states to elicit their opinion on the scheme, and if they are interested we will launch the scheme, said a senior official at the agriculture ministry who declined to be named. According to this official, the letter to states was sent more than a month ago.The proposed scheme comes against the backdrop of a record harvest of cereals and pulses in 2016-17, which led to wholesale prices plunging below MSPs. The price crash has led to protests by farmer groups across the country since June, with demands for remunerative crop prices and loan waivers. While states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka have announced farm loan waivers that are at different stages of implementation, states like Madhya Pradesh have launched their own price support schemes for farmers growing pulses and oilseeds.Experts welcomed the move, but cautioned that it was at best a stopgap measure and that the eventual solution was to bring in greater competition in agricultural markets by dismantling existing cartels.While any intervention and attention to agriculture marketing is welcome, we must await full details of the scheme to make any specific comments, said Pravesh Sharma, farm expert and a visiting fellow at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. However, it can be generally observed that government does not seem to risk spending political capital to directly take on poorly functioning agriculture markets, where lack of competition, cartelization and opaque price discovery are the root causes of price distortions.Spending public money may be necessary in some instances, but the larger goal of reforming agricultural markets should not be lost sight of, he added."

Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."
5a53a4e99855b770e0381bbf,Arsenic poisoning is spreading. We need drastic steps to tackle it,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/arsenic-poisoning-is-spreading-we-need-drastic-steps-to-tackle-it/story-j9UyOujE9izHfaTWvVy9fP.html,2017-12-27,"In a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the Union ministry of water resources said 239 million people across 153 districts in 21 states drink water that contains high levels of arsenic.Thats around a fifth of the countrys population, and by any standards, thats an appalling statistic.The actual number could be higher. India pegs arsenic concentrations above 50 parts per billion as harmful; in the US, it is 10 parts per billion. Arsenic is one of the 10 chemicals classified as a public health concern by the World Health Organization; it slowly poisons the body, potentially causing skin lesions, damage to the peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal ailments, diabetes, renal (kidney) failure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At least half the people who were known to be at risk of arsenic contamination live in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh and India (across the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh).Groundwater contamination, Indias hidden crisisThe number of habitations affected by arsenic in India has increased from 3,728 in 2012-13 to 7,535 in 2015-16. This is because of the overuse of groundwater for irrigation and drinking. Arsenic previously occurred in a harmless insoluble conjugate with iron called arsenopyrite. Overuse has split this compound, contaminating groundwater with a soluble ionic form of arsenic. Over-exploitation of groundwater started in India in the 1970s when millions of tube wells were installed in the Ganga delta to prevent diarrhoea from surface water sources such as tanks, ponds and open wells. Today, India has over 30 million groundwater extraction points.Groundwater is also used for irrigation. This means arsenic poisoning affects not just the people of the area but also those who consume the produce of the affected region. In food, rice has the highest sensitivity to arsenic followed by vegetables. In most arsenic-affected states rice is the staple.Despite the crisis, groundwater contamination , either by arsenic or other pollutants such as fluorides, does not get the attention it deserves, especially when compared to surface water contamination because the latter is visible. Moreover, there is no law yet to check groundwater withdrawal.This severe environmental-health crisis has to be contained quickly before it can expand. Along with periodic testing of water in affected areas and individualised testing of each hand pump or tubewell (marking it as safe/unsafe), it is important to encourage people to opt for low-cost, local solutions such as rainwater harvesting that can ensure clean drinking water. States such as Bihar have set up filtration units but the maintenance of filters has always been a problem.This needs to be addressed. Additionally, governments have to curb the use of groundwater and keep a strict control on agricultural and industrial effluents that pollute aquifers that recharge groundwater."

He also said the family of rice mill owner Ravinder Kochhar, who was gunned down by gangsters in July, migrated abroad after selling their property. He said there is a fear psychosis in the minds of people, particularly businessmen who were being targeted by extortionists.The Akali leader said the situation was worsened by the visit of UP mUttar Pradesh alleged gangster Raja Bhaiya to Faridkot. He said that Raja was hosted by local Congress legislator Kushaldeep Dhillon who even boasted about the same on his facebook page. Romana demanded the reason behind Rajas visit to Faridkot should be verified along with a thorough probe into who all he met during this visit but the Congress government refused to do anything in the matter."
