58f4d19360de470aa339c273,Lives touched with extraordinary passion,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160101/jsp/nation/story_61559.jsp,2016-01-01,"HAND THAT FEEDS G.C. Shekhar in Chennai Picture: Arun Shanker Just before six in the morning, one corner of Pycrofts Road in Triplicane, central Chennai, wakes to the bustle of traffic and the tea stalls. But to one man waiting on the terrace of a two-storey building, its already breakfast time for his 3,000 friends. For the past hour, C. Sekar had been placing clumps of boiled rice, washed in water, on a dozen wooden planks. He inspects his work, washes his hands and steps back into the narrow staircase. Dont worry, theyll be here any minute, the 62-year-old says. As if on cue, a flurry of green wings arrives, screeching. A few at first, then a dozen more, till there are hundreds of them, as though Chennais entire parrot population has invaded Sekars home. For the next one hour, its a wavy sea of green on the terrace, broken at the edges by the black of a few pigeons, outnumbered in their own backyard. The parrots line up on the mesh of TV cables and eye the terrace gingerly before dropping onto the planks.As one batch finishes, another flies in amid an incessant cacophony of parrot talk. The occasional bus horn or vroom of a motorbike sends them into a brief tizzy before they land back on the planks. One hour later, the last of the parrots flies out, leaving behind the handful of local pigeons. Theyll be back at five in the evening for dinner, Sekar says. I tried counting them along with a few college students, and our estimate is that we get about 3,000 parrots a day. The love affair began in December 2004, a few days after the tsunami, when Sekar spotted a few parrots on his terrace. He threw a handful of grains at them and found they were only too happy to polish them off. I realised they were unable to find food, so I kept some rice ready next evening only to see more birds arriving. Their numbers kept increasing and they began arriving in the morning as well, expecting me to feed them twice a day. Sekar, who repairs cameras and has a collection of over 4,000 vintage cameras and accessories, some as old as 200 years, uses up 60kg of boiled rice every day, which comes to Rs 600 a day. Initially, all the money came out of my own pocket but seeing my dedication, several nature lovers now contribute every month. So my personal expense is only Rs 12,000 a month. A local trader supplies the rice at wholesale rates, Sekar says. A wildlife official who visited him after hearing about the parrots has told him the birds come from a national park near the IIT, from the Theosophical Societys large gardens and from a few cemeteries. He said the parrots do not fly more than 10km for food and are happy to find a regular feeding spot on my terrace.The routine means Sekar has rarely stepped out of Chennai these last 11 years. He left on his latest outstation visit, to a relatives wedding, after laying the breakfast spread in the night and returned before evening. A few of his neighbours tried to copy Sekar by laying out the same rice breakfast but the parrots simply ignored them. I gave up after a few days as the parrots preferred Sekars food to mine, said Shyam Das, who sells automobile spares and lives two streets away. Still, Sekar has to watch his friends eat from the staircase: They are wild creatures, you see  theyd fly away as soon as they see anyone on the terrace. The pictures had to be taken with a remote camera or from another terrace, hiding behind a cloak. During the recent floods, the number of parrots nearly doubled to 5,000 as they couldnt find food elsewhere, says Sekar. Every shower washed the rice away and Sekar, wearing a raincoat, kept replenishing the planks. This went on for almost 10 hours during non-stop rain on December 1. Sekar cant think of life without the parrots. Im willing to give away my camera collection to a museum; Ill be happy to spend the rest of my life feeding the parrots. What will happen to the birds after him? They found me, Im sure theyll find another like me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MAN O SCRIPTS Muzaffar Raina in Srinagar Picture: Muzaffar Raina When hundreds of his peers from Srinagars old city were trotting across the Line of Control to receive arms training a quarter century ago, a young Manzoor Ahmad Daikoo was keeping alive a legacy often associated with the Valleys fleeing Pandits. He was collecting rare manuscripts, some over a millennium old, that were getting lost to the mayhem following theadvent of militancy. I have more than 11,000 manuscripts, more than the state archives department has and perhaps the largest individual collection in north India, Daikoo, now 50, says. He calls the collection, stacked in racks and gunny bags at his home in suburban Nishat, the Kashmir Research Institute. Sure enough, it keeps attracting scholars from across the country and abroad. Many of my manuscripts are from unknown authors and without a second copy. Many are original, unpublished scripts, Daikoo says. Ive manuscripts written on paper, birch bark and even cloth.... They can buy me a fortune but Ill never sell them.Daikoo has what his mentor Triloki Nath Ganjoo, former Sanskrit professor at Kashmir University and a Shaivism expert, avers is a rare complete manuscript of the famed Kathasaritsagar, a 10th-century collection of stories. Most of the manuscripts are in the Sharda Lipi, the ancient script for Kashmiri and Sanskrit writing, or Persian.I also have manuscripts in Kashmiri (in the calligraphic Nastaliq script), Punjabi, Hindi and English.... I have pieces written with fingernails, called khat-e-nakhoon, an ancient art, Daikoo says. He explains that these were written without ink, by using specially pruned and nurtured fingernails as styluses to make fine grooves on paper that last centuries. I have a couple of manuscripts of nail-written religious literature in Sharda, around 300 years old. They are among my most prized possessions. What inspired Daikoo? Like many others in the Valley, mostly the Pandits, he had inherited a collection of manuscripts from his forefathers. When the Pandits migrated, many left behind their valuable collections, much of which was in danger of falling into the hands of thieves. Besides, the security forces, in their hunt for subversive writing, were questioning people over every piece of literature they possessed, prompting many to destroy their manuscripts. Even my uncle dumped a bag of scrolls once in the Jhelum to save his skin and mine, Daikoo says. That motivated me to do all I could to preserve these documents. I tried to convince whoever would listen that they were precious. I started buying as many as I could. He says he has travelled to Hyderabad, Badaun and Punjab to procure parts of his collection. But most of it was from Kashmir, covering aspects of Kashmiri life ancient and modern, from history, philosophy and religion to politics, literature and medicine. Many are about Kashmiri Shaivism or Trikishastra as it is called. There are translations of the Ramayan and the Mahabharat in Persian. One book shows how much our ancestors knew about the veterinary sciences. He says he has unpublished writing by Urdu poets from the last century, such as Brij Narain Chakbast and Nand Lal Farsi. Daikoo, who translates oriental literature for a living, had inherited large tracts of land, some of which he sold  he says they would fetch crores at current prices  to buy the manuscripts. Ganjoo says Kashmirs rich tradition of writing grew partly from its cold winters when many would sit indoors and write. He said there were 30 lakh Sharda manuscripts across the world, much of it taken away by western scholars during British rule. Daikoo also has thousands of books, administrative orders and key documents of past regimes, and old photographs, coins and newspapers. He says he never received any assistance. Only once I received preservatives worth Rs 1.6 lakh from the government. Most of his collection is therefore poorly preserved, stacked in gunny bags and easy prey for termites. Preserving them scientifically costs a lot. I approached the state government but it offered no help, he says.Nor did the Centres director of manuscriptology when Ganjoo met him, he says. Only 3,500 of Daikoos manuscripts are catalogued. You need experts to do that and you have to pay them. I spent Rs 2.6 lakh on cataloguing; I couldnt afford more, he says. He is saving up to build a preservation chamber on his lawns. It will take me Rs 30 lakh to build but I shall be better able to preserve them, he signs off. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FACE OF SCARRED MEMORIES Muzaffar Raina in Chahal, Baramulla When human rights activist Khurram Parvez wants to put a face to Kashmirs disappeared youths, he thinks of a very wrinkled one. Its the face of Baramulla farmer Atta Mohammad Khan, 82, who Khurram says is the only man in the Valley ready to declare he has buried nameless dead brought by the security forces  all 235 of them. Rights groups that estimate 8,000 men went missing in custody  the state says the number is far lower  want an international probe to find out who are buried in the unmarked graves. They claim to have found 2,700 unmarked graves containing more than 2,943 bodies in three of the Valleys 10 districts alone: Bandipora, Baramulla and Kupwara. Khan was the only gravedigger who came forward to speak about these graves and thus became the face of that expose. He said that at the most he could get killed, said Khurram, coordinator of the J&K Coalition of CivilSociety. I have buried some 235 people there (the local graveyard), Khan acknowledged at his ramshackle home in Chahal village, 80km from Srinagar. He gave them a proper burial, after conducting a funeral, when the security forces came from nearby camps with bodies and asked the village to bury them  a common occurrence across the Valley during the height of militancy.Khan volunteered because none else would, fearing trouble from either the forces or the militants. That was from 2002 till 2006, before the graveyard ran out of room. Manzor Ahmad points to one of the graves. Pictures: Muzaffar Raina Now Khan is bedridden with multiple ailments and his memory is almost gone. But one thing he doesnt forget is to keep reminding his son Manzoor Ahmad to take care of the graveyard. One of those buried at the graveyard was a six-month-old girl. I remember the army saying she was killed in crossfire. Nobody has ever come looking for her, Manzoor said. If that was one of the most heartbreaking sights Khan had to see, he was spared another. When the forces brought the body of his nephew Mohammad Salim one day, Khan was not home and, for once, somebody else buried him, Manzoor said. Later, when we checked the photograph (clicked by the police), he turned out to be a cousin of mine. He was not a militant but had been missing for a year or so. Khan, despite his failing eyesight and memory, tried to remember the appearances of the bodies he had buried so he could later help families who came looking for missing loved ones. Around half a dozen of the graves now have tombstones with names inscribed on them. My father helped identify them, Manzoor said. Some of them, possibly, were militants and some were not. Manzoor said the burials affected his fathers health over the years. I would help him bury these bodies, which were badly mutilated and in many cases defaced, he said. Every burial would leave him deeply disturbed and haunted by bad dreams for days. After the rights groups came out with a report titled Buried Evidence in 2009, with Khan the sole gravedigger who testified, the forces came looking for him and asked troubling questions. We faced harassment but were not harmed, Manzoor said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TURNING A CORNER Nishit Dholabhai in New Delhi Good morning, sir, the cabbie says in English. His accent, body language and ease of manner suggest a college education. Er, how far did you study? I ask hesitantly, wondering if he might see it as unwarranted curiosity. Well, I have a degree in civil engineering, he says after a moments pause and bursts out laughing. I join him, in disbelief and surprise. Ramit Arora, 29, had sometime in 2012 decided that signing up with Ola Cabs made better sense than sticking to his Rs 10,000-a-month construction supervisors job with realtor Gaursons India Limited in Ghaziabad. Id learnt by word of mouth how much they earned, the Ghaziabad businessmans son who graduated from a private engineering college in Meerut said, changing gears as he tackled the evening traffic at Mandi House, New Delhi. So, borrowing a little from friends, he bought a car. Today, he says, he works over 12 hours a day and earns at least Rs 90,000 a month. Ramit explained he had to pay Ola a portion of the fare, which rises sharply during the peak hours  6am to 11am and 4pm till late evening (a 25km ride in Delhi between 4.30pm and 6pm on December 6 cost me Rs 478). But the key is the incentive of Rs 225 per trip that Ola pays him during the peak hours  to pre-empt attrition in a fiercely competitive taxi-hailing industry. I hardly have to wait 10 minutes between two trips, said Ramit, looking smart in his Ola uniform  white linen kurtas with shoulder straps and matching jootis. But the road to prosperity offered a few tricky turns. First, the family found his new profession demeaning. When his sister, a lawyer, got married Ramit told his family he had hired a driver for his cab  just to spare them embarrassment before the in-laws. Harder to handle has been the condescending attitude of some of the passengers, who would address him with a tu and often speak disrespectfully. One afternoon there were some extremely impolite passengers; I dropped them halfway, near another cab, with folded hands and said I didnt want the fare, Ramit said. The company told me my ratings (which Ola seeks religiously from the passengers) would drop but I said I cant compromise on self-respect. Aprameya Radhakrishna, who founded TaxiForSure with Raghunandan G. before selling the company to Ola, said the average monthly income of a cabbie attached to a taxi-aggregating company was Rs 50,000. Theres a social mobility, with even students working as part-time drivers, he told The Telegraph. But Radhakrishna warned that Ramit and his peers might be enjoying a first-mover advantage that might not last. As the taxi-hailing industry grows  estimates suggest a combined fleet of 300,000 taxis in major Indian cities  only a handful of competitors would be left standing and the fares would rise while the incentives for drivers fell, he said. Ramit, whose father runs a wholesale grocery business in Uttar Pradesh, has inspired a cousin, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering, to become an Ola driver too. Ive been driving a cab for two years but my family doesnt know. Ill tell them once I buy a second car and hire a driver  that will raise my status, said the young man, who earlier worked in the machine tools department of a well-known gear company near Delhi. He asked that his name not be revealed lest it interfere with his marriage prospects. Ramit ducked a query about his marriage plans, smiling and saying he needed to save money first. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A LONG INNINGS Piyush Srivastava in Muzaffarnagar Pictures: Naeem Ansari When a young Vijay Singh walked out to bat  stage a dharna outside the Muzaffarnagar collectors office, actually  P.V. Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister and Sourav Ganguly a mere Test hopeful. Almost 20 years from that day  February 26, 1996  the frail-looking 54-year-old is still at the crease, on the same dharna, protesting large-scale land grab in his village of Chausana, 73km away. Thats nearly two decades spent non-stop on the roadside in rain and shine, 44C summer to 5C winter, protected by a canvas tent, surviving on roti and vegetables he cooked on a brick chulha and then a kerosene stove, leaving his post only to use the nearest public toilet. Except that one time the ex-schoolmaster had to visit Chausana when his father died in 2002. And, oh, that other time in 2006 when he had to be taken to hospital after suffering a mild heart attack. A few things have changed since last year, though. A sympathetic administration has allowed him to shift to an unused veranda inside the collectorate premises, where he has set up home with three plastic curtains. And he has an LPG cylinder, provided by an admirer. Masterji, enough is enough, go home now, a fresh-faced additional district magistrate would tell him now and then. Only after you meet my demands, would be the instant reply out of the 5-foot-7, 65kg frame. The DMs dont talk to him: he has seen off 23 of them, including a few who tried to browbeat him. Nowadays he sometimes leaves the spot to speak on human rights at school functions. Masterji has become part of Muzaffarnagars lore. The hawkers give him Hindi newspapers for free every morning. His handful of fans now contribute Rs 2,500 every month, so hes stopped accepting the money that his nearly estranged family of well-to-do farmers used to send through acquaintances. Singhs wife Pushpa, whom he left to bring up three young children all by herself, and son Gopal, a 21-year-old BSc student, look after their 23-bigha land, which grows sugarcane, paddy and wheat. Daughters Kalpana, 25, and Sakshi, 23, are doing MSc and BEd, respectively. Initially, my wife would call me a godly character because I was fighting for others. But after the first four-five years she began objecting. Now they all think Im crazy, Singh rued. Gopal and Kalpana accuse their father of being uncaring and doing nothing for them. The son last visited him three years ago but his daughters sometimes call him. In Singhs conservative boondocks, his wife isnt expected to travel and meet him in public. Does he feel guilty about abandoning them? Occasionally, yes, but he believes the cause is bigger. A boys cry It wasnt Singhs plots the mafia grabbed but 4,000 bighas of the government-owned gram sabha land, leased to Chausanas landless to grow food. Since 1982, when he was 21 and had just begun teaching economics and civics at the village school, Singh had been writing these victims applications and accompanying them to the collectorate. My life changed on a February evening in 1996 when, on my way home from school, I overheard an eight-year-old begging his mother for roti. She had none to give because the familys plot had been snatched, he said. I wept through the night. While there was so much fertile land, a child was sleeping hungry. I decided to quit my job and take up this fight, but I hadnt the foggiest that it would stretch 20 years. Within days, he had pitched his tent at the dharna sthal, a designated place for protests just outside the collectorate gates  a feature in many Uttar Pradesh districts. As a rich landowner, he could have led a comfortable life but chose to fight for others. Thats why we respect him, said Devraj Panwar, the man who provides the LPG cylinders. It was here that Singh had felt chest pain one day nine years ago. I had the phone number of the then city magistrate, V.K. Singh, whom I somehow managed to call from my mobile. He came and took me to hospital, Singh said. Nowadays, when I occasionally catch a fever, I can go to any doctor in town. They all know me and never ask for fees. We know his struggle is genuine but the land mafia have political patronage, said a district official, pleading anonymity because chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is seized of the matter. Singh had undertaken a 19-day, 610km padayatra to Lucknow and met Akhilesh on April 28, 2012. Akhilesh ordered a probe, which helped free 300 of the 4,000 bighas the same year. But progress has stalled again. Appreciation has been coming, though, with the Limca Book of Records in 2011 declaring Singhs protest the longest continuous one-man agitation in the country and the India Book of Records honouring him for his non-political, non-violent satyagraha the following year. What if he achieves his end some day, will he go back home? A shadow crosses Singhs face. I dont know if I can, he says. Since most of the land-grabbers are my fellow Thakurs, I fear ostracism if I return to Chausana. Besides, my familys alienated from me. So will he spend the rest of his life on this veranda? Havent thought about that yet, he replies slowly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INSULT TO CRUSADE Basant Rawat in Rangpar Picture: Basant Rawat Ratna Ala couldnt see their faces but the mocking laughter rang in his ears. What use is information for a blind man? Get lost, son, the sarpanch said to a chorus of guffaws. That moment changed the now 39-year-old Alas life, turning a mild-mannered, disabled herdsman in Kathiawad into a Right to Information crusader feared by the mafia and corrupt officials alike. This was sometime in 2007. Ala had been listening to a radio programme on the RTI Act, enforced since October 2005, and was impressed. Why dont I do something about my problem? he thought. So he turned up at the local panchayat office in Rangpar, 40km from Rajkot, to ask why they werent repairing the rutted village road he was finding difficult to negotiate. Their rudeness deeply disturbed me. But it made me think, Ala told this newspaper. He wondered how much a man who could only read Braille do. Ala had lost his father at 15 and studied till Class X with help from a philanthropic organisation. So, when he learnt about the RTI helpline run by the Ahmedabad-based NGO Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel, the first question he asked Pangti Jog, one of its officials, was: Can a blind man file an RTI plea? Of course, why not? she assured him before teaching him how to draft an RTI application. Since then, Ala has been unstoppable. The reply to his first RTI query told him the village road had been repaired twice in the past two years. On paper, that is. Ala got a local newspaper in Rajkot, 40km away, to publish the story, and the road was repaired soon. The same year, 2007, Ala prevented 281 acres of village pastures from being illegally handed over to a clock factory by local officials. In 2010, he exposed Rangpars incorrect voter list braving threats from a political group that thrived on bogus voting. A friend told me that when he went to correct his name on the voter list, he saw many names without photographs, Ala said. His RTI plea revealed that the rolls carried the names of 35 who had left the village and 10 who had died. A grateful Rangpar fielded him as a peoples candidate in the local polls three years ago and elected him its deputy sarpanch unopposed, sending him to the office from where he had returned insulted five years earlier. He then found out that the mining mafia was scooping out moram, a soft gravel, from village grazing land at night.They had political patronage and tried all kinds of tactics, he said. Some people came to my home in my absence and warned my wife Ila that since both of us are blind, they would eliminate us and nobody would be the wiser. Like the former sarpanch, they would soon learn that abusing his blindness only helped stiffen Alas resolve. So they tried a new tack, offering to build Ala a two-storey house. My fight goes on, the 12-bigha owner said in the two-room thatched house he shares with Ila and school-going sons Ajay and Ashish, a few yards from a polished village road that stands witness to how Ala humbled the scoffers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THUMBS-UP TO LIFE Ananthakrishnan G in Kochi Sometimes, asking the wrong question can lead to a right answer. Its perhaps the best lesson little Amrita Antony of Kochi has learnt in school. An anxious query by the Class III girl, heartbroken at a younger mates brain tumour, has triggered a campaign by her school that will help save lives and was highlighted before the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Except that the Prime Minister did not know of Amrita, or teacher Abhilash T. Prathap who found the answer to her query, or the unfortunate Bhavana Lakshmi who had inspired it. Cant we give her a new brain? an anguished Amrita had demanded at the school parliament at St Marys Upper Primary School, Kochi. She had just learnt that Lakshmi, the Class I girl who had stopped coming to school last year, was severely ill even after two brain surgeries. No, what Amrita had asked for was impossible. But it provided to the young Sanskrit teacher Prathap his eureka moment. It was an innocent question from Amrita. Its impact hit us a little later, and the discussion veered to organ donations. Participants wondered what we could do to spread awareness, said headmistress Shajimol K. Thomas. It was then that Prathap suggested the map. It was this colour map of India, printed on a sheet of cloth and covered with white thumb impressions that give it a mottled look, which was sent to Modi with a request to promote organ donations. The 2,500 thumbprints signified 2,500 signatories. Four large pieces of cloth were sewn together for the map, which was displayed as our 400 pupils organised a street play on organ donation on August 11, Prathap said. The onlookers and passers-by gave their thumb impressions. Till now, the school has got 150 adults, including many of its teachers, to actually sign up with an authorised NGO, pledging their organs after their death. Of course, organs can be harvested only from beating-heart cadavers  patients who have suffered brain death while being attached to a ventilator that keeps their hearts and lungs functioning. This is a possibility when death is caused by conditions such as head injury (as in road accidents), stroke or a brain aneurysm. Still, signing up formally means that if any of the 150 are eligible to donate organs after death, their relatives cannot block it. Initially, I was surprised: why a map of India from thumb impressions? Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat broadcast on October 15, before lauding the schools efforts. When the school celebrated its newfound fame, it invited Lakshmi too. She was happy but didnt seem to understand what it was for, Thomas said. Lakshmi has been advised 30 chemotherapies but the family had to stop after three as she was growing increasingly nauseous. We funded the second surgery in July by mortgaging our house, her father R.S. Moorthy, an auto driver, said.Prathap has his own problems. Like many other teachers in government-aided schools, he and his wife, a fellow Sanskrit teacher in another school, are not paid because the government is yet to recognise their posts. The matter is in court while Prathap, father of a nine-month-old girl, works part-time as a welder and gas-stove repairer to sustain the family. All the while devising new ways of thumbing his nose at adversity, no doubt. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FOR THEM, WORLDS A SCHOOL Nalin Verma in Araria Kerala Public School is hardly a signboard youd expect to see in a north Bihar town, 10km from the Nepal border and 2,500km from the state whose name it bears. Nor would the school have existed in Araria, or drawn the Election Commissions attention during this years polls, if gun-toting Naga militants hadnt visited the home of the owners  Bindu and N.J. Shaju  in Assam a decade ago.If thats confusing, first things first. After getting a BA in English in her home district of Wayanad, Bindu had trained as a nurse and joined a hospital in Lumding, Assam, in the late 90s. It was a low-paid job in a small hospital. Id been a good student and wanted to shift to teaching which I loved, Bindu, 40, said. I applied and got a job at Don Bosco School, Lumding, in the year 2000. Her family married her off the same year to Wayanad boy Shaju who, after graduating in English, was running a grocery. He was only too glad to join his wifes school as a fellow teacher. We lived happily. Then the terrorists targeted migrants, Bindu said. Four men brandishing firearms and sickles barged into our home and set us a deadline to leave. Many of the couples relatives and friends from Kerala, working as professionals, teachers and nurses in Lumding, left because of the threat. After several fearful days, we received a call from some of our relatives and friends who were working in southeast Bihars Maoist-hit Jamui-Munger region, where missionaries from Kerala run several educational institutions, Shaju, 43, said. We caught a train to Jamui. But the wages at the private school that recruited them were very low. So they left for Lakhisarai to work at a girls school. Members of the land mafia were on the schools board and fought among themselves. The school was in perennial turmoil: our wages were kept pending for months, Shaju said. So, on to north Bihar and Araria. This time they opened their own school from a rented house. It was 2009.We were given two small rooms at a congested place. The landlord fleeced us, and we didnt attract enough students, barely 15-20, Shaju said. We began looking for another neighbourhood. Picture: Nalin Verma A violent tropical storm that struck in April 2010 and killed 90-odd in north Bihar also left an asbestos-roof house in Ararias Mahadev Chowk devastated. The owner was very generous; he rented it out to us on a nominal rent and asked us to open the school, Shaju said. We had no money; so we removed the debris ourselves and shifted here in 2010. Five years on, Kerala Public School has 320 students including 80 girls and stands as a beacon in a district whose literacy rate of 55.1 per cent trails the national average of 74.04. Of the 15 teachers, 11 are from Kerala. People here believe that teachers from Kerala are better. We too feel a connection because we believe we have something to offer to these backward areas whose new generation wants to study, Shaju said. Literacy is high in Kerala, so is the competition in the field of education. Bihar gave us the chance to follow our passion. The English-medium school, affiliated to the CBSE, draws the children of Ararias middle class and its elite  district officials, Sashastra Seema Bal officers and local businessmen. Bindu said the tuition fee was Rs 450 to Rs 500 a month. Its an extremely good school, an SSB officer averred. My kid is doing well. Shes learnt to speak English. The couples younger son Shabil, 11, lives with them but the elder Shabin, 13, studies in Thiruvananthapuram.The school caught the eye of the election authorities who paraded its students on Ararias streets ahead of the Assembly polls to urge people to vote. District officials and townspeople had perhaps told them what they told this newspaper: that Bindu and Shaju ran Ararias best school."
58f589d9a3d24b0b70c226a6,"Warned of scam, State to decentralise rice procurement",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/warned-of-scam-state-to-decentralise-rice-procurement/article8071223.ece,2016-01-06,"Faced with warnings from its officials on a possible foodgrain scam in the state, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday moved to majorly decentralise its procurement mechanism. A decision was taken to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell to state fair price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from the procurement chain.This has been done by adopting the Centres scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) of foodgrain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and Public Distribution System (PDS). But not all States had switched to it.A finance department report forwarded to the State Food and Civil Supplies Department last month had pointed out major lapses in Maharashtras paddy and rice procurement and warned that a rice scam like the one that occurred in Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was in the making if the millers and the FCI were kept part of the chain any longer. All three States have still kept FCI as part of the procurement chain.Senior officials of the State finance department told The Hindu that a report has been pending approval. The report points out procedural lapses in the existing process, in which paddy procured by the State is sent to a rice mill and the rice is stored in the FCI godowns and later supplied to the PDS shops.The miller was dependent on FCI for verification while he himself was supplying poor quality to pass the verification scrutiny. We had strongly recommended the procedural lapses be corrected earliest, said an official.The State cabinet approved the DPS on Tuesday allowing the State to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers to meet the need of PDS and fair price shops. The scheme will be implemented from March 1, and the responsibility of rolling out the scheme has been left to the State Adivasi Vikas Mahamandal and the State Marketing Federation, and monitoring will be done by district authorities.Under the DCP scheme, the States undertake the responsibility to procure foodgrain, store it scientifically and distribute it through Targeted Public Distribution System.Currently, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala are procuring rice under the decentralised procurement scheme. Due to the decentralised process there has been an increase in procurement of rice in these States, the data shows. The finance departments suggestion has been included in report of the food and civic supplies departments. We have considered those points, reads the note of the cabinet."

After cotton crop failure and losses due to basmati rice price crash in the last kharif season, we were pinning our hopes on a good harvest from wheat, but it looks like the crop could fail and our miseries will continue, said Mr. Bains.Minimum temperatures have been hovering above 2 to 4 degree Celsius above normal at many places in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana during the past few days and are expected to continue to be a little higher than usual for the next few days, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).It will be mostly dry weather prevailing during the next 7 to 10 days across the northern region and parts of central Indian States, said B.P Yadav, weather official at IMD.Yield may be hitCurrently temperatures are on the higher side and wheat needs cold conditions to thrive. Its a crucial period for the crop and if temperatures continue to remain high there would be definitely a yield loss, said P.S Rangi, agriculture expert, adding that rain was also required at this moment."

We receive the second highest number of complaints of bonded labour from Odisha after Uttar Pradesh,"" said Justice D Murugeshan, member of the NHRC, here on Tuesday. He was speaking at a national-level workshop on elimination of bonded labour organised by the NHRC.He said that most of the complaints received from Odisha are regarding the 'bartan' system in which the upper caste employs lower caste families for menial labour jobs for a pittance - as low as 15kg rice a year. ""The 'bartan' system is a major violation of the human rights of a person. Government officers must be sensitive while identifying and rescuing bonded labourers. Rehabilitation of the rescued along with alternate employment is very important so they are not forced to migrate again,"" he added.According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011, Odisha has a total 6,353 bonded labourers of whom 5,413 have been legally freed. Since 2011, a total 1,747 bonded labourers have been identified. The state government has so far rehabilitated 493 bonded labourers and has sought permission from the Centre for rehabilitation of 891 more. The state government and the Centre give Rs 10,000 each to a bonded labourer under the rehabilitation scheme.Senior officers of the state government, representatives of the State Human Rights Commission, voluntary organisations, and representatives of brick kilns, stone crushers and other related industries participated in the day-long workshop.""The objective of the workshop is to familiarize and sensitize district magistrates, sub-divisional magistrates, state labour officers and members of vigilance committees, brick kilns, stone-crushing and other related industries involved in the process of identification, release and rehabilitation of bonded labourers and with the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 and other related legislations,"" said chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi.A large number of people - including from the washermen and barber communities - are still working as bonded labourers in Puri and Cuttack districts. Meanwhile, many rescued bonded labourers in Nuapada and Balangir districts are again migrating due to delay in payment of the assistance money of Rs 20,000 each, alleged organisations working for the uplift of bonded labourers."

Lokur and Justice R.K. Agrawal asked the Union agriculture secretary to hold meetings with counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Chattisgarh to evolve a coordinated strategy to tackle the problem.The bench passed the direction while dealing with a PIL filed by an NGO, Swaraj Abhiyan, through counsel Prashant Bhushan complaining that no proper succour was being provided by most states and Union territories except Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Apart from 5kg of rice/wheat per person every month, the petition said each family should be provided 2kg of dal and at least 1kg of edible oil.The NGO also urged the apex court to ensure that children are provided free milk or eggs under the mid-day meal scheme, so they get adequate protein.Bhushan told the court that under the National Food Security Act, 2013, the government provided 5kg of rice per person per month only to BPL households.Bhushan pointed out that the rural job scheme provided guaranteed employment for only 100 days to a rural household. He pleaded that the number of days be increased to 150 to tackle the drought crisis.Solicitor-general Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Centre, said that since data relating to rainfall and drought relief were with the states, he needed time to collate it for placing it before the bench.According to Kumar, the Centre had earmarked Rs 61,200 crore under the state disaster response fund for the five-year period of 2015-2020. It was for the states and Union territories to utilise the funds effectively, he added.Justice Lokur, heading the bench, then asked the states concerned to consider the measures suggested by the NGO when their representatives meet the Union agriculture secretary."

It would be Modi's second visit to the state in a month after he inaugurates the Paradip oil refinery of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) on February 7.Addressing a news conference here, Singh vied for PM's special love for the eastern state while announcing the PM's rally plan for Bargarh, two weeks after he addresses a meeting in Paradip. Modi would be felicitated for his pro-farmer initiatives at the Kishan Mahasammelan. He will interact with farmers to understand their problems apart from sharing the government's landmark initiatives for the farm sector, he said.He would address four farmers rallies in February, the others being in Madhya Pradesh (February 18), Karnataka (February 27) and Uttar Pradesh (February 28). BJP sources said the PM would publicise the pro-farmer initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana during the rallies.The BJP's selection of Bargarh as a venue for the PM's peasant rally seems politically significant because allegation of highest farmers' suicide has come from this district. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had chosen this western Odisha district to address a farmers' rally on November 19 last year and announced Rs 35,000 crore package for the underdeveloped western Odisha.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too had chosen Bargarh for a padayatra to highlight the plight of farmers on September 10 last year and had interacted with kin of around 10 farmers who ended their lives over agrarian distress.Of the around 140 farmer suicides across the state, Bargarh district witnessed the highest of over 25 in the last kharif season. Bargarh, on Odisha-Chhattisgarh border, is termed the rice bowl of Odisha. It contributes about one-fourth of the total around 30 lakh metric tonne paddy procured annually in the state. A major part the district (Bargarh sub-division) is irrigated for two paddy crops from Hirakud water reservoir while Padampur sub-division is drought-prone with almost no irrigation facility even for single crop."
58f4c09b60de4776e369499e,SC 'secession' lash on Gujarat for food law,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160202/jsp/nation/story_67086.jsp,2016-02-02,"New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Supreme Court today came down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat for failing to implement the National Food Security Act, 2013, wondering whether it wanted to ""break away from India"" and had scant respect for Parliament. The apex court also asked what Parliament and the Centre were doing when the state was not implementing the food law. The bench felt that if Gujarat was allowed to have its way, other states following the law would also stop doing so, citing Gujarat as an example. The food law guarantees 5kg of rice/wheat to each member of a family. Under the programme that seeks to cover 75 per cent of the families in rural areas and 50 per cent of the households in cities, the rice is to be provided at Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2. The court was hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, Swaraj Abhiyan, saying the act should cover all families in 11 drought-affected states. Ranjit Kumar, representing the Centre, told the bench during the hearing that Gujarat was one of the states not implementing the food law at all. Kumar - who at the last hearing had been asked to collate information from all states on the scheme - said Gujarat had certain reservations over the programme. The reply invited the wrath of the bench, comprising Justices Madan B. Lokur and R.K. Agrawal. ""You (Gujarat government) want to break away from the Union of India? It is an act passed by Parliament. Tomorrow, Bihar will say we are not implementing it because Gujarat is not implementing it,"" Justice Lokur, heading the bench, told Kumar. Neither Kumar nor the Gujarat government's standing counsel, Hemantika Wahi, could give any convincing reply, except for saying the state was yet to take a decision. At this, the bench observed: ""A law is passed by Parliament. Tomorrow, some other states will say we will not implement it. What is the Government of India doing? What is Parliament doing? What about the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code)? Tomorrow, some other states will say we are not going to implement it (CrPC), we will not implement the IPC, the Indian Evidence Act."" The solicitor-general replied that besides Gujarat, eight other states were not implementing the food law but pleaded that he did not immediately have details about them. ""Today it is Gujarat, tomorrow Bihar.... Then, Chhattisgarh, Haryana will say the same thing. Where is the system going? Jharkhand has been implementing, but from tomorrow they will be saying Gujarat is not doing it, we will not do it. Karnataka is doing it (implementing the scheme), they will say we will not implement. Madhya Pradesh will say we are not implementing. Telangana will say the same thing,"" Justice Lokur observed. As Kumar tried to make some submissions, the bench asked twice: ""Gujarat is unique? Gujarat is unique?"" The court made it clear that ""we are nobody to tell you (the Gujarat government) what you should be doing"". ""But the question is whether you believe in Parliament, or Indian laws? As of now, the law (Act) stands or not? If not, why?"" the bench asked. Later, the bench directed the solicitor-general to place before the court details of the scheme's implementation in various states by February 12 and posted the matter for further hearing on February 15. Swaraj Abhiyan counsel Prashant Bhushan and Pranav Sachdeva pleaded that besides 5kg of rice/wheat free for each person, all families in the drought-hit states should be given 2kg free dal and 1kg of edible oil. Children should be provided an egg free daily or 200ml of milk. The NGO has also sought an increase in the 100 days of guaranteed work each year for a household under rural employment scheme NREGA to 150 days in the drought-affected states. The states are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh."

(Source: File | Reuters)Madhya Pradeshs battle to get the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for basmati rice grown by its farmers in several districts has hit a hurdle, with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) ruling against it.The assistant registrar of the Geographical Indications Registry had ruled in favour of Madhya Pradesh on December 31, 2013. But the Delhi-based Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) challenged the order. The Chennai-based IPAB has now sided with the APEDA, which had argued against allowing GI tag for basmati rice grown by MP farmers.More than three lakh farmers in Madhya Pradesh cultivate basmati on over four lakh hectares of land and were hoping for a favourable order, which would have earned them more in exports.We will move the Chennai high court. We will eventually succeed, Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister Gaurishankar Bisen told The Sunday Express, a day after Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal gave their ruling.Principal Secretary (Agriculture) Rajesh Rajora said the state and other applicants had submitted detailed documentary evidence, such as the gazetteers during the British rule, to shore up the states case. He said the appeal will be filed in the next few days.Though there are hundreds of varieties of long grain and scented rice grown all over the world, basmati is the best known due to its unique properties attributable to agro-climatic conditions prevailing in a geographical area.The assistant registrar had asked APEDA to include some districts in Madhya Pradesh that grow basmati before giving GI tag to the rice grown in parts of seven states, including Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The APEDA, which functions under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, had challenged the erroneous order on several grounds. While arguing against MPs inclusion, APEDA claimed to have legally challenged in 40 countries third party attempted registrations in the name of basmati or any deceptive variations.Saying MPs evidence was based on improper verification and illegible and unreadable documents, it was argued that the state does not fall in the Indo Gangetic Plain. In the 235 goods granted GI tag by the registry, only two have been challenged so far.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

State government records show the highest price rise across the state was recorded in Visakhapatnam in superfine and fine rice categories in recent times.According to the essential commodity report (ECR) from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, AP government, superfine category rice was sold in the city at Rs 52 per kilo, the highest price in the state, as on the second week of March. The price was Rs 8.12 higher than the state average price, which stood at Rs 43.88 per kilo in the second week of March. The lowest price of the superfine variety was reported at Tekkali in Srikakulam district where the price was Rs 38 per kilo.Similarly, fine category of rice was sold at Rs 42 per kilo in the city which is Rs 4.8 higher than the state average price of Rs 37.2 per kilo. The lowest price of the fine variety was reported from Gudur in Nellore district where the price was Rs 31 per kilo.G Madhusudhana Naidu, proprietor of Maruthi Minerals Pvt Ltd in Vijayawada, said that the maximum price of superfine rice was reported between Rs 48 and Rs 50 per kilo in Vijayawada during the period.Rice traders attributed the exorbitant rise in prices to several reasons such as unavailability of superfine and fine category of rice that is preferred by Vizagites in the district. Almost all rice traders in the city procure the food grain including the preferred variety Lalitha from other parts of the state like Peddapuram, Mandapeta, Nellore and Guntur.Along with this rise in transportation and labour cost and increasing population in the city also affect prices. Besides, the 'Smart City' tag has led to the increase in rents and other essential items impacting food prices. Labourers charge Rs 200 to Rs 250 per quintal of rice shifted from the trucks to the godowns at the wholesale markets.""Rice preferred by Vizagites are procured from other parts of the state as it is not produced in the district or even neighbouring Srikakulam. However, even though the lowest price of superfine rice was reported from Tekkali, there is a lot of difference in the quality sold in Vizag and Tekkali,"" said S Sudhakar, secretary of Food Grains Dealers' Association for Visakhapatnam city.K Nirmala, civil supplies officer for Vizag city, said that prices are high in the city as consumers are willing to buy the rice at a higher price. ""80% of the rice consumers procure the essential commodity from the public distribution system at Re 1 per kg. The department is also ensuring that more variety of stock at different prices are available in the market to cover all categories of consumers,"" Nirmala told TOI.K Srinivasa Rao, an Andhra University employee, who was spotted at the Rythu Bazaar at Pedawaltair, said the steep rise in prices was impacting the common man as meals were becoming expensive at home and at restaurants.""The state government should focus on such issues on a priority basis. Unfortunately, the state government is not taking any sincere measures to regulate the price of the essential commodities in the state. Instead it is focusing on the capital development at Amaravati,"" Rao opined.An agriculture official said on anonymity that the price can be stabilised if the government took efforts in procuring superfine and fine rice from other states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra where production is high and consumption is low."

(Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) An opium farmer whose crop has been ploughed back into his field using rotavator. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)The current crisis in agriculture seems to have spared none  not even those engaged in legal cultivation of opium poppy.Extreme moisture stress from a failed monsoon and lack of winter rains have led to an unprecedented 95 per cent of the 19,651 licenced opium growers in Madhya Pradeshs (MP) three northeast districts of Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam to seek destruction of their crop this year. The reason: expected yields falling below the minimum 58 kg per hectare level stipulated by the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) under the Union finance ministry.The CBN, under whose regulation and monitoring the licenced cultivators operate, requires growers to request for destruction of their standing crop if they anticipate yields to be lower than the minimum qualifying level. Not tendering such request and harvesting less than the minimum qualifying yield (MQY) of opium latex would make them liable to lose their cultivation licence.Share This Article Related Article Afghan opium cultivation jumps 10 per cent in 2016: United NationsAfghan opium cultivation jumps 10 per cent in 2016: United Nations Tech lag: Indias opium finds few takersTech lag: Indias opium finds few takers Conditions eased for farmers seeking opium licenceConditions eased for farmers seeking opium licence Rising drug trade threatens Myanmar's aspirationsRising drug trade threatens Myanmar's aspirations Myanmar declares war on opiumPoppy in a rice bowlEvery year, there are some growers who approach the CBN with crop destruction requests. But the extended dry spell this time has resulted in only about 1,000 of the 19,651 licenced cultivators agreeing to harvest the crop, which is sown during late-October/November and is ready for lancing in February. Under the rules, such requests are to be made before lancing or scratching of the poppy seed pods (fruits) from which the opium latex leaks out. The latex that coagulates on the pods and dries to a sticky yellow residue is what gets tediously collected by the cultivators; they are supposed to account for every gram that is thus obtained. While growers are still coming to terms with the poor yields on account of natural causes, their main grouse  for which they have taken to the streets  is the Centres decision to plough back the entire crop that is not harvested.Previously, the crop affected by natural calamities or disease could be uprooted under official supervision, with the cultivators allowed to take out the poppy seeds (khas khas) from the pod after latex extraction and sell these in the open market. Although the pod husk (doda chura) remaining after extraction of the opium latex and poppy seeds is classified as a narcotic under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act  in view of containing some morphine that can give a high when used in sufficient quantities  it could also be sold to contractors with licenses from the state government.These bulbs are yet to be harvested. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) These bulbs are yet to be harvested. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)The current changed opium cultivation policy mandates the entire sub-MQY crop to be ploughed back to the soil, which growers complain deprives them of revenues that can at least recover their cost of seeds, fertilisers and chemicals. I realised my crop had failed, so I informed the authorities. But what about the costs I have incurred and the time spent in cultivation? asks Rajmal Kabra, a resident of Bahi Parasnath village, about 16 km from Mandsaur. The 55-year-old, who cultivates poppy on a plot of 10 are (0.1 hectare) claims he has never in my life witnessed so much damage to an otherwise most hardy crop.The CBN has defended the new total-ploughing-back policy on grounds of preventing smuggling and black-marketing of opium. Growers dont want to risk their licenses. But they also want to make money from selling seeds and diverting poppy husk illegally, says a CBN official. He adds that the policy was actually issued first in 2009, but its implementation was deferred twice.This time, the CBN has even used rotavators to destroy the un-harvested sub-MQY crop, although the Neemuch-based Assistant Commissioner of Narcotics Mahesh Kumar denies it was done on any significant scale. We dont have any rotavators. It is only a few farmers who have these, and which may have got used, he clarified. Either way, that operation has been kept on hold, following farmer protests.Ek ne bhi chira nahi lagaya (not a single one in my group has lanced his poppy), informs Chandraprakash Patidar, a grower in Bahi Parasnath, who also has 67 cultivators under his jurisdiction. As the mukhiya of the group, he has to maintain a register tracking the daily opium extraction by each of them.Satyanarayan Patidar is among the few who has gone ahead with lancing his pods. He grows opium on a 20 are (0.2 hectares) patta that has yielded just 9 kg. At 45 kg per hectare, this is below the MQY of 58 kg. I am scared to lose the licence next year, observes Patidar, whose patta is in his grandfather Shrirams name. This patta yielded 15 kg or an average of 75 kg/hectare in 2014-15.Producers are paid a minimum price of Rs 870 per kg for opium yields up to 44 kg/hectare. The price rises to Rs 1,000 for yields between 44 and 52 kg per hectare and going as high as Rs 3,500/kg for 90 kg and above. Last year, Patidars family earned Rs 24,000 from their 15 kg opium at Rs 1,600 per kg. But they made even more from sale of 215 kg of khas khas (Rs 96,750 at Rs 450/kg) and 205 kg of doda chura (Rs 25,625 at Rs 125/kg).We are awaiting further orders and clear guidelines from the finance ministry, Mahesh Kumar told The Indian Express when asked about the authorities response to the demand for allowing farmers to recover poppy seeds and also not to cancel licences due to lower yields from unfavourable weather this year. For the moment, the CBN has permitted farmers to pluck and crush the opium pods for obtaining the khas khas, before ploughing back the poppy husk along with the plants into the soil. We dont object to the seeds, as they are not narcotic, explains an official, while confirming the relaxation.MP accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the countrys 44,438 licenced opium cultivators, who are also from Rajasthan (Kota, Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Pratapgarh and Jhalawar) and Uttar Pradesh (mainly Barabanki, Faizabad, Mau and Ghazipur). In 2013-14, 318 tonnes of opium was produced from 5,893 hectares where legal cultivation took place.Opium collected from farmers is sent to government-owned factories at Neemuch and Ghazipur for final analysis, drying and processing. The factories convert a part of opium (150-200 tonnes) into alkaloids (morphine, codeine and thebaine) for supply to medicine manufacturers. The balance is exported as raw opium to the US, Japan, Hungary, UK, France and Thailand for medicinal purposes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In Uttar Pradesh, Ballia is most prone to arsenic contamination followed by Bahraich, Rae Bareli, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Meerut, Chandoli and many more.The technology is ready for field trials. Senior NBRI scientist Debasis Chakrabarty, who conducted the research recently, visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippine and discussed the possibilities of field trials. The institute in principal agreed to help in this regard.""The institute invited us to become familiar with ongoing research work at NBRI and has agreed in principle to conduct field trials subjected to clearance by governments of both countries,"" said Chakrabarty, head of the eight-member team, which carried out research published recently in an international journal 'Metallomics' published by 'Royal Society of Chemistry'.The scientists said the transgenic rice has 'arsenic methyl transferase', a gene isolated from a fungus that accumulates less arsenic and would be less toxic.He explained that arsenic present in groundwater percolates in soil during irrigation and contaminates rice with arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure through groundwater contamination affects more than 150 million people worldwide and over 500 million people in Ganga, Meghna and Brahmputra areas.Rice is the crop most susceptible to absorbing arsenic during cultivation. Cultivating rice varieties that accumulate less amount of arsenic can tackle the challenge of exposure to carcinogens (cancer causing elements) that affect population in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha."

During the regime of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the party had formed Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, carved out of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, he said.Mr Danve said the erstwhile UPA government formed a separate Telangana state (out of Andhra Pradesh) due to political views of the Congress.

In Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, voters generally speak up with enthusiasm on who they will vote for and why. Its a different story in a state where political violence has claimed thousands of lives over the last four decades. Hinterland common folk are uneasy about revealing their preference. A dozen variations of the expression, dekhte hobe (well have to see), is what one gets to hear.In a climate of fierce political partisanship, where one is often forced to choose sides, staying anonymous looks like a safer option for survival. Even so, journeying through the picture-postcard villages of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and the stunted expanse of Malda district in north Bengal, one gathers that the Mamata Banerjee government enjoys a fairly positive rating among the rural impoverished.Several marginalised farmers and daily wagers admit to benefiting from state welfare schemes. According to them, PDS functions better than ever. Rice is readily available for Rs 2 (shades of Raman Singhs Chhattisgarh government here) and atta for Rs 3.50 a kg.Like Bihars Nitish Kumar government in its previous avatar, the TMC government has distributed thousands of bicycles among needy school students. These bicycles, painted a political shade of blue, stand out. Miles of roads in rural areas have been laid with fresh tar.Many would love to lump Mamata alongside Lalu Prasad, a mass leader hardly associated with progress. But evidence shows she is closer to the development-driven Nitish. Its possible to argue that TMC lacks a long-term vision for the state. But in contrast to the small-town and mofussil middle-class who are less than satisfied with TMCs five-year performance, the underprivileged in north Bengals countryside have generally positive things to say about her tenure. This class also seems relatively indifferent to the scams (Saradha, Rose Valley) that have put Mamatas party on the backfoot in recent weeks.Throughout north Bengal, flags of the Left parties and Congress flutter on trees and poles like conjoined twins. The erstwhile bitter rivals are new comrades-in-arms. Political alliances, for all their compulsions and contradictions, can be electoral master strokes. Last year, for instance, when RJD supremo Lalu and JD(U)s Nitish rediscovered each other to combat BJP, Bihars caste calculus tilted decisively in favour of the two Mandalites and a piggybacking Congress.In Bengal, this is the question everybody wants a definitive answer to: Is the Left-Congress alliance working on the ground as it unofficially did during the Siliguri municipal elections last year? What one can say for sure is that the unlikely union has energised the duos cadres and party workers, hugely demoralised after the thrashing in the 2011 state polls and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The jot (alliance) and the fervent wish that it can synergise votes is the hook both parties have hung their hopes on.Any election is also about managing public perception. In that regard, the pact has reasonably succeeded. The allies are sharing stage, attending mohalla booth meetings, even occasionally shouting Inquilab Zindabad together. At least publicly, theres a show of unity.But will party workers of both Congress and Left Front, divided for years by ideology and memories of hate, be honest to that public show of bonding inside the polling booth? It appears that a fair percentage of vote transfer among party workers could happen on that account. And thats primarily because theres an increasing realisation that another electoral setback could be ruinous to their future.However, the same may not hold true for the ordinary party voter, who might walk his own line. Most pre-election opinion polls have given a majority to TMC, in greater or lesser degree. But the alliance, boosted by the surround sound of those who benefited during the 34 years of Left rule, has partially dented the self-confidence of TMC. Whether it is enough to alter the final outcome is another matter.Amidst this battle for the top slot, BJP has marked its physical presence far and deep. From the lush hamlets of Jalpaiguri to the water-parched villages of Malda district to the forest areas of Alipurduar, the saffron flag can be seen in most corners of north Bengal.In the 2014 Lok Sabha poll where BJP got 17.02% votes, pundits attributed the surge to the Modi wave. Thats partly true. Over the years, RSS as well as its political wing have set up base in dozens of villages. Shakhas are common.Broadly speaking, their support base includes sections of SCs (rajbonshis, namasudras), a small portion of STs, parts of the non-Bengali population and the anti-Left, anti-Congress middle class. The party stands a chance in Baisnabnagar and Kalchini assembly seats. Its vote-share should be far higher than the 4.06% it got in 2011 assembly polls. However, the 17% peak of LS 2014 could still be a bridge too far. BJP is a party in search of an articulate and widely-accepted local leader.PS: Another saffron votary is making his presence visibly felt. His visage can be seen outside every shop peddling his goods even in the border outposts of north Bengal. No other businessman comes close. Guess who? Baba Ramdev."

Production was low due to draught in these areas.Farmers are selling their produce at high cost, as a result prices in open market rose. Hoarders too were exploiting the situation. He informed that impact of arhar dal had made the price rice in other pulses. Gram pulse, which was available for Rs 61 per kg on April 3 had recorded a hike of Rs 12 to 13 per kg. At present, gram dal was Rs 72 to 73 per kg.The traders expect that the prices may go up further and suggested that the government should import lentils to meet the domestic demand and take stern action against hoardersThe country consumes around 18 to 19 million tonnes of arhar, whereas production is around 14 to 15 million tonnes."

Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation.

The 32 bighas of land that Mr. Singh shares with his three brothers also boasts of a one-of-a-kind rural museum, the Humane Agrarian Centre. A farmer-activist based in Bandas Badokhar Khurd village, Mr. Singh believes that his experiment with sustainable and traditional farming could be replicated at a larger level, and could pave the way for a policy change.The idea is to ensure the prosperity of the farmers family, ecological balance and food security of the country.He calls his pioneering method of sustainable farming Aavartansheel Kheti. Loosely translated, as per a book he co-authored with Belgium environmentalist Johan Dhulster, it means periodic proportionate farming.Key elements of this approach are crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, planting and research for improving soil fertility and seed development. The essence is to minimise the farmers reliance on the market while improving their standard of living.The farmer would have to utilise his farm by dividing it into three parts: one-third would be used for rearing fruits and crops, the other for growing timber and the remaining portion for animal husbandry. Mr. Singhs multi-pronged technique, pioneered and implemented by him for over a decade, is similar to the idea of farming Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been propagating in his addresses to farmers.The farmer, known in the area as pragatisheel or progressive, advises farmers to not directly trade their produce in the market but to sell the processed extracts. For instance, sell paneer but not milk, and so on. That will link the farm to the kitchen. And also give the customers a better quality and nutritious product, said Mr. Singh. Some of the popular products at his farm are amla pickle and candy, cow ghee, mustard oil, organic rice and flour (wheat, gram, and barley). Asked whether it was practical for small farmers, Mr. Singh said, yes, with certain adaptations and adjustments.Born in 1964 into a farming background, Mr. Singh studied philosophy in Allahabad University but soon turned to his ancestral vocation. In 1995, he adopted a traditional method of farming, triggered by his dismay at the negative impact of the Green Revolution.He says the Green Revolution and other policies played a big role in dismantling the traditional structure of farming and pushed the farmer to the mercy of unsustainable methods, which also harmed environment. Mr. Singh links it to the present crisis, where three consecutive droughts, with bouts of unseasonal rains and hailstorm, have devastated the morale of the Bundelkhand farmer.The outside knowhow of some experts was forced upon farmers. Till 1980, not a single bag of urea was purchased in Bundelkhand. But due to the governments policies, farmers were forced to abort traditional and more sustainable methods, eventually leading them into debt-traps, Mr. Singh said. Every time a farmer commits suicide, the government says he was burdened by debt. What is the key reason for the debt? The farmers are dying because they follow the schemes of the government. This is the real injustice.Droughts are not new to Bundelkhand. As per records, in the last century it witnessed 17 major droughts, 10 of them caused by deficient rainfall. But the traditional water-recharging methods, numerous ponds, and natural harvesting techniques of people then mitigated the scarcity. The steps taken by the government in the last three decades have nullified the work of the ancestors, Mr. Singh said.The crops grown then did not require much water. With the Green Revolution, underground water began to be extracted heavily to sustain the thirst of the seeds. The local seeds were tested and adapted to fight drought. But the seeds introduced by the government needed excess water and urea to grow. Tractors further increased the costs, Mr. Singh said.At the centre of it all, said Mr. Singh, was the ruling class apathy towards farmers, manifested in their lack of representation in policy formation. The farming sector was bearing the brunt of their mistakes and excesses of the industrial and service sectors.His farm has plenty of water, many trees bearing fruit and a steady produce of organic products"

Maximum sales of musical instruments take place during Ganeshotsav, say Dabghars.SITTING amid teeming commotion in his shop, with tools to mend the broken ring of a tabla, Suresh D Chauhan works hard to bring it to the desired size. Suresh, who keeps a close watch on his subordinates work and customers in his century-old Lalbaug shop, belongs to a community of Dagbars, whose expertise in making musical instruments is well-known.With his life spent as a skilled artisan, Suresh cherishes the age-old art of making musical instruments, particularly related to the origin of Marathi music.Dabgars come from Indias western belt that includes Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. Having long practised and promoted the art of making quality musical instruments, they specialise in nagadas, dhols, pakhawaj, mrudungs, tablas, dholkis, tuntunas, halgis and other instruments.My grandfather would make the jheels (leather strips tied on the tablas) of tablas and get a bag of rice in return. He, and other Dabgars, would also get silver coins which they would use to come to Mumbai, Suresh reminisces, seated around an ensemble of instruments.What keeps him going is the satisfaction of putting his hard earned skill to practice in his shop.For Ishwarlal Chauhan too, another one from the community, the profession is where he derives his identity from. He has been running the shop for over five decades now and takes pride in passing on the art to his sons. His son Atul says, I have been making dhol-tashas since I was a nine-year-old, and I completely adore my job. I think the market still holds importance for recognising the work of artists like us.However, with preferences substantially tilting towards electronic instruments such as keyboards, electric guitars and recorded sounds at processions and devotional functions, Suresh says its future is bleak. Nobody likes to work in this field now. From about 12 shops in 1940 of dhol-tasha makers in Lalbaug, just three or four remain. I frankly believe the following generations would not even want to touch these instruments, he fears.But Dabgars believe they are better-off. With maximum sales of musical instruments happening during Ganeshotsav, musical events and repair works keep accounts running for the rest of the year. As electronic items are a bit expensive and tougher to use, connoisseurs of classical music and musicians who cannot afford to spend more become the target audience for Dabgars.It takes ten years at least for any artisan to learn the job perfectly. In our community, we do not care about artisans class, as whoever masters the skill and performs the work perfectly is the winner, says Suresh.With popular Lavanis or folk music of Marathi films making use of instruments made by these Dabgars, the community has not lost hope, yet.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
58fef44e7be9e0420db29fdb,New-age tools for tillers to boost produce,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160509/jsp/bihar/story_84512.jsp,2016-05-09,"More than 50 grain processing machine manufacturers will show case their equipments at the 14th International Exhibition on Rice & Grain processing technology from May 13 to 15 at the Patliputra ground. The grain processing machinery manufacturing companies, which includes national as well as international ones, will exhibit the latest technology which can be beneficial to farmers and grain mill traders. Bihar is an agrarian economy and as the state has a good production of paddy, wheat and maize, the grain processing machinery manufacturing companies aim to target farmers and grain mill traders, as there is no big grain processing unit. Surinder Gupta, the chairman of Business Empire, the unit which is organising the exhibition, said: ""In absence of big grain processing units in the state, the wheat and paddy produced in the state are processed in other states especially at Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Due to processing of grain in other states, the farmer as well as mill owners suffer losses."" The idea behind holding the exhibition is to showcase the latest technology in grain processing so that farmers and mill owners can introduce new techniques. The paddy, after going through various process in mills such as de-stoning, whitening, polishing, colour sorting, the rice is recovered which after packaging is sent to markets. Manish Sahay, director of Bihar Enterprises Association, said: ""The rice mills operating in district as Rohtas, Sasaram, Kaimur and Buxar have middle level rice mill processing unit. The mills are inferior to ones in Punjab and Haryana, as they hardly go for colour sorting. The technique is used to remove black colour from paddy. Sahay said the idea is that farmers and grain mill owner will know about the new technologies which can be beneficial to them, thus improving the quality of whole processed grain. The average cost of installing grain processing unit (middle level) is around Rs 30 to 40 lakh. The organisers claimed that with introduction of new technology, not only will there be improvement in qualities of processed grain but also there will be increase in production. Sahay said: ""The modern machines not only increase the output of processed grain, but also takes less time in processing than normal machines."" Similarly, the exhibition will also have wheat and maize processing machines. As the Kosi region leads in maize production, in absence of advanced grain processing unit, the farmers are left with no other alternative but to sell their produce at lower rates. The modern maize milling machine can help the farmers get various kinds of corn products, such as cornflour and others. The exhibition will be inaugurated by industries minister Jai Kumar Singh. At the exhibition, farmers and interested mill owners booking machines will also get discounts."
58f56dc8a3d24b0b70c21428,Insure farmers against climate change,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/insure-farmers-against-climate-change/article8587072.ece,2016-05-12,"Bundelkhand is where Indias marginal farming dream died. Known for the dacoits of Chambal and the Rani of Jhansi, the arid region, occupying districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has experienced drastic variation in climate in recent times. It faced a drought from 2003 to 2010, then floods in 2011, delayed monsoons in 2012 and 2013, and drought again since 2014. Farmers tried everything to adapt  growing a mix of dry crops during the kharif season, while interspersing the winter rabi wheat with cash crops like chickpea and mustard. They invested heavily in borewells, tractors, threshers and seeds and fertilizers through formal and informal credit.The past two winters, with hailstorms and unseasonal rain, destroyed crops (chickpea yields were mostly wiped out, the arhar crop failed completely), leading to farmer suicides (3,500 since 2003) and mass migration. Mitigation has been lacking; contractors not farmers benefit, and instead of providing crop insurance, warehouses are built. Bereaved families, hoping for compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government (Rs.7 lakh on death), were instead offered wheat bundles.India, a climate change hotspotIndia is uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures  it ranks in the top 20 in the Climate Change Vulnerability Index. Our average surface temperature, over the past four decades, has risen by 0.3 Celsius, accompanied by a rising incidence of floods, droughts and cyclones. With the majority of all landholdings in India measuring less than a hectare, marginal farmers face a steep decline in household income and a concomitant rise in household poverty through exacerbated droughts. Climate change would impact soil health, with increasing surface temperatures leading to higher CO{-2}emissions and reducing natural nitrogen availability. Mitigating this by increasing chemical fertilizer usage could impact long-term soil fertility, leaving the soil open to greater erosion and desertification. Meanwhile, migration patterns, farmer suicides and stagnating rural incomes, along with increasingly ad hoc land acquisition in the name of public goods, have politicised the idea of climate mitigation. Marginal farmland will increasingly be useless for agriculture.Our dependency on rain continues to amplify  rain-fed agriculture is practised in the majority of our total cropped area supporting a significant proportion of the national food basket (55 per cent of rice, 90 per cent of pulses, 91 per cent of all coarse grain). Our regional crop patterns assume a specific range of weather variability, failing to cope with the recent high periods of heavy rainfall with long dry intervals. In 2013, large crops of wheat, gram, lentils and mustard, weeks away from harvesting, were destroyed in untimely rains. Indias flood-affected area has doubled since Independence, despite generous state spending on flood protection schemes.Research has highlighted the deleterious impact of climate change on crop production. By 2100, the kharif season will face a varying temperature rise (0.7-3.3 Celsius) with rainfall significantly impacted. Limited temperature rises could lead to a 22 per cent decline in wheat yield in the rabi season, while rice yield could decline by 15 per cent. Other staple crops  sorghum, groundnut, chickpea  could see a sharp decline. Its impact is already prevalent: it is estimated that without rising temperatures and rain variability, Indias rice production over the past four decades could have been 8 per cent higher. India is home to the largest hungry population  falling agricultural yields will only make matters worse.Some policy prescriptionsOur low agricultural productivity remains a key constraint. According to the Swaminathan Committee on Farmers (2006), for rice, we produce 2,929 kg per hectare, while China produces twice as much. For other staples, we remain woeful, producing 913 kg of groundnut per hectare, while Indonesia produces nearly half as much more. As suggested by the National Commission on Farmers, a rural spending plan, focussed on investments in agriculture infrastructure, particularly in irrigation, rainwater harvesting and a national network of soil-testing laboratories is needed. Simple water harvesting and conservation measures (micro-irrigation, watershed management and insurance coverage) can reduce the majority of the potential loss due to drought (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Drought strategies should be extended to the village level  for example, each village should have a village pond, created under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Indian agricultural policy has made us structurally vulnerable to climate change. As suggested often by the National Commission on Farmers, conservation farming and dryland agriculture should be promoted. Each village should be provided timely rainfall forecasts along with weather-based forewarnings regarding crop pests and epidemics in various seasons. Afforestation, in a biodiverse manner, should be encouraged to help modify regional climates and prevent soil erosion. Our agricultural research programmes need to be retooled towards dryland research  it has been argued that adoption of drought-tolerant breeds can help reduce production risks by nearly a third, while offering attractive returns to breeders. Changing planting dates could have a significant impact; research highlights that planting wheat earlier than usual can help reduce climate change-induced damage. Zero tillage and laser-based levelling can also help conserve water and land resources. Crop planning can be conducted as per the climatic zones of different regions, while utilising better genotypes for rain-fed conditions.We should focus on expanding our formal credit system to reach all marginal farmers. Insurance coverage should be expanded to all crops while reducing the rate of interest to nominal levels, with government support and an expanded Rural Insurance Development Fund. A debt moratorium policy on drought-distressed hotspots and areas facing climate change calamities should be announced, waiving interest on loans till farming incomes are restored. The Centre and States should launch an integrated crop, livestock and family health insurance package while instituting an Agriculture Credit Risk Fund to provide relief in the aftermath of successive natural disasters.Climate change will impact the entire food production chain, affecting our food security. Livestock production, often considered to be a substitute to farming for marginal farmers, would face reduced fodder supplies given a decline in crop area or production. With Indias population rising, demand for diversified crops will be hard to square with diminishing yields. Agricultural investments in food crops, along with systemic support for irrigation, infrastructure and rural institutions can help move India beyond climate change-induced food insecurity, strengthening our stressed food production systems. Through adaptation and mitigation measures, we can overcome this Hobbesian crisis.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency forthe BJP."

59284b807be9e0137c77c938,Mamata steamrolls all her opponents,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/547909/mamata-steamrolls-all-her-opponents.html,2016-05-22,"Mamata steamrolls all her opponentsAloke Banerjee, May 22, 2016, 0:07 ISTThe year-long blizzard of propaganda could not shrivel her prospects. Disturbing TV visuals of her ministers taking bribe, collapse of a Kolkata flyover killing over 20 people prior to the election had little impact on the results in West Bengal as Mamata Banerjee stormed back to power for a second consecutive term, leaving many political pundits baffled and fumbling for words to explain her unbelievably massive victory both in terms of seats and vote share.How can one explain Mamatas triumph? Is the mandate a yes in favour of her governments development activities or a no to a hastily conjured alliance of two ideologically opposed partners, the Left and the Congress? The story contains both.The no factorTrouble was brewing within the Left-Congress alliance since its inception. Many CPM leaders, from the Polit Bureau to the district committees, were ideologically opposed to the idea of joining hands with the Congress. It is no longer a secret now that many Left voters chose NOTA (None Of The Above) instead of an alliance candidate. Similarly, a large number of Congress supporters refused to vote for Left candidates, they voted for the Trinamool instead. In short, neither the arithmetic nor the chemistry worked for the alliance.The Left-Congress partnership emerged too late, barely two months before the polls, giving it too little time to bloom. Also, after repeated electoral debacles, first in the 2011 Assembly polls and then in the municipal and Lok Sabha elections, the powerful organisation of the Left, which won them so many elections in the past, collapsed completely. So, while Trinamool workers were busy campaigning in the villages, the Left leaders had little option but to use air-conditioned studios of news channels as their primary vehicles of campaign.The silent voters, whose votes finally determine the outcome of every election, did not trust the alliance. Many believed the Left-Congress bonhomie would not last long even if the alliance came to power. As a result, the government would fall, requiring another round of elections. These silent voters chose stability and voted for the Trinamool.The Muslim community influenced electoral outcome in at least 80 of the 294 seats by supporting the Trinamool. The Left could be credited for preventing communal riots, but they virtually did nothing for the Muslims during their 30-year rule. True, Mamata promised much and delivered little, but unlike the Left, she delivered something, felt the Muslims, particularly those in the rural areas.Finally, the Left-Congress leaders expectations on the possible swing in the BJPs vote share in their favour went horribly wrong. True to their calculations, the BJPs vote share came down from 17% to 10%, but the swing entirely favoured the Trinamool.The yes factorStrange though it may sound, but many of the accusations against Mamata in fact helped her. The Trinamool was accused of running a syndicate raj in West Bengal. True, the syndicates fleece realtors, supply low-grade building materials at prices much higher than the market rates, but syndicate members, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, have no other source of livelihood.There are at least 30,000 syndicate members in the Rajarhat-New Town area alone, and the Left-Congress alliances promise of action against syndicates if they came to power worried these young men and they worked body and soul to ensure a Trinamool victory. Syndicates exist in all urban areas in Bengal and all of them worked for the Trinamool. Similarly, the Oppositions charge that the government was wasting tax payers money to give donations to the local clubs alienated the club members, who doggedly worked to ensure Mamatas victory.On the other hand, in spite of the financial constraints and the resulting shoe-string budget, Mamatas government successfully implemented a slew of development projects, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. In spite of repeated incidents of violence against women, Mamata managed to win them over by distributing cycles to girl students. Owning a cycle in a village is like possessing a Maruti car in a city. Interestingly, the idea of distributing cycles was floated by a chief secretary during the last leg of the Left Front rule, but the proposal was bluntly shot down by the then finance minister Asim Dasgupta.Finally, distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg came as Mamatas masterstroke. Better road connectivity, availability of water and medicines increased the Trinamools vote share. Though corruption was clearly visible, local Trinamool leaders were pardoned by the rural voters. Issues like the Saradha chit fund scam, Narada sting operation, flyover collapse and campus violence eroded the Trinamools vote share, but the erosion was confined to urban seats and every Narada-tainted minister won, albeit with a lower margin.So, where does Mamata go from here? Insiders say Delhi is her next target. If the Third Front takes shape after the Uttar Pradesh elections, she hopes to play a major role at the Centre. Till then, she will concentrate on the next panchayat election in West Bengal to further consolidate her position.(The writer is a senior journalist based in Kolkata)"

A large part of the country is witnessing drought, declining ground-water levels, and shortage in reservoirs, following two consecutive sub-normal monsoons.Deficit rainfallRainfall deficiency in 2014 and 2015 stood at 12 per cent and 14 per cent of normal, respectively. In 2015 rainfall received by Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab and West Uttar Pradesh was more than 50 per cent below normal. This has taken a toll on agricultural production, according to the report.As per the third advance estimates for 2015, rice output was down two per cent, coarse cereals fell 12 per cent, pulses declined by 0.5 per cent along with sugarcane (0.5 per cent) and oilseeds, (six per cent) exacerbating rural distress. Agriculture GDP growth averaged 0.4 per cent in the last two fiscals, much below the long-term trend of 3 per cent.An above-normal monsoon this year will augment groundwater and reservoir levels and in turn increase crop production, according to the report.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reiterated its April forecast of a good south-west monsoon  at 106 per cent of the long period average (LPA). However, the report said that the sensitivity of crops to rainfall signals the need for improvement in irrigation facilities, change in cropping patterns, harnessing of rainwater, adoption of water conservation techniques and availability of stable electricity. Also, efficiency of water usage needs to improve. India currently uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, compared with half that  or 1,321 cubic metre  in China. This underlines the need to address structural issues. An important source of irrigation in India is groundwater, which accounts for as much as 60 per cent of water used for irrigation. Also, irrigation accounts for close to 90 per cent of the total groundwater consumed in the country  the proportion is 98 per cent and 94 per cent for in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.Farm outputDuring the green revolution, the report said, with excessive use of inputs to pump up farm output, farmers increasingly moved towards using groundwater compared with surface water for irrigation. This was supported by government subsidies for electricity supply and irrigation equipment. Excessive use of groundwater has led to depletion of the water table. Between 1993-94 and 2014-15, the share of wells with groundwater less than 10 metre has fallen by 6 percentage points, while that of wells with groundwater more than 60 metre has risen to 6 per cent from 4 per cent, making it increasingly difficult to access ground water.India uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, while China uses half that amount"

In this way, the PM had dishonoured the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers, even though he addressed a large gathering near the place, said Tiwari.In a press communique, Tiwari said that the PM had mentioned that 18,000 villages were not electrified after freedom and ""we (BJP) will take steps for the electrification of these villages"", but he failed to mention that the electrification of these 18,000 villages was being done under the 'Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme' started by the Congress government.On the PM's claims on fighting corruption, Tiwari said Modi had failed to look at the performances of the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Shiv Raj Singh Chauhan, and Rajasthan, Vasundhra Raje Scindia, who were also sitting on the dais.Madhya Pradesh, said Tiwari, was facing the biggest corruption scam in the form of the Vyapam case in which about 51 murders had also taken place. There was also the Lalitgate scam in Rajasthan, and the Rs 36,000-crore rice scam in Chattisgarh."

(Source: Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)Hard-pressed to explain his narrative of Hindus being driven away from western UPs Kairana because of threats from a gang belonging to a particular community, BJP MP Hukum Singh Tuesday released a second list of names, this time from Kandhla in the same region.The Indian Express had reported that many of the families on the first list had migrated from Kairana years ago for better jobs or education. Now, similar discrepancies have emerged in the latest list, with one key difference  the word Hindu was missing from its title.The title of the list of 346 names that Singh released last week was Kairana se palayan karne wale Hindu pariwaron ki soochi (List of Hindu families who migrated from Kairana).The list from Kandhla, with just 63 names, was titled Kandhla se palayan karne wale pariwaron ki soochi (List of families who migrated from Kandhla).Watch Video: Whats making newsThe Indian Express checked on names from both lists:Narendra Jain and son Arun Jain are listed as residents of Saravagyan in Kairana. Srimander Jain, Narendras brother, said, Narendra moved to Muzaffarnagar around ten years ago. His son is a contractor who moved to Delhi over five years ago for better business opportunities. They have houses here.Srimander said Narendras family ran a few shops in Kairanas Chowk Bazar area but moved out due to alleged harassment from street vendors and hawkers.Amod Jain, listed as the son of Roopchand Jain and a resident of Saravagyan, died around five years ago. Amit Choudhary, who bought Jains house in 2000, said he had moved out 16 years ago. His son has been running a business in Delhi since 1995 and they own a house in Pitampura, he said.Jagdish Jain, listed as a resident of Saravagyan, was living on rent in Amod Jains house. He was a metre reader with the electricity board and got transferred to Badaut in 2008-2009, said Rohit Choudhary, a neighbour.Pramod Jain and brother Rajeev Jain are listed as sons of Indrasen Jain and residents of Saravagyan area. Pramod Jain is a 67-year-old businessman who deals in rice and fodder, and still resides in Kairana along with his family, said neighbours. Jain and family were not present at their residence Tuesday. Rajeev Jain rented out his property and moved to Dehradun more than five years ago to run a tea business, said Rohit Choudhary, who stays two houses away.Pavan Jain, son of Janewshwar Das, is listed as a resident of Saravagyan. He left Kairana three years ago for a better life and to be with his son, Ankit, who works in Delhi and was staying alone.

591f15787be9e025a5d4a7ac,Pulses shortage: Set up procurement mechanism,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/554708/pulses-shortage-set-up-procurement.html,2016-06-27,"Pulses shortage: Set up procurement mechanismSagar Kulkarni, Jun 28, 2016, 23:37 ISTAround July last year, soon after celebrating a year in office, the Narendra Modi government woke up to the steady rise in the prices of pulses. The first year in office was marked with low inflation levels  thanks to the decline in global crude and commodity prices and sluggish domestic demand. But July of 2015 brought with it the rude shock of a steady increase in prices of pulses. As the festive season of September-October approached, arhar or toor was retailing at Rs 200 per kg, forcing the government into action.The first response was to ramp up imports by tapping the usual sources  Canada, Malawi and Myanmar. But global crop failure and non-availability in international markets kept the prices high. This year too, pulses continue to cost dear to the common man who spends about 5% of his food expenditure on his key source of protein in the diet. And, the government has come up with the expected response  increase imports and build up buffer stocks to enable market intervention to cool down prices.A look at the data put out by the government clearly states that India has been dependent on imports to fill in the gap between demand and supply of pulses. The increase in rural wages in the latter part of the past decade had led to a steady increase in demand for pulses. In 2007-08, the demand for pulses was 16.77 million tonnes, while domestic production was 14.76 mt. Over the years, the domestic production stagnated at around 18 mt and the demand this year has been pegged at 24 mt.A study by Assocham in November last year has pegged pulses imports at 10.1 mt for 2015-16 raising questions whether India would need to depend on buying from global markets perpetually to meet its domestic needs of the protein source. The Indian Institute of Pulses Research has forecast a demand of 39 mt of pulses by 2050.According to a Crisil study, this would require production of pulses to grow at an annual rate of 2.2%, compared with the 0.9% growth witnessed in the last decade.The need of the hour is to dramatically increase domestic production to meet the growing demands for pulses. It needs a mix of policy and technological interventions to bridge the demand-supply gap. The Economic Survey 2015-16 had pointed out that most of the land dedicated to growing pulses in each state was unirrigated  thus leaving the output at the mercy of the rain god. It had made a strong pitch for increasing production of pulses on irrigated land to meet the high and growing demand.The recent spike in prices of pulses has sent the government scurrying to Africa and Myanmar once again  this time round exploring the possibility of contract farming in foreign nations to meet the domestic demands. Law and order issues in some African nations and high transportation costs have been cited as key hurdlesin previous attempts to explore land leasing options.The earlier attempts were made by the private sector and now India is holding government-to-government talks to explore avenues to ensure stability in supply of pulses. Top Central officials visited Mozambique and Myanmar last fortnight and are expected to present their reports to the government. This comes even as the government is pushing farmers to grow more pulses. But what ails the pulses sector? And why has India been unable to keep pace with the growing demand.The Green Revolution began in India in the early 1960s and within a decade the food grain production was on a steady increase. In 1970-71, total food grain production was 108.43 mt of which rice and wheat amounted to 42.22 mt and 23.83 mt, respectively. Production of pulses was 11.82 mt. By 2006-07, the total food grain production had doubled to 217.28 mt. While rice production zoomed to 93.35 mt and wheat to 75.81 mt, the growth is pulses amounted to 14.20 mt.Low yieldIn the absence of technological breakthrough, farmers were saddled with low yield seed varieties that help them produce about 700 kg of pulses per hectare, against the global average of 800 kg per hectare. Some states do much better than the all-India average, but even the key pulse producing state of Madhya Pradesh has yields (938 kg/ha) barely three-fifths that of Chinas (1550 kg/ha). This also makes a case for examining the viability of genetically modified variety to increase yields.Pulses are also high risk-prone crops as most of the production takes place in rainfed areas. Only 16% of pulses coverage is through irrigation thus exposing the farm output to monsoon shocks. Moreover, 70% pulses production comes from four states  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Barring Rajasthan, the rest three states have received deficient monsoon for the past four years thus affecting the production of pulses.In June, the Centre increased sharply the minimum support price (MSP) for pulses. But farmers were not enthused by the increase as wholesale prices are almost double the MSP.There are also demands for increasing the MSP to the level of the rates at which government imports pulses. They also recall the glut in chickpea production three years back when prices had fallen below the MSP. The government had failed to intervene and procure at the support price.But the biggest intervention from the government could be in the form of setting up a procurement mechanism to buy pulses from farmers at it does in case of wheat and paddy. The government procures between 30 and 40% of wheat and paddy produced in the country. But in the case of pulses, procurement is almost negligible.The Shanta Kumar Committee on Restructuring Food Corporation of India had suggested better price support operations for pulses to encourage farmers to take up cultivation on a large scale. The government needs to act on this."

58fedab47be9e0420db2867b,Rainfall low but no crop worry yet,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160630/jsp/nation/story_94049.jsp,2016-06-30,"Crop weather specialist Nabansu Chattopadhyay isn't worried yet by the multiple patches of dark red on a map of India on his computer displaying rainfall deficit zones since the start of the 2016 monsoon. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has documented 12 per cent lower than expected normal rainfall across the country between June 1 and June 29, but 36 per cent of India's land area has received deficient or scanty rainfall. While the monsoon's onset was delayed in many parts of India, weather scientists say the delayed advance is not expected to have any significant impact on the amount of rainfall. Crop performance largely hinges on the rainfall during July and August, they add. ""Sowing activities are proceeding as expected in several places despite the rain deficit,"" said Chattopadhyay, a senior agrometeorologist at the IMD Pune, who is among scientists tracking the monsoon's progress and providing guidance to farm activities. ""Rice transplantation has already started in Kerala, coastal Karnataka, and Konkan and Goa and rice seedlings are waiting in nurseries for transplantation in Odisha, Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, among other rice-growing areas,"" he said. Scientists say there is nothing in the behaviour of the monsoon thus far to indicate any deviation from the IMD's long-range forecast that India would receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall during the four-month season from June to September. India's kharif crops such as rice, maize, pigeonpea, sugarcane and groundnut, among others, rely significantly on monsoon rains. ""But a 12 per cent rainfall deficit during June is no cause for any alarm,"" said Vadlamudi U.M. Rao, the president of the Association of Agrometeorologists. ""Even some amount of weak rain during June helps in preparing land and soil, but July and August are crucial for most crops."" Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch have experienced the largest rainfall deficits during June, with Gujarat receiving 80 per cent lower than normal rainfall and Saurashtra and Kutch receiving 72 per cent lower than normal rainfall. ""There is still time, but only a week or two - after that we'll have to think about alternative crops for this region,"" said Vyas Pande, professor and head of agrometeorology at Anand Agricultural University. ""Farmers can wait at the most until mid-July - beyond that they could face the risk of reduced yields,"" he said, referring to cotton and groundnut, the main kharif crops cultivated in the state. The IMD, in its long-range forecast issued earlier this year, had predicted that rainfall would be above normal during July (107 per cent of long-period average) and August (104 per cent of the long-period average.) #Some parts of eastern India, including the Gangetic region of Bengal and Bihar, have experienced subdued rainfall activity soon after the monsoon advanced there between June 17 and 19. Meteorologists have attributed this to changes in wind patterns that drove moisture to southern Odisha and coastal Andhra Pradesh. Gangetic Bengal has a current rainfall deficit of 28 per cent, while Bihar's rainfall is 17 per cent below the expected amount over the past four weeks. ""Computer forecasts predict rainfall will pick up in the coming two weeks,"" said P. Chandra Sekhara Rao, a senior meteorologist at the IMD. ""After the onset, the rains don't fall every day, there are break periods. Moreover, we're still in the aftermath of an El Nino that is just going away,"" he said, referring to subtle changes in the Pacific sea surface temperatures that have in the past been linked to poor monsoon rainfall."

58fed5f97be9e0420db27ebf,Eyes on July after tardy rains onset,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160704/jsp/nation/story_94704.jsp,2016-07-04,"Nagpur, July 3: A slow-off-the-mark monsoon in a year billed for good rainfall by weather scientists has hobbled crop-sowing, leaving farmers hoping for adequate and uniform rainfall in July. Data released by the Union agriculture ministry on July 1 show that farmers are yet to start planting crops in full swing across large tracts, particularly central India. Officials are blaming the slow start on a delayed southwest monsoon and deficient June rainfall, with the added factor of a cash crunch among farmers after two to three years of drought. Delayed sowing leads not just to delayed arrival of fresh crops but also to lower yields. Crop scientists don't see a problem yet because, in many parts of the country, sowing picks up pace in July and even spills onto the first week of August. But any climatic aberration in July - either low rainfall or extreme weather events - could spell disaster for a vast majority of farmers in rain-dependent regions such as Marathwada, Vidarbha and Bundelkhand. The good news so far is that the India Meteorological Department's weekly forecast on Thursday suggests the southwest monsoon is gathering steam. Officials in Maharashtra blamed the delayed onset of the rains on a change in their pattern of arrival in the state. The southwest monsoon usually strikes Konkan first and then spreads to the state's eastern parts. This time, it entered Maharashtra from the eastern Vidarbha region and spread westward. Konkan and Mumbai witnessed heavy rain over the past week, but Vidarbha, Marathwada and western Maharashtra are yet to receive enough rain to start sowing. Seeds need a certain level of soil moisture for better germination and growth. Premature sowing is fraught with the risk of failure, necessitating re-sowing and thus pushing up the cost of production and labour. Besides, in many states, farmers are cash-strapped after successive years of drought. The banks have yet to restructure the outstanding loans and issue fresh credit for the current season. Maharashtra alone has more than 25 lakh such farmers. On July 1, going by the official data, sowing was way behind schedule in the case of crops such as cotton, pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals. If one considers only the major crops, India's farmers had finished sowing on 279 lakh hectares by this time last year. This season, the figure stands at 216 lakh hectares - a deficit of nearly 23 per cent. ( See chart) ""We have finished sowing but the rain has not been satisfactory,"" Sudam Pawar, a five-acre cotton grower in Wardha district, about 60km from Nagpur, said. ""We expect good rain this week,"" he added, drawing hope from the forecast for the region. The India Meteorological Department has predicted above-average rainfall in July and August, but farmers say it is crucial that the rain is uniform in spread and pattern. The past several years, including the so-called good-monsoon years, have seen extreme rainfall events in these parts. ""It's not just the amount of rain but the number of rainy days and its spatial spread that is important to us,"" said Pawar. India grows cotton on roughly 120 lakh hectares; a third of it in Maharashtra. Friday's ministry data showed that cotton-sowing had crossed barely 30 lakh hectares in the country - half the acreage compared with the corresponding period last year - mainly because of scanty or unsatisfactory rainfall in the cotton belt. Marathwada and Vidarbha, key cotton-growing regions, have faced droughts the past two to three years and, therefore, lower yields. Pulses, whose prices are sky-rocketing across the country owing to shortages caused by successive droughts, too have lagged last year's acreage - less than 20 lakh hectares sown against 22 lakh hectares last year. In the case of oilseeds, the figures are 28.7 lakh hectares this year compared with 54 lakh hectares by this time last year - lower by 47 per cent. Sowing is likely to speed up once the monsoon gathers steam in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, officials say. Coarse cereals like jowar, bajra and millets, grown mostly in the drier regions, have been planted across 37 lakh hectares, lower than the nearly 44 lakh hectares planted in the same period last year. The area under rice, the main kharifcrop, stands close to 48 lakh hectares, marginally higher than last year, thanks to good rainfall in Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The seasonal area under rice is 393 lakh hectares. Sugarcane too has a marginally higher acreage this year but officials attribute it to good rainfall in western Uttar Pradesh, where most of the crop is planted around this time. Sugarcane acreage in water-stressed regions like Marathwada and north Karnataka, they fear, would drop this year."

We, four friends, are heading towards the western Uttar Pradesh town, about 60 kms from the capital, as food explorers.Meerut has an impressive resume. We know it was the raging heart of the great 1857 revolt that shook British raj. The small town was once the centre of a multi-million rupee Hindi pulp fiction industry and still manufactures the finest cricket bats in the country. But many may not know that Meerut is a gastronomic delight too.Our first stop is the famous Jain Ki Shikanji shop at Modinagar. There are dozens of shikanji sellers in this town once famous for Modi suiting and shirtings. But Jains small cubicle-size shop, located by the police station, is the real McCoy. Shikanji was created to beat the summer heat. And at Jains, you know how. The drinks preparation is a short seven-step to heaven. First, a measured portion of sugar syrup is poured into a glass; followed by a strong squeeze of lemon.The glass is stuffed with crushed ice. Then a bottle of soda is emptied over it. This is followed by a spoonful of the special shikanji masala. The glass is then capped and shaken. Your drink is ready. Unlike Coke, the ingredients is no state secret. You can buy them separately too.The drink fortifies us for the lunch ahead. Asking passers by every 50 metres, we arrive at Papa Ji Daal Wale (sic), a dhaba near the old Baghpat More bus stand. Daal is to any meal what Laxman is to Ramayan: vital and self-effacing. At Papaji, it commands centre stage. The shop, owned by a genial sardarji, specialises in urad-chane ki daal which is slow cooked over low fire overnight. We want to pack some for dinner.But sardarji hasnt come in yet and without him, the staff refuses to serve. We leave with a heavy, hungry heart.Delhi Durbar, next to Imliyan Masjid, is on Hapur Road. Far more accommodating, they usher us into the new air-conditioned section where a young man is feeding what looks like fruit-cream to a woman in burqa. Our order is simple: chicken kali mirch and tandoori roti. One of us orders a chicken biryani too. The biryani is a crushing disappointment, it feels more like chicken in fried rice minus the finesse. But the chicken kali mirch is just right; its thick curry blended in cashew and cream. Flavour and taste blend to create a dish that is pure bliss. It is worth a hundred trips from Delhi. Anytime.Thats the unanimous view.On the way back, we pick up the dal. But before that we stumble upon the culinary treasure of the day. We spot a hotel whose name reminds me of an old Bollywood song. Its called, Char Yaar, and it was set up in 1950. Its basically a sweet shop that specialises in halwa-parantha. The deep-friend paranthas are the size of a large pizza and its crisp and flaky, much like a patty. The halwa, topped with cherries, is equally oily. You can say, its a dish to die for.Rather literally. But as food explorers, this is our discovery of the day. We taste some and pack the rest. It has been a week since that afternoon but the taste of the chicken kali mirch lingers on."

Millions of government employees recently received hefty pay hikes, while more farmers are going bust.The dusty village of Sisauli puts the dilemma facing India's policymakers into clear focus.Sisuali is three hours by rough road from New Delhi, making transporting goods difficult and expensive.Layers of middlemen also clog the supply chain and take their cuts. Some farmers say their produce can go through at least four intermediaries before reaching customers.Malik says he sold rice for 16 rupees (24 U.S. cents) a kilogram to a middle man. In a market 10 minutes away, it retails for three times as much.""Inflation has come down only on paper; in reality, there is no let up in surging prices,"" Sudhir Kumar said in his grocery shop, which also has a small TV set he uses to keep an eye on commodity prices.DECADES OF NEGLECT BUBBLING OVERRural India has long suffered from neglect, but tensions are rising as food prices have surged after two years of drought.Retail inflation in rural areas has consistently outpaced urban areas in the past 18 months, hitting 6.20 percent in June, well above 5.26 percent in cities such as Mumbai.That has pushed overall inflation to a near two-year high of 5.77 percent in June, near the upper end of the RBI's 2-6 percent inflation target.RBI officials have stressed that many of the causes are structural and beyond the central bank's control, but the spike in inflation could complicate the next governor's job.Though India has become the world's fastest growing large economy, political pressure on the RBI is growing to cut interest rates more aggressively to spur full employment, at the risk of unleashing even stronger inflationary forces.Outgoing Governor Raghuram Rajan was lauded by investors for introducing inflation targeting last year, restoring the RBI's credibility by linking price management to numerical targets. Investors are closely watching to see if his successor will stick to tough targets or water them down.Economists polled by Reuters see only one more rate cut over the next year, if inflation does not pick-up too sharply.NO EASY FIXESModi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is already facing a tough electoral test in the state next year. Uttar Pradesh will be a crucial test for its re-election bid in 2019.""You are not ready to pay more to farmers because that is bad economics,"" said Malik. ""But no one complains when hefty pay increases are given to government employees.""The government is making some strides. It is spending on infrastructure and is seeking to weed out middlemen by giving farmers an option of selling their goods across India via electronic trading platforms set up at wholesale markets.But progress is slow, and middlemen continue to hold sway as farmers lack the means to ship directly to buyers.Rate cuts would do little for villagers such as Narpendar Jhinjha, a heavily indebted 52-year-old farmer, who says another bad year will force him to sell his land.""A farmer is hit on both sides,"" Jhinja said, referring to low crop prices and higher prices for goods he needs to buy.""And on top of that we have our loans to pay for. Farmers have been condemned to a life of misery."""
5904285d7be9e02646bdc881,Carving a niche for themselves,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/561204/carving-niche-themselves.html,2016-07-30,"Carving a niche for themselvesR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, July 31, 2016 23:51 ISTHome Guards in Coimbatore district in Tamil Nadu have taken up a unique venture to carve out a niche for themselves. Besides launching initiatives like planting saplings and holding blood donation camps, they have started many projects which not many of their ilk have attempted so far.Going beyond their usual voluntary services, a 320-member Home Guard contingent, including 50 women, is engaged in creating awareness on the importance on organ donation, fighting man-animal conflict and helping the authorities at Kasi temple in Uttar Pradesh by sending coconut shells for the cremating the dead.Recently, over 100 home guards in Coimbatore helped a hospital to get an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for popularising the cause of organ donation by enrolling 13,206 donors in just eight hours. They also pledged their organs on the occasion. To create an awareness on the importance of eye donation among the people, the home guards have also pledged their eyes.We were doing our usual work till a few years ago. However, all of us thought that we should do something different to the people, which should help them, says Balaji Raju, Area Commander, Coimbatore district Home Guards.Accordingly they started rice bucket challenge two years back, a unique programme with each home guard providing one kg of rice to one family living on the street and daily wage workers.After the rice bucket challenge, the district Home Guards have now taken up another initiative to provide clothes to the downtrodden in society. The condition of children and men was pathetic as many had only two pairs of clothes, according to Balaji. The plight of those living in far-flung areas inside Thengumarada Forest, Kallampalayam, Melur and Keelur was horrible and many women were wearing torn clothes to cover their bodies. Called adai kodai (donate clothes), sarees, dhothis and kids wear, both new and used, were donated to the poor in those areas.As Coimbatore and its neighbouring districts are surrounded by forest area, animals like elephants and leopards enter human habitat frequently. This was a great concern for the district authorities as many people have lost their lives in the man-animal conflict in the last one decade.In a bid to help forest officials, home guards chipped in to help the authorities. Following our request, the forest authorities conducted a training programme in Annamalai Tiger Reserve, which was mainly focused on animals in hilly areas and preventive measures to keep them inside the forest, K Sidharthan, a home guard, said.He said the man-animal conflict programme is focused on Pollachi, Thudiyalur and Mettupalayam areas. Each unit is headed by a company commander, he said.The comprehensive training covered the safety measures needed to prevent animal attacks besides stocking rice and salt at PDS shops in a manner that does not attract elephants and other animals to human habitats, Sidharthan said. We were also trained on light and sound alert systems and SMS introduced by the forest department"".Under the SMS programme, a message on the movement of animals is sent to the nearest forest department outpost. The Home Guards and forest officials will alert people through public address system.Deputy area commander Vidhyashree Dharmaraj said that her unit has launched a novel programme called Kasi Pasumai Yatra. She said in Kasi trees are cut for burning bodies. We thought of a remedy to this and our cadres started collecting coconut shells, which can be used as alternative for wood to burn bodies, she said. We send the shells regularly to Kasi and an NGO helps us in this regard, she said.Vidhyashree said on some occasions, home guards also help the local police in nabbing criminals. Last month, our cadres Shanmuga Sundaram and Satish were on night duty when they noticed two people moving around suspiciously in the wee hours, Vidhyashree said. On seeing the home guards, the two attempted to flee. After a long chase, the home guards caught the hardcore criminals with guns and handed them over to the Mettupalayam police.Another Home Guard company commander Jaikumar said his cadres along with college students travelled to the flood-hit areas with relief materials. A group of home guards went to Chennai and Cuddalore district, which were devastated by December 2015 flood, and supplied food and helped in rescue and relief works.In another attempt to enter into the Guinness Book, the Home Guards cleaned Coimbatore city recently in association with the municipal corporation under Swachh Bharat Mission. The unique work included removing nails from trees and illegal hoardings. With an aim to stress on the importance of girl child, home guards were asked to take selfies with their daughters and post them on FaceBook.Recognising their efforts, the Tamil Nadu police have provided a distinct white uniform to the Home Guards , which is similar to the ones used by traffic cops in Coimbatore. Like traffic police, our cadres could also be identified during nights, which is not possible in the usual khakhi uniforms, Balaji Raju said.Interestingly, women cadres are also involved in activities such as cleaning local hospitals, providing temple security and extend escort to VIPs.Kalpana, who is in catering business, said: ""I am proud to be a part of the Home Guards team. Though I have lots of commitments at home, I do devote some time to public service."

We have demanded to hike it to `80 per quintal, he said.The millers who convened a meeting here to discuss issues concerning survival of rice milling industry demanded to frame policies properly and implement separate rice Out Turn Ratio (OTR) for each State as per their respective output instead of a uniform OTR of 68 per cent. Eastern India, especially Odisha and West Bengal, never produce rice above 63 per cent of the paddy supplied due to climatic condition. But millers in these two States are asked to provide 68 per cent rice, Saini said.General secretary Santosh Sonthalia said instead of storing entire procured paddy will millers, the State agencies should have their own storage arrangements from where the millers can lift paddy against 100 per cent security from time to time by rotating delivery. The millers warned to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in September if the Government fails to consider their demand. More than 400 millers from different parts of the State and office bearers of State associations from Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry attended."

Booming exports of basmati also resulted in higher returns for the farmers of both states as rates of Pusa Basmati 1121 variety had touched Rs 4,500 per quintal.Manpreet stated that entire basmati industry in the northern states have large exporting units who had expressed their shock over the reported move to include certain area beyond the Indo-Gangetic plains which traditionally never cultivated the aromatic crop. ""Such a step will be detrimental to the aromatic traditional basmati which is the heritage of this region cultivated with the irrigation of five rivers. Basmati of our area will lose its premium tag over other regions,"" he said. In February this year, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) allowed the GI tag on the basmati grown in certain states. Farmers and exporters and Madhya Pradesh wanted to be included in the list of states approved by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the statutory body responsible for export promotion and development of certain scheduled products.IPAB chairman Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal had stated that basmati rice cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on the foothills of the Himalayas covering areas of the rice grown in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, western Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu and Kathua, would be issued the GI tag.According to APEDA, India exported 37 lakh tonnes of basmati rice overseas in 2014-15 valued at Rs 27,597.87 crore. The agency stated India was the world's leading exporter of the rice."
58f4f7b57be9e018510a0792,Squatters ‘safe’ on plot TMC refused,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160814/jsp/nation/story_102399.jsp,2016-08-14,"(Above) The two temples on the plot offered to Trinamul for its party office; rickshaws parked on a portion of the plot on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg. Pictures by Prem Singh.New Delhi, Aug. 13: Santosh Kumar chuckled at the thought that the Trinamul Congress was allotted the plot that is his home in Delhi but dropped it like a hot potato. It was bound to happen, the 34-year-old squatter from Bihars East Champaran district said. Ive been here for long years and have seen thousands come, measure the land and leave. No one ever came to stay. Santosh is one of 1,500-odd encroachers who live in shanties in a 6,000sqm patch of land off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg in central Delhi, from where the Centre recently offered Trinamul a 1,886sqm plot to build an office.But the party was horrified when it found that the plot is home to two temples  one to Sai Baba and the other to Shiva  and refused to accept it. Does Naidu (Venkaiah Naidu, the urban development minister) want us to demolish temples now? Trinamul member Sudip Bandyopadhyay had told The Telegraph on Wednesday night while conveying the partys rejection of the allotment.Santosh is certain that the central government had sold Trinamul a fast one. It was a political ploy, he said. People like us always find plots that lie between temples and mosques to live in  we know that no one will ever touch the area. Some Trinamul sources too said they had a feeling that Naidus ministry had tried to short-change the party by offering it a piece of land that no one wanted. Trinamul sources said the Centre had promised the plot in the days ahead of the passage of the goods and services tax bill, when it needed their partys support, but the allotment came after it was passed. They said that Naidu had been on his best behaviour with senior Trinamul MPs when they approached him for a plot, asking an official in front of them to show the party clean areas to choose from. The area off Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg is prime real estate, located a few kilometres from Parliament and a stones throw from the headquarters of most of the big political parties. But for decades, its been home to rickshaw-pullers, mostly migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal. The rows of parked rickshaws take up a large slice of this tract of land, which has four temples of which two stand bang in the middle of the plot offered to Trinamul. Several eateries stand on the plot: they serve chicken curry and rice to their mostly labourer customers. There are multiple grocery stores and tea stalls, and a barber shop-cum-residence that caters to the nearby slum dwellers. Then theres Santoshs makeshift public telephone booth, which also serves as a ticket counter for travellers and an online service centre that helps the rickshaw-pullers pay their bills and send money home. This land is not ours, and well no doubt have to get out if the government tells us to. It hasnt happened in 20 years, though, said Mahesh Shah, 45, who came from Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh. Shah, a rickshaw-puller, lives on a part of the 1,886sqm plot the Trinamul was offered. Sudip had said that the residents had confronted Trinamul MPs staff when they went to see the plot on Wednesday, prompting them to escape with their lives. But the encroachers this newspaper spoke to denied having had any exchanges with the Trinamul representatives.Sudip said Trinamul was determined to assert its right. They were trying to shuffle on to us a plot no one else wanted. Why should we take such a plot? he told this newspaper on Thursday. What we have asked for is our legitimate right and we should get it. We have conveyed this to Naidu and he has promised that more plots will be shown and we can decide which one to take. This newspaper tried to contact Naidu over the phone at his offices in Parliament and at Shastri Bhavan on Thursday and Friday but his staff said he was busy with meetings. A source close to the minister said that Naidu himself had been surprised that Trinamul had been provided a plot with temples and had advised Sudip not to take it. He has promised him two more plots to choose from, the source said. Sudip confirmed this. But the encroachers are thanking the temples. These temples have saved us. Only someone willing to demolish them will get the plot, but who is going to do that? said Naresh Thakur, 50, the barber who runs his shop adjacent to the Shiva temple and opposite the Sai Baba temple. Nowadays, temples alone are the saviours of the poor, he signed off."
58f221b4a3d24b68099aa776,The race to light up the last village,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-race-to-light-up-the-last-village/article14592893.ece,2016-08-25,"Jalan Singh, 30, has not removed the cardboard carton that protects the sides of his new Godrej refrigerator. You cannot miss the striking red cooling machine in the room. Having spent Rs.12,000 on it, Singh is proud of his acquisition. Sixty-nine years is a short time in an independent countrys life but it has been a long time for power to reach Singhs village, Tanwarpura, an hours drive from Barmer city in Rajasthan. Power that arrived in the village two months ago, although erratic, nudged Singh to buy a refrigerator. He opens it to show it to us, but its empty. The rains may have tripped some lines, a government official offers an explanation. Rains did lash the village a few days ago. Having been consistent this year, they promise good harvest and some extra income. Singhs spirits are not dampened by the temporary absence of electricity; he reels off his wish list: a fan, a cooler, and an atta chakki (flour mill).Rukh Singh, his neighbour, has beaten him to procuring an atta chakki . The flour mill means two extra hours of sleep for his wife. In the early hours before dawn, Tanwarpura wakes up to the sounds of the chakki as women work it to pound flour. With the manual mill, it took my wife four hours to prepare the flour for our daily meals. The electric one takes an hour, Rukh Singh says. His wife smiles behind her veil, allowing Rukh Singh to speak on her behalf.The Singhs got an electricity connection under the Modi governments flagship scheme of rural electrification launched in July 2015, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The governments goal is 100 per cent electrification by 2019. Official estimates peg the number of un-electrified villages in India at 18,452. Of this, the government claims to have electrified 10,097 villages till date, a figure that doesnt go uncontested.The lifelines of a villageAt least there is light, says 34-year-old Chagan Kanwar, a mother of two. Two weeks ago, for the first time, solar energy lit up houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti in Barmer district where she lives. Designated as a Desert National Park area and situated almost at the farthest edge of the State, a few kilometres before the border with Pakistan, the village has around a hundred households. Power for Kanwar means less pollution. The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining, she says. The inhabitants of this basti were accustomed to travelling 25 km to Gadra village to charge their mobile phones. A shopkeeper there would ask for Rs.10 to charge each phone. We used to take 10 phones once a week to get them charged, says Pan Singh. Mobile phones, lifelines for the villagers and the only connection to the outside world, when powered ran for a week.Their main lifeline, however, is the sun. Under the off-grid scheme of DDUGJY, houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti have been provided with a 100W solar panel which can light five LED bulbs, one standing 12W fan, and a socket to charge a mobile phone. These three utilities come as part of the solar kit, a one-time investment of Rs.1,029 which works out to 5 per cent of the total cost incurred to install the kit in every home. There is no burden of electricity bills.The villagers have become so accustomed to the absence of power that even its presence does not prompt them to switch on the fan. The two villages, Tanwarpura and Salam Singh Ki Basti, are examples of the grid and off-grid programmes of the Centre, which are committed to providing electricity in every village. Explaining the decision for this, the Executive Director of Rural Electrification Corporation, Dinesh Arora, says: States have generally preferred and adopted grid connectivity for most of the villages except in areas where connectivity is either not feasible or cost-effective.In Rajasthan, as at the Centre, a Bharatiya Janata Party government is at the helm. Both Central and State officials are racing to power villages, but they are also wary as the media has turned its gaze to the claims made by the government in rural electrification. Officials everywhere are now tutoring villagers on the art of communicating with the media. With a spate of critical reports on the app-based claims of electrification on GARV making the government more watchful, even the hint of a journalist in the remotest of villages sends officials into a tizzy.Promise of powerMeanwhile, in distant Uttar Pradesh, power is a touchy issue, especially as elections are set to take place next year. When the Centre claims credit for any development, the State is quick to point out loopholes.In Anandpur, a village at the edge of Hathras district which is famed for asafoetida, a dried latex that is indispensable to curries and dals (lentil), power comes and goes. A gift from Delhi, an LED bulb, has brought light into the lives of 70-year-old Ram Prasad and 17-year-old Rahul. The electricity meter, wrapped in plastic, is a prized possession and is precariously mounted on the mud wall of the house that has a small porch, a room, and a tube well in the courtyard. There is a toilet too, Prasad points out, seemingly well-versed in the drill of showing to outsiders the trappings of modernity that have crept into the village. The toilet is pitch dark; light hasnt travelled there yet.For rural India, the DDUGJY brings not only the promise of power to every village, but its attendant trappings too. Our ancestors will be happy. They never saw light, says Savitri, a resident, as she begins cooking potatoes and chapattis under the light of a solitary bulb. The bulb has freed her from having to swat insects that she would have otherwise battled with under the light of a kerosene lamp or candle.Glimpses of a fractious relationshipAnandpur is an odd mix of upper castes (mostly Thakurs) and backward castes. Adversity and deprivation is the glue that holds these communities together. Most of the villagers wear a bemused look as officials from the electricity department come inquiring about the availability of power here. Mukesh Kumar from the State Electricity Board examines 18 meters installed in Anandpur and requests people to show their papers. He looks agitated. We were not informed about the installation. What if the villagers refuse to pay for the power or their homes collapse in the rains? he asks. The question hangs in the air, offering a glimpse of the fractious relationship between the Centre and State.The Prime Minister claimed in his Independence Day address that Nagla Fatela, a village in Hathras, was electrified but the media found surprised villagers and a dark village when it reached there. The embarrassment caused by this episode has left everyone on edge here and the U.P. government is determined to keep a check on every connection by sending its officers to the field. Kumar is one of them. Other senior officials have been dispatched from Lucknow. Says Rakesh Verma wryly: Ideally, the village should be getting 14 hours of power but that seldom happens. Lets see what happens after the elections. The officials wait patiently for Anandpurs residents to show their cards. Others who also wait are the men who installed the meters, the Centres officials.The scheme is premised on the Centre and the State working in tandem. The Centre provides the infrastructure; the State provides the power after working out its availability  12-14 hours a day is what has been calculated. The reality plays out differently as power keeps tripping. Young Anshu whispers that she saw a snake first when the light came on some time at night in her thatched hut just two days ago. Snakes are common in the tiny village of Anandpur, which is ringed by paddy fields. The villagers could not steal power like other villages nearby  katiya , or the illegal tapping of power, is rampant there  as high tension wires made that impossible.The power is erratic and the wait long and uncertain. We wait and watch; so do Savitri and Rahul. Everyone looks at the cooler fan installed upside down, a common jugaad in these parts, which works when the electricity comes. This is a welcome addition to their huts as it helps make the nights less muggy.In Anandpur, the monthly income of a family of five rarely exceeds Rs.2,000. Electricity is a luxury. Agricultural holdings are small, and income is supplemented by selling milk. The villagers are worried; they ask as they wait for the power to come, Do we have to pay the bill? As per the plan, the village will get power from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pointing out the absurdity of the schedule, an official on a visit to the village says, We dont draw the plan. We follow instructions from Delhi. Contesting this, Mr. Arora says, The responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.These villagers are the Antyodaya card holders. In other words, they are the poorest of the poor whose entitlements are a few kilograms of rice and two litres of kerosene a month. The supplies get exhausted quickly and they are forced to purchase these goods from the open market. The nearest school is 2 km away and the villagers are wary of sending their girls to school. Rahul is studying for an examination and he finds the light a godsend. I can study now when the light comes; I dont have to study under the lamp, he says, wistful though for a regular supply.The State government is working out a way to regulate the tariff so that people pay for the power they consume. From the headquarters in Lucknow, the chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Desh Deepak Verma, has been keeping a watch ever since false claims were made about electrification, by dispatching officials to the ground. He says the problem is with the definition of an electrified village. One in 10 homes is all that a series of schemes have focussed on. What about the 9 others? And within the 10 per cent, only poles have reached some villages; last mile connectivity is still distant.Its 6.30 p.m. when dusk falls to herald the night. Thirty hours have passed, but Tanwarpura has no power. Is it because of the rains? Electricity is transformative, but only when it is available, Rukh Singh says. We get it for about two hours a day. A tiny bulb dispels darkness in Jethmal Singhs house. I got my connection under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) governments Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) before it was re-christened by the BJP government as DDUGJY. Only five connections have come in the last six months under the DDUGJY, he says. Thirty of the 35 households which have electricity in this village were electrified under the RGGVY. A Tata Sky dish hangs at the back of Jethmals house. The TV, however, is missing.On August 12, the governments field engineer encouraged us to purchase a television so that we could tune in to Prime Minister Narendra Modis Independence Day address. We bought the set on the 13th, he says. People gathered in Jethmal Singhs house on August 15. But the TV conked off after the Prime Ministers speech and has been sent for repair.Bhiram, who lives ten minutes away from Jethmals house in the nearby village of Tirsingra, also listened to the Prime Minister speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort. The field engineer told me that light would reach my village too, he says. But there was a problem. In April 2015, the government identified 34 un-electrified villages in Barmer. Tirsingra was not one of them.Un-electrified and not on the listA hundred kilometres away from Tirsingra, Mahadev Nagar has a similar story. There is no power in the village and it is not on the governments radar. Surta Ram, 40, calls fellow villagers to gather on the lawns of the primary school to discuss the problems related to lack of power. Photographs of Indira Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar hang prominently in his house. He calls himself a samaaj sevi (social worker). For the last five years, we have been contacting government officials at all levels: the Collector, the MLA, and others. Now they tell us that our name is not in the government survey, he says. Ten days ago, the MLA said that our village will see light this Diwali. Lets see.Mahadev Nagar has a primary health centre, a facility that other villages mentioned as lacking here. But it is just a building. There is no doctor here. No one wants to come here because there is no electricity, Surta Ram says.Adds 39-year-old Puga Ram: Yesterday, three malaria patients had to travel for 5-10 km for injections. The ambulance also doesnt come inside our village. Puga Ram teaches in the village school and is concerned about the childrens education. This is the age of computers. How will these kids get digital literacy if there is no electricity, he asks, distressed. There are five classrooms in the school; one is under construction. The heat inside the room compels the teacher to take his classes on the sands outside under the trees. Misra Ram shows a receipt of Rs.200 dated November 2015. For electricity connections, we had to apply in groups of five. A hundred such forms have been sent from our village. I have applied thrice. But there is no progress, he says.All conversations with the villagers start and end with electricity. Its announcement and presence have fuelled aspirations long bottled up.Back in Salam Singh Ki Basti, Abdul Khan shakes his head, disgruntled with the governments solar-powered electricity scheme that is oddly restrictive as well as liberating. We wanted electricity powered by the grid. The current set-up limits us to a few predefined utilities. There is nothing more that we can do with this, he says. The power limitation of the solar kit doesnt allow them to use other appliances. Unlike in Tanwarpura, electricity in this village doesnt match aspirations. Also, the government is advocating for one kit that fits all. This means that the village school in Salam Singh Ki Basti gets the same set kit as the houses. There are multiple classrooms, but only one fan.In the summer heat in Anandpur, 70-year-old Prasad dreams. Now that we have seen light, we have become a little greedy. Dil aur chahta hai (the heart desires more), he says. That means a few hours more hours of light. And a fan that will make the summer more bearable.The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining.

With no local takers for the aromatic paddy, the 40-year-old from Badi, which falls in Raisen district, was told he could get a good price for it at Delhis Narela mandi or Kota in Rajasthan, both many hundred kilometers away.I wondered whether it was worth the trouble going all the way there, recalls Tomar. The long road journey to Narela may only have further sowed seeds of doubt over his decision to switch from growing regular high-yielding paddy.But today, basmati is my main crop, declares this science graduate, who grows Pusa Basmati-1 (PB-1), a variety bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, on his entire 35-acres farmland. He devotes more resources and attention to it than even wheat, which is cultivated during the rabi winter season and sold to government agencies at the official minimum support price (MSP).Tomar used to previously cultivate paddy varieties such as Mahamaya and Kranti, which gave yields of up to 30 quintals per acre. PB-1 yields are lower at 18-22 per acre. The difference, however, is in prices.Ten years ago, ordinary paddy sold at Rs 600 per quintal. Even today, the governments MSP is only Rs 1,470. In basmati, prices rose as high as Rs 3,900 per quintal in 2013. They have fallen since to Rs 2,000, but are still more than that of non-basmati, he points out.Tomar is among the many farmers in this area  having assured irrigation, thanks to the Barna Dam completed in the late 1970s  who have stopped planting regular paddy or soyabean in the kharif season. They have prospered by switching to a crop that is now a bone of contention between Madhya Pradesh (MP) and the northern states led by Punjab and Haryana.All the three are, incidentally, ruled by the BJP either by itself or in alliance.At the heart of the dispute is MP staking claim for inclusion of 13 of its districts  from Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri and Guna in the north to Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur in the central-south  in the Geographical Indication (GI) area officially demarcated for basmati cultivation.As of now, only seven states in the Indo-Gangetic plains on the foothills of the Himalayas  Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu & Kashmir  have been granted GI certification rights for growing basmati.The states that have been issued the GI tag  mainly millers and farmers in Punjab and Haryana  are vociferously opposed to extending the same to MP. Their contention is that the state neither has a history nor the specific agro-climatic conditions suitable for basmati cultivation.But for farmers here, basmati is what has brought them prosperity that was non-existent till a decade ago. Tomar may have, then, struggled to dispose of his crop. But that changed with the entry of millers, who sensed an opportunity to procure basmati from MP at rates lower than what it cost in the traditional northern belt.LT Foods Limited was the first mover. The company, which sells basmati rice under the well-known Daawat brand, went on to establish a state-of-the-art plant in 2006 at Mandideep, about 20 km from Bhopal. In no time, many others also moved in. They included S.S.A International and Narmada Cereals Pvt. Ltd, which have also set up milling facilities at Mandideep, technically in Raisen district.There is no dearth of buyers for basmati, unlike wheat, where we are entirely dependent on the government. Nor do we have to go to any procurement centre to sell, as the company agents come to us directly to purchase from our doorstep. And the basmati crop does not fail from less or more rains, which is not so with soyabean, notes Sunil Sharma.This 40-acre farmer, also from Badi, took to basmati after seeing Punjabi Jat Sikh farmers settled in the region growing it.The Class XI-pass Sharma owns a Mahindra Bolero SUV, while his friend and fellow-farmer Mukesh Chouhan drives a Scorpio.Many people in these parts have purchased four-wheelers and even property 100 km away in Bhopal. It is all only due to basmati. Yes, prices had shot up to Rs 4,000/quintal three years ago and are now half of that. But things are still better than 10 years ago, when we did not even have our own tractors, he points out.These farmers are equally clear that they cannot be denied the right to cultivate basmati, in the name of GI protection. We did not oppose their getting the GI, why should they oppose ours, then? Punjab is, no doubt, the leader in agriculture, but we are trying to catch up. Whats wrong in that? retorts Sharma.The primary argument of the northern millers and farmers  supported by the scientific community and bodies like APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority)  is that MP never had any tradition of basmati cultivation, a prerequisite for grant of GI. They started growing basmati only from the start of this century. All this pressure to include MP is for just helping one company, said a Delhi-based miller, while alluding to LT Foods.The company, however, denies the charge of the MP government fighting a proxy war on its behalf. We buy less than 15 per cent of the states total basmati paddy production. The rest is bought by many others, including millers and traders in North India, says Rajinder Wadhawan, Director (Operations) at LT Foods.MPs farmers are the ones who would be affected the most, in the event of the state government losing the GI battle, he adds.According to Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary (Agriculture) in the MP government, the state has submitted evidence, including documents and publications dating back to the British era, to prove that basmati was being cultivated in the relevant districts long enough to warrant a GI tag.That evidence was, however, not accepted by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, which, in an order on February 5, directed the MP government to file additional evidence. The latter has since challenged the order and the matter is currently before the Madras High Court.All this wrangling comes even as basmati exports from India have shown a decline in the last couple of years, after posting a more than ten-fold jump to over Rs 29,000 crore between 2006-07 and 2013-14.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive.The spread of basmati cultivation, beyond its traditional confines of undivided pre-Partition Punjab, Jammu, West Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, can be put down to a single phenomenon: Advances in crop breeding.The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive. They needed a short day length for flowering; the plants would simply not produce flowers until the sunshine hours fell to 12 or less.That condition was available from end-September  when the kharif paddy crop should normally commence flowering  only in the north/northwest parts of the subcontinent on either side of the Indus River. In central and southern India, the day length was 14 hours or more through October. These areas couldnt, therefore, grow or at least had no recorded history of farming basmati in contiguous stretches.This changed, though, with the release of improved basmati varieties from the late 1980s. These strains  especially Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509, bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  were not just high-yielding, but also relatively less sensitive to photoperiod or day length variations, giving more planting time flexibility. Since they could flower even when sunshine hours were long, farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh could now grow them.But as AK Singh, head of the Division of Genetics at IARI, points out, the grains from the basmati paddy cultivated in the non-traditional belts have quality issues. Basmati rices most distinctive trait  apart from long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking, and fluffiness  lies in its aroma, which, in turn, derives from a compound called 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline. The accumulation of this highly volatile compound in the grain, contributing to basmatis characteristic fragrance, is largely a function of environmental conditions.The retention of aroma, courtesy 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline, is best when the flowering and grain-filling phase coincides with a cool climate, with temperatures below 30 degree Celsius during daytime and just over 20 degrees at night. These conditions are, again, obtained during October only in the traditional basmati belt.Moreover, it isnt aroma alone. Higher temperatures during the roughly one-month period from flowering to maturity can also affect the texture and milling quality of the grain. When temperatures are high at the time of grain-filling, the packing of the starch granules in the rice tends to be loose. So, you get grains with more chalkiness (opaque areas caused by incomplete filling) and resulting in higher percentage of broken rice during milling, explains Singh.What all this means is that Pusa-1121 basmati can well be grown in MP or Maharashtra. But the aroma, appearance and milling quality of the grain produced from there cannot really match what one would get from the basmati grown in Amritsar, Karnal, Kathua, Kangra or Dehradun. The cooler climate during the critical crop maturity and grain-filling period in those parts cannot possibly be replicated elsewhere. And theres little even plant breeding science can do about it.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

As his quest to add movement to the dolls depicting the different small forms of Krishna Leela began in 1947-48, it was the eco-friendly way that he went for.Putting together aluminium from old clothes hangers, circular wood cut out from rolling pins, cycle rims, old levers, pulleys, ropes and other things lying at home, the 88-year old retired medical professional has since then managed to extend his hobby to family members and devotees who form a beeline year after year with the stories of Lord Krishna in continued sustained motion.""I wanted to do something new, ahead of what was being done by my elders at home back then. Studying at Kanpur medical college that time helped me a great deal in understanding human body movements, which I developed into all these dolls, without even having any knowledge of mechanics,"" said Dr Mathur , who did his MBBS from King George's Medical University and retired as additional director of medical health, Uttar Pradesh.From the aura behind the head of Lord Vishnu , to the chakra moving continuously on his finger, the shadow display of Kans to Lord Krishna opening up his mouth to show mother Yashoda the universe within, from the water play during Holi to the 'cheer haran' of Draupadi - all stories with limb movements of the wooden dolls have been made by him.While it takes around 25-30 days for the entire tableau to be assembled, the entire family, from Mathur's children and grand children, all has a role to play. ""I paint the dolls' face now, earlier my aunt used to do that. My father narrates the stories to people who flock our home for the six days. Every person has a department to take care, from sewing clothes for the dolls, to assistance with the mechanics,"" said Shubhra Mathur , the third generation. Regular visitors come in every evening and schoolchildren come in during mornings for the tableau to be up at the house till August 31.""The most difficult movement to solve was in the story of Krishna-Sudama , where I had to depict snatching of the rice packet. The Mahabharat scene with Krishna lying in the bed, getting up and turning his neck was also a difficult one. But it all came God gifted for me to solve,"" said Mathur, sitting in his Khurram Nagar house."

He is an artist-par-excellence who single-handedly sculpted the Big Foot at Lotoulim and created Ancestral Goa which is a famous tourist attraction in the state. But, very few know that he has a huge collection of 3,123 idols of Lord Ganesha and it is growing with time.These idols of Lord Ganesha are in different hues made of stone, glass, metal, wood, leaf, grain, porcelain, gold and silver either gifted, collected or bought from various parts of Indian and abroad, over a period of more than last two decades.Such is his craze for rare idols that he collected the idols from many parts of India like Sawantwadi, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Orissa, Maharashtra and foreign countries like Nepal, Burma, Malaysia, Tibet and China.Call it a passion or devotion that he gradually developed, Alvares has a carving of Lord Ganesha on a rice grain and the biggest is 12 inches.Speaking to TOI, Alvares said his collection was accidental. He was mostly invited for judging community (sarvajanik) installation of Lord Ganesha during the festival. As a momento, he received these idols which were lying with him. One fine day, he decided to display it in his museum. To his surprise, his friends started gifting him with Ganesha idols from various places in India and foreign countries. His friend Anand Khandeparkar then gifted him with the antique piece and thus his collection started growing.""I am in the process of categorizing them in different folk art to bring out the folklore of that particular place. Ganesha, being the 'God of Nature', in Sawantwadi, most of the time they carve it in wood, in Orissa they do it in metal (wire), Jaipur in stone, so on and so forth. In some places, artisans do it on grains, hence it is a befitting to Lord Ganesha,"" says Alvares."

India had demanded market access for products including non-basmati rice, pharmaceuticals and several fruits & vegetables among others.Indias goods trade deficit with China has surged from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16. Beijing has been denying market access to India's non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its concerns included the likelihood of a pest called Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.China was the worlds largest rice importer in 2015-16 followed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq.Mill inspectionOfficial sources said after several requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials have finally agreed to visit India during September 19-28 to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are situated in states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.To export to countries including China, it is mandatory for Indian rice exporters to be registered with the NPPO  the Indian government body in charge for inspecting these mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO will assist its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection from September 19-28 for pest risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian commerce ministry is also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.The inspection is a very significant stage in the process, A. K. Gupta, Director (Basmati Export Development Foundation, foreign trade, World Trade Organisation-related matters & agri-export zones), APEDA, said. He expressed hope that following the inspection, China will soon issue a formal notification regarding permission for non-basmati rice exports from India.The Chinese authorities had carried out a similar inspection in 2009, following which in 2011-12, they gave their nod to basmati exports from India to China, Mr. Gupta added.Pointing out that the 19 mills are involved in processing non-basmati and basmati rice, he said, therefore, the inspection will cover both varieties.Rajen Sundaresan, Executive Director, All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA), said he was also hopeful that the Chinese authorities will shortly give green signal for non-basmati rice exports from India to China. He said a recent joint survey done by AIREA and the leading agro-chemical (including pesticides) firm UPL found that the allegations regarding the presence of Khapra beetle in processed Indian rice were wrong and vastly exaggerated.Pakistani importsPointing out that China imports non-basmati rice from Pakistan, Mr. Sundaresan said Beijings objection to Indian non-basmati export seems more political in nature than anything else.Trade sources said there are reports of rice (basmati & non-basmati) exports from India to China happening through Hong Kong and Thailand. In 2015-16, India exported 6.2 million tonnes of non-basmati rice worth Rs.15,000 crore, he said."

Mangla said the directions to the police were issued in the wake of a number of specific complaints that the biryani vendors were serving beef. After Mewat, sampling will be done in other districts as well.Why just biryani and not any other preparation like mutton curry and kebabs? Mangla believes he has got the logic right. ""Selling beef openly is difficult,"" he says. "" According to the complaints we received, the vendors are mixing a little rice with the meat to camouflage it.""Haryana has one of the most stringent cow slaughter acts in the country with a maximum jail term of 10 years.The police have been told to immediately book vendors if they find beef. ""At the same time, we have also asked the food and drug administration to ensure early reports of tests,"" he said.Former minister and senior Congress leader from Mewat, Aftab Ahmed has termed the move as an attempt by the BJP government to embarrass and humiliate the particular community and a particular district. ""This violates constitutional provisions of people's right to work,"" he said. ""This is totally vague, unjustified and targeting of a particular community."" The Ayog has even pinpointed specific areas with beef trouble. These include Ghaseda, Nuh, Ferozpur Jhirka, Rawali, Nagina, Pingawa, Bhadas, Malab, Punhana, Shikrawa and Choukha.Mangla will be convening the meeting of preachers and the prominent persons in the district and ask them to spread the word that beef should be totally avoided during the festival.Arora, on the other hand, said the police have already started collecting samples. ""So far, we had selectively collected samples, but now the sampling will be random, targeting all vendors selling biryani,"" she said."
58f6d59fa3d24b0b70c2f7a7,Dark clouds over the PDS,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Dark-clouds-over-the-PDS/article14631425.ece,2016-09-10,"Indias Public Distribution System (PDS) has improved steadily during the last 10 years. The system used to be most ineffective and corruption-ridden, with leakages of around 50 per cent at the national level, going up to 80 or 90 per cent in some States. Around 2007, Chhattisgarh took the lead in reforming the PDS  making it more inclusive, methodical and transparent. Within a few years, the system was overhauled. Today, most rural households in Chhattisgarh have a ration card, and are able to secure their entitlements (typically 7 kg of rice per person per month) on time every month.The Chhattisgarh modelLater on, it turned out that the Chhattisgarh model (so to speak) was replicable. Odisha was among the first States to emulate Chhattisgarhs experience, with similar results. Many other States also initiated Chhattisgarh-style PDS reforms: broad coverage, clear entitlements, de-privatisation of PDS shops, separation of transport agencies from distribution agencies, computerisation, fixed distribution schedules, tight monitoring, active grievance redressal, and more.In the last few years, I have been involved in several surveys of the PDS initiated by independent researchers with student volunteers. In 2011, we studied the PDS in nine States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. We found that the system was working reasonably well for below poverty line (BPL) households: on average, they were receiving 84 per cent of their foodgrain entitlements from the PDS. A similar picture emerged from a follow-up survey in 2013. However, high leakages continued in the above poverty line (APL) quota, which tended to be used by the Central government at that time as a dumping ground for excess food stocks.The National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted three years ago, was  and still is  a chance to complete the process of PDS reform and ensure a modicum of food security for everyone. Under the NFSA, the APL category is abolished and eligible households come under two well-defined categories: priority households, entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at nominal prices, and Antyodaya households (the poorest), entitled to 35 kg per household per month. The PDS is to cover at least 75 per cent of rural households at the national level, rising to 80-90 per cent in the poorest States.Impending setbackIn June this year, we went back to six of Indias poorest States (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal) for an update. We found that four out of six had a fairly good PDS, with most NFSA cardholders receiving the bulk of their entitlements every month and relatively low exclusion errors. The last two, Jharkhand and especially Bihar, still have a long way to go. Even there, however, the situation is much better than it was a few years ago. In Jharkhand, for instance, the transparency of the system has vastly improved, and the official NFSA website is among the best in the country. However, recent progress is in danger of being undone soon due to the Central governments counter-productive push for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. This involves installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at PDS shops, and verifying the identity of cardholders by matching their fingerprints against the Aadhaar database over the Internet.This system requires multiple fragile technologies to work at the same time: the PoS machine, the biometrics, the Internet connection, remote servers, and often other elements such as the local mobile network. Further, it requires at least some household members to have an Aadhaar number, correctly seeded in the PDS database.This is a wholly inappropriate technology for rural India, especially in the poorest States. Even in State capitals, network failures and other glitches routinely disable this sort of technology. In villages with poor connectivity, it is a recipe for chaos. Note that Internet dependence is inherent to Aadhaar since there is no question of downloading the biometrics.Recent developments in Rajasthan illustrate the dangers of forcing biometric authentication on the PDS. During the last few months, the Government of Rajasthan has tried hard to enforce the system. The use of PoS machines is compulsory and every PDS shop has one. Yet, according to official data compiled by Nikhil Dey, only 61 per cent of Rajasthans foodgrain allocation found its way through the PoS system in July 2016, with a similar figure (63 per cent) for August. The rest is either siphoned off or delivered using the old register system  which of the two is hard to say since utter confusion prevails about the permissibility of using registers as a fallback option.Further evidence comes from Ranchi district in Jharkhand where the PoS system is also mandatory. In July 2016, NFSA cardholders in Ranchi district received less than half of their foodgrain entitlements through that system, according to the model website mentioned earlier. The situation was much the same in August.As in Rajasthan, it is not clear whether those for whom the PoS system does not work in Ranchi are getting any grain through the old register system. Officially, that is not allowed, according to local PDS dealers and officials (indeed, some dealers have been suspended for using this fallback option). Even if it happens unofficially, this dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the PoS system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst. The reason is that only PDS dealers know whether and when the register system is permissible, and they have no incentive to share that information with the cardholders. Quite likely, the new system is reviving PDS corruption in Jharkhand, reversing a healthy trend towards lower leakages in recent years.A short visit to a PDS shop just outside Ranchi quickly brings out the multiple vulnerabilities of the new system. Within minutes we met many people who had been deprived of their food rations for months because they had no Aadhaar number; or because their Aadhaar number had not been correctly seeded; or because their biometrics did not work, or simply because the PoS machine returned various error messages.Even those for whom the system works face huge inconvenience. Often they have to make repeated trips to the PDS shop, or send different members in turn, until the machine cooperates. Sometimes schoolchildren are asked to skip classes and try their luck at the PDS shop. This unreliable system causes a colossal waste of time for everyone.By the way, all this is one year after I was told by the Food Departments upbeat consultants that the PoS system is functional throughout Ranchi district.The Aadhaar juggernautIn spite of ample warnings, the Central government continues to push for compulsory Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. Incidentally, this is a violation of Supreme Court orders. The court did allow the use of Aadhaar in the PDS, but not making it compulsory for PDS users. Nor can the government invoke the Aadhaar Act to justify this move: the relevant sections of the Act are yet to be notified.PoS machines seem to be expected to ensure a corruption-free PDS. This expectation, however, builds on a misunderstanding of PDS leakages. The main vulnerability today, at least in the States I am familiar with, is not identity fraud (e.g. bogus cards), but quantity fraud: PDS dealers often give people less than what they are entitled to, and pocket the rest. PoS machines are ineffective in preventing quantity fraud. They may help in reducing identity fraud, such as it is, but that does not justify depriving people of their food entitlements when the technology fails.As with many other applications of Aadhaar, this one is proceeding like a juggernaut, without paying serious attention to the collateral damage. Instead, the Central government peddles bogus figures of Aadhaar-enabled financial savings (often relayed by unsuspecting columnists or economists) to justify further imposition of the technology. It is only when concerned journalists, activists or researchers make enquiries from the victims that we learn about the adverse effects of Aadhaar on the PDS.The Central government and its advisers pride themselves on their commitment to evidence-based policy, but this is a case where evidence is being systematically ignored to press on with technological solutions based on blind faith (handsomely nurtured by commercial interests). The drive to impose biometric authentication on the PDS must stop immediately to avoid further damage. There are better ways of plugging last-mile leakages, including the use of simpler technologies not dependent on the Internet. Imposing a technology that does not work on people who depend on it for their survival is a grave injustice.Jean Drze is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University.The dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the Aadhaar-based Point of Sale system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst"

(Are you from the PK team?) Thats the question on the lips of most farmers turning up for the roadshows as the Rahul Gandhi caravan rolled into Jaunpur, at the end of the first leg of his yatra that started from Gorakhpur and covered 100 Assembly constituencies in eastern-central Uttar Pradesh, straddling Awadh and Poorvanchal.The Congress party has only one MLA from these 100 seats at present  this is Samajwadi Party turf mostly, accounting for Muslim-heavy areas like Azamgarh.An answer in the negative to that question sees the farmer losing interest and turning away in quest of someone from the PK team.The reference is to Congress strategist Prashant Kishor, and this parallel buzz shows how the Congress party is building up some momentum in its bid to revive itself in this huge swathe of Uttar Pradesh.Prashant Kishor is moving around with a team of partymen who are armed with forms, where the most relevant entries relate to the loan/debt owed by the farmers. Locals are zeroing in on the team in the belief that this is a quasi-official exercise that will ultimately lead to a loan waiver, as Rahul has been promising in his speeches.Theres something markedly different here from the last Assembly poll campaign. There too, Rahul had campaigned but Akhilesh Yadav ended up getting the votes. But it was an optics-heavy approach last time  Rahul would walk through the rice fields, occasionally picking up a poor child on his shoulders. This time, he has focused more tightly on farmers issues. The tactics are more process-oriented.A well-mounted PK style campaign, it is aimed at gathering steam on the way, which it is doing.And its running on the shoulders of local leaders  they are gathering people, also providing funds for local coordination. Unlike the impression people in Delhi may have of a dormant party structure, Youth Congress and NSUI cadre are visible on the roads. Rahul, when hes travelling within a town, uses an open-top SUV. Bottles of water are kept at the ready (so that no repeat of Sonias Varanasi fiasco happens).On the highways, he shifts to a huge bus  done up with slogans in Hindi on loan waiver, cut in bijli (power) price and hikes in MSP. The faces of a lot of local leaders adorn the sides of the bus too, along with that of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi.Saturday afternoon, ahead of a two-day break for Eid, Rahul stops for lunch at a madrassa in Jaunpur. The bawarchi (cook) is from Lucknow, says an insider.Thats typical. A common touch, along with food fit for the nawabs.Heavy SPG deployment is of course part of the bargain. They are constantly sanitising the route.During a roadshow at the Malipur chauraha, an SPG man was seen sanitising the fat marigold garland that is to be put around Rahul over and over again. In his speech, he picks up one Guptaji for cross-questioning on the petrol price, job creation and topics like that.Janta trast, Modi mast (people in distress, Modi in delight) is a favourite one-liner for Rahul.After the Eid break, the caravan will resume its journey into central and south UP from Allahabad, K Raju, Rahuls close aide, tells Express. Just a two-day break, then we are back on the road. Less khat Sabha (cot conference) more roadshows."
58ff20807be9e0420db2d1b8,Bengal part of Patanjali's Rs 50000cr vision,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160912/jsp/business/story_107615.jsp,2016-09-12,"Haridwar, Sept. 11: Yoga guru Ramdev plans to invest Rs 3,000-5,000 crore to set up half-a-dozen plants across the country to manufacture Patanjali ayurvedic medicines and consumer food products. The company is also scouting for a site in Bengal to set up a rice-based food products plant. ""I plan to set up six plants as we cannot meet demands from our mother plant at Haridwar. In the east, I have identified Guwahati for an ayurvedic plant. I am also looking to set up a plant in Bengal to produce rice-based fast moving consumer goods, rice bran oil, packaged rice and more,"" Ramdev told The Telegraph. Ramdev claims that the Patanjali brand will have a turnover of about Rs 10,000 crore by the end of this fiscal and grow into a Rs 50,000-crore business empire in the next five years. The saffron-robed yoga guru has zeroed in on Guwahati, Jammu, Indore, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh for the plants. ""Till now, we have funded our own expansion. We are a zero-debt operation. Now, we will take loan from banks,"" he said. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, founded by Ramdev and his friend Acharya Balkrishna on the outskirts of Haridwar in 2006, has become one of the country's fastest-growing companies, producing a host of ayurvedic drugs as well as fast-moving consumer goods, including flour, rice, honey and children's health drink. It sells over 800 products. The Patanjali group, which has been witnessing frenzied sales, has started hiring business professionals from multinationals. Rivals such as HLL, ITC and advertising giant Mudra have been tapped for talent. ""Many nationalist-minded people working for MNCs want to join us,"" Ramdev said. He said the plant in Bengal would be set up to produce rice products and rice bran oil. ""We will be setting up units to produce refined oil without a chemical process. We will use the old process (kachi ghani) to refine oil. Processing of refined oil using chemicals, which MNCs do, is very harmful and can lead to ailments,"" Ramdev said. The plant in Assam will manufacture FMCG products to cater to the demand from the east and the Northeast. Patanjali Ayurved has reported a Rs 5,000-crore turnover in March 2016, up from Rs 450 crore in 2012, an eleven-fold growth in less than four years. ""We are building a chain of factories to support our network. We are also investing significantly in research and will run the whole gamut of stringent testing to check the safety of our products,"" said Ramdev. The impressive growth has come on the back of a well-knit team. Overhead costs have been kept low. Also, free-air time has helped to push sales. According to a research by Edelweiss, Patanjali's strength lies in pricing and low ad-spend. Its products are priced at about 15-30 per cent discount to competition, while its ad spend in the initial years were negligible compared with 12-18 per cent of sales for rivals. However, in the second phase of market penetration, Patanjali has seen a massive surge in print and points of sales advertisements, which analysts estimate to be worth about Rs 300 crore annually. Edelweiss said the company's growth was being driven by its largest-selling products, such as cow ghee (about Rs 1,200 crore in 2015-16), followed by toothpaste Dant Kanti and hair oil Kesh Kanti. Besides Patanjali noodles, it plans to introduce products such as Dant Kanti Advance, sugar-free chyawanprash, PowerVita, Seabuck thorn dietary supplement and powdered hair dye."

The good Southwest monsoons this year is expected to boost production of most crops above last years levels. Given that food crops account for around two thirds of the agriculture output, and that kharif grain contributed around half the total annual grain output, it is a good breakthrough for the agriculture sector where growth has slumped from a high of 4.2% in 2013-14 to a negative 0.2% in 2014-15 and a meagre 1.1% in 2015-16.Improved supply of food grains will also help soften food prices which has been one of the bugbears that has rankled policy makers, especially the central bank which has had a tough time trying to hold down inflation rates. This is especially because rice output has gone up to record highs. The higher coarse grain output, primed mainly by the record output of maize, will also help bring down prices of an important product consumed by low income groups.Especially reassuring for the government is the surge in output of pulses by more than half to 8.7 million tons mainly boosted by the significant improvement in area and productivity of tur and urad dal. This would help bring down pulse prices, which has hit the roof for some time now, and help cool down food prices substantially.Among other major crops oilseeds have also registered a boom in output this year. However, sugarcane production is expected to be hit in the current year. However, the surprise is the increase in cotton output despite the fall in cropped area, mainly due to the increase in productivity. Overall the first advance estimates of crop production in the middle of fiscal year will be a major boost to consumer and investor confidence in the coming months.Given the optimism on the farm front this is the ripe time for the government to push forward with its efforts to extend important schemes like the extension of farm insurance and e-marketing to a majority of the farm households. Though the number of farmers benefiting from the national agriculture insurance scheme has gone up in recent times only about a fifth of the farmers has been covered in the last kharif crop. Numbers show that crop insurance covers at least half the farmers in only two states: Maharashtra and Rajasthan. However, in states like Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh less than a tenth of the farmers are covered by crop insurance.The other important intervention of the NDA government has been on extending ecommerce facilities to farmers. The idea is to extend electronic trading facilities in 585 regulated wholesale markets by 2018 so that farmers can trade the produce across the nation without any hurdles. Though the plan was to link up 200 markets by September this year and another 200 markets by March 2017 the government has been able to link up only about 23 wholesaled regulated markets in 8 states to the national portal.This not only points to the lackadaisical approach of the states government to freeing the farmers from the clutches of the middlemen but also the strong political links of the trader cartel which not only deprive the farmers of the gains of any increase in food prices but also cause supply bottlenecks to crash prices. Extending the reach of the farm markets should now get the top priority of the government and push it to roll out the program to meet deadlines."
58f6ab757be9e031f13b9aa6,Rural girls chase big-city dreams,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Rural-girls-chase-big-city-dreams/articleshow/54506017.cms,2016-09-25,"BENGALURU: The factory floor is going full throttle when the new girls walk in. Everywhere is the thrumming of sewing machines, the hum of fans, the faint burning smell of steam irons. On narrow tables that run between the machines, half-assembled Marks & Spencer miniskirts are thrust forward by fistfuls. The tailors, absorbed in the task of finishing 100 pieces per hour, for once turn their heads to look.The new girls smell of the village. They have sprinklings of pimples. They woke well before dawn to prepare themselves for their first day of work, leaning over one another's faces in silence to shape the edges of each eyebrow with a razor blade. Their braids bounce to their hips, tight and glossy, as if woven by a surgeon. On their ankles are silver chains hung with bells, so when they walk in a group, they jingle.But it is impossible to hear this sound over the racket on the factory floor. The tailors glance up for only a moment, long enough to take in an experiment. The new workers  teenagers, most of them  have been recruited from remote villages to help factories like this one meet the global demand for cheap garments. But there is also social engineering going on.A government program has drawn the trainees from the vast population of rural Indian women who spend their lives doing chores. In 2012, the last time the government surveyed its citizens about their occupation, an astonishing 205 million women between the ages of 15 and 60 responded ""attending to domestic duties.""Economists, with increasing urgency, say India will not fulfill its potential if it cannot put them to work in the economy. They say that if female employment were brought on par with male employment in India, the nation's gross domestic product would expand by as much as 27 percent.Experiments like the one in Bangalore run against deep currents in India, whose guiding voice, Mohandas K. Gandhi, envisioned a socialist future built on the small-scale economy of the village. They also collide spectacularly with an old way of life, in which girls are kept in seclusion until they can be transferred to another family through arranged marriage.Bangalore is the first city the 37 trainee tailors have seen. They are dazzled by the different kinds of light. Picking their way through the alleys around the factory, a column of virgins from the countryside, they stare up at an apartment building that towers over the neighborhood and wish their mothers could see it.Among them are two sisters, Prabhati and Shashi Das. They have come from a village at the end of a road, a place so conservative that the single time they went to a movie theater, their male cousins and uncles created a human chain around them, their big hands linked, to protect them from any contact with outside men. They are, as far as they know, the first unmarried women who have ever migrated from the village to work.Neighbors in the village are waiting to see what happens. The nasty ones say, with obvious relish, it will end badly. They whisper about migrant workers whose eyes were removed by organ traders while they slept. They say Prabhati and Shashi will be ""used this way and that.""Still, they go. Prabhati, at 21, is stubborn and able, and Shashi, two years her junior, pretty and fizzing with suppressed laughter. The two sisters hook pinkies when they walk down the lane that leads to the factory.""All the flirts and ruffians in the whole world must have been born on this lane,"" Shashi grumbles, but she is laughing. Attention is like water to her.The sisters are waiting, too, to see what will happen to them. They are both at the age when they could be summoned at any moment to be displayed to a family of strangers as a potential daughter-in-law. And each of them wants something else, something impossible.It is late May, the first day of their factory summer  of love letters folded into squares and dropped onto work stations; of fevers sweated out on the floor of a bare hostel room; of supervisors shouting in a language they do not understand, a couple of words  ""work"" and ""faster""  gradually becoming clear; of capitalism, of men and of a bit of freedom.It all started in March, in the drippy jungle of rural Odisha, when two distant relatives happened to meet on the roadside.One of the men had found employment as a ""mobilizer"" for Gram Tarang, a for-profit agency contracted by India's government to recruit and train workers. He mentioned that Gram Tarang was offering a cash incentive  roughly 450 rupees, or about $6.75, a head  to mobilizers who identified young women willing to enroll in a training program for garment factory jobs.The second man, Hemant Das, perked up, sensing the approach of a change of career. Hemant had an underfed look and teeth rimmed with tobacco stains. Among the first college graduates from his family, he had tried his hand at laying bricks, tutoring schoolchildren, programming computers, setting up wedding tents and waiting tables before finally falling back on the only job widely available to men here, working as a field hand for 200 rupees a day.Hemant was from a village called Ishwarpur, and as it happened, idle young women were something Ishwarpur had in great quantity. That they could be monetized came as good news.On its economic merits alone, Hemant figured, the government scheme would prove tempting: After two months of training, their daughters would be placed in a factory in the industrial center of Bangalore, where they would earn the legal minimum wage, 7,187 rupees per month, or about $108, which is more than most of their fathers make. Six months after arriving in Bangalore, they would be free to return home if they wished.Hemant set out the next day with a fistful of pamphlets and an uncharacteristically sunny disposition. But as he made his rounds of local families  30 of them, at least  they shook their heads. No.""Letting go of female children is dishonorable, in itself,"" explained Pramanand Das, who presides over an informal family council.Minati Das, the mother of a 19-year-old, got to the point quicker.""Not everyone wants a daughter-in-law who is a working woman,"" she said. ""They think she has lost her chastity.""Hemant would have been completely out of luck if he had not thought to try Karuna Das, who had two daughters of marriageable age  Prabhati and Shashi.Karuna was a sinewy day laborer, and he had roamed far from the village in his younger days to work in iron foundries in Chennai and Hyderabad. The gossip was that Karuna agreed to enroll his eldest daughters because he was unable to scrape together 100,000 rupees for dowries. That was undoubtedly the case.""They were reluctant to go anywhere because they were a bit scared,"" he said. ""I told them being scared is OK. OK, you're scared. Now you have to move on.""Prabhati has never seen a train, much less ridden in one, and on the 33-hour journey to Bangalore the earth seems to heave under her. As miles of paddy fields slide by, she vomits. Thatch roofs are replaced by peaked roofs, and she vomits. When they reach south India, rain begins to hit the window in fat spatters.It had come as news to Prabhati that the training program involved traveling 900 miles. But some intention had hardened within her. She wanted to prove the neighbors wrong. She did not care about her marriage prospects because, after examining the marriages that surrounded her in Ishwarpur, she had decided she does not want to marry at all.""I will go to Bangalore,"" she told her parents. ""If I come back, then you can get me married. If I don't come back, you can't get me married.""Shashi sits beside her retching sister and strokes her back. She had not wanted to come. Happy enough with a future as a housewife, she had focused her energy on making mischief. Among friends, she introduced herself as ""45 kilograms of hotness."" Out of the corner of her mouth came a stream of dirty jokes, and she made the other girls dissolve in helpless laughter by comparing breast sizes to vegetables (including, mournfully, a kernel of corn).Working on an assembly line was not Shashi's idea of fun. But Prabhati plunged forward, and, as usual, Shashi cruised along in her wake.The sisters, lugging a bag of clothes, sit with 35 other girls from Odisha who are making the same journey.They have all dressed in baggy purple-and-gray uniforms, with ID cards swinging from their necks. Their parents had made last-minute attempts to keep them from leaving, which had to be repelled with sustained tantrums. A girl called Baby, who is 18 and bespectacled, said that she had secured her mother's permission only by refusing to eat for two days.""They wanted me to come home,"" she says. ""I'm not going home.""The sun has not yet risen when they arrive at the hostel that will be their new home for the next six months: 137 women in 15 unfurnished rooms, every inch covered with girlish flotsam, underwear and bras drying on the window grates, sentimental verses penciled on the walls.Prabhati and Shashi's room is being painted, so on the first night 25 of them crowd into two rooms, so tight that one of their roommates stretches out on the kitchen counter.For the first few weeks, everything is new. Stepping out of the hostel, the trainees are surrounded by men: Men on balconies, men on scooters, men lounging in doorways, staring. The road is plastered with signs saying ""tailors wanted,"" and one girl gives a yelp of alarm, mistaking them for wanted posters.In rural Odisha they like to say that ""a girl's shyness is her jewelry."" But here, there is no space for the newcomers unless they make space for themselves. To cross the street  a throbbing two-lane road coursing with auto rickshaws, clattering cargo trucks, scooters carrying whole families  requires stepping in front of the slower-moving vehicles, if necessary stopping them with their bodies. The girls waver, and then they plunge.When they are introduced to a factory supervisor and dive to touch her feet, a traditional gesture of respect toward elders, the supervisor jumps back as if she has been stuck with a hot poker. She then assumes a slight crouch, as if preparing to defend herself from further reverence.Back in their bedrooms, the girls laugh hysterically at this. From childhood, they have been told that it is disrespectful for a girl to laugh out loud in the presence of elders. In the event of irrepressible laughter, girls must cover their mouths with anything at hand: the corner of a dupatta, a hand, a washcloth. This lesson, too, flies out the window. In the hostel they laugh like tractors. They laugh so loud they spit their water out.""I'm giving you 25 seconds to thread this needle,"" the supervisor says in Hindi. The recruits, whose native language is Oriya, barely understand. Thirty-seven tailors bend their heads, trying to guide frayed threads through a maze of eight loops.At the K. Mohan & Co. Exports Private Ltd., the girls have entered a world of machines: massive industrial extractors, laser cutters, a rapid-response protocol that kicks in when a needle tip breaks off.And yet, incredibly, garments worn in the West are still made by humans  nearly all of them women, working exhausting hours, with few legal protections and little chance of advancement, for some of the lowest wages in the global supply chain.As the trainees practice sewing straight lines on pieces of scrap fabric, supervisors pace the aisle, hoping to spot one with machine-like dexterity and speed. One of them slows, and then stops, beside a girl called Cuddles, the daughter of a truck driver. The supervisor blinks, looks again. This is  there is no other word for it  talent. She has covered the fabric with seams as straight as the lines on ruled notebook paper.Cuddles is among the first in the group to be integrated into an assembly line, bent over, eyes straining. Her task is to stitch together three small tags for the Marks & Spencer stretch corduroy skirt: one that identifies the brand, one that gives washing instructions and one the size, a scrap so tiny that it is nearly impossible to hold straight between finger and thumb. If she allows a tag to slip to the floor, or fly away in the gusts from the ceiling fan, her salary will be docked. She will be under pressure to complete this task 100 times per hour for eight hours, with one half-hour break for lunch, for a base daily wage of around $2.A man with a loft of dyed black hair steps out of his office to greet the group. This is N. Manjunath, the assistant general manager for human resources at the factory. He is recruiting rural workers through the government program because he is desperate: City-dwellers are no longer interested in factory jobs like these, with their low pay and punishing conditions, and attrition rates are high. Migrant women are more docile. This is what Manjunath is hoping.Manjunath thinks of himself as a kind man. But the complications of employing village girls have strained his last nerve: the weepy petitions for leave to return to the village for essential functions, like a father having a hemorrhoid removed; the domestic squabbles, which on one occasion ended in the consumption of toilet cleaner; and the ""love cases,"" in which a tailor, upon forming a romantic attachment in the factory, is summarily ordered home.Lately, when the girls come to him with complaints, he listens skeptically, with a sardonic smile. He assesses this latest batch of recruits, the second from Odisha, as ""lackadaisical."" He believes they have come here for an adventure, and will gravitate back to the village as soon as their parents tell them to come home.He is right to worry. After six months on the job, when the government incentives are paid out, around half the trainees brought in by Gram Tarang return to their villages. Only 40 percent stay longer than a year.It comes down to this: If the village has a plan for the girls, so does the factory. Leading them through the rows of machines, Manjunath wags his finger.""Don't get married too soon,"" he warns them.Within two weeks of their arrival, one of the sisters' roommates has eloped straight from the factory gates, not even stopping by the hostel to pick up her clothes. Those who remain spill their secrets to one another. Tanushree Behera sleeps entangled with a girl she calls her wife. Jayasmita Behera is divorced, having left her husband less than two weeks after the wedding.""If I had stayed,"" she says, ""my life would have been destroyed.""Sitting cross-legged on the floor, they compare notes on evasive maneuvers they use to avoid being shown to prospective in-laws, like Roadrunner slipping away from Wile E. Coyote. Shradhanjali Mallick, the beauty among them, says she used to have success with bouts of hysterical crying, but that moving to Bangalore has been more effective.""How can they marry me off if I am not physically present?"" she asks innocently, and Prabhati laughs. ""Let them hold a wedding of mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law,"" she says. ""Because that's the only kind of wedding they will be able to pull off.""This is not something Prabhati can laugh about at home. Her views on marriage were set in stone several years back, when a young wife in her village was set on fire in a domestic dispute. Prabhati has been arguing for years that she should be allowed to remain single, that her parents should proceed to fixing a marriage for Shashi, who is pretty and will get better offers.""I will become a nun,"" she says. But her parents flick away her comment, casually, as if it were a fly. So she thinks of escape.This is a subject she cannot discuss with her sister. Three years ago, Prabhati came across a mobile phone that a secret boyfriend gave Shashi as a way of keeping in touch, rigged, as if for espionage, with no audible sound or light, to be switched on at times when they have agreed to speak. Prabhati snatched the phone away and informed her father. Shashi screamed at her father that day  don't break that phone!  but she never saw it again. For months, she could not look him in the eye.The sisters were never as close again. When it comes to the future, Prabhati and Shashi keep their own counsel.By the first week of June, the new girls are praying for Sunday to arrive. Their joints hurt. Their backs hurt. They come home from the factory with fingers punctured by needles or sliced by industrial clippers. Sitting still for eight hours is strange and new, and at times, the boredom is maddening. They sing to their machines. They pull hairs out of their chins. Baby amuses herself by giving herself little scratches on the wrist.They are locked into the hostel except for ""out passes"" on alternate Sundays, which are granted by the factory human resources staff. A Gram Tarang ""life skills"" instructor makes the rounds inside the hostel, selling them 600-rupee jars of an Herbalife energy drink, which she tells them will help them keep up with the pace of work in the factory. It does give them energy  it includes caffeine and maltodextrin  but it also gives them diarrhea and eats up their remaining cash. This is no small problem, because they are running out of money for food.They count the days until June 10, when they will be paid for their first two weeks of work. Prabhati and Shashi, who had left home with 5,000 rupees, or about $75, find themselves with 100 rupees between them.""If there's no salary today, it's going to be a problem,"" Prabhati says.On June 10, they are not paid. Three more days pass, and they still are not paid. Outside the factory window the sky has turned black and the air is churning; a curtain of monsoon rain is about to sweep in.About 15 girls walk into Manjunath's office, hearts pounding, to demand their pay. He looks up from his desk, annoyed. The usual genial expression has vanished from his face. He explains that he cannot solve their problem: The company has opened bank accounts for them, but the bank has not delivered their ATM cards. Anyway, he dismisses the suggestion that the girls are running out of money. And who, he wonders, has given them the idea that they can make demands? He surveys the group in search of its leader.""My clear understanding is that if you have a basket of fruits and only one is not good, it will spoil the other fruit,"" he explains. ""You have to take one out.""When Jayasmita steps forward to say they have not eaten since yesterday, he swivels his head in her direction. He does not speak Oriya. ""What did she say?"" he asks a caseworker.The girls are promised an advance for rice and are ordered to leave his office. They shuffle out. They had been planning to stop working unless they were paid immediately, but their strike has lasted less than 5 minutes. Jayasmita slumps against a wall, and vows never to try anything like that again.""When you come to a new city,"" she says, ""you have to learn to care for yourself, and not bother with others.""The money for the first two weeks' work comes through three or four days later  after withholdings for pension, health insurance, lodging, food and kitchen furnishings, a grand total of 1,874 rupees, or roughly $28. This sum must last them for the next month. In the hostel room where Prabhati and Shashi stay, the amount of the paycheck is not relevant. They have never earned money before, only asked their fathers for it. A wave of happiness washes over all of them. They do not feel like girls, they say: They feel like boys.They transfer credit  30 rupees, 50 rupees  to the cellphones of their mothers, brothers, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and boyfriends, as if they were distributing sweets to celebrate some windfall.Shashi dances down the stairs and most of the way home. The money sends a wild thrill through her, so that she wishes she could fast-forward through the next month, and the month after that, and after that. So that life is a long string of paydays.The two sisters make a pact: They will stay in Bangalore at least a year. They spend much of their paychecks on nose rings for each other, tiny specks of 22-carat gold. They place them on each other in front of their roommates, beaming, their faces so close together that they could be kissing.Then Prabhati lies down on her stomach, full length, cheek to the cool linoleum. She is not feeling well.It is strange that one of the first girls to falter is Prabhati, who was the most resolute about staying in Bangalore.She has contracted a fever that comes and goes for two weeks. She stops eating and then stops talking; her eyes are so hollow that you could place a handful of rice in them. Shashi stays home, combing her sister's hair and forcing her to bathe. But then she must return to work, and Prabhati is left shivering on the floor.""In city life,"" Prabhati says, ""even if you are dead, people will just get dressed and go to the factory without being bothered ...(Continued on next page) .""Minati Mahji, who has lived in the hostel for six years, observes them wearily. Of 130 women who arrived at the same time, only she and her four roommates have stuck it out. She tried switching to another factory, but it was no better, and she wound up back in the hostel. Her pay has crept up to 9,800 rupees, or $146 per month.She has seen wave after wave of young women arrive from the countryside, freshly hatched, and she knows how it usually ends  with the girl's disappearance into that old world as a daughter-in-law.""Whatever they are planning, it doesn't happen like that,"" she says.Even through her fever, Prabhati knows she wants to stay. She tries to keep her illness from her family, handing her crisp new 500-rupee bills to a street-corner doctor who seems to give all his injections in the buttocks. It is Shashi who tells their father that her sister is sick. Her father calls the Gram Tarang training center, demanding that Prabhati be sent home, and the training center calls the factory.On the day she is to board a train to return to Ishwarpur, Prabhati stands at the edge of the roof, tears streaming down her face, and watches her younger sister walk down the lane toward the factory. The mood in the hostel sags.""The day she left, she told me: 'I told you I would stay a year. And I couldn't even stay for two months,'"" Jayasmita recounts.Minati doubts Prabhati will return. The family, having violated custom once by letting the daughters go, is not likely to do it twice.""People mean to come back,"" Minati says. ""But they don't come back.""It turns out factory life agrees with Shashi. She has been absorbed into an assembly line expected to produce 100 pairs of khaki chinos an hour. In the morning she takes her seat among hillocks of pants, and spends the next 8 1/2 hours in a work-trance, punctuated by the shouting of supervisors and a half-hour break for lunch. A whiteboard lists the per-hour target. They are always behind.Behind her in the assembly line, a potbellied man in his late 30s peppers her with the gustatory queries that pass for small talk in south India. Have you eaten today? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat more? She swivels in her chair to ask him, ""Would you like me to shove these pants down your throat?""Shashi finds it interesting that she, the screw-up in the family, is the one becoming a city person. She examines her face in the mirror for signs that she is becoming paler. She tells the family that Prabhati should not return, and that she cannot send money home this month. Instead, Shashi arranges for a meeting with Sunil, a boy from a neighboring village whom she wants to marry.Six years ago, when Sunil first asked Shashi to meet him in person, she was escorted by a female cousin and was too shy to look at Sunil's face. When he sat on the chair, she would go to the bed. When he went to the bed, she would go to the chair. Finally he told her to stop and listen. She sat still. Whatever it was he said to her, it made her feel that he was her own.""I love him, you know?"" she says. ""I do not know whether he is good or bad.""Now that her sister is gone, it is no longer necessary for Shashi to keep this a secret. It is a blessed relief, like taking off a shoe that is cutting into a tender part of your foot.On the August day when her third paycheck comes in, Shashi doesn't tell anyone what she has planned. Leaving the hostel means breaking curfew, but she persuades her friends to go with her. The small group threads its way along the darkening street, past rotting cauliflower and coconut shells. The girls are headed to a bright shop where smartphones are displayed in glass cases.The shopkeeper is about 25, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a glint of gold chain. He has seen many girls like these, provincials, fishing out coins at the vegetable market. He does not hide his disdain. But when Shashi announces that she wants to buy a 4,000-rupee Lava A59 smartphone, he is suddenly wide awake, respectful.Shashi's face is a mask of concentration as she repeatedly counts the bills and arranges them into a fan to show the shopkeeper. The girls around her are hushed. The amount is more than half her month's pay. It is the weightiest decision she has ever made.When they step back onto the street, something flickers across Shashi's face  triumph  and she pumps her fist. Back at the hostel, she drops her new purchase into the hands of her roommates, who immediately go through it, looking for WhatsApp, which they discovered the week before.Sunil will be calling soon. He has been badgering Shashi to make this purchase so she can send pictures over the internet. She disappears into the bathroom to splash cold water on her face. She is gone a long time. She lies for a moment on the floor, staring at the ceiling. Then she dials a number in the village.""Elder sister,"" she says. ""I got my phone!""September has arrived, and every day there is a new reason Prabhati cannot return to Bangalore. Her mother has stomach cramps. Her younger siblings' tuition bills are due. No adult male is available to accompany her on the train journey. Prabhati mentally reviews the cost of the ticket: 1,350 rupees for the train, 300 more for the auto rickshaw from Majestic Station. She jokes, a little nervously, that she should steal the money. A voice in her head tells her that if she doesn't go now, she never will.And yet that voice is becoming fainter. She can feel the village's drowsy peace overtaking her. Her mother says, in an offhand way, that it is time to start finding a groom. This is not how it was supposed to go. Shashi ensconced in the city, and Prabhati stuck in Ishwarpur.""Before, I was at home, and I didn't know anything, and it was OK,"" she says, dully. ""Now I know something, and it's not OK.""Back in Bangalore, the factory girls' fathers have begun to call. They expect them to come home on leave in December, after the six-month factory stint is up. Jayasmita's father says a marriage proposal has come from a man in Cattuck.""I tell them I'm not going anywhere,"" she says. ""The moment I heard talk about marriage, I hung up.""Shradhanjali says she will return, and plans to wriggle out of yet another proposal. ""If possible, I'll fight it off,"" she says, but sounds uncertain.""You know where you'll find her in a year?"" Jayasmita says, teasingly. ""At her in-laws.""The factory girls seem less afraid every month.Shashi sees her boyfriend, Sunil, as planned. He takes the overnight train in from Kerala , where he has migrated for work. They meet at a nearby gas station and walk in a park for most of the day, holding hands. At 4 p.m., he returns to the train station and boards another overnight train back to Kerala. She uses Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with him, as if the internet were two tin cans attached by a piece of twine. Every time they get into a fight, she uninstalls the apps.Her smartphone has become an appendage. She presses it to her ear while she is walking down the lane, striding over rats flattened into the pavement. Waking in the night, she rolls over and checks it for new messages. A group of her friends are toying with the idea of leaving the hostel, seeking higher-paid work at another factory.She is amazed at how far she has come.That's another thing: Shashi and her friends are not the new girls anymore. The new girls are arriving from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand . Their braids are tight and glossy. Dropping their bags in their rooms, they climb up to the roof to gaze at the 22-story building, which is the most amazing thing they have ever seen.Their eyes widen at the girls from Odisha, in their jeans and T-shirts. The girls from Odisha regard them with friendly condescension. They invite them into their rooms, as if they've been here forever."

The Institute of Microbial Technology (Imtech) has sequenced the megagenomic data of microbes coexisting with basmati rice. With this, scientists have opened a big window of opportunity in this tiny white speck. They say that with access to such a data, there can be huge possibilities of new research to increase rice plant output and quality Megagenomics imply large-scale genetic data and sequencing of bacteria. One bacteria has around 5,000 genes and scientists at Imtech have sequenced genomes of 100 such bacteria. Imtech is one of 37 laboratories of Council of Scientific and Industrial Re search (CSIR) in Chandigarh.""The new data can also lead to research in using lesser resources like water and land to grow rice -a staple for almost half the world's population,"" said Prabhu B Patil , lead author of the study.In India, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh , Delhi, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are major basmati cultivating states. India's export of basmati rice fetches between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore annually.""The data can be a boon for farmers if it can identify those microbes of the grain which makes the crop drought, disease and shattering (during harvesting 1015% of the grains fall off) resistant,"" said Rameshwar Singh, project director, Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Delhi.It is believed that with the chemical and artificial treatment of rice, the original or native bacteria that coexisted with the plant had been suppressed. Exploitation of this genomic data might restore the native bacterial consortium as was in millions of years ago.Plants are host to numerous microbes that co-evolved over millions of years. These natural microbes in turn aid development and protection of plants in diverse climatic conditions. ""Analysis of bioinformatics by an expert can become valuable source for further research. Imtech has shown a new direction to the world. It is a breakthrough when the world is talking about food security,"" said Girish Sahni, director general CSIR.Patil's group at Imtech has published the `The rice microbiome' in Frontiers in Microbiology. It is the first megagenome database of seed microbiome of any plant. ""We have sequenced genome of bacteria found in basmati seeds. These bacteria would be contributing to boost rice's immunity to fight against diseases and other stressful conditions like less water etc,"" said Patil.While genome data of many plants is available, the microbial megagenomic resource of only a plant weed -Arabidopsis thaliana was sequenced earlier. The data generated by Patil's group is the first megagenomic information of microbes associated with an economically important plant.Samriti, who is the first author of the megagenomic study , along with Kanika Bansal, both PhD scholars associated with Patil at Imtech, is carrying forward this work."
58f665fe7be9e031f13b3fe2,State lags behind national average in rice production,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/State-lags-behind-national-average-in-rice-production/articleshow/54619452.cms,2016-10-01,"BHUBANESWAR: Between 2012 and '15, Odisha won national awards for excellence in foodgrain productions. But when it comes to producing rice, it has fallen behind the national average despite the area under paddy cultivation being more than other states.Over the last decade the all-India average of rice production stands at more than 2,000 kg/hectare (kg/ha). In the same period Odisha has steadily increased its production from 1,554 kg/ha in 2005-06 to 2,361 in 2012-13. But over the past few years the number has started declining. In 2013-14 the yield was 1,821 kg/ha while in 2015-16 it had dipped to 1,491 kg/ha from 1,989 in 2014-15.Explaining the change, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said in a written reply in the assembly recently: ""Odisha faces natural calamities like drought, cyclone, flood and untimely rain almost every year. Despite all odds, there was a gradual growth in rice production every year due to a number of steps taken by the state government. Effort is on to match the national average.""The reason for the sharp decline in production in 2015-16 was attributed to drought-like situation in as many as 27 of the 30 districts, official figures revealed. Over 200 farmers allegedly committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden though the state government claimed that most of the deaths were due to other reasons.Asked about the low yield despite paddy being cultivated in two-thirds of the total cultivable land, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor of OUAT S N Pasupalak said: ""Factors like low mechanization, poor nutrient management, structure of land and low irrigation potential are responsible for low production of rice in the state.""Among all districts, Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, stands at the top in producing highest amount of rice constantly for past 10 years. Other districts like Boudh, Dhenkanal, Nabarangapur, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur and Sundargarh have been recording high production of rice for past two years.Despite drought in 2015-16, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak produced 2,571 kg/ha and 2,505 kg/ha, respectively, among the highest in the country.""For increase in productivity, Odisha has been promoting modern methods like system of rice intensification (SRI), practice of multiple crops, soil testing, supplying quality seeds and augmenting irrigation potential,"" said an officer in the agriculture department.A number of centrally-sponsored schemes like National Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India, National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana are being implemented in the state to increase the agriculture productivity.Odisha has been winning successive krishi karman awards among category-II states for record foodgrain production.According to sources in the directorate of economics and statistics, states like West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are ahead of Odisha in rice production.."

It makes you want to go out and about. Walk in the flower-full parks. Read some poetry at Rajghat. Revisit the beautiful tomb of Safdarjung. Go boating at the Old Fort or India Gate.

Wear zari shawls to shaadis.Yet, instead of looking forward to the winter a lot of Delhiites are growing anxious. Because in recent years all its charms have come eclipsed under a sickly dark cloud of pollution, a lot of it caused by crop burning in the neighbouring states, who are repeatedly exhorted by the courts to get with the environment but remain enamoured of the spirit of Rhett Butler  Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn.This year too the Delhi high court is asking the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments about their plans to curb crop burning. Winter after winter satellites provide scary heat maps of the scale of the problem. Breathing troubles spike across NCR. Children are especially badly hit. But as the persistent cough of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal shows, all that smog is like kryptonite to adult lungs too.So that instead of going out and about you feel like hibernating in your bedroom with air purifiers. Sadly their superpowers are dodgy as well.When a foul grey covered the capital last winter a ten minute walk in traffic would cover your face with an icky film, making your lungs feel tortured and your throat scratchy as if you had chain-smoked a whole pack of cigarettes. Kejriwalji battled that acute health emergency with an on-off odd-even scheme that far from cleaning the air made it even more mottled  with the sounds of cussing and swearing.Please mukhya mantriji do better by us this year. Look, this can be a big opportunity to teach pradhan mantriji how cooperative federalism is done. Get the neighbouring governments to show some love for clean air.

58ff2f5e7be9e0420db2e1dc,Cong UP hope: bread-butter issues,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161021/jsp/nation/story_114707.jsp,2016-10-21,"New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Congress is praying for a normal election in Uttar Pradesh without any unwarranted ""surgical"" intervention from the BJP's spin doctors. Aware that the BJP had found a ""talking point"" with last month's surgical strikes - the anti-terror army action across the Line of Control - the leadership is working on shifting the focus to everyday issues like rural distress and unemployment. Party leaders realise that the mix of religiosity and patriotism by re-igniting the Ram temple hope along with the anti-Pakistan hysteria could curtail the impact of Rahul Gandhi's recent kisan yatra in the poll-bound heartland state. They also know that the party's nuanced approach on nationalism and religion would evaporate in the heat of raw jingoism; hence the prayer for a normal bread-and-butter discourse. Yesterday, the party's communications chief, Randeep Surjewala, dwelt on issues like alarming economic indicators and job losses in a series of tweets. Among the questions he asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the promise of two crore jobs a year when the unemployment rate was at a five-year peak, the manufacturing sector's performance being the worst in five years, industrial growth, soaring prices of eatables and the grim outlook for bank credit. A couple of days ago he had held an elaborate briefing on the BJP government's refusal to pay even the minimum support price (MSP) for rice in Haryana. ""We don't want Pakistan or a Ram temple to dominate the political discourse. We see them as artificial diversions as the Modi government has failed to deliver on the lofty promises made during the last parliamentary elections,"" a senior leader from Uttar Pradesh told The Telegraph. ""The BJP knows that issues like cow slaughter, love jihad and minority appeasement have lost their efficacy, so the same agenda is being presented in a new packaging."" Another leader said: ""We are going to villages as part of the Rahul Sandesh Yatra. When we explain to farmers Rahul Gandhi's promise to write off loans and halve electricity bills, the only question we face is, 'Won't betray us like Modi did, will you?' This clearly reflects that the farmers are angry with Modi for not fulfilling his promise of giving MSP plus 50 per cent profit. That created a huge opening for us."" This leader claimed the loan-waiver promise had created a wave and farmers, cutting across caste lines, were itching to punish the BJP. ""Other issues that angered the ordinary people were prices of pulses and vegetables, lack of employment and the general perception about the (BJP's 2014 promise of) achchhe din (good days) ahead being a hoax. We got unexpected support throughout the state. But suddenly this diversion has come in the form of chest-thumping about the surgical strikes,"" he said. The Congress has been focusing on farmer-related issues and Modi's failure to deliver on his promises. While party vice-president Rahul did it during his kisan yatra, other leaders are pursuing it in the ongoing Sandesh Yatra. From November 1, a "" vidhan sabha yatra"" is scheduled to begin to spread the same message. The Congress hopes to bolster its campaign next month with the entry of Priyanka Gandhi who too, party sources said, would focus on Modi's ""false promises"". Assembly elections are due early next year in Uttar Pradesh. Party leaders, who didn't have many tears to shed for former Uttar Pradesh unit chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi who defected to the BJP today, saw her reference to Rahul's "" khoon ki dalali"" statement as a reflection of a carefully crafted strategy. Rahul had earlier this month accused Modi of indulging in political exploitation of the sacrifices of soldiers. Sources said Bahuguna was feeding the ""war hysteria"" by referring to the Congress's stand on the surgical strikes as the reason for switching camps, when the primary reason was the trust deficit the Nehru-Gandhi family had developed after her brother Vijay Bahuguna tried to dislodge the Uttarakhand government. Raj Babbar, who heads the state Congress, said the ""BJP is making an army of traitors"" who were attacking Rahul because he was trying to demolish the little fiefs within the party."
58ff37e17be9e0420db2e927,BJP rains yellow rice to pull crowds,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/nation/story_114986.jsp,2016-10-22,"Narendra Modi Lucknow, Oct. 21: If the surgical strikes cannot pull the crowds to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Mahoba, the BJP is hoping its ""cereal strike"" will. BJP workers are distributing packets of yellow rice among Hindu households in the Bundelkhand region's Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, Chitrakoot, Lalitpur, Jhansi and Jalaun districts to encourage people to make Monday's rally a success. Yellow rice - rice dipped in a solution of turmeric and dried - is considered auspicious and is an essential ingredient of pujas. In north India, yellow rice is often offered to women when they set off on a journey. ""We realised that many people were not too excited about the surgical strikes (last month's anti-terrorist action by the army across the Line of Control),"" a senior BJP politician in Lucknow said, asking not to be named. ""But we have succeeded in striking an instant chord with people by distributing the yellow rice."" Led by Om Prakash Tiwari, chief of the BJP's Mahoba unit, over a dozen party activists visited the town's Kadipur, Narupur, Gandhi Nagar, Sattipur and Dal Bangla neighbourhoods yesterday, carrying the yellow rice door to door. They were accompanied by a band playing drums and trumpets. Party sources said they had skipped the Muslim-dominated Chahasiyapur, Mataniyapur and Fatipura localities. ""We tell the people about the Modi government's achievements, including the surgical strikes, and then offer them the yellow rice, which is our way of inviting them,"" local media reports quoted Tiwari as saying. The senior Lucknow-based BJP politician who spoke to this newspaper said the decision to distribute yellow rice was taken two days ago at a meeting presided over by state BJP general secretary Swatantra Dev Singh. ""It was decided that yellow rice would be a good bet to ensure the success of the rally, which will kick off the 2017 Assembly election campaign,"" said the politician, who has been asked to camp in Mahoba and monitor the door-to-door contact programme. He said similar contact programmes were going on in other districts of the region. ""We are also holding public meetings at temples in every neighbourhood. Swatantra Dev Singh addressed one such meeting in the Hanuman temple at Srinagar village in Mahoba on Wednesday,"" he added. Singh also performed a bhumi pujan (earth worship) at the venue of Modi's rally. The BJP has little presence in Bundelkhand and won just one of the region's 19 Assembly seats in the 2012 elections. The Congress won four thanks to a focused campaign by Rahul Gandhi. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have seven seats each from the region. Uttar Pradesh is due to vote early next year."
593f12077be9e024e45957fb,We didn’t start the fire,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agricultural-fire-delhi-pollution-punjab-haryana-we-didnt-start-the-3099304/,2016-10-24,"Farmers in Punjab and Haryana say the bulk of burning happens in the first week of November. Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra) Farmers in Punjab and Haryana say the bulk of burning happens in the first week of November. Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)On one side of National Highway 1, a heap of dry leaves is up in flames. A few kilometres ahead, farmers in fields are burning the refuse left behind after threshing the paddy crop. The air is thick with smoke along parts of the highway in Haryana.Delhis annual pollution crisis has started  and it will only get worse. The large-scale burning of agricultural remains  the stalks left in the ground after the crop is harvested  is expected to begin in earnest in the first week of November. Farmers say the bulk of burning happens in the first two weeks of November, as the entire paddy crop has not been harvested yet. This is bad news for the air quality in Delhi.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne only needs to visit some villages in Sonepat and Panipat near National Highway 1 to realise the extent of the problem posed by burning of agricultural stubble. And to understand why farmers do it.When we used manual labour for harvesting, the stubble was easier to deal with. We would just till the farm again and the stubble would be mixed into soil. Now that we have started using machines to harvest, 8 -10 inches of stalks are left behind and these are difficult to deal with. Getting manual labourers  mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh  is expensive, time consuming and difficult, so everyone does it by machine, said Kherati Lal, 65, a farmer in Haryanas Panchi Gujra village near Murthal.The easiest thing in such a situation, he says, is to set fire to his farms to clear the stubble. Except, this is banned by the government.We would put 2 litres of kerosene and set fire to the whole thing. End of story. Now we have to bring in machines to turn the soil and cut and bury the stubble. We have to water this and run a tractor over it thrice to make sure it decays properly. The government has started keeping a strict check on fires now, so we burn only the stalks that come out along with the rice crop. Its a small quantity, he said.But even small quantities being burnt on each farm make for an air pollution disaster.As per officials at the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), 60,000 acres of land in Punjab is under cultivation of paddy. In Haryana, paddy is cultivated on around 30,000 acres. This produces 32 million tonnes of paddy straw.According to the first source apportionment study of Delhis air pollution by IIT Kanpur, about 30 per cent of pollution in Delhi is because of biomass burning, which includes agricultural, leaf and garbage burning.Several studies since have confirmed this. A recent study by scientists at the National Environment Engineering Research Institute said that 60 per cent of Delhis particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is contributed by neighbouring states. Of this 60 per cent, half is contributed by Punjab and Haryana.Despite efforts to curb such fires, farms in Haryana and Punjab have been going up in flames for the last two weeks, according to NASAs fire mapper. The map also shows that Punjab is seeing more fires, especially near Amritsar, as compared to Haryana.The effect on air quality is already visible. According to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, the air quality has dipped since September 25  something that can partly be attributed to a dip in wind speed and partly to the beginning of the harvest season.An analysis of the air quality on the National Air Quality Index shows that this October is, on average, more polluted than the last. Between October 6 and October 20, at R K Puram station, the average air quality was poor during both years. But this year, the value was 261 as opposed to 257 last year, the data shows.Meanwhile, with the Supreme Court, the Delhi High Court and the National Green Tribunal banning all such agricultural fires, state governments have started feeling the heat.The Haryana government has already issued almost 700 challans and collected lakhs in fines for farm fires this year. The progress in Punjab has been slower, with some officials suggesting this could have something to do with the upcoming assembly elections.But leader of Opposition in Haryana assembly and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala has criticised the decision of the BJP government in Haryana to impose a fine on farmers, and demanded that they be reimbursed.Removal of stubble from fields is expensive. A farmer cannot afford to pay Rs 10,000 per acre from his pocket for this. In several countries, machines are available using which stubble can be cut, tied up and sent to factories for use. The Haryana government has three such machines lying defunct, he claimed.Ram Niwas Gautam, 60, a resident of Manana Village near Panipat, said, I have a 4-acre farm. A farmer cant afford to buy a machine to get rid of the waste and hiring manual labour is out of question as they are rarely available and charge a lot of money. Labour contractors charge aroundRs 20,000; where do we get that kind of money? Only the big farmers can afford it.According to experts, the governments need a mix of prosecution and incentives to deal with the problem. In Punjab, for example, farmers are selling the straw to waste-to-energy plants for power generation, and a small amount is being sold to mushroom farms to use as substrate.Farmers should be paid Rs 1,000 per acre under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana so they can shun the practice of burning paddy straw. They should be given subsidies for buying Rotavator machines that help cut and mix agricultural stubble with soil. We need to understand why the farmers burn stubble and then deal with the basic problem, said Centre for Science and Environment director general Sunita Narain.*Many orders, little changeNov 2012Supreme Court mandated panel, Environment Pollution Control Authority, directs Punjab, Haryana to ensure complete ban on burning of agricultural stubble by 2014. States asked to promote alternate uses of paddy straw, such as power generation.Feb 2014NGT tells Ministry of Agriculture to hold meeting with Punjab, Haryana, Central Pollution Control Board, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and prepare guidelines to control pollution from burning of agricultural remnants in fields.Dec 2015NGT orders fine for burning stubble. Its order states:*Land holders with less than 2 acres to payRs 2,500/- per incident*Rs 5,000 for land holders with 2 and 5 acres*Rs 15,000 for land holders with area more than 5 acres of land*Oct 2016Delhi HC issues orders to governments of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to prevent burning of agricultural stubble in their states. On October 4, Delhi government writes to environment ministers of some neighbouring states in this regard.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Mr. Gandhi should perhaps be reminded of the days of the Emergency. No Congressperson has the moral right to lecture anyone else on the virtues of democracy and speak against the abuse of power before denouncing the Emergency. This might be a big challenge for the party but its high time for them to do this in order to sound more credible.C.G. Kuriakose,Kothamangalam, KeralaThe Congress party seems eager to erase the general perception that the old guard was loathe to have the straight-speaking Rahul Gandhi at the helm (Congress asks Rahul to steer the party ship, Nov. 8). Mr. Gandhi, who has a significant following among the youth in the party, has to cash in on his image of being pro-poor, secular, and not hungry for power. Though tags such as ineffectual communicator and non-assertive politician may haunt him, he has the opportunity to change for the better the partys prospects. Many Pradesh Congress Committees are in disarray and Mr. Gandhi has to groom able leaders at the State level. He also has to expand the partys youth base and ponder why the youth in the country have shifted their allegiance to the BJP. The onerous task of making the party more lively, bringing in accountability, and fixing responsibilities cannot be stressed more. Sonia Gandhis strength was her ability to carry the non-BJP parties along with her and stitch alliances. Mr. Gandhi should learn from his mother.Ganapathi Bhat,AkolaThe Congress has been lying low in practically every State due to lack of leadership and loss of confidence. Rahul Gandhis proposed elevation as president may bring cheer to his supporters but may not change the partys fortunes in the immediate future. In fact, Mr. Gandhi has squandered too many chances to rebuild and rejuvenate the party. Nevertheless, if made party president, he should first revamp the party at the grass-roots level. He should induct new blood while elevating dedicated workers in each State. Otherwise his elevation will be futile.K.R. Srinivasan,SecunderabadAfter the smogIn order to improve the quality of air in any city, the first thing that is required is a change in peoples behaviour and mindset (Solutions after the smog, Nov. 8). Pollution and garbage disposal are often related to peoples livelihoods. While people think of their livelihoods as their own, the pollution or waste that is generated from the same is seen as the governments headache. People criticise the government for its ineffectiveness in checking poor air quality and pollution while forgetting that they themselves are part of this menace. If we take examples from highly polluted cities in other countries, we see that the governments and the people undertook joint efforts to control pollution. The Indian government should frame polices that require the active participation of citizens in controlling pollution.Mudit Katiyar,LucknowDelhi alone does not have polluted air, the whole of India does. The introduction of CNG-run vehicles, which emit nanocarbon according to some studies, and relentless afforestation have been some of the causes of pollution in the capital. The present scenario calls for more sustainable initiatives with short- and long-term perspectives. Bolstering the public transportation network is an immediately plausible solution. People should carpool, follow the odd-even scheme, use cycles as a mode of travel (for which roads, pavements and general infrastructure need to improve), and so on. The burning of crops can be checked only through administrative intervention involving farmer-support measures. Schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which is aimed at providing clean fuel, are laudable.Anjali B.,ThiruvananthapuramA Bihar-like allianceThere is no harm in contemplating a Bihar-like grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh. But the SP should not forget that parties like the JD(S), JD(U), RLD and RJD have nothing much to offer to it in the U.P. battlefield (Chasing a grand alliance, Nov. 8). The main reason for the Bihar victory was that both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad buried their differences and consolidated anti-BJP votes to hand out a shocking defeat to the BJP. If the SP wants a similar story in U.P., party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav must first approach Mayawati. This is the only way he can hope to win this election, especially after the Yadav family feud, because the Congress is still a fringe player.Bal Govind,NoidaStunt gone wrongThat two Kannada stunt actors Anil and Uday drowned in a lake after jumping off a helicopter during a fighting sequence for a film made for sad reading (Stunt goes off script during Kannada movie shoot, Nov. 8). It is made even more tragic by the fact that Anil said just before the stunt that he barely knew how to swim! The incident smacks of sheer madness and irresponsibility on the part of the film producer, director and the whole crew. That a boat was not nearby to haul them up after the rescue makes it all the more bizarre.S. Ramakrishnasayee,RanipetFood and nutritionAlthough the public distribution system has provided poor households across the nation accessibility to regular and subsidised food grains, it fails to fulfil nutrition standards. Hidden hunger in India is created due to paucity of essential micronutrients in the body even if a large amount of food is consumed (Linking food and nutrition security, Nov. 8). The rice that is distributed is polished and lacks nutrition-rich barn. Diversification of food distributed in the PDS is the need of the hour. Cereals fulfil our carbohydrates requirement, but protein is required for overall physical and mental development. It is time to increase pulse production and distribution through the PDS. The most important step is biofortification, a process through which the nutritional quality of crops is improved through biotechnology or selective breeding.Gagan Pratap Singh,NoidaD-Day in the U.S.The U.S. presidential election has been one of the most debated events in recent times as the future President will not only impact the lives of Americans but of people across the world (America goes to polls today, Nov. 8). Even if the U.S.s hegemony has come under challenge, whether due to rising anti-Americanism in West Asia or due to what Fareed Zakaria calls the rise of the rest, the election is still important.With the global economy still not fully healthy, the EU facing a crisis, the Middle East in a state of chaos, and with threats from the Islamic State, who becomes President will determine how these issues are tackled.Abhilash Thimmaiah,New Delhi"
5909e87a7be9e033b96e959d,The arhar solution to pollution,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-pollution-arhar-pulses-demand-supply-gap-burning-of-paddy-4364802/,2016-11-09,"(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The inferno of environmental pollution that the nations capital and its surroundings have been witnessing has many causes, including weather conditions (thermal inversion) that facilitate the settling of particulate matter and other pollution, dust on the streets generated in part from construction activity, and vehicle-related emissions. Particularly critical is the burning of paddy after the kharif harvest which happens every year.Multiple causes will require a broad-based response but one of the permanent solutions to the pollution problem must address paddy burning. This is where pulses come in. In the Subramanian Committee report on pulses that was submitted last month to the ministers of finance, agriculture and consumer affairs, the possibilities created by a new variety of arhar (pigeon pea) developed by K.V. Prabhu and his colleagues at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) were discussed.This variety (Pusa Arhar16) has the potential to be grown in the paddy-growing regions of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and eventually in all of India. Its yield (about 2000 kg/hectare) will be significantly greater than those of the existing varieties and because its size will be uniform, it will be amenable to mechanical harvesting, an attractive feature for farmers in northern India who currently use this technology for paddy.Most important, arhar straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content, which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case of arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the left-over straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast. All this is difficult with left-over paddy stalks that cannot be easily salvaged or ploughed back (it is very firm). Farmers, therefore, choose the easiest option of simply burning it.But replacing paddy with pulses (in over half million hectares or more eventually) will have other social benefits. Our calculations suggest that pulses will use less fertiliser, less water, and fewer emissions, and in addition will replenish the soil with nitrogen unlike paddy which depletes the soil (see table). Together, pulses production would provide social benefits that we estimated at Rs 13,240 per hectare. On this basis, we had suggested an MSP for pulses over the medium term of close to Rs 9,000 per quintal so that it could become competitive with paddy. This would also preserve the incomes of farmers.But, of course, we had understated the social benefits of growing pulses. In the report, we had highlighted that there would be additional benefits: Specifically, the reduced environmental pollution because less paddy would be burnt. But we were unable to quantify these benefits for lack of data. This needs to be rectified immediately to make public and transparent the consequences of current policies.The broader policy lessons outlined in the pulses report have acquired new salience in the light of the pollution problem. These lessons bear emphasis.First, the future of sustainable agriculture must be based on encouraging agricultural science and research especially where Indias scientists have done the hard and creative work. Agricultural research institutions must be free from political interference, must be accorded autonomy, and must reward proven talent.Second, making the fruits of science commercially viable will require price incentives to be re-evaluated. In the case of pulses and paddy, a complicating factor that determines the relative incentives is risk. Because of guaranteed MSPs in paddy, it is less risky to grow than pulses. The Subramanian Committee estimated that pulses production was about six times riskier than paddy production. To compensate this, the required MSP for pulses would have to be about Rs1100 per ton greater than otherwise.Third, pricing in India must increasingly take account of externalities, positive and negative. In the case of agriculture, that means adapting the current methodology of setting MSPs used by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) that focuses exclusively on private costs and benefits. This tends to encourage socially wasteful production and specialisation such as excessive paddy production in north India with all the attendant consequences to which we are grim witnesses. As argued by Professor Ramesh Chand of Niti Aayog and recommended by the Subramanian Committee report, MSP setting must incorporate social costs and benefits.The burning of rice stalks affords an opportunity to implement a major shift in policy that can reduce pollution while also promoting indigenous research and science, incentivising pulses production, and rationalising pricing more broadly. Converting crises into opportunities is the hallmark of good public policy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A farmer in Punjab.Photo: AFPDelhi has registered its worst air quality in recent times. This has prompted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to call it a gas chamber. Pollution in different parts of the capital has touched hazardous levels with potentially serious health effects on the rich and poor alike, especially on children, the elderly and physically vulnerable people. Leaving aside the politics, the Central and Delhi governments should take urgent measures to prevent air pollution in order to stem the current impact as well as the future cost of healthcare.It is often pointed out that paddy stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab is a major reason for affecting air quality in Delhi during the onset of winter. Stubble burning is a common practice followed by farmers in these States to prepare the field for sowing of wheat in November as there is little time left between the harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat. Since this practice is followed every year despite some efforts by the State governments to prevent it, the problem of air quality getting affected in Delhi during October-November will recur. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and address the fundamental problems that force the farmers to burn the paddy straw on the field and not utilise it for any productive purpose. It may appear that paddy straw has no economic value for farmers in these States.The rice-wheat rotationHistorically, rice was not a major crop grown in Punjab and Haryana. In Punjab, rice accounted for only 7.6 per cent of the total cropped area during 1970-1973, which increased to a whopping 36 per cent during 2011-13. Similarly, in Haryana, paddy area increased from 5.6 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period. Extensive development of irrigation, assured price (minimum support price) and secured market (government procurement) have induced farmers to grow paddy and expand the area of cultivation considerably over time. Consequently, farmers in this traditionally wheat-growing belt started cultivating rice and wheat in rotation year after year. Various studies have shown that the rice-wheat rotation has put land and other resources under severe strain, resulting in depletion of soil nutrients, decline in water table, build-up of pests and diseases, and micronutrient deficiency. The State governments initiatives to push crop diversification as a strategy to overcome these problems have not convinced farmers to break the rice-wheat rotation. Crop diversification with vegetables and fruits hit a roadblock due to marketing problems.Being agriculturally progressive States, almost all farmers in Punjab and Haryana grow high-yield varieties of rice and wheat. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average rice yield was as high was four tonnes per hectare in Punjab and 3.2 tonnes in Haryana. These States have also experienced a high level of mechanisation of agricultural operations including harvesting. In fact, combine harvesters have been extensively used for harvesting of paddy and wheat due to non-availability of labour at the time of harvesting and increase in labour cost. A rough estimate based on the grain to straw ratio showed that Punjab with an average rice production of 11.1 million tonnes during 2011-13 generated about 16.6 million tonnes of paddy straw. Similarly, in Haryana, the average rice output was 1.3 lakh tonnes and it produced about 1.9 lakh tonnes of straw.Use of machines for harvesting has serious implications for crop residue management at the farm level. The combine harvester cuts the crop well above the ground, leaving behind substantial amount of stubble on the field. The machine leaves the residues in such a state that it is difficult to collect them manually. However, the farmers found ways to collect the wheat residue (bhusa) as it is a highly valuable animal feed and is even traded across districts. Given its economic use, the farmers run a chaff combine (reaper) after combine harvesting to collect straws, cut stubbles and make into chaff for feeding to animals directly or mixed with green fodder. So the burning of wheat residue is not necessary for the farmers because of the availability of technology and its higher economic value as dry fodder. Rice straw, however, is not used as fodder as it is found to be non-palatable to animals due to its high silica content. Because of its little economic value as animal feed and other general uses, farmers are prompted to burn it on the field instead of incurring a high cost on collecting it. In fact, field studies show that even though farmers are aware that the burning of straw is harmful to health, they do not have alternatives for utilising them effectively. Therefore, blaming only the farmers may not solve the problem of air pollution and there is a need to find sustainable technological solutions that can help farmers and simultaneously allow everyone to breathe clean air.Looking through the hazeBiomass provides safe and reliable energy. The available paddy straw can be effectively used for power generation, which will go a long way towards overcoming the problem of disposal of crop residues and power deficit in the region. According to data from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Punjab and Haryana have not made much progress in creating biomass-based power generation plants as compared to States such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Thus, there is great potential for making investments in paddy straw-based power plants which can help avoid stubble burning to a large extent and also create employment opportunities.Incorporation of crop residues in the soil can improve soil moisture and help activate the growth of soil microorganisms for better plant growth. However, suitable machinery for collection, chopping and in situ incorporation of straw is required. Further, initiatives can also be made to convert the removed residues into enriched organic manure through composting.Presently, a limited quantity of paddy straw is used for cardboard making and in packing industries and paper mills. However, new opportunities for industrial use  such as extraction of yeast protein  can be explored through scientific research.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality. Use of such dual-purpose rice varieties will help to maintain food security, farm income and improve environmental sustainability.Elumalai Kannan is Associate Professor at Centre for the Study of Regional Development, JNU, New Delhi.There is also a need to develop rice varieties that are both rich in grain yield and high in straw quality"

Picture by Rajesh Shrivastava Nov. 12: Villagers allegedly looted a ration shop in Madhya Pradesh after its owner refused to accept 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, as people's patience seemed to wear thin at many places in the country after four days of the cash crisis spawned by demonetisation. Munnilal Ahirwar says he watched helplessly last evening as over 100 villagers, many of them women, looted bags of wheat, rice and sugar from his store at Bardua in Chhattarpur district. Ahirwar was allegedly roughed up each time he raised his voice or tried to physically stop the looters. ""I recognised most of the faces, but will the police act?"" he asked today. Police from the nearest outpost, 6km away, arrived this morning and registered a case of looting against unknown people. Long queues were seen at bank branches for the third consecutive day throughout Madhya Pradesh, while most ATMs remained non-functional for the fourth day, adding to the popular frustration. For the past three days, most rural areas have received no cash from big cities like Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which are battling their own cash problems. A video clip went viral on the social media, purportedly showing the police thrashing people who had lost their cool after waiting hours outside a bank in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh today. The cops are seen beating the people with canes and belts outside the State Bank of India branch in Porsa. The customers had tried to barge into the branch around 3pm, apparently angered by a policeman on duty allowing some people in through the backdoor, an eyewitness said. ""No one has approached us with a complaint yet, but I'm going to look into the incident and if the policemen are found guilty, they will be punished,"" superintendent of police Vineet Khanna said. In Chhattarpur's Motwan mohalla, Mathura Prasad Ahirwar was able to perform the last rites of his wife Raj Bai only after neighbours pooled the necessary money. His granddaughter Anuradha said the cost of the necessary materials such as milk, yoghurt, honey, ghee, wood and sandalwood came to more than Rs 2,200 but the shopkeeper refused to accept the demonetised notes. Eventually, the funeral was performed after sunset, which is not the preferred time according to local custom. In Sagar district, retired BSNL official Vinod Kumar Pande, 69, suddenly collapsed and died after standing in queue for an hour at a Union Bank branch. He was carrying Rs 4,000 in large currency in his pocket that he had wanted to exchange. Customers ran wild when a bank at Sujdu Chungi in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, delayed the exchange of the demonetised currency yesterday saying it lacked 100 and 50-rupee notes. Some people damaged the cash counter and stoned the police when they arrived. The mob also damaged a government bus and two private cars on the street outside. Later, the police carried out a baton-charge that left Khatiza Begum, 30, and Ayesha, a two-year-old girl, injured. Some people claimed the police had also fired in the air outside the bank. During the vandalism, a few customers chanted "" Mera desh bigad raha hai (My country is deteriorating)"" - a take-off of the slogan ""Mera desh badal raha hai (My country is changing)"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted after completing two years in office in May. Eyewitnesses said the problem began at 11am when an iron net attached to the teller's window, which some customers had grabbed as they jostled to get closer to the counter, came off under their collective weight. Someone then smashed the glass pane at the counter, prompting nervous bank officials to call the police. ""The bus driver and the bank manager have lodgedcases against unidentified people,"" circle police officer Tejveer Singh said. ""We are trying to identify and arrest them."" He said the bank received cash after an hour. Some 200 angry customers waiting outside a State Bank of Travancore branch in Kerala's Kollam district allegedly broke a glass door today after the bank decided to down shutters because of the heavy rush. The police are questioning several people. Long queues formed outside bank branches across Kerala for the third day, amid complaints that the ATMs were running out of cash. An elderly man had collapsed and died while queuing to deposit cash yesterday at Haripad in Alappuzha district, while another man fell to his death from a building housing a bank branch in Kannur. People clashed with bank officials at several places in Gujarat, prompting police baton-charges and detention. Customers complained that several ATMs were closed and that banks were exchanging the demonetised notes with coins and very small-denomination currencies. ""Even hospitals are refusing to accept the larger notes,"" Ramesh Agarwal said. ""Bank officials said they had run out of the new 2,000-rupee notes and only had coins,"" said Bipin Patel. ""They have given me coins for Rs 4,000, which is very difficult to carry."" Rajesh Shah, a senior citizen, said: ""We stood in queues for two days.... We have Rs 3 lakh in our bank account but can't buy essentials. Modi should have made proper arrangements for cash."" The police caned customers who had clashed with bank officials when they refused to dispense money at a branch at Shihori in Banaskantha district. A similar incident was reported from Abdasa in Kutch. A senior assistant of the Kolhapur zilla parishad in Maharashtra was arrested on the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs 35,000 that contained 17 newly introduced Rs 2,000 currency notes, officials said. Chandrakant Sawardekar, 45, had allegedly promised to help the complainant secure a promotion as a principal in a zilla parishad-run school."

Only Delhi, naturally for the city most affected, has reacted with some degree of urgency.A severe pollution level, as defined by NGT, meant a PM2.5 level of 251 microgram/cubic metre and PM10 level of 431 microgram/cubic metre (the standard safe levels for these categories are 60 and 100, respectively). When these levels reached 300 and 500 respectively, an 'environmental emergency' was in the offing. In such conditions, NGT said on November 10, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan were to consider measures such as curbing crop stubble burning, raining water from the air to sink polluting particles, suspending construction and demolition activities and ordering cessation of carbon producing activities like brick making and thermal energy generationWith crop burning a major factor, NGT had ordered states to provide alternatives to the incineration of the post-harvest rice plant stalks. The two states most liable for this, Punjab and Haryana, reported some action. In both the states, the governments have provided funds to equip farmers with happy seeders, or devices that can be used to plant wheat without the need for the field to be cleared of the paddy stubble. In Punjab, the government distributed 280 happy seeders, while Haryana has promised farmers a 50% subsidy for the purchase of these implements.In accordance with the previous NGT directions, the agriculture department in Punjab has prepared plans to provide farmers with straw management equipment costing Rs 1,602 crore and has approached the centre for funds. Haryana has similarly decided to install straw balers in each block there next year.To stop the burning of field residue, Haryana booked 1,600 farmers for violating the ban and recovered Rs 16 lakh from them as fine in the past 20 days. Delhi too has clamped down on the open burning of leaves and waste, with violators coughing up Rs 63.7 lakh as fines till last week. In addition, the municipal corporations have pulled up other offenders, among them 476 in South Delhi alone.The government in Rajasthan ordered the temporary closure of stone crushing units and brick kilns, while remaining alert to the burning of agriculture residue, garbage and dry leaves. Sanitation workers have been directed to clean the streets only at night, and all construction activities are to be carried out with proper dust management systems in place.Delhi has temporarily closed the Badarpur thermal power plant and stalled construction and demolition activities for 10 days. A committee, which included the chief secretary and environment secretary, will discuss the issue of water spraying with the centre. An official said, ""Since Pawan Hans helicopters do not have the desired capacity, we approached the centre about harnessing Indian Air Force choppers. But the union environment and forests ministry told us it could not help us. Meanwhile, PWD is spraying water along major roads through hose pipes.""Like Rajasthan, Haryana too has stopped stone crushers and suspended brick kiln work for a few days. S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board , said the state was amenable to water sprinkling too. ""In urgent circumstances, we may follow this measure,"" Narayanan said.Directed to start vacuum cleaning of roads in Delhi, PWD had expected tenders for mechanical sweepers to be decided by November 10, but no one put in a bid, mainly due to the uncertainty caused by the demonetisation of high-value currency notes. The tendering process has been extended for some time. The transport department has deregistered 1.91 lakh diesel vehicles, deemed to over 15 years old and polluting, and officials said the list of such vehicles were sent to the traffic police last Friday, with instructions to impound them immediately.Members of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board , which met on November 15, admit that compliance of NGT orders would be tough given the state's geographical area. A senior official said that coordinating with the various government departments concerned would take time. However, the state is indeed thinking of means to reduce carbon pollution, including contemplating asking industries to use high-end boilers and process heaters.The UP government is willing to comply with the National Green Tribunal's orders to control air pollution, senior government officials in Lucknow said. SC Yadav, member, UP Pollution Control Board , said that the state sub-committee on the matter would discuss the draft plan, methodology and procedure that UP would follow to control air pollution on November 24.A meeting of the central monitoring committee has been summoned in New Delhi on November 17, where the states will further discuss NGT's directives."

The All India Taxi Permits granted by these states for taxis to ply inter-state should be streamlined, said the bench. It was informed that of the 1.9 lakh taxis in Delhi, 80,000 run on diesel, while 35,000 inter-state permit cabs violate the 2001 Supreme Court order  which states that all commercial vehicles in Delhi must run on CNG.Why cant Punjab, Haryana and UP stop giving permits to diesel-run cabs? Their polluting vehicles are also coming to Delhi, observed the bench. The bench added that ban on diesel taxis could be extended to inter-state buses as well.What are you going to do to prevent the burning of paddy straw, and what is your plan of action for All India Permit taxis to move towards CNG? asked the court.Refusing to accept the argument that CNG pumps are not available in the other states, the bench has asked for a clear-cut plan with timelines for introducing CNG stations and phasing out diesel-run taxis from the four NCR states within three weeks.On the issue of crop stubble burning in Punjab, the bench once again pulled up the state government for not taking steps to stop the practice. Punjab alone generates 17 million tonnes of rice paddy straw every year, of which only a small percentage is used by cardboard and paper factories. More than 13 million tonnes is being burned. Do we know how much pollution that causes? asked the bench. The court has also asked the Central Pollution Control Board to conduct a study on the amount of pollutants released from the burning of crop residue and submit a report.With the recent spike in pollution due to lighting of firecrackers on Diwali, the court suggested that the government could consider giving fewer firecracker licences and designate certain areas for fireworks display.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Its well connected to the cricket stadium where incidentally the pavilion, the first structure to go up on the ground that used to be filled with fly-ash in the days gone by, is named after Dr. Vizzy. It could well have been Sir Vizzy for he was knighted by the Queen in the 30s but relinquished it after India became a free country. Vizzy wasnt even the crown prince, he was the second son of the king and his brother ascended the throne, but he was a man with great ambition, and tagged himself with the unique title Maharajakumar, son of Maharaja.The old fort of Vizianagaram of Vizzys ancestors still stands, an 8-rupee shared-auto ride from the bus stand. Eateries abound here and there with delectable local fare. There isnt much to see but the old man guarding the gate tells you to go around the fort, from outside, to see narrow holes in the grounds. It used to be a moat filled with crocodiles to keep the enemies at bay. A trust MANAS runs a school inside the dilapidated fort now, and a small book-fair  books from Peter Drucker to Amitav Ghosh are spread out on a few tables  is currently being held on the eve of the Test. Schoolgirls form a disciplined queue and walk towards the books.About 10 kms from the fort, stands a Sainik school, which once used to be Vizzys palace with a tree-ringed cricket ground. Hobbs and Sutcliffe must have passed the fort to get to this palace where they not only stayed but also batted a bit. It was in Benaras in Uttar Pradesh where Vizzy moved after the death of his father into a palace owned by Vizianagaram royal family that Hobbs hit his first hundred in India. The bat with which he scored those runs is now on display at the Lords museum in London. On it, Hobbs has scribbled, I used this bat in my last Test match versus Australia at the Oval August 1930, also while scoring my first century in India at Benaras, November, 1930.Not only did he get the English openers but Vizzy also drafted in the West Indian all-rounder Learie Constantine to come play in India. Those were the days Vizzy was waging cricket wars with his arch rival the prince of Patiala Bhupinder Singh, and Constantine found himself in the thick of battle in 1933 during the final of Moin-ud-Dowlah tournament between the teams owned by the two princes. Vizzy didnt play that game but he sent a telegram to Constantine, offering to ply with pounds for runs and wickets taken. Vizzys side lost the game by three runs but his battle with Patiala prince over Indian cricket had just begun.*******Vizzy was up against a man incredibly richer than him. Bhupinder Singh was a prince with a lifestyle that can astonish even those who are used to reading about decadent lives of rich and famous. The writer Khushwant Singh had once waded into the prince on print. He was a headstrong bully, a debauch, drunkard, womanizer and philanderer. A proud owner of the famous Patiala necklace as it came to be called that he specially commissioned the Parisian jeweller Cartier and took three years in making  it had 2930 diamonds, weighed 962.25 carats, and included the 7th largest diamond in the world, a 234-carat De Beers. He was the first Indian to own an airplane, had a fleet of Rolls Royce, and the state of Patiala already had Indias first automobile, a French made De Dion Bouton imported in 1892. Also suffice here to say that his sex-tales are mind-boggling, and he reportedly had over 300 concubines.Its not known whether Bhupinder indulged in a traditional ritual but the authors of Freedom at Midnight record that his father certainly did  The Maharaja of Patiala would walk out annually, clad just in a diamond breastplate. People would cheer and greet the nude king, a custom that was supposed to ward off evil spirits from the kingdom. Unlike Vizzy, Bhupinder Singh could play pretty decent cricket, and had set his eyes on taking control over the game in the country. But Vizzy could never be accused of being chicken-hearted and was ready to take on the Patiala prince.Without the patronage of these princes, Indian cricket would have been a non-starter for it was they who ploughed money into the game. The princes sponsored tours from visiting teams, also allowed India to go on foreign tours, and the money helped cricketers and cricket to grow.Vizzy vs Bhupinder battle started much before Indias first Test tour of England. The Patiala prince had fallen out with Lord Willingdon, the viceroy of India and the patron of Indian cricket board, and Vizzy moved up as the challenger. The cricket historian Mihir Bose put Vizzy in perspective. In a land where titles were important, Maharajakumar, meaning the son of a king suggested someone connected with royalty but never likely to rule. In English terms he was, at best, a member of the landed gentry. But what he lacked in princely clout he made up in tenacity and an unrivalled capacity for intrigue.In 1931, the cancellation of MCC tour of India due to the political situation allowed Vizzy to step in. He organised cricket tours in India and Ceylon, and it was during this time when he somehow managed to convince Hobbs, who has refused several such Indian tours before, and Sutcliffe. Prominent Indian cricketers like CK Nayudu, Indian crickets first superstar who used to feature in adverts and whose name was used to promote movies, DB Deodhar and Mushtaq Ali too were part of the team. Incidentally, the current Indian and England team bus rolls past a statue of Nayudu thats near the entrance to the Vizag stadium every day. Inexplicably, though, the wondrous hitter, who hit three sixes even at the age of 61 in his last Ranji game for Andhra, is caught in a pose as if he is leaving the ball.*******It was this tour that had Hobbs, Sutcliffe and Nayudu, that Boria Majumdar who has written several tomes on the Indian cricket history especially covering the early battles in the cricket board and the tussles of these princely patrons, notes as the turning point in Vizzys career. Vizzy also cosied up to Willingdon and offered 50,000 rupees to the Indian cricket board  40,000 was proposed for Indias tour of England in 1932.But Bhupinder wasnt done yet. He not only financed the trials for the tour at the Bardari Palace ground in Patiala but also offered to sponsor Indias month-long tour in England. That tilted the scales back in his favour, and he won the first round, as he was named the captain of the touring party. The vice-captaincy was given to a prince Ghanyshyamsinhji of Limbdi and Vizzy was made the deputy vice-captain. Vizzy promptly withdrew from the tour, citing health reasons, and as it turned out, so did Bhupinder. Thus it came to pass that Maharaja of Porbandar was made the captain but luckily, for India, he realised he was the worst cricketer in the camp, and asked CK Nayudu to captain the team.However, Bhupinder lost his hold on the cricketing powers by 1933, perhaps due to Lord Willingdon, and in his book, Bose mentions a 1933 meeting where the members of the board had turned against him. The prince though wouldnt be dissuaded, and threw in the money to win back the hearts. In 1934, during a MCC tour of India, he arranged hunts and shoots for the English, and reportedly won the favour of the captain Douglas Jardine. However Jardine also ended up boosting the profile of Vizzy on that tour praising his captaincy after MCCs solitary loss of the tour came against Vizzys team.The prince and the Maharajakumar made another valiant effort to seize control over Indian cricket. Patiala donated the trophy for the domestic tournament and decided it would be named after Jamsaheb of Nawanagar, Ranjitsinghji, the famous Indian prince who played for England and had died a year before.Not to be outdone, Vizzy too donated a trophy, gold plated and made in London, for the same domestic tournament and in an attempt to ingratiate himself further with the viceroy, said it should be named after Willingdon. Vizzy suggested that Ranji hadnt done much for Indian cricket, and Indias premier tournament shouldnt be named after him. It was around this time that the teams of Vizzy and Patiala met in the final of Moin-ud-dowlah where even the presence of Constantine couldnt help Vizzys team win as Lala Amarnath came up with a counter-attacking hundred that sealed the game. The domestic tournament also rapidly progressed towards its finale  nameless and without much interest from people who were still hooked on to Pentagular tournaments then. The trophy was to be given away by Willingdon himself but Vizzy had to suffer the ignominy of watching the viceroy hand out the trophy donated by Patiala, and the tournament also named after Ranji.*******Vizzy wasnt the one to be dissuaded by such small episodes though. Even as Patiala was in London for the silver jubilee celebrations for King George V, Vizzy was busy in India, organising a tournament to honour the King. His team, that included CK Nayudu, defeated Patialas team and this time around, the viceroy handed out the original Willingdon trophy to Vizzy. His team also had Captain Jack Brittain-Jones who would later become the manager of Indian team that toured England in 1936.Patiala tried to repeat the same ploy he did before the 32 tour- offering to host the trials and sponsor the tour but by now Vizzy had moved ahead in the game. He went around the country, canvassing for votes, and managed to secure the captaincy for himself. And unlike the maharaja of Porbandar, he didnt allow CK Nayudu to captain, and played himself in all the three Tests. This was the tour that also saw Vizzy send back Lala Amarnath on disciplinary grounds.Vizzy averaged 16.21, his captaincy came under fire, and he cut a sorry figure on the field: a plumpish, rather hunched figure, perpetually standing in the slips and peering through spectacles at a game he did not seem to understand.It wasnt just Amarnath, CK Nayudu faced Vizzys wrath, too. Vizzy had Baqa Jilani abuse Nayudu at the breakfast table, and rewarded Jilani by giving a Test cap. On that tour, he also asked Syed Mushtaq Ali to run out Vijay Merchant but Ali duly informed Merchant when he joined him at the crease.For all the criticism, though, Vizzy had achieved his dreams. Not only did he manage to captain India in Tests, but he also got knighted on the tour. The once minor royal who couldnt become the king of Vizianagaram had come a long way.Meanwhile, his once-arch rival Bhupinder not only lost control of cricket but also was fast losing his virility. He tried various concoctions from Indian doctors and even tried radium therapy from the French doctors, but in vain.However, Collins and Lapierre nail the issue of his death in their book. It was not a lack of virility that afflicted the jaded and sated prince. His was a malady that plagued not a few of his surfeited fellow rulers. It was boredom. He died of it.In later years, Vizzy became a commentator, selector, board president, and a politician. His commentary too was reportedly dull, captured best by a story told by his fellow commentator Dicky Rutnagur, featuring the West Indian batsman Rohan Kanhai. Tired of Vizzy yakking on about his numerous tiger hunts, Kanhai, supposedly asked him, How do you kill them?I shoot them.. And Kanhai let it rip: Really? I thought you just left a transistor radio on when you were commentating and bored them to death.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
58e52d057be9e05a951f512b,Indus farmers grew rice independently of China ,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161121/jsp/nation/story_120452.jsp,2016-11-21,"Archaeologists excavate pits to look for crop residues at sites of the Indus civilisation in Haryana. Picture by Cameron Petrie New Delhi, Nov. 20: Farmers in the Indus civilisation had independently domesticated rice and grown it as an annual summer crop long before rice from China spawned the crops cultivation across the Gangetic plains, new archaeological excavations have established. These excavations, at three sites in Haryana, provide strong scientific evidence for a longstanding but muchdebated idea that the domestication of rice had occurred independently in China and South Asia, archaeologists involved in the excavations said today. The new research, published today in the journals Antiquity and the Journal of Archaeological Science, also suggests that the Indus people were the first to exploit complex, multicropping strategies, planting crops across both seasons. While earlier excavations had revealed rice grains at Lahuradewa, Uttar Pradesh, dated to about 6000 BC, sections of archaeologists had argued they represented the exploitation of wild rice and not real domestication, which they said began only after rice from China arrived about 2000 BC. Now archaeologists from Indias Banaras Hindu University and the University of Cambridge in the UK have discovered evidence indicating a progressive increase in the proportion of domestic types of rice and a decrease in wild types between 2430 BC and 2140 BC. This would imply rice domestication in India about 400 years earlier than presumed. Weve found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process in ancient South Asia, likely based around the wild species Oryza nivara, Jennifer Bates, an archaeobotanist at Cambridge who specialises in South Asian archaeology, said. The archaeologists examined crop material from two sites Masudpur in Hissar district and Bahola in Karnal districtand found what they say is a pattern of slow development of rice exploitation from wild foraging to farming with full cultivation. Until now, many had argued that the Indus people had not routinely cultivated rice, Ravindra Nath Singh, the team member at BHU, told The Telegraph. Our findings suggest that rice domestication had already occurred in South Asia before the arrival of Oryza japonica (the Chinese variety). The analysis of weed residues from the sites suggests that the Indus civilisation farmers had introduced multicrop farming that is practised even today, growing rice, millets and beans during summer and wheat, barley and pulses in winter. Some of the Indus civilisation sites received both summer and winter rain, which may have encouraged multicropping practices, the scientists said. We found evidence for yearlong farming that predates its appearance in other river valley civilisations, said Cameron Petrie, the third team member. Most contemporary civilisations used either summer or winter crops, he said. Mesopotamia, for instance, grew wheat and barley during winter, while China produced rice and millets during summer. The study, supported by the Archaeological Survey of India and funded by the UKIndia Education Research Initiative and other agencies, has also yielded the first absolute radiocarbon dates for Indus crops 2890 BC to 2630 BC for millets and winter pulses, 2580 BC to 2460 BC for horsegram, and 2430 BC to 2140 BC for rice. Weve had earlier evidence for rice suggesting independent domestication from Lahuradewa and other sites in the Gangetic plains, said Rakesh Tiwari, director general of the ASI, who was not associated with the Cambridge BHU study. The dates ranged from about 6000 BC to about 3000 BC. However, until now, some archaeologists had viewed rice residues from a site called Mahagara in Uttar Pradesh as the earliest evidence of full domestication. Some had attributed the earlier rice residues as exploitation of wild rice. Another archaeologist, Dorian Fuller from the University College, London, had in earlier research papers argued that there was no evidence for rice agriculture until about 2000 BC, by which time the Chinese variety had been brought into India."

Indias goods trade deficit with China has ballooned from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $52.7 billion in 2015-16.Beetle fearChina is the worlds largest rice importer. However, Beijing had so far not granted market access to Indias non-basmati rice claiming that the item had failed to meet Chinese norms on quality, health and safety. Its apprehensions included the possibility of the Khapra beetle (or cabinet beetle) pest getting transported along with Indian non-basmati rice consignments to China.Official sources said after numerous requests from the Indian side, Chinese officials visited India in September to inspect 19 rice mills registered with the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO). These mills are in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. To export to nations including China, it is mandatory that Indian rice exporters are registered with NPPO, the Indian government agency for inspecting the mills and granting certificates on plant health for export purposes.The NPPO assisted its Chinese counterpart AQSIQ during the inspection for pest-risk analysis and plant quarantine purposes to ensure that the non-basmati consignments from India will be pest-free, safe and of good quality.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Indian Commerce Ministry was also involved in the process. India had earlier sent the information sought by AQSIQ regarding the quality protocol and standard operating procedures, the sources said.They said the Indian embassy in Beijing informed the Commerce Ministry that Chinese authorities, last week, cleared 17 of these 19 mills for rice exports to China. The Commerce Ministry has forwarded the list to APEDA and asked it to inform rice exporters to soon find customers in China."

This means the profit margin for the next two times will be higher as the input costs involved will be much lower,"" Rai said.He said that many others in his village were keen to use some part of their land for growing various medicinal herbs which have good commercial value.The traditional grain-growing farmer, however, did put in a few hours of training to master the cultivation process of Shalaparni.Rai took part in a special training programme conducted by Dabur India Ltd, as part of its Environment Sustainability strategy.The Head of Bioresources group at the Dabur Research and Development Centre, Sarvepalli Badri Narayan, said the initiative involves both farmers and tribals and would benefit around 2,500 households spread across eight states.""We focus only on marginal farmers and tribal communities and encourage them to grow medicinal herbs on only a part of their land. We give them technical assistance as well,"" Narayan told IANS.""It engages them to a large extent, providing them visible economic opportunities while helping the conservation of the natural resources in wide ranging eco-systems,"" the official said.This IANS correspondent visited the fully automated state-of-the-art greenhouse in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, dedicated exclusively for medicinal plants, including Akarakala, Ativisha, Taxus, Shalaparni and many others.The facility caters to the supply of ""elite"" planting material to the farmers enabling them to cultivate and supply well-standardised medicinal plants on a large scale.""We create artificial environment -- of the Himalayas to that of the Thar -- in this facility to grow different kinds of plants that have different requirements,"" he said.After initial germination stages, the saplings are shipped to different parts of India and given to farmers for further phases of their cultivation.On harvest, they are bought back on mutually agreed terms. Dabur has grown and distributed close to 7.5 lakh saplings of rare medicinal herbs to farmers in 2015-16 from its greenhouse.""This continuous engagement with the community has helped revive a host of endangered plant species and established a sustainable source of livelihood for the farming and forest-based communities,"" Narayan said.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 80 per cent population in developing countries is dependent on traditional systems of medicine, which are mostly plant-based.""We have identified around 100 rare and critical medicinal herbs. Today, we are cultivating 23 of these herbs and have drawn up a road map to initiate cultivation of another 27,"" Narayan added.Dabur has embarked on a journey to become the largest bulk grower of rare medicinal herbs, with 2,700 acres of land currently under cultivation of these rare medicinal plants. Their strategy would be to increase the number to 3,800 by the end of the 2016-17 financial year.Narayan said that the company is also establishing herbal gardens across ayurvedic colleges and universities in India. ""These would make available rare ayurvedic medicinal plants for the coming generations,"" he said."
58e50ac1a3d24b4437c4a825,The centralising instinct,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-centralising-instinct/article16712866.ece,2016-11-28,"The shock and awe of demonetisation has left no one in India untouched. Equally no one has been left with any doubt as to the fact that the policy originates with the Prime Minister, and that they are being asked to bear with short-term inconvenience in order to advance the longer-term national interest.Reams of newsprint have been devoted to the economics of demonetisation. Here I take stock of the questions raised by demonetisation for the direction of Centre-State relations.Unmediated by the StatesAs a policy initiative of the Central government, demonetisation is unique in recent times for reaching everyone in the country directly, unmediated by the filter of State governments. State governments do not appear to have been consulted ahead of the announcement, and in many cases demonetisation has directly undermined the routine administration of policies under their purview. Many have expressed frustration that they are powerless to address hardships faced by people unable to pay for treatment in private hospitals or of farmers unable to access loans from, or make repayments at, cooperative banks.Unsurprisingly, a number of States have complained that the way in which the policy was enacted violates the spirit of cooperative federalism about which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken so often.Furthermore, the design of the new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India include new national symbols that challenge regional sensibilities. For the first time, the new banknotes include Devanagari numerals, threatening to reignite old settled compromises over the national language within Indias federal union. The use of Devanagari numerals is already the subject of a PIL in the Madras High Court.The back-side of the new banknotes also carry the logo of the Union government policy, Swachh Bharat.All of this is in line with broader attempts to refocus political debates around national questions since 2014. Mr. Modi has consistently called for the strengthening of cooperative federalism, recognising that he is reliant on the cooperation of State governments to achieve national policy goals.A matter of identificationFor decades as Indias polity and economy became more decentralised and the States became the centre-ground of political life, they have been the primary level of political identity for most voters.In a situation where voters found it difficult to correctly identify which level of government was responsible for any given policy and chains of electoral accountability became quite opaque, State governments became adept at claiming the credit for Central government initiatives. Voters frequently give the credit for programmes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) or the National Rural Health Mission to their State governments rather than to the Central government.In the post-poll National Election Study conducted by Lokniti, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) during the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 42 per cent of voters who had benefited from MGNREGA gave the credit for the programme to their State government and only 27 per cent to the Central government. This looks vastly different to the situation in Brazils federal setting, for instance, where over 80 per cent of voters in 2010 attributed the countrys flagship social programme, Bolsa Familia, to the President.Mr. Modis election victory in 2014 challenged, although it has not displaced, the idea that the States serve as the primary unit of political affiliation. It was an election campaign that had a more national character and Mr. Modis candidacy and populist leadership style extended the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to farther-flung parts of the country.Once in office, Brand Modi has involved the projection of the Prime Ministers presence and authority across areas of government activity. Programmes have been carefully rebranded in an effort to better enable the Central government to claim credit for them and to limit the ability of the States to do so.Mamata Banerjees challengeStates have had different reactions to this. The most outspoken critic of Mr. Modis style of government at a regional level has been West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation. Just a day earlier she had raised objections to the fact that the Central government now makes MGNREGA payments directly into workers bank accounts. She has also railed against the naming of Central programmes after the Prime Minister, for which State governments are required to provide matched funding.In August, her counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, explained that his State was right to drag its heels over the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme). He called for the scheme to be renamed the PM-CM farmer insurance scheme, or  Kendra-Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana ( Centre-State Crop Insurance Scheme) if the States were expected to bear half the financial burden.Last month, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav distributed ration cards along with bags of wheat and rice  under the National Food Security Act  that carried pictures of him. The BJPs State spokesperson complained bitterly that the State government was playing politics by trying to claim credit for a policy of the Central government.There has not, however, so far been a resounding critique of the Modi governments version of cooperative federalism from most States. Demonetisation itself has been welcomed by Chief Ministers of both BJP and non-BJP ruled States alike, including Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha and Telangana, although some have criticised elements of its execution and potential to hit State revenues.For those critical of the centralising instincts of the Modi government, demonetisation presents an opportunity to refocus debates on Centre-State relations. Yet at the moment, many regional parties seem more intent on continuing a pattern of Centre-region bargaining rather than building new cross-State alliances that would act as a counterweight to the Central government.Even in the absence of a coordinated inter-State opposition alliance, for the Central government there is the risk that the centralisation of credit claiming for government policies could start to reduce the political incentives of opposition-ruled States to cooperate with the Central government in achieving national goals or implementing Centrally designed policies. This matters since State governments remain crucial for policy implementation. It is even more significant after the enhanced fiscal devolution to States following the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which gives States greater flexibility to decide priorities for government expenditure.A deeper debate neededThe time is right to engage in a deeper debate about Centre-State relations and the operation of federalism. There are major constitutional innovations in the offing such as the GST Council, designed to realise a more cooperative model of federalism in which the Central government and the States pool their sovereignty in order to pursue national economic goals. The counterpart to this platform of cooperation should be a deeper discussion about Centre-State relations and a focus on enhancing the incentives for States to cooperate with the Centre while preserving their autonomy.Louise Tillin is Senior Lecturer in Politics at the Kings India Institute, Kings College, London.An outspoken critic at a regional level has been Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation"

On Thursday, tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and ATMs across the country, as the first payday since the recall of the high-value banknotes raised fears of more chaos amid the severe cash crunch.Most government and private sector employees get their salaries credited to their accounts on the last day of the month and millions of people were expected to withdraw cash to meet their immediate needs  such as school and medical fees, newspaper bills, and other sundry purchases. In India, 78% of consumer payments are made in cash, which the government is attempting to change.A penniless Lal, however, has a way out. As he has now decided to do what almost everyone in his village has been doing for a week now - barter grains for goods.He offered the village merchant Pooran Gupta a sack full of wheat, weighing 100 kg, in exchange for vegetables, spices, wheat flour, rice and oil. He has another one at his house that he plans to trade sometime later. The owner of the field they had worked on had given them the wheat in exchange for their labour.This is the only way I can make sure my family has food and lentils with their meals. The children dont understand the problem, we cant make them understand either. They want food and we have to arrange (for food), Lal said.Money is no longer available to us. God knows when we will have work.The daughter-in-law of one of his dead brothers, Meena, is worried about arranging for the wedding of her eldest daughter. Sumans wedding has been fixed to be held on December 20 and the family doesnt have much cash to spend on the ceremonies.Meenas husband has a broken hand and her three children are too young to work. However, unlike Lal, this family has one bigha of land and rice  in abundance after the autumn harvest  would be the medium for exchange. As will be wheat for potatoes, flour, vegetables, cooking oil, spices and even for salt.Families like Meenas have been dealing in rice and wheat as currency in the countryside.I will have to trade the rice even for clothes. How will my daughter live in her sasural (in laws house) if we fail to provide right hospitality to the baratis (guests from the grooms family)? She will be teased for any folly of ours. I cannot jeopardise her dignity, we will do the best we can to arrange funds, Meena said.She has struck a deal with a farmer who would give her ghee or clarified butter, vegetables and flour for the wedding feast. In turn, he will keep one-quarter of the wheat crop the family would sow.To earn some cash, she has started working in households in Kalyanpur, 15 km away from Ghazipur, and will barter the paddy for the clothes from local shops.Gupta, the merchant who has struck some goods deals with the villagers, set a reminder. He said the barter system will not work as the villagers are bound to run out of things to exchange.Cash squeeze has begun hurting me. The number of people for barter is increasing by the day and how long I can barter is the question before me? he asked."
58e51143a3d24b4437c4ac54,Language was no barrier in making sammelan a success,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/article16766822.ece,2016-12-06,"The 82nd edition of the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan, which concluded here on Sunday, is memorable for more than one reason.First, the event made a difference with better crowd management. The organisers, with their experience of previous sammelans, expected around 7,000 delegates and around 30,000 visitors each day and made arrangements accordingly. To their surprise, the event attracted a 1.25-lakh crowd on the first day and between 80,000 and 1,00,000 on the last two days. However, the organisers somehow managed to provide food for almost all of them and avoided possible chaos at the food court. Police personnel worked day and night for managing crowds, controlling traffic, and dealing with security issues.It was one of the best organised sahitya sammelans where the food section was neatly managed despite huge crowds thronging the venue at the eleventh hour, B. Rajendra, a teacher from Shivamogga, who is also a winner of the national award for teachers, said. He has attended at least 10 sammelans in the past.Secondly, people with different linguistic backgrounds came together and played a crucial role in making the event a success. Deputy Commissioner S. Sasikanth Senthil, who led the reception committee and its 33 sub-committees involved in organising the event, is a Tamil. Superintendent of Police Chetan Singh Rathor, who maintained law and order, controlled traffic, and ensured safety of VIPs and other guests leading a posse of around 2,000 police personnel, is a Hindi speaker from Uttar Pradesh. Raichur Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer M. Kurma Rao, who supervised many sub-committees involved in organising the event, is a Telugu. N.S. Boseraju, MLA, and working president of the event, is also a Telugu.Deputy commissioners are the chief conveners of sahitya sammelans. Mr. Senthil, however, made a difference. For the first time in my experience I have seen a non-Kannadiga Deputy Commissioner passionately involving himself so much and relentlessly working day and night make the sammelan a success, Mahantesh Maski, writer and sahitya parishat functionary, told The Hindu . The functioning of the district sahitya parishat, he added, appeared to be dull in comparison with the rigorous work of the officer.Other non-Kannadigas too involved themselves at various levels for the success of the event. S.R. Reddy, MLA for Narayanpet in Telangana, and Vishnukantha Budada, who jointly provided food for delegates, were of Telugu and Rajasthani origin. Many in the Raichur Rice Millers Association that provided food to lakhs of people, including A. Papareddy, former MLA, are of Telugu origin.The huge venues, book stalls, food court, exhibition centres and other temporary structures for the sammelan were built by Tamils. The food for lakhs of public was prepared by a team of Gujaratis led by Babulal Jain, a Pakistani refugee. Besides, many Rajasthani speaking Marwaris and Urdu-speaking Muslims sponsored and served water, cool drinks, butter milk, snacks and other refreshment to artists and the people during the six-km long colourful procession on the first day.Mr. Senthil is leaving Raichur with fond memories and satisfaction as he is transferred to Bengaluru to the Department of Mines and Geology. His transfer order issued a month ago was withheld till the completion of the sammelan."
590a2e317be9e033fa430356,Meet the Asurs — a marginal tribe that describes Durga as a goddess who enticed Mahishasur,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/meeting-the-asurs-a-marginal-tribe-in-eastern-india/,2016-12-08,"HRD Minister Smriti Irani expressed shock in Parliament at anyone describing Durga as a goddess who entices Mahishasur, a brave, self-respecting leader.Its true that we have never celebrated Durga Puja, says Chamru Asur. It is also true that we remain inactive during those nine days and, at the end of it, make offerings to our ancestors so that we are all safe, says the 70-year-old at his home in Sakhuapani, a village 500 metres from the Hindalco Groups Gurdari bauxite mine in Gumla district of Jharkhand.WATCH VIDEO: The Earliest Known Ramleela In Chitrakoot Preserved In Its Original FormOn February 24, after reading from a pamphlet purportedly distributed in Jawaharlal Nehru University, which, the minister said, had depicted Durga in poor light and Mahishasur as the victim, Irani had said, What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it.As he speaks about his traditions and way of life, Chamru is almost passive  not apologetic, not defensive, not angry, not seeking answers.Chamru is an Asur, a particularly vulnerable tribal group that dominates Sakhuapanis population of about 2,000 and lives in villages spread over a radius of 10 to 20 km. Besides Jharkhand, members of the tribe live in pockets of Bihar, West Bengal and a few other states. The 2011 Census put the number of Asurs at 22,459 in Jharkhand and 4,129 in Bihar.Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey) Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)The Asurs claim to be descendants of Mahishasur, the buffalo-demon whom Goddess Durga kills after a spirited fight lasting nine nights. Its this mythology in mainstream Hinduism thats celebrated in the form of the nine-day-long Durga Puja, but observed as Mahishasur Dasain among the Asurs, who hold a period of mourning during which they largely stay indoors.Chamru says that even when he was a child, though people had their beliefs and biases, nobody attacked them for it, they merely thought they were different. Those were the days of zamindari. The zamindar of Bishunpur (now the local police station) would ask us to get wood and collect leaves for making pattals for the puja. We would go there, give the zamindar all this and also give him some of our tools. We would then return home before the celebrations began and offer prayers seeking protection from our own ancestors, says Chamru.WATCH VIDEO: Dussehra Celebration At Red FortNow as these cultures are seen as offending, Chamru says these are just beliefs. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you. I cant tell you how our descendants settled down in this part of the country and so on, he says.***Sushma Asur, a tribal activist in Sakhuapani, says the community also celebrates Sohrai, which coincides with Diwali, by applying koronj (or karanja in Hindi) oil on their navel, chest and nose, and eat cucumber. The symbolism here is that when our ancestor Mahishasur was killed, he had blood oozing from his navel, nose and chest. Applying oil on those parts depicts the same. Eating cucumber is a symbol that we are avenging his death by eating the kaleja (liver) of the killer, Sushma explains.In her 20s, Sushma says she has studied up to Class XII and is working with tribal activists to revive our lost traditions, songs and skills. Over the years, she says, there are several of these traditions that have given way to modern practices of the outsiders.Asurs, she says, were once iron smelters, but now the village doesnt have a smelting unit. Chamru says he used to make small weapons, but I have forgotten all that now. According to one of the theories, the Magadh Empire benefited a lot from the weapons the Asurs made. Their iron does not catch rust. And we know there are many Ashokan-era edicts on iron that havent rusted, says Ashwani Kumar Pankaj, a tribal activist in Ranchi.Traditionally, Asurs dont drink cow milk. We want the calf to have all the milk and grow up strong so that it can be used in the fields, says Anil Asur, Sushmas brother. Villagers still dont drink much milk or tea, happy instead to down a glass of rice beer.***Carron tea estate in West Bengals Jalpaiguri district is hundreds of kilometres away from Jharkhands Sakhuapani village. Its here, down a hillock carpeted with emerald-green tea bushes, that Bargi Asur, 83, lives with his family. Reading a Hindi newspaper in the courtyard of his house, Bargi introduces himself as the oldest resident of Asur Line, a colony of about 100 mud and bamboo huts in the tea estate. Bargi says he isnt surprised that the minister said what she did in Parliament. She is not the first person to say our beliefs are wrong. For centuries, we have been afraid to talk about them openly. Now we carry out our rituals almost apologetically, says Bargi, whose son and grandchildren converted to Christianity a few years ago.At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta) At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Bargi himself chose not to convert because he wouldnt be able to adjust to a new way of life. My two sons and my grandchildren work as tea pickers at the estate. Thats what I have done all my life too. I couldnt give them a better life, maybe a new faith will bring some light in their lives, he says.Bargi belongs to a group of about 1,000 Asurs, who moved from Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh in the early 20th Century and work and live near the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. My father moved here in 1914 to work for a British tea planter. We have lived here ever since. Its been more than a century now, he says.Jagannath Singh, 67, a social worker who used to work as a primary school teacher at the Carron tea estate school, says the story of the Asurs is like that of most other particularly vulnerable tribal groups of the country, but with a cruel twist. Apart from abject poverty, they also have to deal with social stigma. The Asurs in Jalpaiguri were recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in 2014, after years of struggle, says Singh.He says that of the 101 Asur families living in Carron tea estate, more than 90 have converted to Christianity. They have little choice. They feel this new identity will give them a better life, he says.Yet, some find ways to keep both their new and old identities. We observe Asur puja twice a year, once during the month of Phagun (March-April) and once during Dusshera. The puja can be performed only by men, and women later participate in a traditional asura dance, says Etwari Asur, 75.Lalita Asur, 38, who works in the estate and had converted to Christianity about five years ago, says life has taught her to be careful about revealing her true identity. Why should I claim to be Mahishasurs descendant? Am I mad? she laughs. A lot of us have taken on different surnames such as Topo and Kajur, says Lalita.Over the years, the Asurs, both of Jalpaiguri and of Sakhuapani in Jharkhand, have migrated to cities in search of jobs, most youngsters dont speak the Asuri language any more and their worries are as mainstream as any other. The only thing they hold on to are memories  of stories told by their parents, of childhood fears and anxieties.Back in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand, Sushma recalls how over the years she began getting acutely aware of the fact that the asurs or demons were always depicted as ugly and were primarily painted black. All demons are dark-skinned, ugly and evil. Now, we trace our lineage to them. Tell me, do we look like anything like that? she asks.

(Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)Expert column: Struggle for survival, not of faithThe term tribal defies any universal definition. Between the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia and the Indigenous People of North America, there is a shared historical fact. They were all there before the colonial powers pushed them to margins. This is not so in the case of all tribal communities in India.Some of the Indian tribes such as the Onges and the Jarawas of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been entirely indigenous. Some others like the Banjaras in Western and Central India and the Gujjars in the Himalayas have been nomadic. And, some, such as several sub-groups of Bhills, have migrated in various historical phases to their present geographical locations. The stories of migration of such communities are found in their oral traditions. The diverse histories of tribes in India are seen among the Particularly Vulnerable Groups as well. The term primitive used for them at one time has fortunately been declared as pejorative.

As a result, it was not taken up since the formation of the State.When the cards were finally printed and ready for distribution, the Centre dropped a bombshell. It took objection to printing of the pictures of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Civil Supplies Minister Etala Rajender on the cards like in some other States. The pictures were traditionally printed on the cards by every government. The Centres grouse is that it has propriety on the ration cards, now called the Food Security cards, because it supplies subsidised rice to the States under the Food Security Act. It took particular exception to the photos of leaders on cards in Uttar Pradesh which is going to polls shortly.The Telangana government was forced to hold back distribution of cards and await the Centres response to a letter.Collectors high-handednessGovernment staff in one of the newly created districts in Telangana are upset over its Collectors high-handedness. Word has it that the Collector insists that all staff live in the district headquarters, even though many have conveyed difficulties in moving from the parent district. Insiders say the official also takes liberty in admonishing senior staff, which has led to discontent. Irrespective of their designations, even leave applications have to be sent to the Collector. Employees rue the working conditions in the new district, stating that its creation and subsequent appointment of the officer may have been an ill-thought move.For more accountabilityThe Telangana State governments recent decision to introduce biometric attendance system in the institutions of higher learning has no doubt brought cheers to parents, but the move has raised many an eyebrow.The decision comes in the light of complaints relating to a section of private colleges submitting false reports relating to attendance of students and teachers alike to garner benefits like fee reimbursement. There are allegations that some colleges were taking advantage of the existing system to cover up their failures like maintenance of student-teacher ratio and other key aspects and this was causing a drain on the exchequer.Coming in this background, the decision is expected to streamline the functioning of these educational institutions on whom the government pins high hopes of generating qualified and trained human resources, a key element in ensuring the accelerated growth of the State.Being in power after retirementVery few civil servants get an opportunity to hold key positions even after retirement and Rajiv Sharma, who hanged up his boots as the Chief Secretary to the Government of Telangana on November 30, seems to be among the top of such list. Not only was he made Chief Advisor to the State government on the day of his retirement, but Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao made no bones of his importance as he announced during the farewell function to Dr. Sharma that although he had retired as Chief Secretary, his position as the Chief Advisor would be nothing short of it. Immediately, he has been provided a chambers in the Chief Ministers Office itself. Besides, orders followed making Dr. Sharma the Chairman of Telangana State Pollution Control Board. He has also been made Advisor to the Cabinet Sub-Committee set up to formulate guidelines on allowing the establishment of private universities in the State.- Reporting by N. Rahul, Rohit P.S., M.

5904711e7be9e04154df6cc6,Wheat imports will help improve supply and restrain any sharp surge in prices,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/wheat-imports-will-help-improve-supply-and-restrain-any-sharp-surge-in-prices/,2016-12-12,"The government move to sharply reduce the import duty on wheat from 25% to zero at the end of the last week has set off howls of protest from farmer lobbies and other assorted groups. The argument has been that such free imports would dampen domestic wheat prices and hurt Indian farmers while it would help traders and large multinationals who largely dominate wheat trade.On the face of it the government move seem surprising. Its decision to boost minimum support price of wheat by Rs 75 to Rs 1525 per quintal, one of the largest increases in recent years, have helped boost the sowing of wheat in the rabi season. Total sown area under the wheat crop has gone up by around 10% to 226 lakh hectare by 9th December.And the crop has not been too bad in recent years. Wheat output has picked up from a low of 86.5 million tons in 2014-15 to 94 million tons in 2015-16 which is close to target set for the year. However, the fact remains that both wheat and rice production has largely stagnated since the turn of the current decade.But what makes the current scenario especially worse in the case of wheat is that the buffer stocks have whittled down rather sharply in recent months. Wheat stocks with the government which peaked at 32.6 million tons in June 2016, soon after the rabi market season, has been halved to 16.4 million tons by December 2016.This is a precarious situation as the stocks were never so low in recent years. In fact despite a bad crop the wheat stocks with the government were 26.8 million tons in December 2015 and as much as 31 million tons in December 2014. And the demand for wheat is likely to be buoyant especially given the need for meeting the demand for grains from the PDS under the food security act.And the signals from the price front has been ominous. Wholesale wheat prices which had fallen in the first three months of the last year has seen prices shoot up by more than 5% in the early months of the current year. In fact wheat prices has shot up double digits a few months back. Though it has climbed down to the 6% plus range in the most recent month the stage is now all set for a further rise given the depleted wheat stocks with the government.And this is not the first time that the government has used customs duty to reduce the gap between demand and supply. In fact the first UPA government reduced import duties on wheat from 50% to zero in 2006 after two years of bad wheat crops. And this time it is especially bad because though the rabi wheat crop sown in the current year is now excess of the norm the sown area has fallen in important states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. By allowing for free import of wheat the government has made the best out of a bad situation without waiting for the crisis to get out of hand and reach alarming proportions"

Once it becomes successful, then NIH would replicate it in some ten villages of Muzaffarnagar and Meeruth under the Integrated Water Resource Management project which is sponsored by union ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.Senior scientist of NIH, VC Goyal told TOI, ""We are exploring creation of a model for inclusive development of a village in Ibrahimpur Masahi village which will be applied in 10 villages of Muzaffarnagar and Meeruth next year. We are purifying the waste water of the village through wetland technique. The villagers are being trained about the right practices of agriculture and water conservation. Once they learn it all then they would face no shortage of water for agriculture or personal consumption and, also have crops which will give them good yield and revenue.""The waste water near handpumps in the village has been streamlined into a pond like structure. Under wetland technique, water is being treated for its impurities with pebbles and enzymes in liquid form. Ravinder Saini , gram Pradhan beamed saying that now the villagers are planning to start rearing fish in the pond. The fruit trees would also be planted on the edges of the pond which would also provide shade alongwith fruit.""The soil of our agriculture fields was tested by NIH scientists. We were educated about the deficiencies prevailing in the soil and, the kind of fertilizers required to treat them. We also learnt about crop diversification as to which species of crops to be grown which consume less water and provide more yield and fetch good price in the market, "" he said, giving example that the villagers were informed not to grow water intensive crops such as rice or sugarcane and rather switch over to vegetables and pulses. They were also taught about the methods of rain water harvesting and its benefits.Goyal is hopeful that experiment with this village will pave way to provide useful inputs for other villages across India which are being developed under flagship schemes of the Government of India such as Krishi Sinchai Yojna, Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and SPM Rurban Mission and MNREGA Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act."

The unit, located on the premises of Udyogiri at Gandamunda area, is equipped with eight motor-enabled oil extraction machines.Earlier, a Kachi ghani mustard oil unit existed at the same location which was destroyed in the super cyclone of 1999. With financial assistance from the State Government, the OKVIB took an initiative to revive the unit at a cost of `10 lakh. The cold pressed machines which can extract upto 60 litres of mustard oil per day, have been procured from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, OKVIB Chairman Tejeswar Parida said.Procurement of mustard seeds to run the plant will be done from remote districts of the State where farmers are victims of distress sale. Raw material will be purchased at market price from farmers through Odisha Consumer Cooperative Federation - Bhanjaprabha from all districts. This will eliminate the scope of farmers getting exploited by middlemen, Parida added.Inaugurating the processing unit, MSME Minister Jogendra Behera exhorted consumers to purchase mustard oil from OKVIB to support small farmers. The products are 100 per cent adulteration free and more such units are required to imbibe financial independence of people in remote areas, he added.The Board will soon install a honey processing plant with capacity of 100 kg of honey per day at the same facility. The honey processing plant will be procured from Pune. Once the facility is fully operational, the Board expects to supply more processed honey inside and outside State.On the occasion, sanction letters of village industries were distributed to 26 entrepreneurs from six districts. Projects like rice mill, paper cup and plate production, beauty parlour, automobile servicing, ready-made garment manufacturing, cement products and carpentry were approved for assistance by the MSME Department."

Jharkhands people, mostly women, suffer from iron deficiency. The DFS salt will help fight against anemia, said food and public distribution minister Saryu Rai.Colour of the salt will be pale yellow, he said.Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh governments too earlier launched the similar double fortified salt.Jharkhand has the highest number of women having iron deficiency in the country with 70% females between the age group of 15 and 49 are anemic, according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-III).Head of gynecology department of Patliputra Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) Dr Pratibha Rai said, Anaemia has been a bane for Jharkhand women. 90% of women visiting PMCH are anaemic. Anaemia causes low productivity in adults, slow development among children, severe anaemia also leads to low birth weight and child mortality.She said state health department took several initiatives such as distribution of iron pills to control anaemia. Lack of awareness among people is proving to be a major hindrance in the success of the programmes. Rural women do not take iron pills regularly. We hope DFS salt could bring some result in controlling anaemia, Rai said.Disbursement of the salt will be made through biometric system like other PDS items sold through the fair price shops. Under the system consumers require to give thumb impressions to get a link to their biometric data recorded under their Aadhaar number to collect the PDS items, said Sanjay Kundu, state general secretary of the Fair Price Dealers Association.He said earlier iodized salt was given to the ration card holders, which was a huge hit among consumers.Distribution of double fortified salt is the second big PDS programme undertaken by the state government. From October last year it started distributing 5 kg of rice and wheat per household for Rs 1 under the National Food Security Act. The scheme covered more than 2.63 crore people out of the states total population of 3.29 crore."

Rethinavelu has said that the Department of Science and Industrial Research, Government of India, has recognised the TNFMY as a scientific and industrial research organisation.Speaking to The Hindu on Sunday, he said the recognition would enable the TNFMY, a special purpose vehicle established under PPP model, to undertake research works for identifying several innovative and nutritious value-added products.The TNFMY, was set up at Sikkandarchavadi over a 30-acre site at an investment of Rs. 40 crore, with the support of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.Mr. Rethinavelu said the recognition would go a long way in helping not only agro producers, but also those engaged in food processing, traders and exporters. The all-under-one-roof facility had a scientifically built warehouse, cold storage unit, individual marketing-cum-storage depots in the southern districts.The research and development lab, he said, would help in analysing the quality of products manufactured or dealt with by food processors and traders. Recently, a research in causes for variation in milling breakage in Basmati rice grown in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was undertaken here. The inference arrived at was to carry out standardised parboiling techniques, which would reduce breakage of rice. Today, many rice mills, which processed Basmati rice, had converted the suggestion into action, he added.Mr. Rethinavelu said the TNFMY had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology, Thanjavur, for carrying out research works. Students and research scholars working in the field of food processing and other allied areas might use the research and development facility.Currently, they were studying the non-chemical jaggery on a commercial level adoption to position it in the global market. Yet another area of research was paddy analysis  physical quality analysis, cooking analysis and sensory evaluation  to bridge the gap between the farmers and millers. This would enable the farmers to get a remunerative price for their crop, he said."

For tonights meal, she and her two brothers and parents have half a roti each. Her father Babloo worries how he will arrange food tomorrow.Things began to go bad when the local stone crushing unit was shut down a few months ago due to legal tangles and Babloo and other labourers had to take up other jobs. Most of them enlisted as daily wage labourers under a contractor who paid them between Rs 500 and Rs 700. And then came demonetisation on Nov. 8. The contractor suddenly stopped work as he had no money to pay the labourers.More than 1.50 lakh labourers across Bundelkhand, particularly in and around Bharatkoop, are sitting idle. Many have left for other places in search of work, leaving behind their families.I used to earn about Rs 800 per day in the stone crushing unit. One day, it was abruptly closed. I was worried how I would feed my family. But luckily, all of us here were called by a contractor who took us in as daily wagers. But after demonetisation, the contractors told us they have no money to pay us, Babloo says.His wife, Rupa, takes up the story: For the last 15 days, I have been borrowing rice from my neighbours but now even they have run out of food. But demonetisation has shattered us completely. No one is bothered about our fate.A few metres from Babloos hut is the house of Dayaram where his family, his wife and two children stay. Dayaram left home in search of livelihood 10 days ago. The family is borrowing food from neighbours. He left home looking for work. I dont know when he will return. It is getting difficult to carry on with life. The children are going without food most days, says his wife, Munni.According to Suresh Kesarwani, the contractor, the going was smooth till demonetisation. Initially after Nov. 8 we managed to pay our labourers. But as the days passed, it became difficult to get cash. I had no other option but to stop work. All other contractors have done the same as despite making endless rounds of banks there was no money. I think the situation will continue like this for a few more months, he says.In Bharatkoop alone, there were over one lakh of labourers who earned their livelihood by working in the stone crushing units located there. They continue to stay there in the hope that the factories will start functioning soon. But then came demonetization, says another contractor, Neelkanth.A local BJP leader, Munna, told me that he and his fellow party workers are trying to do their bit for the labourers. We are talking to other contractors in Bundelkhand and asking them to employ these labourers. But not many are willing to go far, he said.Asked demonetisation, he trots out what senior BJP leaders have been saying to the nation: The situation will improve soon. Demonetisation is for the good of the people.In Banda district, some 50,000 labourers have been badly hit by demonetisation.Some have left for Lucknow, others for Allahabad, Varanasi, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Noida. Under the prevailing circumstances, Im unsure whether they can get jobs easily as no one has money to pay, says Shiv Prasad Sony, another contractor. He says that the government ought to have thought about the poor."

Gajendra Yadav Rahisan Khatun and her husband Kalar Bax Mansoori are daily wagers work as masons. Gajendra YadavOutside her one-room home in Noidas Barola village, Rahisan Khatun, 35, places wood under her stove, which keeps her warm, and cooks chicken for her family. She takes a peek to check the dish, before going inside. What is this? Can you get money from the bank with this? she says, pointing to a cheque book. Her neighbour Phool Kumar explains how to use a cheque book and an ATM card. Holding up a card, she asks, But if I cant read or write, how will I use this?Watch what else is making news:Khatun, her husband Kalar Bax Mansoori, 41, and most of her neighbours are daily wagers working as masons. Mansoori, a migrant labourer from Madhya Pradesh, says he never went to school. He cant read or write, and has never been to a bank. I cant even tell you my phone number. There is no question of using a phone to make payments, he says.Since demonetisation, Mansoori and his family of four have faced a series of predicaments. My employers have no cash, and they owe me Rs 15,000. I have asked a local shopkeeper to give me oil, rice and dal on credit. A few days ago, my sister-in-law fell sick. I had to borrow Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 from people, Mansoori says.He says work is not hard to find, but contractors and clients dont always pay on time. In a polythene bag, he has kept four Aadhaar cards  his own, his wifes and his two childrens. I thought it would be better to have a card with our Noida address on it. So I got my wifes address changed, though I am yet to change mine. Since we may all need bank accounts now, this is all we have as ID proof, says Mansoori.About 8 km from Barola, a settlement of migrant workers in Khoda Colony along NH-24 has been quietly coping with the effects of demonetisation. Here, Shiv Kumar, 25, a native of Allahabad, makes breakfast inside a room he shares with two others. I dont have a bank account. I work as a tailor. Our employers said they would open our accounts but I think they are taking us for a ride.We were paid last months salary in old notes. I wasnt able to send money home or pay rent, he says. From a nearby window, Asma, 45, who hails from Farrukhabad, looks out for her husband Sayyed, who sells bangles on a cart. There is no income unless money changes hands. If everything becomes cashless, our future could be difficult, she says. Faces of migrant daily wage labourers at Khoda labour chowk are grim. At least 60-70 of them  many from villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand  await employment at the chowk every morning. Some of them have no option but to return empty-handed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But nearly 2,500 km away from home, he is guarding the perimeter of a luxury hotel in Kasargod.The 21-year-old Robin Singh is an 18-time state champion in sub-junior, junior and senior categories between 2012 and 2016. At the Subrata Classic International Powerlifting Championship at Jamshedpur, he finished second behind Irans Arash Rezaei in the 93kg category.I thought the government would support me. But all I got was `10,000 from the district administration on the Republic Day, he said, choking on his words. Poverty was gnawing at his dream and the self-trained powerlifter left his home at Ladpur village in Bulandshahr district. Robin came to Delhi and left his CV at several staffing agencies. One of them found him a job as a security executive at The Lalit Resort & Spa at Bekal. Powerlifting is not an Olympic sport but championships are conducted regularly by federations. It is a strength sport in which contestants attempt three types of lift - squat, bench press and dead lift - in a set sequence.Born to a farmer couple - Lalita and Subhas Singh Poonia - Robin was taken to bodybuilding when he was in Class VIII in 2008. There was no sportsperson or bodybuilders in the family and my parents were baffled at my choice, he said. He converted a shed in his house into a gym, made weights out of his mothers chakki (stone grinder) and upholstered a plank with rexine for his bench press. In 2012, he drifted to powerlifting through Youtube and signed up for a trial for North Zone championship at Mathura. I sat through the tournament watching others lifting weight, learning the techniques, he said.At the NZ championship at Patiala, Robin won the gold in the 93kg category. Since then there was no looking back. I go to tournaments to learn techniques. I speak to referees for guidance, then train at home, he said. But without a proper trainer, it was just a matter of time before he herniated his spinal discs. In 2015, I had bulge in L4, L5 and S1 discs, he said. Doctors asked him to quit the sport.But after six months of rest, he returned to the ring. But the first resistance came from his home. Every day Robin drank four to five litres of milk and ate 60 almonds. His parents cultivated wheat, mustard and rice in their 1.5 acres of farmland but the income was too meagre to sustain Robins schedule. He has two younger brothers too. Luckily, my mother reared two cows and three buffaloes, he said.The frequent crop failure due to drought and rain also made his going tough. But his exploits at the Subrata Classic changed his familys perception. The villagers gave me a rousing welcome upon my return. My parents said they would support me. But I know it was tough for them. Perhaps, my dream was too big, he said. On the brighter side, Ladpur started warming up to the sport. Youngsters started approaching Robin who threw open his gym for them. But after five months, Robin left home in search of a job."

People have made up their mind to get rid of him and SP. His government encouraged only corruption and crime, and did nothing for the common man, BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said.Faced with an imminent split which could have drastically reduced his clout, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav today revoked the expulsion Akhilesh and his uncle Ramgopal, just a day after they were sacked for indiscipline.Citing incidents like Jawahar Bagh violence in Mathura in which close to 30 people died and Bulandshahr gang rape, he alleged people remember Akhilesh Yadavs rule for such incidents besides SP governments failures on health, education and infrastructure development fronts.Sharma claimed there is a Tsunami in the BJPs favour. The state government could not buy rice and wheat from farmers, causing them a lot of distress, he alleged.Akhilesh Yadav has insisted that the state has seen unprecedented development under his government and he will lead his party to victory.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
