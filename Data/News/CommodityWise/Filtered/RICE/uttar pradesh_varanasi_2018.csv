(Right) A worker coating the threads used in flying kites with finely-powdered glass, cooked rice and colour at Dabeerpura.G. Ramakrishna & Serish NanisettiFor generations, Sankranti has always meant endless blue skies, colourful kites, and reels of manja . But fewer school holidays, disquiet over Goods and Services Tax, ill-implemented ban on Chinese thread has sent the kites and manja business into a tailspin.One of the main markets in the city between Kali Kaman and Gulzar Houz has shops only on one side of the road.Usually, both sides of the road used to have shops by this time, but the business is dull and there are hardly any buyers. I am expecting the business to change from tomorrow as it is a Sunday and more children will come and buy the kites. Earlier, the vacation period used to be long, but now its only for two or four days. Maybe thats the reason for the lack of interest in flying kites, says Moiz Khan, who has set up a makeshift shop near Kali Kaman.Inside the colourfully-decorated Bajaj Patang Ghar of Bhuvan Bajaj, kites made of thin plastic sheets are covered with political messages while kitschy movie themes dominate. But its the kites made of thin colourful paper that get a pride of place. I have even made small curios with kites, charkas which people can keep at home. People are showing interest and are buying these, but there are a few takers for kites, says Mr. Bajaj.We have a small mulgi (workspace) at Yakutpura where these kites are made. Not the big factories like they have in Gujarat, Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh. It is a year-round enterprise. But the last two years have been bad. While demonetisation killed the business last year, we dont even know why it has been affected this year. Not many children are seen buying the kites. Children from as far as Tarnaka, Secunderabad and Bowenpally would come and buy from us. But this year, there are no shoppers, says Muhammad Azhar, who has opened a kite shop, but drives an auto-rickshaw in his spare time."

I heard number of farmers committing suicide in Karnataka was highest in your regime, not to mention the numerous deaths and transfer of honest officers.

The prices are as low as Rs 5 for breakfast and Rs 10 for lunch and dinner. Designed by a former Taj Group chef, the rotational menu has 25 items, which includes brinjal rice, sambar rice, pongal, khara bath, methi rice, and kesari bath as the lone sweet item. A similar canteen with subsidised food has also been envisaged by the BJP government in UP.@INCKarnataka, the twitter handle of Karnataka unit of the Congress too targeted the Adityanath government. It cited NCRB data to claim that Adityanath-ruled UP, tops India in crime signing off the tweet.Within hours, Adityanath responded. Thank you for the welcome @siddaramaiah ji.

Being out of power for so long must be hard, went the tweet in response to the Congress listing statistics on poor law and order in the state.The social media cell managing @INCUttarPradesh, the twitter handle of the UP unit of the Congress joined the war.Who are you trying to fool. We live here and know how bad the current law and order situation is. Do you want us to list all the rapes, murders, larceny etc in just 2017!, the Congresss UP unit retorted as BJPs Karnataka chief and former chief minister BS Yedyurappa joined what had by now become a free-for-all.Thanks CM @siddaramaiah for welcoming Shri @myogiadityanath ji to our state. Election eve at least has made you courteous. Inaugurating Indira canteen @officeofRG admitted Amma canteen inspired it. Hope BLR roads turned potholes under your leadership dont impact Yogiji!"

With the sun shining brightly on a leisurely Sunday, Thakur remained a craze for over 10,000 zoo visitors. The big cat was captured by a joint team of forest and zoo officials from St Franscis School after a rescue operation spanning over 8 hours. Having satiated its taste buds with over three kg of chicken meat, Thakur did not oblige many who wanted to have its glimpse on Sunday. Still, under the impact of tranquillizer, the animal could be approached only by the zoo staff. Authorities are planning to release the feline into the forests of Chitrakoot soon.High heels, saree & badminton court...!What if she was in high heel sandals and the saree. The shuttler in her drew minister of state with independent charge, Swati Singh, to the badminton court to spill the charm of her racket. The occasion was a tournament meant for non-professional and amateur women badminton players. The court, thronged by the better halves of many senior bureaucrats, had altogether a different view wherein glamour had an edge over the game. Total 125 players had taken to court on Sunday to exhibit their hidden talent and relive the era of shuttles once again.Relief for Expressway commutersIn a major succour and much-needed relief on 302-km long Lucknow-Agra Expressway, Uttar Pradesh Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) has finally planned to provide free tea and coffee to the night travellers. The purpose is to minimise mishaps. The authority feels it would help bringing the number of accidents guarding the drivers against frequent naps during night driving as hot beverages would help them concentrate in a better way. Work on the upmarket public utilities planned alongside expressway is in full swing though. Till then, this step would help satiate a craving for tea and coffee of the commuters.Khichadi of Ganga-Jamni tehzeebKhichadiMakrsankranti-specific delicacy quintessential of this part of the country  to mark the northward movement of Sun Godas usual was laced with the taste of Ganga-Jamni tehzeeb, the city of Nawabs is known for, once again on Monday when senior religious leaders of both Hindus and Muslims came together for the special feast.

For many decades, Punjabs contribution to Indias production of wheat and rice has been substantial. Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people, Amarinder said.Amarinder said of the states almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. Its our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs, the CM said.With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing high-quantity rice and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into Mohali and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.He said: Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the states youth. I want to see it grow as a major technological hub in north, he said. The city is being equipped with all the necessary facilities. Amarinder said that in the next five years, his government would keep the development of Mohali a continued process towards technological growth."

""Efforts are on ascertain the identity of the man, who had booked the consignment from Punjab. The seized consignment of alcohol and fuel container has been taken to the Baikunthpur police station of the district,"" the SP told The Telegraph.The SP said this is for the first time such a modus operandi has come to the fore. ""The cops are baffled,"" he said.In Begusarai, a truck laden with bags of rice was seized from Sahebpur Kamal police station area as it was allegedly being used to ferry liquor. The truck driver lost control and fell into a ditch after the police chased the vehicle.Begusarai superintendent of police (SP) Aditya Kumar said the consignment was to be delivered to a man at Iniyar village. The truck's driver and cleaner have been detained for interrogation.Earlier, bootleggers had used fake Indian Army permits to ferry alcohol from Punjab to north Bihar. It came to the fore when an excise team seized a truck bearing a fake Nagaland registration number at Jalalpur check post in Gopalganj district early this month. A senior excise official said the truck had entered Gopalganj from Uttar Pradesh. Acting on a tip off, excise department personnel intercepted it in an area under the jurisdiction of Kuchaikot police station and seized 300 cartons of liquor worth Rs 25 lakh.""Liquor smugglers have devised different ways to keep the tipplers happy,"" the officer said. ""From tomatoes to water melon, fuel containers to trucks laden with potatoes they use various methods to transport liquor from Punjab and Haryana.""Sources said illegal trade is facilitated by agents who coordinate with the smugglers in Punjab and Haryana."

The seller claimed that there are firms in Delhi which take a hefty fees to test the radioactive properties of the copper bowl and can buy the article for a huge price as its rare and unique.In May 2017, the seller took me to a shop that deals in antique items and is located at KG Marg. The managing director of the shop assured me that they have a legal licence, issued by various government departments, including the DRDO, to engage in the business of radioactive products, said the complainant.Radiation testThe MD enquired about the genuineness of the article and demanded Rs. 70 lakh as the cost for testing its properties, including opening and decoding chemicals, closing chemicals and anti-radiation suit and spray. He said that if the article tested positive, he will pay Rs. 50 crore the same day and buy it, the complainant said.On May 31, 2017, the businessman deposited Rs. 70 lakh at the antique shops office for the testing of the article. I was told that the radioactive range of the article is measured by the distance from which it can pull rice, said the complainant.On June 3, 2017, the businessman along with the MD, two scientists and two assistant scientists went to a farm house outside the city where he was told to stay out as the rest of them went inside a room to test the radioactive properties of the copper bowl. They came out after one hour and claimed that the article had tested positive, but could not be opened as its radioactive range had increased and its protective layers had been ruptured. They did not allow me to to see the article claiming that it was highly radioactive and dangerous for health. They all left the spot asking me to visit the office, said the complainant.Demand for more moneyAfter several rounds of meeting, the MD asked him to pay Rs. 1.25 crore more to complete the testing. I kept telling him to complete the job but after lot of negotiations he agreed to perform the test again if I deposited Rs. 80 lakh more. I got suspicious and verified the background of the antique company and realised that I had been cheated by a group of conmen, he said.Fake identityWhen he further verified the credentials of the people he had met during the deal, he realised that the MD was not even a graduate and the scientists were illiterate persons. The company did not have any licence of deal with radioactive products. When he tried to get in touch with the six men, he realised that they had fled and the antique shop was shut.The fraudsters have vast network of agents all over the country who entice gullible investors with big bucks promises and get hefty commission on the fees deposited, said the complainant.An FIR has been registered under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The complainant has provided the details and other relevant documents related to the money transaction. The case is under investigation, said a senior police officer.I was told that the radioactive range of the bowl is measured by the distance from which it can pull rice grainsComplainant"
5aead7159855b73f522c3e30,India's Farmers Need a New Deal beyond Cliched MSP Politics,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-farmers-need-a-new-deal-beyond-cliched-msp-politics/story-fpGg1pb90g1IKOkWBTUN3O.html,2018-02-15,"Finance minister Arun Jaitleys grand budget announcement of Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) providing assured 50% return to farmers may not actually mean a 50% return. The government admitted on February 9 that it had the so-called A2+FL (a measure of variable costs) and not C2 (which also includes fixed costs) costs in mind while calculating return mark-ups vis--vis MSPs. An earlier HT story had pointed this on February 7.Now that the buzz around budget seems to have settled, a deeper question can be asked. How much of a role can MSPs, and promises of increasing them, play in addressing the growing viability crisis of agriculture in todays age? Beginning with some stylised facts may help.Less than one-fourth of Indias total cereal production is procured at MSP. The share of procurement is slightly higher, a little less than one-third, for wheat and rice (Chart 1). Of late horticultural production has surpassed food grain production in India. There is no MSP coverage for fruits and vegetables.Even the limited procurement which happens is extremely skewed. More than half of total rice and wheat procurement is done from the traditional green revolution states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (Chart 2).A National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report for 2012-13 shows that less than half of all farmers were even aware about MSPs. The figures vary across crops. Only a fraction of those who are aware about MSPs actually sell their crops to procurement agencies. Such sale is able to dispose off only a fraction of their total production (See Chart 3).These statistics provide a context to the twin challenges of putting into place a holistic and remunerative MSP policy. If MSPs have to be really remunerative, they need a significant hike compared to present levels. An even bigger problem is the skewed crop-wise and state-wise coverage under the procurement net. If this has to be increased significantly, it would require a massive scaling up of governments procurement operations. This is not just a question of money. Storage of procured food grains is a big problem even at current procurement levels.The only effective way to dispose procured grains is through public distribution system (PDS). This avenue would come under squeeze as cash transfers replace distribution of food in the PDS.Both the present and past government has been pushing for abolition of in-kind food security programmes. Politicians, who wax eloquent about the benefits of doing away with in-kind PDS hardly talk about the effect it would have on procurement operations. Wider MSP coverage and cash transfers in food security programmes cannot go hand in hand in India.The problem does not end here. It is a fact that more and more Indians are getting out of abject poverty. They are also becoming more and more mobile in search of jobs. The middle classes do not need the PDS to buy food grains and other essentials anymore. Scarcity of such things is not something post-reform India would even relate to. Growth in agricultural production is the biggest reason for this.Both these developments reduce the possibilities of a healthy growth in number of people using the old arrangement of ration shops to access subsidised grains. This means even without cash transfers, the ability of MSP- type policies to support farm incomes will shrink in days to come.All this is not to say MSP-based PDS is not needed anymore. Starvation deaths have been reported because people could not get their ration due to Aadhaar-related problems. The absolute number of very poor people is still very high. MSP-based procurement is an important anchor of agricultural prices in India. It also protects countrys food security. Many farmers could switch from food crops to commercial crops if there were no procurement.What all this does suggest is the fact that agricultural policy making has got itself into a cul-de-sac. The tested method of incentivising agricultural production  MSP-based procurement  is reaching its limits. Uncertainty in farm incomes is only increasing with growing weight of perishables in total agricultural production. Challenges such as climate change related adverse effects on farm production would be here much sooner. Farmers are feeling the pinch of all this, but they have no agency. Farmer politicians do not hold much clout in Indias game of thrones.Those who do not earn their living from farming are not bothered for the moment. Indias urban middle class probably never had it so good when it comes to consumption of food products. A large variety of food items are being delivered to their doorsteps at discounted rates. The more farmers incomes are squeezed, the cheaper they get these things. Although much smaller in number than farmers, this class exercises a disproportionate sway in opinion building.The political class has by and large chickened out from handling this fundamental political economy divide. Its happy to placate one class at a time. Lower inflation for large part of the term, followed by a tactical MSP hike towards the end.The consequences can be disastrous in the not-too-distant future. A deep rooted crisis in farming can end the supply glut largely taken for granted. Signs of growing social unrest are already visible. Any new deal to farmers would require resolution of this contradiction rather than fraudulent promises of MSP hikes."

He said UP was a rich state with poor people because of the lack of vision for development and hoped the state would achieve heights of development under the leadership of its chief minister, Yogi Adtyanath.Gadkari said his ministry was ready to help UP in all possible ways, provided land was made available for the road projects. You provide us land and we will not let you down, he said pointing to minister for industrial development, Satish Mahana on the dais.The minister said Lucknow-Kanpur travel time would be reduced to just 40 minutes on the completion of the expressway connecting the two cities. Work on the proposed expressway, he said, would begin with bhoomi poojan in April. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would inaugurate the Delhi-Meerut expressway next month.However, Gadkaris emphasis was more on the development of waterways which, he claimed, could be a game-changer for UP. The ongoing Rs 54,000-crore Varanasi-Haldia waterways project will transform UPs economy, he claimed.He said the under-construction multi-modal terminal at Varanasi would emerge as a major logistics gateway connecting north India to eastern and north-eastern states.By the 2019 Kumbh, people will be able to travel between Varanasi-and Allahabad by the Ganga waterway, he said, adding that a new law would be made within the next three months to facilitate the plying of sea planes in the country.Gadkari said this sector had immense potential in UP and called on the state government to work on the promotion of second generation ethanol (made from bagasse, rice straw etc) and use of the same as a cheaper fuel for vehicles. With 125 sugar factories, UP has a lot of potential of producing ethanol fuel, he said, adding This will create a lot of employment as well in rural areas.He said the ambitious Ken-Betwa river interlinking project will project UP in a big way by irrigating 4.50 lakh hectare land in Bundelkhand region. The minister said Rs 28,000 crore would be spent on the project in UP alone.Earlier, potential investors gave presentations on the possibilities of development in UP. Minister of industrial development Satish Mahana assured entrepreneurs of all government help, if they invested in the state. With long-term planning, we will make UP as one of the most preferred states, he said.Gadkari said 4,000-km new roads will be made in UP under the Bharatmala project, the Centres flagship scheme for highway construction. He said detailed projects reports (DPRs) for Rs 900 crore had also been cleared."
5b177fa89855b75db2e79d76,Foodgrain production may touch record 277 mn tonnes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foodgrain-production-may-touch-record-277-mn-tonnes/articleshow/63104177.cms,2018-02-28,"New Delhi: India's overall foodgrain production may touch a record of 277.49 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) with output of pulses and rice reporting a new high. The agriculture ministry released its latest estimates on Tuesday, just when the government has been exploring various options of procuring more and more foodgrains from farmers in the year of plenty.Option of extending the government's guarantee to banks and lending agencies to ensure that state agencies do not face fund crunch for procurement is likely to come up before the Union Cabinet for approval on Wednesday.The move will help states go for procurement of pulses, oilseeds and cotton under the Price Support Scheme ( PSS ) through central nodal agencies and the other crops by state agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) without worrying about paucity of funds.The basic objectives of PSS are to provide remunerative prices to the growers with a view to encourage higher investment and production and safeguard interests of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices.Though the year is expected to report decline in production of wheat and oilseeds as compared to previous year (2016-17), the latest estimates gave a new hope amid reports of good sowing of winter crops ( Rabi ), except wheat, in December-January.The fall in wheat production can be attributed to farmers' decision to shift to pulses with the hope of better MSP. Farmers in Rajasthan, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh shifted to pulses during the Rabi season.The agriculture ministry, while releasing the second advance estimates of foodgrain production, attributed the record output in 2017-18 to ""near normal rainfall during 2017 monsoon and various policy initiatives taken by the government"".The ministry said that the assessment of production of different crops was ""based on the feedback received from states"". It claimed that the assessment was also ""validated with information available from other sources"".The ministry releases four advance estimates, before the final one which gives exact details of foodgrain output. The second estimates, released after completion of the Rabi sowing operations across the country, show that the production of wheat is likely to drop by 1.42% to estimated 97.11 MT. It is lower by 1.40 MT as compared to record wheat production of 98.51 MT achieved during 2016-17."

We have plugged the leakage of subsidised wheat, rice and coarse grains to the tune of Rs 17,500 crore annually. Though there is no direct savings because new beneficiaries also get added, now we are providing the foodgrains to the real beneficiaries, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told TOI.According to government data, about 23.19 crore ration cards have been issued to people under the National Food Security Act ( NFSA ). While all the ration cards have been digitised, the progress of linking ration cards to Aadhaar numbers is about 82%. More bogus ration cards will be out of the system once we have 100% Aadhaar seeding, Paswan said.Data compiled by the food ministry show that nearly 50% of the deleted ration cards across the country came from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal . A large number of bogus ration cards were also deleted in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.NFSA is the worlds largest welfare scheme, which targets ensuring food security to more than 80 crore eligible beneficiaries."

How is being finance minister in the SAD-BJP coalition different from being one in the Congress government The difference between the Akali finance minister and the Congress finance minister is that the style of functioning of Capt Amarinder Singh is very different from Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Capt Singh likes to delegate his work, he trusts you completely and expects results. In Mr Badals case, he never delegated and he didnt expect results. He would take finance departments meetings personally and not invite the finance minister. In the present dispensation, I am expected to tie up everything, sew up everything and give a final presentation either to the CM or the cabinet. In that sense, its quite different.I think the last 10 years had been very reckless in so far as populism is concerned, in terms of good governance or administration. A lot of money was recklessly thrown on projects not in the larger interest of Punjab. For example, for the last 10 years they kept telling us that they had foodstock to cover all the losses. But one day before the counting of votes on March 10, 2017, the Punjab government signed an agreement with the Centre accepting all the losses and converting that account into a term loan. In one stroke of pen, we were saddled with $4.5 billion or Rs 31,000 crore. Similarly, electricity boards losses of about Rs 17,000 crore were converted to UDAY bonds. So about Rs 51,000 crore was loaded in within a few weeks.In the last financial year of the SAD government, they made memorials worth Rs 2,000 crore. But for the first time, there was a strike in the Panjab University for 20 days. Students were beaten up. PU was just asking for Rs 20 crore of additional government support. We have not paid the Sainik School at Kapurthala, which for continuous 17 years got the Presidents medal for sending most cadets to the NDA. The annual grant to the school was Rs 1 crore, which is peanuts. Baba Farid Health Sciences University vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur wanted Rs 50 crore to make it a world class university.Once they have been built, what do you do? Either you complete them or leave them. They are all half-constructed. So well have to complete them. But, why were these decisions taken?All revenue of Mandi Board accounts to the tune of about Rs 5,000 crore, PIDB about Rs 2,000 crore a year have been escrowed with the banks for five years. Before they left, they made sure that they emptied out everything and no sources of revenue were left for the next government. Its, as they call it in military, a scorched earth policy where the retreating forces destroy everything. But in this process, the Congress government has learnt a lesson, that howsoever reckless you are, you will be reduced to 15 seats, if you are not careful, if good governance is not there, and if corruption is there. The basic concern is rozi-roti and, what in Urdu they say, izzat ki roti.We were acutely aware of what was happening in Punjab. Whatever the Congress government has promised is basically with the view to kick-start the economy. Now in this cross-subsidisation of giving free power to farmers, the whole subsidy burden was loaded on to the industry of Punjab. They were getting power at Rs 7.60 a unit. If I can take you 50 years back: Why did Punjab progress? Punjab progressed because it had the Bhakra Dam. Because Punjab had access to cheap power, Punjab industrialised and developed.Industry was leaving Punjab in droves because of the power situation. So how do we retain them? We have to create a level-playing field. So when you talk about populism, I would respectfully disagree with you. It was not populism. It involves a subsidy of about Rs 1,500 crore. But I see benefits or multiplier effects if we can retain our industry. Because you dont just retain industry, you also retain jobs and taxes. So, this was a must.No, this is not the only way. There are two other things that need to be done. Farmers have to be weaned away from agriculture. If agriculture forms 20% of Punjabs GDP and 75% people are engaged in agriculture, that means 75% people are trying to earn Rs 20. They are not going to be rich or well-off. The idea is to give skill sets and job opportunities to farmers children so that they can get away and start doing other jobs. Second step is to give better crop prices and promote alternative crops. It has to be multi-pronged approach and debt has to be taken care of. Unless you do all three simultaneously, you will not have the desired effect.We have to remodel our economy from a foodgrainproducing economy into a more industrialised or a service-oriented one. That model has to be put in place in the next four years. If we dont do that, I foresee our resources will be severely affected in the post-GST situation when compensation stops after four years.The Green Revolution must move eastwards. Punjab should be relieved of this duty of growing foodgrains for the country. We have done this duty for 60 years, but in this process we have poisoned our soil, depleted our aquifers and water sources. Let Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, which form the natural food bowl of India, do that duty.We are saying instead of rice, we will be very interested in growing maize. As long as we get the MSP or a little bit of hand-holding, Punjab could become Denmark of India. Why should there not be MSP on milk, fruits, or vegetables? If you study the food policy of India, it is rooted in the 1960s and Green Revolution was the main thrust at the time.If you look at an average Indian, he is malnourished. So now, the Union government should change the food policy to nutrition policy. An average man should have the access to fruit, milk and vegetables, and Punjab could step in as the producer of milk, fruits and vegetables. And, this is how we can remodel and maize could be one of the options.Of course, maize would give as much income or cash as rice would. There would be no problem of stubble burning as well. It will take care of all that.I think that is the political line. The Punjab government is basically trying to assess the electricity requirement. At present, any transmission losses or any inefficiencies of the electricity board are actually all being billed to free power. This is only a pilot project. We are trying to tell farmers that every tubewell costs us, say Rs 48,000 per year. We have 1.4 million pumps. So we are saying, you take this Rs 48,000 which we anyway have to give. In case, you can save power of say Rs 18,000 out of Rs 48,000 that we pay you, then Rs 18,000 is yours. There is another angle to it. We want to save water as well. If farmers accept it, we are going to go further and if not, let it remain a pilot project.We had flagged this issue with the Union finance and agriculture ministers. Maybe the CM will again meet Union minister (Ram Vilas) Paswan and we again will say, Either you take over the entire procurement operation, or reimburse us our actuals  whichever is convenient for you. Pre-GST, we have been charging some cess from the FCI, but it has been subsumed now.Food procurement exercise is inherently a lossmaking exercise to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore per year for Punjab. The Punjab government has to pay Rs 3,200 crore every year to the Centre for next 20 years. Over that, Rs 1,800 crore is the annual loss for procurement of grains. Why should we suffer a burden of Rs 5,000 crore every year? Why should we be burdened with this huge amount when we are undertaking the procurement exercise for the Centre, we are poisoning our soil and exhausting our ground water?I think we are actually selling water not the foodgrains. Every kilogram of rice takes 5,000 litres of water and every kilogram of wheat takes 3,000 litres. To get a cash credit limit, we have to first deposit that loss with the Central government before they give us the limit. We had paid Rs 1,100 crore before the wheat season.I quite agree with this. We have not been able to increase our revenue share and industry in our economy. We are dependent on the Centre. That is why I said, we need to remodel our economy.There are two huge areas I see for Punjab. One is our excise policy. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have opted for corporation model. We are not trying to go for retail mode, but trying to have wholesale part of it so that we can track every bottle that comes to the state either from our own distilleries or from outside. There is a technology to help curb sale of illegal or nontaxed liquor. My own feeling is that distillers, wholesalers and retailers are the same people. This is the area where Punjab should increase revenue by 25% every year. This year, my target is to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and next year it could go up to Rs 2,000 crore.Second area where our revenue can be increased is mining. My feeling is if we can identify additional mines and if we can install technology to check illegal mining, this is an industry worth Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. We are now generating around Rs 150-200 crore from mining compared to around Rs 45 lakh during the Akali regime. Although we had auctioned around Rs 400 crores of sand mines, some people backed out and there was some controversy.Punjab should also be looking at non-tax revenue as it has the lowest non-tax revenue collection in India. The rates have not been revised for 20-30 years. We would ask all departments to review their non-tax revenue.We have flagged this issue with the RBI and even the Union finance minister that there has been some unethical lending to the farmers by commercial banks. This must be checked because in order to achieve their targets they indulge in such things where they know that this money can never be recovered. It is beyond our purview to bring these banks to kneel. We have made a big hue and cry. The reason why we started farm debt waiver first with cooperative banks was that we did not have data from commercial banks.We have already rolled out some of the bigger promises. There were two types of promises. Ones which did not entail any financial liability like electricity subsidy to industry, or farm debt waiver. So we have already rolled out all these. For smartphones we are in talks with many companies. There are some procedural and tax issues with those firms because it is a service and soon those would be resolved. I dont think smartphones will not be handed out as promised.Sometimes tokenism is also important. Mahatama Gandhi was not short of kurtas. He was a barrister from London. But he never wore kurtas because he realized that 70% of people in India at that time never wore a shirt. I think leaders should be role models. Even tokenism of doing away with red beacons on vehicles was a decision in the same direction.It is not only about PDS. They have not allowed use of ethanol made of foodgrains. They have banned it for rice and maize.At this moment, if I look at the total under the MSP regime what the farmers are being paid is about Rs 55,000 crore and the subsidy bill of power, which is the biggest subsidy, is around Rs 6,000 crore. It would add up to around 15% of the total compensation which is being paid to farmers. At this moment I feel that farmers are not able to take that 15%. That would be a huge blow.We will have to carry on with it till such time when we can have farms up and running. It is not possible at the moment. Basically, you have to prioritise, what needs to be done. In Punjab, human resource needs to be upgraded in a massive way.Manpreet Badal is not a first-time finance minister, he was the finance minister in the Akali government as well. Despite that he has not been able to generate resources and has been taking the shelter of empty coffers left by the SAD-BJP government. If he cannot implement the promises made in the election manifesto and cannot improve the financial condition of the state, it is better for him to give up the post. It is for the first time that the salaries of employees are being delayed. How will there be development in the state? At the same time, he has been making unrealistic promises of making Punjab revenue surplus in next four years.The Punjab finance minister has always been begging for financial support from the Union government when the state government has not even been able to distribute funds released by the Centre for various welfare schemes. One of the best examples is the post-matric scholarship for the Scheduled Caste students where around Rs 115 crore sent by the Centre has not been released by the state. Finance department sher-oshayari se nahi chalta. Jab Raja hi mast ho jayega to wazir se kya umeed ki ja sakti hai? Salaries are not being paid on time to employees, pensions are not being distributed for months, and farm debt waiver has not been properly implemented. What to talk about distribution of smartphones to youth as promised in the election manifesto?It seems to be a totally confused government. The Congress govt totally miscalculated Rs 15,000 crore revenue in its first budget. The finance dept doesnt seem to be in the loop of the decisions being taken by other departments. I had asked them during the last budget session where they would generate Rs 10,000 crore revenue from when they do not have any concrete roadmap. The state cannot borrow more than 3% of the GSDP. The Congress government has not been able to even implement announcements made in the last years budget. They have not even cleared the DA and arrears to employees till date and salaries are being delayed every month."

Ashok Rao, general secretary of the institute asked by the government in 2015 to conduct the survey, said the failure to address classroom hunger was affecting the quality of education. The report was submitted to the HRD ministry over a year ago but no action has been taken yet.The survey conducted in 70 schools found that for a large number of children, the midday meal is the first and main meal of the day. The data showed that 83 per cent children in primary classes and 56 per cent in upper primary classes had come to school on an empty stomach.""Their parents send them like that because they have no food at home. Since the children are on an empty stomach, they fail to focus on classroom transactions. After eating the meal, they feel sleepy and fail to focus on studies,"" Rao said.The NGO experimented by splitting the meal into light snacks, such as roasted rice or roasted chana, as soon as the students arrived and another light meal around 10.30am. ""We showed that the split is possible without spending extra money,"" Rao said.The HRD ministry spends Rs 4.13 per meal at the primary level and Rs 5.88 at the upper primary level, excluding the cost of rice or wheat.According to the SSMI study, about 25 grams of snacks costing between Re 1 and Rs 2 can be prepared in 10 to 15 minutes and served.The purpose is to break the cycle of hunger, Rao said. The study also found that about 57 per cent children had mouth ulcer, indicating Vitamin B deficiency.The study criticised the practise of supplying of food materials like rice and wheat under the public distribution system centrally instead of local procurement.Sources said HRD minister Prakash Javadekar had recently asked the department of school education to work out if breakfast could be served without diluting the midday meal. But after it was estimated that Rs 7,000 crore would be needed, no further action was taken."

Several districts which were earlier neglected by businesspersons are seeing an inflow of investment due to assurance on the power front. It has also markedly changed the lifestyle of residents, with thousands of people purchasing air-conditioners.A recent study by discoms showed a rise in domestic and industrial power consumption as several industrialists are setting up small and medium units in rural areas. This is particularly visible in most backward districts such as Adilabad, Asifabad, Mahabubabad, Mahbubnagar and Kothagudem, where the land prices are cheap. Availability of cheap labour is an added attraction that is pulling in fresh investments.Sources in the industries department said that they are overwhelmed with the response from industrialists for setting up new units in most backward districts. We received more than 4,000 new enquiries for fresh investments in rural Telangana , which is unprecedented, said sources.Self-employment units also coming up in the villages with the availability of power. Youth who have some technical skill and a diploma are looking to open their own ventures in the villages. Rice mills, granite polishing, pumps and motors repair, floor mills, welding units and service centres are coming up with the introduction of 24-hour power supply, said a senior official of energy department.Across the country, only Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana supply 24-hour power to rural areas. Rural households in nine out of 28 states  Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Mizoram, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh  receive less than 18 hours of power a day.Till recently, urban areas, particularly cities such as Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad and Khammam were attracting new industries due to availability of power and other infrastructure. But as the expenditure of setting up business increased in the urban areas, industrialists have started looking at backward districts."

5b2e59c69855b72640115a1d,Spicing up sweet chocolate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/664106/spicing-up-sweet-chocolate.html,2018-03-11,"The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Limited (Campco), which is well known for bailing arecanut and cocoa farmers out of distress during the price fall many years ago, is embarking on an extensive diversification-cum-expansion drive.The multi-state cooperative society between Karnataka and Kerala is all set to shake up the cashewnut and coconut markets, as part of its expansion programme.Campco was started in 1973 by its founder president Varanasi Subraya Bhat, when there was a sudden marketing crisis in arecanut.Foray into chocolatesCampco set up a chocolate factory for creating market for cocoa, when farmers were in distress in the early 1980s, with help from the Karnataka government and the Centre. The then President of India Giani Zail Singh inaugurated the facility on September 1, 1986.In fact, Campco's chocolate factory at Puttur is South India's only such facility, and the country's second in the cooperative sector. The other chocolate factory belonging to Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited) is in Gujarat.Right from 10 products (chocolate varieties) in 1986, to 23 varieties (including one drinking chocolate) today, Campco has come a long way. In fact, until 1997, all the chocolates available under the Nestle brand were supplied by Campco. Though Nestle opened its firm in 1997 in Goa, Campco continues to supply chocolates (approximately 5,000 tonnes per annum) to the MNC even to this day, says Campco Managing Director MSuresh Bhandary.New flavoursThough the products of Campco were highly affordable with a unique taste, they were not available at malls and high-end stores until two months ago. However, the recent launch of six varieties of premium chocolate (without vegetable fat) are available in many parts of India, including Karnataka, Kerala, Hyderabad, Ghaziabad, Jaipur, Punjab and Kolkata.The newly launched premium chocolates are:Moments - dark chocolate with ginger; Dietier - sugar-free dark chocolate; Milk Marvel - soft and silky milk chocolate; Milk n Milk - with chocolate with rice crispies; Fun Tan - dark chocolate with hint of mint; and Fun Tan - dark chocolate which is slightly bitter.Though each bar costs Rs 100, the gift box (with six pieces) is available for Rs 500, which are available at airports as well as malls, among other places.Besides retail sales, Campco also supplies bulk chocolates to industries, weighing up to 1 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg slabs. ""The industrial supply accounts for about 6,000 tonnes per annum,"" says Bhandary, adding that even Amul buys chocolate butter from Campco.A lesser known fact about Campco is that it supplies chocolates to the Indian Navy at the latter's Mumbai, as well as Visakhapatnam bases. ""They have purchased 23 tonnes of chocolate in the last four months,"" he says.Plans are also on the anvil to market Campco chocolates to the Armed Forces (including the Air Force and Army) and the Indian Railways, and the same is under process, says Bhandary.Currently, the capacity utilisation of the factory is more than 70%. The Campco chocolate factory at Puttur, about 60 kms from Mangaluru in Dakshina Kannada district, has the capacity to produce 23,000 tonnes per annum.Campco's share in retail chocolate market is 7% and it plans to increase the same to 12-15% in the next three years. Mondelez (earlier Cadbury) holds a majority 70% share, followed by Nestle with an estimated 15-16% share, according to Bhandary.Campco stands in the second position as far as industrial chocolates are concerned, with a production of 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes per annum.Out of 20,000 tonnes of cocoa requirement in India, up to 13,000 tonnes is procured from farmers, while the remaining 7,000 tonnes is imported from Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana, among other countries. Out of 13,000 tonnes, about 3,600 tonnes is handled by Campco, while the remaining quantity by other handlers, Bhandary informs.He says that Campco is carrying out extensive R&D to develop more varieties of chocolate with natural ingredients.Capacity expansionEarlier this year, Campco commissioned a new amenity building at its chocolate factory in Puttur that conforms to the international food safety standards and zoning of processing area as per FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) standards, Campco President S R Satishchandra says.Built at a cost of Rs 13 crore, the building is spread over 42,000 sq feet.It has also laid the foundation stone for a master godown for arecanut, pepper and rubber at Kavu in Puttur taluk of the district. To be built at a cost of Rs 19 crore, the godown will have a built-up area of 1 lakh sq feet, and will be completed in 24 months, Satishchandra adds.It is worth mentioning here that 40% of Campco's 1,07,000 members cultivate cocoa along with arecanut in Karnataka as well as Kerala. At the same time, scientists from the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) fromVittal as well as Kasargod educate the growers on cultivation and pruning, besides providing technical guidance.The cooperative had purchased 53,720 metric tonnes of arecanut valued at Rs 1,308 crore, including 23,946 metric tonnes of red variety, valued at Rs 624 crore, and 29,774 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 684 crore, and sold 53,806 MT, valued at Rs 1,362 crore, including 24,890 MTof red variety, valued at Rs 656 crore, and 28,915 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 705 crore.Foray into new areasHitherto, Campco, with a record turnover of Rs 1,600 crore in the financial year 2017, and with a net profit of Rs 26.22 crore, was procuring directly from farmers and selling arecanut, cocoa, pepper and rubber in the states of Karnataka and Kerala.This year the cooperative is all set to enter the FMCG segment by foraying into marketing of coconut oil and cashew nuts that have good demand in the market.""Campco, during its last general body meeting, had proposed amendments to its bylaw, to market cashew, coconut products and FMCG segment, and it would be soon approved from the Central registrar,"" Bhandary says, and added that once it gets approval from the authorities concerned, it would foray into marketing of coconut oil and cashew products.""Plans are on the anvil to develop the brand, and a processing unit may be started within 12 to 15 months,""he hopes.As far as pepper is concerned, half kg packs of pepper under 'Kaala Sona' brand are already produced at Campco's Baikampady unit since the last six months.DH News Service"

Rohit Gupta, MD of Sarveshwar Foods, believes that while a company from J&K will enter the listed space after two decades, the development has already set the ball rolling for others from the State to initiate the process of listing.There are good entrepreneurs in the State, but they have little awareness about the stock market, said Mr. Gupta. But since we completed our IPO successfully, they are now asking us what is the process for listing and its benefits, he added.Uday Patil, director investment banking, Keynote Corporate Services, which is one of the merchant bankers for the issue, said: An IPO of a company from Jammu & Kashmir opens up opportunities for many other established companies from the State to explore opportunities to raise equity and get into the listed space, he said.The company, which once supplied basmati rice to the royal family of J&K, was started in 1890 and since then has diversified into nearly 40 products.The listing of a company from Jammu & Kashmir is an important milestone for NSE Emerge platform... the focus is to create value for companies, which is also the reason that over 50% of our listed SMEs are from manufacturing sector, with services sector too having sizeable representation, said Varanasi, Chief Business Development Officer, NSE."

Plates are arranged and food from a makeshift kitchen is brought here. It is then that Azhar Maqsoosi, the man behind the Hunger Has No Religion campaign begins to serve food to them as if they were his own.On Saturday, the campaign entered 2,163rd day. Sitting in his modest one-room shop, the pensive 38 year old recounts the genesis of the campaign.My father passed away when I was four years old. My mother raised me and my five siblings with much difficulty and there were days when we went hungry. Soon I realised what hunger was and thats when I decided to fight it, he says.While the campaign had its humble beginning in the city, Mr. Maqsoosi says it has now spread to other States such as Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and now, Assam. His Facebook page keeps his followers informed of the daily developments.Speaking in the straightforward Dakhni idiom, Mr. Maqsoosi says the campaign was built on goodwill. The support of volunteers and collaboration from other organisations has taken it forward. The dastarkhwaan at Dabeerpura and at Gandhi Hospital  which has entered the 896th day  is a daily affair. In Assam, it is weekly which is in its 30th week now. We have also partnered with an NGO in Bengaluru which is seeing its 505th day near Siddipura police station, he says. Dastarkhwaan in Urdu means a table cloth or great spread  apt for Maqsoosis generosity. The typical meal is a simple fare of plain rice and Hyderabadi khatti daal . Sometimes, theres zeera rice and occasionally bottle gourd gets added to the daal , just enough to satiate a persons hunger. About 60 kilos of rice goes into feeding the hungry souls every day.Mr. Maqsoosis work has attracted even the attention of Bollywood star Salman Khan. Last month, he was invited for an interaction with the actor. The Being Human Clothing representatives informed me that I have been nominated to meet the actor. When I met Salman Khan, I told him how my wife and I began serving home-cooked food to the homeless in 2012 and today we serve food to around 300 people in Hyderabad alone. He appreciated our work, he says.Fund-raising has not been a problem for Mr. Maqsoosi except in the initial days. When people realised his genuine work, kindred spirits flocked to help.My friends on social media have helped me a lot. They have always come forward for the cause. Its only about the cause and nothing else. They understand that irrespective of faith, hunger is real. No person should sleep on an empty stomach, he says."

If it was the BJPs programme, why it is not being implemented in BJP ruled states  Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, he sought to know.Addressing the Janashirvada rally here on Wednesday, he said the Manmohan Singh-led government at the Centre brought in the Food Security Act. We have been providing 7 kg of rice to four crore people of the State. No other State has a scheme of this magnitude, he said.Accusing the BJP of being anti-poor and anti-minority, Mr. Siddaramaiah said nobody could do politics on communal issues for long. The BJP tries to divide people by raking up issues like Bababudangiri-Datta Peetha. They do politics over the dead, he accused.The CM said his government had proposed a Karnataka-model of development and it had fulfilled promises it made during the elections. We had given 165 assurances and of them, 158 have been fulfilled. We have practised what we preached, he added."

The rectangular board atop the entrance has ""Salehjee Musafirkhana"" written in three different languages - English, Bengali and Urdu - one out of compulsion, one for necessity and the last for the sake of tradition.The literal translation of musafirkhana would be travellers' lodge, guesthouse, hostelry, inn... And yet it is not. It is not just about the checking in and the checking out. It is not just a stopover; it is a hyphen connecting journeys. Musafirkhana is redolent with the joy of diverse and disparate peregrinations.The three-storey building has pillars with a dark grey chevron pattern resembling a regular heartbeat. The floors are red oxide, smooth and cool to touch. The louvered sunshades, only half covering the balcony on each floor, are wood in faded turquoise. The railings, couplets in iron, flirt with the sunlight, their effect khwabeeda or dreamy. Breaking all subdued tones are bursts of red and yellow on the clothesline on the topmost floor.It is 5 in the evening. The doors of the common room on the first floor are a soothing bottle green and ajar, not unlike the people inside. These men must have just arrived from some place, dead tired. Their luggage lies hither thither, much like themselves, splayed on mats in deep slumber. The soft evening light streams in through arched stained glass windows - green, red and yellow - missing a pane or two in places.The musafirkhana was established in 1889 by Ebrahim Sulaiman Salehjee and Musaji Ahmed Salehjee of the Sunni Bohra community who had come to Calcutta from Surat's Kathor village. Musaji's great-grandson Mohammed Ibrahim Ameen Salehjee, the present secretary of the place, tells The Telegraph, ""We were billionaires at that time and had shifted here seeking to expand the business. But my great-grandfather wanted to create something people would remember him by. That is why he built this place."" He adds, ""In those days, there were no other hotels or lodges not only in this area but in all of Calcutta.""Salehjee shows an old photograph of the place, from 1947. He says, ""This picture was taken during the Bengal riots. Many Muslims from all over the city took refuge here.""For the first 100 years, the musafirkhana would not charge even one paisa from anyone. Thereafter, a nominal fee was levied.The place has 70-plus rooms and can accommodate as many as 1,500 guests. But even that is not enough during Haj season. Says Salehjee, ""Despite the government arranging accommodation for the pilgrims, those from the poorer sections prefer staying here. In fact, there have been times when we have had to put up a tent on the terrace to provide lodging. We don't refuse Haj pilgrims and during the season, we do not allow anybody else to stay.""Abdul Salam from Bareilly is here on a business trip. He is staying on the first floor, which is where all the single men check in. In the room adjoining his are four people, all from different parts of Uttar Pradesh. One of them, Khurshid Alam, tells us, "" Yahaan pe sab log apne jaise lagte hain. Hotel mein jaayenge toh ek hi room mein akele rehna padega. Yahaan par naye logo se milna ho jaata hai, baat cheet ho jaati hai."" He is basically recommending the familial ambience of the musafirkhana, the wealth of interactions that cannot be accrued from a sanitised stay in some hotel room.Some renovation work is going on on the second floor. Apart from the common room, most of it is empty. On the staircase leading to the floor above, there is a board that reads: Gair mard ko upar jana mana hai. It is the only floor that has family rooms. The notice written in English is not as nuanced: Do not go upstairs. This is the liveliest and most colourful floor of all. Children run about playing catch-catch as their mothers comb their hair, put out clothes to dry, all the while exchanging pleasantries, swapping tales. A family of seven from Malda busily tucks into a meal of rice and dal. The little ones eat puffed rice heaped on a newspaper spread on the floor. They are here to get their visas for Bangladesh. And then, like all those others before them and those many that will come after, they too will take their leave.Not for nothing did the poet write - Hava par hai ye buniyad-e-musafir khana-e-hasti. Na thehra hai koi yahaan aye dil-e-mahzun na thehrega..."

A narrative of north versus south, them versus us, Centre versus states with splices of rationality riveted with rhetoric has come to occupy centre stage.Context crafts the contours of dissent, discord and discourse. The immediate provocation is the change in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, set up to design devolution of funds to states. Population is and has been a determinant of allocation. Hitherto, Finance Commissions used the 1971 data. The 15th FC will use 2011 data. States with lower population assert that they will be shortchanged.On Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan used Facebook and Twitter, no less, to state: Presently, Kerala receives only a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee of tax it contributes to the Union, Tamil Nadus benefit is a mere 40 and Karnataka gets only 47 paisa. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh receives `1.79 for every rupee they contribute. The new move will further aggravate this disparity.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, tagging the CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Puducherry, tweeted: This will further affect the interests of the south: we need to resist. DMK leader M K Stalin charged the Centre with unilateralism and wrote to 10 CMs, including those of the south, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, already in a face-off with the Centre, called out, There is nothing called Centres or States money. It is the taxpayers money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre, but they are diverting the money to the development of the north.Assertions aside, the actuality is that states with smaller populations and lower rates of growth in population could be affected. It is also true that use of data from 1971, when India had 54 crore people, in 2018, when the population is 131 crore, is irrational. Besides, population is only one of the factorsothers, including progress in moving towards a replacement rate of population growth, will deliver compensatory dividends.Political narratives are rarely linear. The southern states have delivered better outcomes and the anger is about the incentive structures and the lack of disincentives. The articulation and the underlying angst is less about who is getting more and more about how states that do less get more.In 1960, the government of India identified the 100 most backward districts. Over 80 of them were from the Hindi heartlandBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Four decades later, a study on the 100 worst districts by this author found that laggards continued to lag. After much was said and done, little had changed. In 2001, a study by N J Kurian found that not a single district from Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh figured among the top 100 districts of India.It is true that the Constitution obliges governments to deliver a minimum level of public goods and services. Ergo population matters. But so does governance. Poor governance is best illustrated by the level of vacancies in the fields of education, health care and security. The largest numbers of teacher vacancies are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The largest number of vacant posts for police personnel is in Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar, the hospital bed to population ratio is one bed per 8,681 persons. Bihar has 40,043 registered allopathic doctors for over 10 crore persons, Uttar Pradesh has 65,343 for over 20 crore people.Governance requires interventions, and some of the most transformative interventions have been in the south. It is, therefore, shocking to find Control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures among the terms of reference of the 15th FC. Fact is what is populist today most often than not becomes policy sooner or later.When M G Ramachandran introduced midday meals in Tamil Nadu in 1982, it was considered populist. It became policy in 1995. The 1983 two-rupee rice scheme of N T Rama Rao led to the National Food Security Act. The 1960s EGS was born south of the Vindhyas in Maharashtra, and became MGNREGS. Amma canteens are now sprouting in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as are fair price medicine shops.The schism is not necessarily geographicit is about performers and non-performe0rs. On October 29, 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the 14th Finance Commission and urged a paradigm shift in the approach. He argued that the Centre share 50 per cent of the divisible pool and that fiscal discipline, revenue collection and contribution to national growth be factored in for allocation. The argument is just as valid in 2018.Article 1 of the Constitution states, India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. This is us. That said, there is no mistaking the discontent bordering on alienation born out of a real and perceived sense of discrimination coloured by social, cultural, religious, political and economic interests. Perception is a high-octane volatile cocktail of facts, fancies, finger-pointing and frailties. Embedded therein are questions that demand dialogue, debate and a dtente of thoughts. To argue that much of it is political is to state the obvious. There is no politics without economics. shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

Millets are a naturally rich source of vitamins and micro-nutrients.Rajasthan is the top producer of coarse cereals in the country. Millets are mostly cultivated in low-fertile lands, mountainous terrain, tribal and rain-fed areas in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.Supply of cheap millets to poor households and through school midday meals will improve nutrition outcomes among the poor and also boost incomes of small farmers, the minister said.According to agriculture ministry data, the area under millets has been declining. Despite growing demand for millets from urban consumer because of their natural high content of vitamins, proteins, oils and minerals, in 2016-17, the area under millet cultivation declined to 14.72 million hectares, down 60% compared to the previous year. India produces, on an average, over 40 million tonnes of coarse cereals.The ministry is rolling out a programme called nutri-cereals under the National Food Security Mission to increase output of millets, such as jowar (sorghum), bajra (pearl millet) and ragi (finger millet) as well as indigenous indigenous little millets known as kutki, kodo, sawa, kangni and cheena. The government has declared 2018 as the National Year of Millets.Last July , Prime Minister Modi had called for inclusion of millets under the public distribution system. Following this, a meeting of the consultative committee on agriculture headed by NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand was held in October 2017. Based on the recommendations of NITI Aayog, the agriculture ministry has decided to create a sub-mission on nutri-cereals.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, millets are drought-tolerant and resistant to climate change. Cultivation of millets requires less water than rice and wheat, which makes them suitable for small growers."

(AFP)Chandigarh: An unusual spell of rain on Monday morning has cast a cloud on the wheat crop yet to be harvested in Punjab, forcing the agriculture department to sent teams across the state to assess the damage.The rains have come at a time Punjab has been grappling with a storage crisis.The state has a total storage capacity of approximately 153 lakh tonnes. But it can accommodate only 37 lakh tonnes of fresh stocks that are expected to be around 130 lakh tonnes.Of the total storage, 103-lakh-tonne capacity is with the Food Corporation of India, while the rest is with five state-run procurement agencies.From last year's harvest, 26 lakh tonnes of wheat and 90 lakh tonnes of rice are still lying in the warehouses.Although officially the procurement of the current stock of wheat started from April 1, sources said the bulk starts arriving by the second week of April - just when the rains have hit.The Punjab government has invited expressions of interest to arrange for cover and plinth space for wheat storage. It is also expecting the FCI to pick up the stocks lying in the warehouses by the time the fresh crop starts arriving.""If things work out as we have planned, we will manage to store between 110 and 120 lakh tonnes but anything over that would be a problem for us,"" said Anindita Mitra, director of the department of food supplies.According to the meteorological department, western disturbances caused the unseasonal rainfall in Punjab as well as Haryana.Amritsar, Pathankot, Anandpur Sahib, Nangal, Faridkot, Talwandi Sabo, Adampur, Sangrur, Kapurthala, Muktsar and Kharar in Punjab received the rainfall.""An upper air cyclonic circulation over North Pakistan caused this rainfall. There is another similar cloud formation over Haryana adjoining western Uttar Pradesh which could bring more rainfall to the area over the next few days,"" said a senior official in the Meteorological department in Chandigarh.While the drop in the temperature brought smiles in the urban areas, the farmers and the agriculture department have reasons to complain.""The damage would not be restricted to the standing crops but also the yield that is yet to be taken to the grain silos as there would be an increase in the moisture level in the crops. How the weather remains for the next couple of days will be extremely crucial,"" said Arvinder Singh, chief agriculture officer, Patiala.The Met department has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall on Tuesday.Sources in the agriculture department said they were expecting damage to 10 per cent of the wheat crop, if the inclement weather continued.""The standing crops have been flattened in most of the areas because of the strong winds that were raging since Sunday night. The minimum damage to the standing crop would be around 10 per cent. We are awaiting reports from the field,"" said Naresh Gulati, a senior officer in the agriculture department."

Considered the biggest open-air eatery in the world where devotees jostle for Mahaprasad every day, the place, however, appeared lifeless on the day.The stalls that sell Mahaprasad and dry prasad were found covered with polythene sheets, while some priests could be seen persuading devotees for dakhina citing that donations on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya can bring them good fortune.Baisi Pahacha, the 22 steps which connect the Lions Gate of the temple to the main premises, was however crowded for sometime as devotees struggled to get khichidi that was being served by a group of servitors.For the last three days, Mahaprasad has not been prepared after a rift between Suar Mahasuar Nijog and the temple administration over unsold Abadha after delay in rituals of the Trinity - Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra on April 16.The body of cooks, which has the sole right of preparing Mahaprasad in the 12th century shrine, demanded a `50 lakh compensation as the unsold Abadha had to be buried as per the tradition.This is perhaps for the first time that devotees were denied Abadha on Akshaya Tritiya which is believed to be one of the most auspicious days in the Hindu calendar. The day also marks beginning of agriculture season and construction of chariots for Rath Yatra.I visit Jagannath temple at least once a month but never experienced such a situation. Whenever I visit the temple, I take plenty of Mahaprasad packed for my family members back home. For the first time, I am returning empty-handed. No one is above the Lord and the law. Whoever is responsible must be dealt with iron hands, said Bhubanananda Sahu, a resident of Patia in Bhubaneswar.Devotees from as far as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, who had come to witness the rituals, were left disheartened too.This is my first visit to Puri and I feel unlucky to have missed out on Abadha. I will stay back for one more day, said Sambhunath Jha, a devotee from Rajasthan. Earlier in 2015 and 2011, a cease work agitation by the cooks had deprived Mahaprasad to devotees. Around 600 cooks prepare Mahaprasad for about 10,000 pilgrims everyday and on special occasions, the number touches one lakh. Nearly 20 quintals of rice and 10 quintals of dal besides other vegetables are used to cook the Mahaprasad daily."

Earlier this year, a 13-year-old girl from Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh hanged herself after starving for more than two days  her father had passed away and her mother had found no work as a labourer. In the same week, a tribal youth in Kerala was beaten to death for stealing a kilo of rice from a grocery store. He had earlier resorted to begging and then to stealing; when caught, he was severely beaten and later succumbed to his injuries.More than 14.5% of our population is considered as undernourished, says the Global Hunger Index, 2017, with 21% children suffering from acute malnutrition, while 38.4% of children under the age of five suffer from stunting. This is reflected in the height of our children (children born in India are on average shorter than those in sub-Saharan Africa). More than 250 million Indians remain food insecure, ingesting less than 2,100 calories every day. As the Planning Commission put it in the Human Development Report, 2012: If India is not in a state of famine, it is quite clearly in a state of chronic hunger.Its not that policymakers dont recognise this. Along with the Right to Food Bill, the landmark PUCL vs Union of India case (2001) has seen more than 60 orders over the last decade  but this judicial activism has failed to translate into execution on the ground. This is owing to three key systemic factors. First, there is little institutional will to execute reforms that lead to better food delivery nationally, despite extensive legislation. Second, our food policy has focused on making cereals widely available even as the Food Corporation of Indias warehouses continue to leak away our agricultural surplus. Finally, the low social status of women has kept them ill-nourished. This, combined with open defecation has taken its toll on women and on children.This complex issue is not unsolvable  a variety of countries and states offer a template. South Africa, like India, has sought to explicitly guarantee a right to food, while Brazil has utilised its Fome Zero programme to provide three square meals to its people. This is backed by an institutional commitment, which has led to the consolidation of more than 31 food welfare programmes. Brazil has also allowed public prosecutors to take up the issue of hunger as a violation of human rights at the local level. Meanwhile, Uganda has sought to confer a legal responsibility for food security on the head of the household with penalties for malnutrition. It has combined this with urban centres which offer food for subsidised prices, and supplementary nutrition schemes have helped reduce hunger.States such as Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan have changed grain entitlements, while others such as Himachal Pradesh have sought to achieve universalisation of the PDS scheme. Chhattisgarh, in particular, has focused on better service monitoring while better commissions for fair price shop owners and price reductions have also helped increase PDS offtake while lowering incentives to cheat. India continues to store more than three million tonnes of grain in the open, exposed to rain and pests, with plastic sheets offering minimal protection. This is enough to feed a mid-sized European country.The challenge is one of getting more grains to the poor, while eliminating wastage and corruption along the way. Meanwhile, the leakages of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) can run up to 90% due to a range of factors, including poor quality wagons and inadequate security. Its stocking operations must be outsourced to the private sector, along with the adoption of a proactive liquidation policy. Breaking up FCI into its constituent parts should be evaluated, potentially decentralising procurement and encouraging local storage. With rising food inflation, its procurement policy should be increasingly skewed towards crops under the minimum support price policy, including pulses and oilseeds, even onions, and focused on food insecure states such as Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.There is a need to pursue a zero hunger programme with no stunted children below the age of two. This should be a multipronged strategy that focuses on improving agricultural productivity, empowers women through support for maternal and child care practices, and offers nutritional education and social protection programmes. Even as we offer such programmes for Vitamin A and iron, there are still significant gaps in implementation. Maharashtra has adopted a multi-disciplinary initiative, reducing child stunting by 15% between 2009 and 2014. The states nutrition mission has sought to develop better protocols for treating the acutely malnourished while ensuring better coordination between the nutrition and healthcare departments. India should adopt this mindset , battling against hunger over the next decade through long-term political commitment, along with policies encouraging food coupons, cash and in-kind transfers. Without such changes in execution, India will continue to remain hungry.Varun Gandhi is BJP national general secretary and a Lok Sabha MPThe views expressed are personal"

He will repeat the same drill on April 26 at Mehndipur village, where his host will be the dalit gram pradhan of the village.Several villagers, including many women, were seen at the chaupal where Adityanath interacted with villagers, most of whom were OBCs and Dalits, the group BJP is wooing ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The chief minister also gave away kits of Ujjawala Yojana, the scheme being run by ministry of petroleum and natural gas for providing LPG connections to women below poverty line, at the chaupal, obliged mothers by feeding kheer to a new born and said that his government would always be there for them. Village chaupals, dinner at Dalit houses and night halts in villages are part of BJPs gram swaraj campaign that was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14, Dr Ambedkars birth anniversary.He also spoke to the villagers about the Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the drinking water scheme being run by the government. Adityanath also directed the officials to hold camps to provide ration cards and gas connections within a week to all those who didnt have it. He also ordered officials to read out names of 136 beneficiaries figuring on the list of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.As soon as the chaupal commenced, the villagers unable to get their voice heard, broke the barrier and reached almost near the stage and started apprising Adityanath about their woes, largely pertaining to official apathy.The CM realizing the anguish of villagers called Pratapgarh district magistrate Shambhu Kumar along with chief development officer and district panchayat raj officer (DPRO) on stage and made them answer the complaints one by one. He questioned the DPRO as to why toilets were missing from houses and ordered for transferring money in account of beneficiers by tomorrow.He questioned DM as to why ration cards of villagers were not yet made and why panchayat level officials did not know the count of families residing in the village.Expressing annoyance Yogi Adityanath ordered holding of week-long special camps in every corner of the village and ensure enrolling of every genuine beneficiary residing in the village in different welfare schemes.He also warned that he would not leave the place on Tuesday morning after launching of School Chalo Abhiyaan without reviewing work of drinking water scheme in the village.Its a unique campaign to take the government to the doorstep of the villagers and address their concerns. It will help us create a New India that the PM has been talking of, an India that is strong and self reliant, UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey said.Adityanaths security had a tough time balancing between the chief ministers wish to allow access to villagers and ensuring that there was no security threat. Such village chaupals would continue. We would want to cover all the villages, interact with all of you, Adityanath was heard telling the villagers.Despite instructions from the chief ministers office to keep it simple, Dayaram Saroj, the Dalit lekhpal, made elaborate arrangements. Anticipating several people, Manju Devi, the lekhpals wife, started preparing for dinner from 4 pm even when Adityanaths chaupal hadnt even begun. The dinner comprised four types of vegetables, chapattis and rice with kheer for dessert. Adityanath praised the preparations before proceeding to upper secondary school campus for the night halt.Instructions have already been issued not to make any special arrangements like ACs for the chief minister, an aide of the chief minister said.Though the Gorakhnath temple of Gorakhpur of which Adityanath is the head priest annually organises samarasta bhoj or community feasts, this was only the second occasion since Adityanath dined with dalits after becoming the chief minister on March 19, the first being in June.That time the dinner at Dalit home had followed after caste violence in Saharanpur. This time it has come amid the likelihood of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party teaming up against the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Several Dalit MPs of the BJP too had raised questions on their partys handling of issues Dalits hold dear, including reservation for the Dalits.The chief minister is a monk. When he dines with Dalits, it helps convey the message about our intentions to build a casteless society, a local RSS leader said."

(Express Archive) Madhya Pradesh farmers contend Pusa Basmati-1 is superior when grown in their region as opposed to being cultivated in states such as Punjab, Haryana. (Express Archive)Even as the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry has rejected the claim of Madhya Pradesh to be included as a traditional basmati-growing area, rice millers in the state are challenging the order. Central to their argument is that the quality of rice, from an improved variety, Pusa Basmati-1, is superior when cultivated in MP, as opposed to Haryana, Punjab or West Uttar Pradesh (UP).MP accounts for 50 per cent of Indias area under Pusa Basmati-1 and 70 per cent of the export of this rice variety to the western world (US and Europe). That itself is proof of the quality of basmati being grown by farmers in MP. Since GI certification is meant primarily to protect the quality of a product, it is unfair to deny recognition to MP as a basmati-growing state, says Ashwani Arora, managing director & CEO of LT Foods Ltd.The MP government had demanded that 13 of its districts  Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna, Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur  be given the GI tag for basmati paddy, along with the areas of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Western UP in the Indo-Gangetic plain below the foothills of the Himalayas. The GI Registry under the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, however, rejected MPs contention in its order dated March 15.According to Arora, whose Rs 3,500-crore sales company sells basmati rice under the Daawat brand, the soil and environmental conditions in MP are best suited for growing the high-yielding Pusa Basmati-1 variety. The traditional tall basmati cultivars are suited for saline and alkaline soils of pH 7-9 found in states such as Haryana. But Pusa Basmati-1 is ideal for the neutral to acidic soils of MP with 6-8 pH.Also, the shallow to deep black soil in MP is better for moisture retention. And with the main growing areas (Raisen, Vidisha and Hoshangabad) getting twice the rainfall of Haryana and Punjab, the crop gets enough water without a flood-like situation. That, in turn, also makes it less prone to pest and disease attack, says a company official.The common pests in basmati include the brown and white plant hopper (sap-sucking insects that attack between mid-September and mid-October), while diseases are mainly the leaf and neck blast fungus that infest the nodes of the plants main stem (from where the grain-bearing earheads or panicles emerge).The stagnant water and high humidity during late-August is particularly conducive to the blast in Haryana. Farmers, therefore, are forced to spray fungicides like Tricyclazole and also insecticides such as Buprofezin and Picoxystrobin against plant hoppers. All this leads to pesticide residue issues, whereas you dont get these conditions in MPs well-drained soils, the official states.The other advantage that MP has is the less sharp drop in temperatures during the October-November period at the time of flowering and grain-filling. While traditional basmati paddy or even other high-yielding varieties such as Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 can tolerate these, Pusa Basmati-1 cannot. The latter when grown in MP, hence, yields better quality paddy with more grain length and less chalkiness due to more complete filling. That is precisely why Pusa Basmati-1 rice from MP has good consumer acceptance in the western world, adds the official.But whether this argument will cut ice with regard to GI certification remains to be seen. The GI Registry, in its order, held that MP did not satisfy the fundamental requirement of popular perception as a traditional basmati-growing area for being granted the coveted tag. Basmatis GI character was derived from its supposed uniqueness as a rice grown in a specific region. MP did not fall in this specific geography, namely the Indo-Gangetic plain situated below the foothills of the Himalayas.However, the fact that about 2 lakh hectares area is today under basmati cultivation in MP (of which 1.5-1.6 lakh hectares comprises Pusa Basmati-1), and the one million tonnes of paddy from this is worth Rs 2,600 crore, makes the GI issue fraught with complexity. What will these farmers do if they are denied the right to grow basmati? Can you force them to cultivate soyabean, which yields only one tonne per hectare (against 5 tonnes from Pusa Basmati-1) and fetches a marginally higher price (Rs 30,000/tonne versus Rs 26,000/tonne)? a rice miller in Mandideep near Bhopal asks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Chile has approved coconut fibre and walnut. South Korea and Malaysia too have agreed to buy Indian mangoes. Equador is the latest country to clear Indian rice.Read | IMD forecast of normal monsoon may temper economic, political risksAccording to a new farm export framework thats in the works, the government is looking to moderate its strategy of placing frequent restrictions on agri-exports to tame domestic consumer prices.The plan is to curb commodity exports only in extreme situations and to boost farm income from trade. The government has promised to double farm incomes by 2022.Agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh recently tweeted about increasing the value of agricultural exports to $100 billion by 2022-23. The Dalwai Committee Report on doubling farmers incomes also talks about freeing up farm exports.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. The countrys net exports (i.e. exports minus imports or the agricultural trade surplus) fell to $7.8 billion in 2016-17.Read | Why a normal monsoon is crucial for Indian economy, 2019 general electionIn 2016-17, marine products, meat and rice together made up 52% of Indias agri-export basket. India also exports spices, cotton, fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar, coffee, groundnut, oilmeals and cashews, which together with marine items, rice and meat comprised over 80% of the agri-export basket in 2016-17. According to farm economist Ashok Gulati, in farm exports, the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies which he says must be addressed.New export hubs for horticultural produce  fresh fruits and vegetables  are being opened in smaller cities as part of the strategy to provide direct global access to local farmers. Trial shipments were recently sent from Varanasi and Guwahati. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, in association with our ministry, has identified 70 districts as potential export hubs, agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said.Shipments to Dubai from Varanasi contained chilli from Uttar Pradesh. Pineapples were sent from Guwahati and oranges from Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Both Varanasi and Guwahati now have complete infrastructure for exports, including phytosanitary certification.In a boost for mango exports, the US has agreed to transfer requirements of pre-shipment inspection to Indian plant quarantine authorities starting in 2019. The US has also agreed to bear the cost of inspection of mango shipments by US personnel, which will bring down the cost of exports, an agriculture ministry official said."

We got water tankers at Fetri and water melons to avoid dehydration to animals, said Bhatkar.The convoy started on April 29 from Karnataka with four elephants from Shimoga and seven from Mysore. It took four days to reach Nagpur passing through Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. It will take another week to reach Dudhwa, says Koujalagi.As there is no shade in Gorewada, we took shelter under trees near Fetri. It is a tough exercise. We bagged the contract to shift the animals. So far, we have shifted 50 odd elephants to places in MP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, said Mohammed Rafi, the transporter.Our biggest problem is not feeding elephants or transporting them but food for around 30 men from Karnataka, who want rice and in Maharashtra and MP, roti-sabji is the staple diet, adds Rafi. Breakfast for all costs around Rs8,000, lunch and dinner even more.This is a classic example of interstate coordination. We have failed to shift elephants from Gadchiroli to Pench to create a permanent rescue unit but UP is transporting elephants all the way from Karnataka by spending lakhs of rupees, said local wildlife lovers."

They are ridiculing and insulting the Scheduled Castes,"" Savitri Bai Phoole told reporters in Bahraich, her constituency, on Friday.She seemed to also imply that these BJP leaders were practising untouchability. ""They hire caterers, rent utensils and deploy their own people to serve the meal. The Dalits are kept at bay,"" she said.Phoole added: ""The poor are insulted repeatedly by being reminded they are from the Scheduled Castes. I am an MP of this country but I am identified as a Scheduled Caste MP.""She suggested her party leaders should visit Dalit homes ""without prior information and eat whatever has been cooked in their kitchen, even if it is just roti and salt or rice and dal"".Her comments come at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked BJP politicians to spend time in Dalit localities and instil confidence in them about the BJP.Phoole called it a sham, highlighting the government's failure to punish people who have desecrated statues of Babasaheb Ambedkar and attacked Dalits.Asked about Phoole's allegations, state BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla avoided a direct reply.""The idea is to identify localities with substantial Scheduled Caste populations that are still awaiting development. All the leaders are supposed to spend nights in those localities and mix with the people,"" he said.""I suggest the Bahraich MP follow the (party) decision so that the poor can be empowered.""Phoole's comments back up claims by many Dalits that BJP leaders had ""picnicked"" outside their homes, eating food brought from hotels or cooked by caterers.Rajnish Kumar, a Dalit from Lohgarh in Aligarh district, has alleged that state minister Suresh Rana had arrived at his home with more than 100 people at 11pm on Monday and told him they wanted to dine in front of the house.""Everything was brought from a hotel. They ate matar-paneer, pulao, tandoori roti and gulab jamuns. They drank bottled water brought from outside,"" media reports quoted Kumar as saying.Kumar said he was asked to sit in a corner and have his share of the food.Rana, however, said it was Kumar who had requested him to eat at his home. ""Some of the food was cooked by the family and some of it was brought from outside,"" he told reporters.Phoole's fellow BJP parliamentarian, Udit Raj, had said on Thursday that the outreach programme would not bring the BJP any electoral gains but would make Dalits feel ""inferior"".""Pretending through night stay and eating food... neither empowers the Dalit families nor benefits the politicians,"" he said.""Rahul Gandhi (who started the trend a decade ago) is a live example.... It would be better if politicians come forward (to provide) food, clothes, houses, employment and treatment.""On Tuesday, Union minister Uma Bharti had skipped a scheduled meal with Dalits at an event in a Madhya Pradesh village, saying she was not Ram who would purify people by eating with them.She later apologised, claiming she had not known she was supposed to eat at the event and pleading she needed to rush to an urgent appointment elsewhere. She, however, invited the Dalits to a meal at her home in Delhi.It was Rahul who started the trend of politicians eating at Dalit homes about a decade ago. He also invited friends from India and abroad to spend nights in Dalit hamlets.In 2009, Rahul and British politician David Miliband had met self-help groups in Amethi and both had spent the night at Dalit homes, prompting BJP accusations of ""showcasing India's poverty to the world"".Sting in the taleAn Uttar Pradesh minister on Friday lauded BJP leaders for visiting Dalit homes and braving ""mosquito bites the whole night"", all for the sake of educating the community about government welfare schemes.""Ministers have to face mosquito bites the whole night, still they visit the villages and feel happy about it,"" PTI quoted basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal as saying.If a minister gets an opportunity to hold two chaupals (village meetings), he wants to organise four more, she added."

First, he tosses her in the air, then pulls her onto his lap and thereafter, rocks her back and forth. But she is not interested, shrugs off his overtures and runs away.""My daughter cannot recognise me anymore,"" says Kafeel Khan, the 38-year-old paediatrician from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, who is just back home after spending eight months in jail.Zabrina was barely eleven months old when Kafeel was arrested last September. She used to crawl then; now she can walk, climb and run. She could barely say ""Papa"" then, now she can string whole sentences. Says Kafeel, ""As a paediatrician, I always tell parents, never miss the milestone moments of your child. But I have missed all her milestones. I couldn't even celebrate her first birthday.""Kafeel, who was assistant professor at Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) in Gorakhpur, and eight others were held responsible for the deaths of at least 60 infants over a span of five days.It all started on August 10, 2017, when the agency, Pushpa Sales, stopped supplying oxygen to the government-run hospital because of non-payment of dues worth Rs 68 lakh. Apparently, the company had sent 14 reminders to the authorities, including BRDMC principal Rajiv Mishra, UP health minister Siddharth Nath Singh and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to clear dues, but nobody paid any heed.Dr Kafeel Khan with his family.Pictures: Sonia SarkarWhen the hospital ran out of its supply of liquid oxygen by 7.30pm, an alert was put out on the WhatsApp group of the doctors. Kafeel was on leave, but upon getting the message he rushed to the hospital.As he goes over that day's incidents with me at his three-storey house - with an armed guard stationed at the entrance - in UP's Basantpur, Kafeel claims he called the head of the department of paediatrics, Mahima Mittal, and Mishra, but nobody responded.He says he arranged cylinders from a local hospital and a local agency. ""There was no oxygen available in the hospital from 11.30pm to 1.30am. Every day, 12-13 children were dying of premature birth or because of Japanese encephalitis. But on August 10, 30 infants died. I cannot deny that the sudden stoppage of oxygen supply was one of the reasons for these deaths.""He picks up his phone to show me an image from that fateful night. Four living infants along with a dead one cramped into a single warmer at the hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit. He also shows me screenshots of the calls he made to the higher authorities and the cash memos for the oxygen cylinders he bought from local vendors.Along with his colleagues, Kafeel procured over 250 cylinders in 48 hours. The oxygen tank finally arrived on the night of August 12. By then, television channels were running his images and hailing him as the saviour. But on August 13, when Adityanath arrived to inspect the reason for the deaths, he blasted Kafeel.""He told me, 'You are Dr Kafeel? You bought cylinders? You think you are a hero? I will see...' He thought I had informed the media about the mess in the hospital. At that point, my life turned upside down,"" he recalls.And before he knew it, Kafeel had moved from being saviour to villain. Charges of corruption were levelled at him; it was alleged that he was running a private nursing home and diverting oxygen cylinders from the medical college to this nursing home. He lost his post of nodal officer under the National Health Mission at the 100-bed acute encephalitis syndrome ward at BRDMC. Well-wishers warned him that he could be killed in an encounter.Fearing for his life, he left for Delhi on August 17 and stayed at an undisclosed location for a fortnight. Since he was untraceable, the police allegedly harassed his family. Kafeel's daai, the elderly helper at his Basantpur home, tells in chaste Bhojpuri how the cops would often come around at night, banging on their door, when no male member was present in the house. When she refused to let them in, they barged in and ransacked the house.On September 1, Kafeel's elder brother, Adeel, was detained by the special task force (STF) in Lucknow. Realising that things could get worse, Adeel asked his brother to return. Says Kafeel, ""I surrendered before the STF in Lucknow on September 2.""Illustration: Suman ChoudhuryThe STF took him to a government guest-house in Sahjanwa, 251 kilometres from Lucknow, before handing him over to the police. He says, ""They threatened to slap on me charges under the National Security Act. It was Id al-Adha that day, but I was not even allowed to offer prayers.""Here, I ask him, if he was made a scapegoat because he is a Muslim; the ideological inclinations of the Adityanath regime are, after all, known to all. He pauses. His eyes, restless and sleep-deprived, are fixed on the floor for a few seconds. ""When Mohammed Akhlaque was killed for allegedly storing beef and Junaid Khan was killed by random men during an argument over a train seat, I condemned them on Facebook. But when it happened to me..."" He does not complete his sentence.After another pause, he says, ""Only Yogi ji will tell you if my Muslim identity was the only reason for punishing me. Yes, after a point, I thought I won't be able to get out for the next five years, as long as he [Adityanath] is there.""Kafeel's wife, Shabista, and mother, Nuzhat Parveen, met the chief minister to plead his case, but all that Adityanath apparently told them was - ""Justice will be done.""The family remained silent for many months, but on April 9, when Manish Bhandari, the owner of Pushpa Sales and one of the nine accused, got bail, they realised they needed to expedite Kafeel's case.On April 18, Kafeel wrote a 10-page letter, explaining his role and appealing for justice. He wrote, ""I surrendered to save my family from humiliation and misery, thinking, when I have not done anything wrong, I should get justice.""The family released the letter to the national media. A week later, Kafeel was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court, which ruled out charges of ""negligence"" against him. ""I still consider those 48 hours [from August 10 night to August 12] more harrowing than the eight months in jail. I am out now, my mother has got her child back, but those parents will never get their kids back,"" says Kafeel.Indeed. Some of the families I spoke with are still not convinced about Kafeel's innocence. Some hospital officials believe he did nothing to save lives. It is uncertain if Kafeel will ever be back in the hospital; his suspension order is yet to be revoked. He says, ""If they call me respectfully, I will go back. But I am not desperate to join them. I have suffered so much humiliation and misery.""He plans to open a hospital to treat children suffering from Japanese encephalitis. Gorakhpur badly needs one. Right now, BRDMC is the only one that caters to ailing infants from UP, Bihar and Nepal. Primary healthcare centres in Adityanath's constituency are tardy, hence the pressure on this hospital. ""My hospital would cater to the needy,"" promises Kafeel, fiddling with his goatee.In eight months, his beard had grown longer than usual, but now the goatee is back. He is dressed in a white shirt, a pair of black trousers and a chequered tie, perhaps attired for a television interview earlier in the day. He has lost around 10 kilos.In jail, he found solace in books. He read Ken Follett's The Pillars Of The Earth, S.J. Whitcomb's The World Never Ends and Robin Sharma's Who Will Cry When You Die. Says Kafeel, ""My biggest lesson from these was, I should never run away from a situation.""Our meeting is interrupted by visitors. As he shares his ordeal with them, I enter his mother's room. She is busy surfing news channels. All these months, she has been glued to the television, hoping to hear some news related to her son's case. But they never showed anything on him, she complains, except when he was arrested and released.Even Kafeel thought people had forgotten him. But on the day of his release, hundreds greeted him carrying banners saying ""Dr Kafeel is our hero"" and ""Congratulations"". ""I realised I am no longer tainted,"" he says.It's Shab-e-Barat, the night of forgiveness for Muslims. I urge him to take a family photo before he leaves to pray. He stands next to Shabista, who has been stirring biryani rice in the kitchen. He drags an unwilling Zabrina into the frame too. In a few seconds, however, the child leaves their side and rushes to feed a cow at the main door.Looking at her fondly feeding the bovine, I wonder, what Adityanath would have to say.ttevitae1979: Khan is born to an engineer father and a homemaker mother in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh1998: Completes school from the Mahatma Gandhi Inter College there2000-2012: Completes MBBS and MD from Manipal University, Karnataka2013: Returns to Gorakhpur and joins Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) as a senior resident for three years2016: In August, is appointed assistant professor in the department of paediatrics2017: Gets embroiled in the controversy that follows the BRDMC infant deaths.

JCP (Crime Branch) Alok Kumar identified the arrested accused as Virender Mohan Brar (56) and his son Nitin Mohan Brar (30).Police said they had recovered what the accused claimed were copper plates, anti-radiation suits, anti-radiation chemical stickers as well as a laptop, printer, foreign cheque books, fake ID cards and an Audi car from their possession.A few years ago, the complainant, Narender Saini, met Virender, who told him his company would sell the rice puller to NASA after building it. He said he needed seed money for this purpose, JCP Kumar said.Police said Virender told Saini that he would be paid Rs 10 crore as soon as tests for the equipment were successful. Saini entered into an MoU with Virender and paid Rs 87.2 lakh for anti-radiation suits, which the accused said would be worn by scientists during testing. They said tests were scheduled in Hapur, but could not be held as the place was not conducive. They also took him to an office in East of Kailash to convince him that he was not being conned, he said.The accused also roped in fake actors posing as DRDO officials, after giving them a salary of Rs 20,000, just to convince Saini about the authenticity of the equipment, DCP Bhisham Singh said, adding that the father-son duo were also arrested, and released on bail, earlier.They were earlier arrested when they allegedly sold snakes in Dehradun for Rs 17 lakh by claiming that the reptiles were rare and had medicinal properties. They were also arrested from Kurukshetra in a separate case, but resumed duping people once they came out, an official said.Police said they stayed in the posh Meera Bagh area at a rent of Rs 60,000 per month. They travelled in luxury cars with two personal security officers who carried weapons, at a salary of Rs 35,000. They wore branded clothes and sported expensive watches. With their confidence and fluent English, most people would not suspect them, an officer said, adding that they ran seven offices in Delhi.Virender ran a motor workshop in the 1990s and Nitin assisted him. But they faced financial losses and started duping people on the pretext of selling rare and antique objects such as magic mirror, rice puller and two-headed snakes, Kumar said.

They also told the victim that it was being used by NASA and the DRDO in advanced space research.Rice Puller is a non-existent product. The cheats coated a copper plate/ utensil with liquid magnet. Then, they used a mixture of boiled rice and iron filings to fool the victims by pulling the rice towards the magnet-coated copper utensil/ plate, said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar.Complainant Narender, who deals in garment exports business, approached the Crime Branch saying he was cheated of Rs. 1.43 crore by Virender Mohan Brar, his son and others.Mr. Narender alleged that he had came in contact with a person a few years ago who had told him about huge profits in Rice Puller testing.Virender, who posed as the managing director of a company, told the victim that he was in the process of testing the Rice Puller and would sell it to NASA for Rs. 37,500 crore if he was successful.Virender assured Mr. Narender saying the testing would be carried out by the DRDO scientists who work for him, the police said. The accused further told the victim that he would receive a lump sum if he invested money at the testing stage.To gain Mr. Narenders confidence, Virender told him that he would be paid Rs. 10 crore on the spot as token money if the testing was okay.The victim signed a memorandum of understanding with Virender after this and paid Rs. 87.2 lakh for the special anti-radiation suits to be worn by scientists during testing, the fee charged by the scientists, purchase of chemicals required for testing, etc.The testing was scheduled to take place in Uttar Pradeshs Hapur but the accused cancelled it saying the place was not conducive.They kept delaying the testing repeatedly, the police said. Meanwhile, Virenders accomplices started pressuring Mr. Narender to either finalise or let go of the deal. They took him to another companys office in East of Kailash and promised that he would not be cheated this time, they added.The complainant entered into another MoU with the new company and paid Rs. 51.1 lakh for testing, scheduled to take place in Himachal Pradeshs Dharamsala this time.However, the accused cited unclear skies and postponed the test.The victim later discovered that the DRDO scientists worked for Virender for Rs. 20,000 per month and that all the persons who had taken money from him were members of his gang, the police said.Following this, Virender and his son Nitin Mohan alias Baba were arrested.Seized itemsDuring the investigation, the RP copper plate, the anti-radiation suits and anti-radiation chemical stickers were seized from the accused, the police said.Rice Puller is a non-existent product.

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

MudurThe archaeological site near Lahuradewa lake in eastern Uttar PradeshNew Delhi: Fossils of microscopic algae found near an ancient lake in Uttar Pradesh suggest that people cultivated paddy there about 9,000 years ago, adding fresh evidence for the independent domestication of rice in China and India, scientists have said.The scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP) in Lucknow say their study of the algae microfossils called ""diatoms"" associated with paddy fields point to the presence of cultivated rice near Lahuradewa lake in eastern Uttar Pradesh about 9,000 years ago.A team of Chinese and Canadian archaeologists had two years ago described plant remains, including residues of rice, dated to between 9,000 and 8,400 years ago, representing the earliest evidence for domestication of rice in the Yangtze valley.""The evidence from Lahuradewa supports earlier suggestions that domestication of rice occurred in parallel in China and India,"" Rakesh Tewari , a senior archaeologist and former project director of the Archaeological Survey of India's excavations at Lahuradewa told The Telegraph.Tewari, who was not associated with the new BSIP study, said differences of a few hundred years from a single site should not be used to claim domestication of rice may have taken place in India even before it did in China.Paleobotanist Biswajit Thakur and his colleagues at the BSIP analysed the distribution of diatoms across excavated areas around the Lahuradewa lake which has long been recognised as a site of ancient cultivation.""We looked specifically at the distribution of diatoms associated with paddy fields - these algae are like signatures for rice cultivation,"" Thakur told The Telegraph. ""The rise and fall in the populations of diatoms coincides beautifully with conditions conducive and not conducive for rice cultivation.""Their study, published this week in Current Science, published by the Indian Academy of Sciences, has found increases in diatoms along the margins of the lake when environmental conditions were favourable for paddy cultivation and decreases when conditions were unfavourable.The earlier excavations by Tewari and his colleagues had already recovered phytoliths, or fossil remains of rice plants, from around the Lahuradewa lake area dated up to 8,300 years ago.The BSIP researchers believe the lake's margins with between 10cm and 20cm deep water were used as paddy fields. ""Even today, we see lake margins used for paddy cultivation,"" Thakur said.Two years ago, a study by scientists at the University of Cambridge and the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, had shown that farmers in the Indus valley civilisation had independently domesticated rice as an annual summer crop.""Rice is a staple across eastern and southeastern Asia and the subcontinent - it is possible the domestication process occurred at multiple sites,"" Tewari said."
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The aroma of fuming kebabs and fried chicken will take you places while your eyes feast on stacks of vermicelli, dates and breads sold in small street stalls. The medley of cultural influences is richer than the food served. As par t of the Ramzan celebrations, Raipur Times takes you to a food walk in one of the oldestlanesin the city. With Badi Masjid in the backdrop, the outer lane (Urdu Bazaar Road) is lit up with kebab shops. Among many, Lalus and Qureshis stall is 80 years old. The slender and juicy kebabs are served hot off the griddle and put you in the mood. These are the softest kebabs that youll find and full of flavour. Ours is a family business and for generations we are selling kebabs here. During iftar time, we serve over 200 people from different communities. During Ramzan time, we reduce our prices to half so that more people can come and savour kebabs here, says Qureshi Mian, owner of the shop. You can eat kebabs here at Rs 40 a plate which comes with four kebabs.Just ahead of Bilal, head here for some serious feasting. Pieces of meat are cooked for hours along with saffron flavoured rice to give you a place of delicious biryani, without which your food trail will be incomplete. The Mirchi Masala Biryani is a must try at Mota Pehelwaan which is a 100-years old Biryani seller in the area. The mirch masala biryani is aOriginally from Uttar Pradesh, youll find his food carts dotted across the lane selling a blush pink drink popularly called Pyaar Mohabbat Maza sold in Rs 30. This refreshing concoction is a mix of watermelon, milk and Rooh Afza. It's fragrant, its light and its got these gorgeous chunks of watermelon and it is a must have during summer and Ramzan, shares the seller of the drink Nizam Khan.The nihari at Bilal is so sublime that its absolutely worth elbowing your way to get here. A plateful of nihari with moti roti is very popular among the people. The meat is slow-cooked for hours to make it delicate and tender. It is then simmered in gravy with a mix of spices handed by our grandmother we served it with squeeze of lime juice and green chillies. We also serve haleem.

At Haji Mohammad, try the fried chicken which is served with red chutney. But people mostly make a beeline for keema golis. During Ramzan, Haji also serves Keema Golis (minced meat rounds served with onions). If you reach here around iftar time, youll manage to get your hands on them. People buy them in kilos for iftar parties too, says one Razia Hussein, who comes here twice a week to savour keema golis from the other side of the city Naya Raipur.After savouring fried food, you come across those large platters of beautifully decorated shahi tukda and matka phirni you know you cant resist. Golden fried slices of bread simmered in milk and topped with khoya and desi ghee made our lips curl into a smile every time we tucked in a bite. You can buy them at the popular Haji Bhai stall opposite Matia Mahal in Rs 20."

(Representational) Officials said that the family in Mangargaddi village did not have a ration card, but added that they were probing whether a formal application for the same had been submitted. (Representational)A 58-year-old woman allegedly died of starvation at a village under Dumri Block of Giridih district in Jharkhand. District officials said the womans family did not have a ration card but are probing whether a formal application for the same had been submitted.According to officials, Savitri Devi, a resident of Mangargaddi village in Dumri, died on Saturday. However, they were only informed about the death after her younger son, Hulas Mahato, reached home on Sunday. An investigation is underway to probe Devis death, they said.Executive Magistrate and Dumri Block Development Officer (in-charge) Rahul Dev said, We reached her home on Sunday afternoon. The administration was not informed about it earlier. Prima facie, there was no food in the house. The family did not have ration card. We are probing whether an application was submitted and, if so, whether it was properly processed.Officials are also probing as to why the woman, or any other member of her family, was reportedly not getting any other government benefits.Ram Prasad Mahato, mukhiya (village headman) of Chainpur Panchayat, under which Mangargaddi falls, said, Savitris elder daughter-in-law had come to me about two months ago for verification of her ration card application. I had verified it. But I dont know whether she submitted it in the block office or not.Mahato claimed that his mother has not been receiving pension in the last three years despite being selected under a scheme for widows in 2014. He said that after his fathers death in 2010, the little produce they got from a small family-owned farm barely lasted for two-to-three months. And the partly stipend he was earning through an apprenticeship program in Uttar Pradesh was also not sufficient to feed the family, he added.My elder brother was not getting salary regularly, while I was getting paid stipend that was too little. The last I talked, the food grain had been managed from a self-help group in the village. But it too had finished-off and for nearly three days, no food was cooked in the house, he told The Indian Express.Mahato said his elder brothers wife, her three children, his wife and their daughter lived together with his mother.Following Devis death, a local dealer has arranged about 50 kg of rice for the family of eight, he said. The family has requested the administration to not send the body for postmortem but cremate it.A womens self-help group also provided three kgs of rice for the family before Devi died.Sunita Devi, one of the core group members of Maa Kali Swayam Sahayata Samooh (Maa Kali Self-Help Group), said, Around eight days ago, Savitris elder daughter-in-law had called me asking if we could be of some help, as there was no food grain in the house. We managed to provide her three kgs at that time. We were again supposed to meet on Tuesday, this week, and could have arranged for more. But, in the meantime, Savitri died. With a family of seven to feed that amount was obviously not enough.Meanwhile, Food and Supplies Minister Saryu Roy has directed the Deputy Commissioner for a detailed report by a senior official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The researchers, Max Friedrich from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and Delhi-based freelancer Bonolata Sen, will carry out the study to know why farmers burn stubble and the scientificallyviable alternatives and how behavioural change interventions could be adopted in containing the trend.The study will be started in the first week of July. The researchers held talks with farmers, agriculture scientists and other stakeholders on Thursday in Bathinda Every year when stubble is burnt in the fields after paddy harvest in November, complaints of air quality turning very poor in Delhi start pouring in. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already asked the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to contain stubble burning by imposing fines on farmers and make alternative arrangements to manage crop residue.The study proposes to understand behaviours related to crop residue burning in Punjab. Why some farmers burn crop residue and why others do not? The study will be designed using the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-regulation (RANAS) approach. Combining leading theories of health behavioural psychology, the RANAS approach postulates that behaviour is primarily driven by peoples mindsets and perceptions, Bonolata told TOI.The design of this research study will be outlined soon after listening to the views of varied sections of society and what do they think about stubble burning, the challenges to address it and the research plan to gather scientific evidence of preferred practices and beliefs related to the issue, said KVM executive director Umendra Dutt."

However, if the low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal intensifies into a depression, it can push the monsoon current towards Bihar. However, no change has been witnessed in the low-pressure area since Sunday, which means it is stagnant, said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, department of environmental science, Central University of South Bihar and secretary of Indian Meteorological Society, Bihar.Meanwhile, the IMDs Patna office has predicted widespread pre-monsoon rainfall in several districts of state on Tuesday and Wednesday and scattered rainfall from Thursday onwards.Weathermen have attributed the prevailing weather conditions to an east-west trough that runs from Punjab to the centre of a low-pressure area over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.The late arrival of monsoon adversely affects rice crops. Although with scientific advancements, enough awareness has been created on how to save the rice seeds from damage. IMD, weather and agricultural scientists from Bihar have also planned to conduct an awareness programme by the end of June to create awareness about sustainable ways of farming when the onset of monsoon is late. It includes information on certain rice seeds that sustain and grow in less amount of water, Sarthi said."

(File) After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. (File)Even as it is struggling to get sugar mills to discharge over Rs 12,500 crore worth of cane dues to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP administration in Uttar Pradesh can take credit on another front: Procurement of wheat by government agencies in the state for the current 2018-19 rabi marketing season has almost touched 50 lakh tonnes (lt) and looks all set to surpass the all-time-high 50.63 lt achieved in 2012-13.We will be closing procurement operations on June 15. With two more days to go and also more updated information for the previous days, the total figure will cross the 2012-13 record, a senior official from the UP Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Indian Express.He said that the state and central agencies had procured the roughly 50 lt of wheat  from the 2017-18 crop, harvested and marketed after April  from over 10 lakh farmers. We opened 5,000-odd centres in 75 districts of the state and ensured that the farmers got the official minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,735 per quintal. In addition, we gave them a Rs 10/quintal incentive for grain that was brought to the centres after proper cleaning and drying, he added.After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat from UP had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. Even during the last marketing season, official procurement touched 37 lt, as against only 8 lt during 2016-17. This year, we set a target of procuring 50 lt out of the states total 350 lt wheat production. That target will be exceeded, the official pointed out.Meanwhile, wheat procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies across India had, based on information received as on Wednesday, reached 353.59 lt. This is again more than the original target of 320 lt, though below the 381.48 lt high of 2012-13. The higher-than-expected procurement this time comes in the wake of the countrys wheat output hitting a record 98.61 million tonnes (mt), surpassing the 2016-17 crop size of 98.51 mt.Besides wheat, government agencies had, as on June 11, also procured 356.81 lt of rice during the ongoing 2017-18 kharif marketing season (October-September). This is already the second highest procurement after the previous seasons 381.06 lt. For rice, too, the production of 111.62 mt in 2017-18 was the highest ever achieved by the country, ahead of the previous years 109.70 mt.Guaranteed MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy has made the two grains the preferred growing option for farmers, especially in a scenario where prices of other crops have been prone to extreme market fluctuations. With roughly 36 per cent of the countrys wheat and 33 per cent of paddy being bought by government agencies, the market for these crops has practically ceased to be significant. That, in turn, means putting more pressure on the already stretched storage capacities of FCI and other state-run agencies.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He also said farmers in districts like Begusarai and Khagaria had started switching over to soyabean cultivation as it required less water.Kumar said farmers in north Bihar needed a strain of paddy that could withstand the gushing floodwaters, while those in the drought-prone south Bihar districts needed paddy which could weather lack of rain for a month.He said the challenge caused by flood was greater because the floodwaters usually damaged the standing paddy crops. Last year, 8.4 lakh hectare of paddy was destroyed. Farmers in the state take three crops  Kharif, Rabi and garma paddy. The minister also asked the IRRI scientists to present a demonstration of their method of paddy cultivation in the current Kharif season to which they agreed.IRRI DG Morell and agriculture scientist Arvind Kumar informed the minister that the institute had developed a strain of paddy that could withstand pressure of floodwaters for 15 days. Similarly, another strain of paddy could be cultivated in drought-prone areas as it required minimal water for a month.Morel said the IRRI had established its South Asia Regional Centre at Varanasi and had also been collaborating with several agriculture universities in the country, including Bihar Agriculture University at Sabour (Bhagalpur). The methods developed by IRRI helped reduce production costs and also promoted farm mechanisation and management of natural resources (like soil, water and insects), Morel said."

Picture by Manoj KumarPatna: Matthew Morell, the director general of International Rice Research Institute, Manila, The Philippines, on Wednesday had a meeting with state agriculture minister Prem Kumar and other senior department officials.The participants discussed the avenues through which the premier research institute could help Bihar to enhance rice productivity and help the state in providing seeds of paddy of such a quality which could withstand vagaries of weather.Morell said: ""We see a very good opportunity to work with Bihar farmers and universities in the state for enhancing rice productivity and add more value to the crop.""The institute had introduced seven new varieties of paddy in the state last year, and this year too it has introduced two new varieties ahead of the kharif season when paddy cultivation is mainly done in the state.The institute is going to work in close cooperation with the Bihar Agriculture University and the state agriculture department for collecting data from the field to assess the outcome of its efforts by introducing new varieties of paddy. The international institution has also set up its south Asia regional centre at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said he urged the institute team to provide paddy varieties to Bihar which could withstand the vagaries of nature as Bihar had 21 flood-prone districts in its northern parts and 17 drought-prone districts in the southern region.""I have been informed that International Rice Research Institute has developed a paddy variety whose plant does not get damaged even if it remains under water for 15 days. This could be very useful for north Bihar districts and urged the team to develop such a variety which could survive up to one month despite being under water. Similarly, I drew the team's attention towards the water problem in south Bihar districts and requested to provide varieties which could give good productivity even when there is a scarcity of water,"" Prem said while sharing the details of the meeting.Paddy cultivation is being done in 33 lakh hectares in Bihar and the state produced around 71 lakh metric tonnes of rice last year. Productivity-wise the state stands at sixth place in the country. Even within the state there are wide variations in productivity and while it is around 2,000kg per hectare in the Bhojpur region, its level comes down to around 1,000 kg per hectare in the Bhagalpur region.The minister also announced that the agriculture department would provide land to the International Rice Research Institute in its farms both in north and south Bihar so that the institute could demonstrate the benefits of using its paddy varieties among farmers."

Mamata had done many things for the Hindus, including developing Gangasagar, building skywalk at Dakshineswar temple and renovating Tarakeswar temple,"" he said.Mr Bandopadhyay claimed that although the highest number of farmer deaths were reported in Maharashtra during the past six months, PM Modi chose to hold a rally for welfare of peasants in Bengal where not a single farmer had died.Accusing the BJP of creating a rift between the Hindus and the Muslims, he said, ""We will not let that happen"".""The Rambhakts of Modi's BJP trigger riots but the Rambhakts of Bengal work for building communal amity,"" he claimed.He claimed that the turnout at PM Modi's public rally comprised people from four states - Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha -- but not a single farmer was present at the rally.Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said, ""The people of India need Mamata Banerjee. She has no lust for power. But she has to take up the responsibility. The people of the country need a leader who works for everybody.""He said PM Modi had raised a slogan of bringing ""Achhe din"" but bad days befell the people.Mr Hakim, who is also the Trinamool Congress' general secretary, said, ""We have syndicate for development but not formed syndicate to organise riots like what happened in Gujarat.""He claimed that the Trinamool Congress would win all the 42 seats in the state and the BJP would not be able to win a single seat.State Education Minister and Trinamool Congress Secretary General Partha Chatterjee alleged that PM Modi was shedding crocodile tears for the farmers.""Modi had suddenly turned up in Midnapore to profess his new-found love for farmers. I ask where was he when the farmers' agitation in Nandigram and Singur were taking place,"" he questioned.Mr Chatterjee said Ms Banerjee had a history of standing by the people and she did not become a mass leader in one day.He said those who failed to provide mid-day meal rice were now claiming to side with the farmers.Mr Chatterjee alleged that the BJP was trying to win polls by bringing out rath-yatras and allowing display of swords in processions, thereby, creating fear among people but, said that, they would not succeed."
5ce7d2b1e8e3fc56af41b789,Fines fail to deter stubble burning,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fines-fail-to-deter-stubble-burning/article25267643.ece,2018-10-20,"Between September 27 and October 14, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) imposed Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they collected only Rs. 3,05,000, according to figures from the organisation.The fines are collected over time  frequently the farmers dont have money to immediately pay them, Gulshan Rai, Chief Environmental Engineer, PPCB, told The Hindu . However our experience from previous years is that this is not a substantial amount.The Centre and the States  Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  have in several meetings through the year declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble for farmers, which, according to various studies, contributes anywhere from 17% to 78% to the particulate matter-emission load in the city during winter.To discourage farmers in Punjab and Haryana  who are responsible for the bulk of such fires  the government has also disbursed Rs. 591 crore to these States to sell subsidised farm implements that can do away with stubble without having to burn them.Officials in the PPCB, on the condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that they were frequently lenient when they caught farmers in the act of burning stubble  an offence that invites fines of at least Rs. 2,500 an acre.Officials said satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complex process.We are helplessWe get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to ascertain the farmer in question. Sometimes, farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence and sometimes poverty. We are helpless at times, said an officer tasked with following up on stubble burning fires in Punjab.Despite a vigorous focus by governments on making mechanised farm implements  combine harvesters-cum-straw management system, seed drillers, rotary harvesters  available to farmers, its still inaccessible to many farmers with landholdings less than 5 acres or those not rich enough to invest in such machines.In Bibipur village, Patiala, there are about 800 households, according to Hardeep Singh, a resident farmer, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields ripe for harvesting.These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are only three or four machines available (for a variety of tasks from cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw) for all of us, he told The Hindu . That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. However, farmers have barely two months  between mid-September and mid-November  to clear out the field.This year, delayed rains have shrunk the window further and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times, in keeping with subtle weather differences.In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, Mr. Singh added.Then theres the spike in diesel prices. Deploying the machines uses up nearly 5 litres of diesel per acre (running the tractors, to which these implements are hitched) to sow wheat and nearly 20 litres per acres to farmers who want to grow potato, said Jitender Pal, a farmer in Jaspal Bangar village in Ludhiana.At village Rola, in the Samrala tehsil of Ludhiana, Upendra, a daily-wage labourer from Bihar, was busy setting fire to a 1.5 acre plot of rice straw. It wasnt his land, he said, and was merely following instructions of the malik. The Hindu couldnt contact him. Sarabjit Singh, a farmer in Rola, said no machines were made available to his village. And thats true for 50 villages around, he added.Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, said that change would take some time. Were educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys soil nutrients, and increases their fertilizer requirement. Weve run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier  just Rs. 300 more per acre  than burning the field and helps preserve the environment as well as their health, he said in a media briefing.( The author was part of a media contingent, sponsored by the Union Environment Ministry, to review measures to address stubble burning in Punjab )."

5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions.

An estimated 31,79,520 voters, including 16,21,839 male, 15,57,592 female and 89 of third-gender, are eligible to vote.As many as 4,336 polling booths have been set up for this phase.While Chhattisgarh has traditionally seen a straight fight between the BJP and the Congress, this time a third front comprising Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J), Mayawati's BSP and the CPI is also in the fray.Campaignning ended at 3 pm in 10 constituencies- Mohla-Manpur, Antagarh, Bhanupratappur, Kanker, Keshkal, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Konta, where Naxal menace is rampant, and the polling time there will be from from 7 am to 3 pm.In the rest of the constituencies- Khairgarh, Dongargarh, Rajnandgaon, Dongargaon.Khujji, Bastar, Jagdalpur and Chitrakot, the campaigning ended at 5 pm and the polling time will be from 8 am to 5pm , a statement issued by the office of Chief Electoral Officer here said.The Naxalites have called for a boycott of polls in the state and have executed half a dozen attacks in last 15 days, three of them major ones which left 13 people dead including a cameraperson of national broadcaster Doordarshan who was covering the election campaign.Three police personnel, besides the DD cameraman, were killed in the Maoist attack in Aranpur area of Dantewada on on October 30.READ| Chhattisgarh elections: Raman Singh government has almost eliminated Naxalism, says Amit ShahBefore that on October 27, four CRPF personnel, belonging to 168th battalion were killed and two others injured after Maoists blew up their bullet proof bunker vehicle in Awapalli area of Bijapur district.On November 8, four civilians and a CISF jawan were killed when Naxals detonated an improvised explosive device (IED) in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada district.Polling parties are being sent to their destination amid tight security, election authorities said.Helicopters have been pressed into service for air-lifting EVMs, polling personnel and polling materials to polling stations in sensitive remote areas, a senior police official said adding that chopper services will be used for around 200 polling booths.A keenly-watched constituency is Rajnandgaon, where Chief Minister Raman Singh of the ruling BJP is pitted against Congress candidate Karuna Shukla, niece of former prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.The highest number of 30 candidates will lock horns in this constituency, while the lowest number of five nominees each will fight it out in Bastar and Kondagaon.The ruling BJP has reposed its faith on old faces and fielded two incumbent ministers Mahesh Gagda (Bijapur), Kedar Kashyap (Narayanpur) and sitting MLAs- Santosh Bafna (Jagdalpur), Sarojani Banjare (Dongargarh).Congress has renominated its nine sitting MLAs Manoj Singh Mandavi (Bhanupratappur), Mohan Lal Markam (Kondagaon), Lakheshwar Baghel (Bastar), Deepak Kumar Baij (Chitrakot), Devati Karma (Dantewada), Kawasi Lakhma (Konta), Girwar Janghel (Khairagarh) and Daleshwar Sahu (Dongargaon).Of the 18 seats going to poll in the first phase, 12 are reserved for Scheduled Tribe (ST) while one for Scheduled Caste (SC) category.The remaining 72 constituencies will go to polls on November 20.

5ce6ac16e8e3fc56af4148d5,The sacred Indian games,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-sacred-indian-games/article25529137.ece,2018-11-18,"One evening, many years ago, my father asked if I would accompany him to a town in northern Kerala called Thirunavaya. The place was known, particularly among the Hindus of Malabar and Kodagu, for a small Vishnu temple. More importantly, it was famous as the place where one went to make offerings on behalf of ones ancestors, to ask of the cosmological order that release ( moksha ) be granted to them. In parts, this sanctity to Thirunavaya in the Hindu, and particularly the Vaishnavite, cosmos is bestowed by the river Bharathapuzha which flows by the temple, between the Vishnu temple on one bank and the Mahadeva and Brahma temples on the other. Alongside that slender but potentially perilous watery channel, like generations before, I sat on the gravelly steps leading down into the river.Like generations before me, wearing a ring made out of darbha grass and with balls of sesame and cooked rice laid in front, I too performed the pitru-tharpanam rituals. These were rituals in the name of those who had ceased to be. I invoked their spectral presence, reminisced about their life and histories, and asked the gods that their beings find release. Sitting there, as an observer and a participant, while the drone of the young priests voice rose and fell, I watched the river flow. The waters carried along with it refuse, debris, and residue to be poured out into the Arabian Sea near Ponnani. The river had survived sand mining mafias, invasive foreign species, chemicals  small and surreptitious abuses that wreck its ecosystem. All the while amidst the profane, natural and secular, the river made its way, unaware of the cosmological significance thrust upon it by humans.Sacred but pollutedThat Indian rivers have become sites where the sacred and the polluted coexist is not new. The Ganga is perhaps the pre-eminent example of this. In the summer of 1993 and 1994, during the course of her field work, the American anthropologist Kelly Alley, who now teaches at Auburn University in Alabama, asked the seemingly simple question of those who lived in Varanasi: How is it that a sacred river can be polluted? While she went about her investigation with compassion and rigour, the scepticism in her question was twofold: How can devotees let the river become polluted, and does the pollution itself not render the river less sacred? Variations on this theme had preoccupied the British colonisers as well, although their focus was inordinately on the macabre. (The Hindoo casts the dead naked into the sacred stream, wrote the authors of The Library of Entertaining Knowledge in the 1830s).When faced with the question of why a phenomenon or practice is held sacred, at the very end of that question often lie claims of civilisational epiphanies. This, in itself, is not unique to India. The scholar of myth and religions, Mircea Eliade (a student of Surendranath Dasgupta), wrote that sacrality bestowed on phenomena is, at its heart, an act of uncovering. Sacredness is the manifestation to all of what was a revelation to only a few. It is an act of what he calls hierophany (hiero: sacred; phany: to make visible). The great Martin Heidegger called this unconcealment of Being as aleitheia, as the truth of experience itself. Inevitably, like mushrooms after rains, stories follow that make the strangeness of hierophany palatable. In fact, according to the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, it is only by deeming some objects as sacred that societies can find reasons and means to cohere.But our lived lives sidestep such theorisations. Our rivers continue to be receptacles of our detritus and yet they remain as objects of veneration. Earlier last week, we saw photos of women, standing in the Yamuna and surrounded by chemical froth, performing the Chhath Puja. Unlike Islam or Christianity, which are abstemious in their relation to nature, the practice of Hinduism is intimately and extravagantly connected to the forests, plants, caves and rivers of India. These geographic features are not just instances of nature; rather, they become the locus of religion, the site where human consciousness acquires its Hindu identity via beliefs.An element of the schizoidWhat, then, happens to these beliefs, and inevitably identity, when these sources of sacrality are destroyed or polluted? We have found ways to make do, to coexist with ugliness, to ignore the discomfiting, and often to invent vocabularies that are elaborate and yet also expedient. The result is that there is an element of the schizoid, a sort of cognitive rupture: our beliefs about the sacred fail to correspond with our intuitions about sanctity. The more violent this rupture becomes, as India pollutes its way to middle-income status, the more strident will be efforts to insist on the sanctity of religious beliefs. At its extreme, our beliefs then become indistinguishable from mimicry."

And now, 4-5 of them are regulars here, says Ishpreet Singh, a Punjabi, seen tossing the flat bread on a hissing plate at the Shake Square every evening.Although for many businessmen, professionals and students from other States, finding dishes familiar to their taste buds here has become easier and convenient, yet with tastes remaining incomplete, they are reluctant to call them homely.Do you remember how much weight we lost in the first semester? Prashant Mallick, Krishnas classmate in the fifth year of B. Arch at the School of Planning and Architecture, asks his friends, who nod in approbation.Even with familiar dishes here, vo baat nahi hai (something is amiss). Here, you get jalebis made of jaggery whereas back home its made of sugar. We survive only on chicken biryani, says U.P.-born Parag Raj Vaish, who became a non-vegetarian thanks to limited options available for vegetarians earlier.For Gaurav Das Swer, from Meghayala, finding mild flavours he is accustomed to is difficult. Only curd rice tastes homely, he quips.As for food trucks now lining up many roads to sell burgers, hot dogs and ice creams, Krishna attributes it to Pelli Choopulu , a 2016 romantic comedy film that made the concept popular.MNCs become popularThe students often flock to McDonalds, KFC and Subway, and refer, curiously, to items served by the multinational companies, which stepped into the city after the bifurcation, homely. Even local cafs offering Italian and Mediterranean dishes satiate them. But, for Vijendra Ranjilal, a Rajasthani who sells toys and balloons at the Benz Circle here, tiffin centres and small restaurants are yet to offer cheap cuisines familiar to him.Whenever I am in rush, I grab two samosas. Everything else tastes spicy, says Vijendra, of the Bagaria community, adding, I mostly prepare food at home. Even my neighbours ask for rotis I make.Even so, the city is beginning to welcome diverse tastes, says 47-year-old Poonam Mootha, a Rajasthani who grew up here. When I was in school, only Bhaiyaji Panipuri Walla in One Town sold North Indian street food. Now, you get pav bhaji and chole bhature everywhere.The change is more noticeable in terms of availability of non-regional fruits and vegetables to common people at Rythu Bazaars and with street vendors, says Karam Singh, a Punjabi who spent her early childhood here and has been in the city for 13 years as a consultant with an overseas education firm.I remember in my childhood when my father, returning from New Delhi, used to bring eggplants in sacks and distribute them among relatives fond of baingan bharta (mashed eggplant curry). Now, he doesnt have to do that. We now easily get carrots and radish too. Earlier, they were available only in supermarkets."

With the latest detection, the department has been successful in checking bogus billing of about five lakh bags of paddy and rice in the ongoing Kharif marketing season.Food and civil supply minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said district manager Ferozepur on November 21 detected abnormal purchase at Jiwan Arain and Panje Ke Uttar Mandis by arhtias, Reet Enterprises. The minister said that they had made bogus purchases of 86,939 bags of paddy in connivance with Sunrise Rice Mill, against which payments to the tune of Rs 5.6 crore have been taken.According to Ashu, the Punsup held a meeting of its district mangers on November 20 to track the movement of paddy and rice from other states to Punjab. In the meeting, district managers were specially instructed to re-check the purchases of paddy and rice and verify those figures with the stocks in the premises of the millers.The minister further added that the miller was planning to buy paddy from other states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where it is much cheaper than the minimum support price (MSP) and then deliver it during the milling to make a quick profit.Ashu said that the investigation has revealed the money trail  funds were diverted from the bank account of Reet Enterprises, owned by Jaswinder Singh, to AM Industries Jiwan Arain owned by Harpreet Singh who is the brother of Jaswinder Singh. AM Industries further distributed these funds to SS Industries, GS Trading Company, MJ Industries, Harpreet Kaur and Amandeep. According to Ashu, further details are being collected from the banks.The food and civil supplies department has lodged an FIR against Reet Enterprises owned by Jaswinder Singh, Jagdish Chander and Sons, owned by Sandeep Kumar, Dhruv Commission Agent, owned by Rishu Mutneja, Sunrise Rice Mill, owned by Jasmeet and mandi inspector Hansa Singh."

Sanjay K JhaInterviews are sometimes cut short because some questions make those interviewed uncomfortable.The roles were reversed at Khasrod village in Madhya Pradeshs Raisen district, around 50km from Bhopal.Questions about the so-called national issues  the temple, the tallest statue, the quality of the political discourse, the distortion of history  burst the dam on the everyday challenges.The flood that cascaded down centred on one issue: lack of employment opportunities in spite of some families breaking centuries-old barriers and sending out their children to study.So much so that eventually, almost every national question was met with an instance of how an educated sister is stuck at home and how a graduate son found out that farm labour pays better than a private company. The narrations ended with an appeal: Please write about the need to create jobs.The interview ended abruptly because every question was triggering traumatic accounts of lives spent in the hope that the system will deliver if the citizens fulfil their part.Rajkumar Uike, a tribal youth living in the village, had agreed to speak to The Telegraph on one condition that itself spoke volumes about what matters: the questions should be limited to the problems he faced as a farmhand.Rajkumars little home falls in the Bhojpur Assembly constituency, named after Raja Bhoj, one of the most celebrated Indian kings who ruled Malwa and was known for patronising the arts and science in the 11th century.This newspaper could not verify some of the specific information listed by Rajkumar as officials are busy with preparations for Wednesdays elections. But signs of abject poverty were visible everywhere and there was little reason to doubt the young man.Excerpts from the unfinished interview follow:Q: You are a farmer?Rajkumar: No, farm labourer. I look after somebodys farm.Q: How much do you earn in a month?Rajkumar: (Smiles and gives a blank look. Wretched poverty displayed all over, on clothes, on the hut, on the utensils.)Q: What are the problems you face in looking after the farm?Rajkumar: DAP (fertiliser) price is up. Electricity comes from 2.30 at night to 6 in the morning. I have to wake up at night to start the pump. We want electricity from 10am to 6pm.Q: But the chief minister says 24-hour power supply is ensured.Rajkumar: For 24-hour supply, they charge Rs 32,000 for four months. We pay Rs 15,000 for four months.Q: You get the MSP decided by the government for your produce?Rajkumar: Got Rs 1,750 for wheat, MSP is Rs 1,840.Q: Got money for building a house?Rajkumar: No, nobody got it in our village. Only one house under the PM Awas Yojana, nobody under the state scheme. Officers say no scheme for your village.Q: But you didnt follow it up?Rajkumar: Officers dont listen. So many documents they ask for. Even in banks, Aadhaar has become another problem. Chappal toot jate chakkar lagate (the footwear gets worn out, going around in circles).Q: But Modiji says he opened bank accounts for the poor.Rajkumar: Anybody who had money could have opened an account anyway. Whats the benefit of a zero balance account?Q: But you are at least allowed to enter banks.Rajkumar: (Points to another person who had just arrived.) Ask him if the accounts could be opened earlier. He is Harlal Gaur, a big farmer.Harlal: I opened my account 30 years ago. Earlier, you had to fill up one slip, now they torture you by asking for endless sets of documents.Q: Did you get fasal bima (crop insurance) benefits?Rajkumar: Not one paisa. Neighbouring villages Ashapur and Nimkheda got it. Here we dont have good quality dhan (paddy) but they put us in that category. Our dhan was bad but we didnt get anything. Nothing for wheat.Q: Did you benefit from the Ladli scheme for daughters?Rajkumar: Nobody so far. They registered girl children but they will get Rs 1 lakh only when she passes Class VII after reaching the age of 18 years. Over 80 per cent of girls drop out after fifth or sixth as there are no schools in the village. A few who will get will have to wait till they turn 18.Q: But you get wheat and rice for Re 1 a kg?Rajkumar: Yes, I do.Harlal: I dont, only BPL cardholders do.Q: Will the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government come back?Rajkumar: (Silence)Harlal: No way.Q: So, do you feel proud Modiji enhanced the prestige of the country in the world?Rajkumar: There are no jobs. It is becoming a big problem.Q: But you got the biggest statue of Sardar Patel worth Rs 3,000 crore.Rajkumar: I am a BCom (graduate). Private companies give Rs 6,000 a month. Thats why I chose to be a farm labourer.Q: Arent you proud Hindu leaders are in control now?Rajkumar: My sister is also a BCom (graduate). We studied in Obaidullahganj (the nearest town, 8km away).Harlal: My two sons did MCom from Bhopal. Both are sitting at home. Should I call them?(The floodgates open. Several people start recounting their plight.)Rajkumar stepped out of his home to remind the reporter: Write something about employment creation. Thats the main issue.His sister, the commerce graduate who assists him in farming and looking after the cow, was peeping from behind a curtain. She belongs to a rare tribal family that cared to educate its children despite facing extreme social and financial difficulties in this remote village.On the day the interview was conducted last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in the state explaining how Rahul Gandhi and Kamal Nath were seeking Muslim votes. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was also campaigning here, saying the Congress needed Ali not Bajrangbali."
5ce5f36de8e3fc56af41073b,Cutting through the smog,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cutting-through-the-smog/article25667099.ece,2018-12-05,"Incidents of stubble burning  following the harvest of paddy crop in Punjab and Haryana  cannot be averted by imposing fines, or giving notice or giving farmers capital subsidy. Instead, the issue requires long-term vision and strategic policy interventions.Air pollution is a worry especially in north India. Stubble burning is said to be a key factor behind the formation of a dense cover of smog in this part of India though its contribution is less than 20%. Farmers are held responsible for the crisis but what is at fault are the flawed and short-sighted policies of the Central and State governments.Policy of rotationIn the 1960s, wheat-paddy crop rotation was encouraged in Punjab and Haryana to make India self-sufficient in foodgrain production. Large public investments in irrigation and adoption of high yielding varieties under the Green Revolution helped achieve the goal and make the nation food secure. However, the negative externalities in terms of land degradation, adverse soil health due to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and plummeting water tables have surfaced.The share of paddy (rice) in the gross cropped area in Punjab has increased from 6.8% in 1966-67 to almost 36.4 % in recent years, while it has increased from 4.97% to 20% in Haryana. The increase has undisputedly been at the cost of the area under maize, cotton, oilseeds and sugarcane. The policy of minimum support price for crops, in tandem with their assured procurement and input subsidy, have left farmers with no option but to follow this rotation. Besides, Punjab enacted a water conservation law in 2009 which mandates paddy sowing within a notified period (some time in June instead of the earlier practice in May). A shorter period of sowing days prohibits transplantation before a notified date, which in turn limits the window available for harvesting paddy to between 15 and 20 days. As a result, farmers who are pressed for time to sow wheat and maintain crop yield find stubble burning to be an easy and low-cost solution.One possibility to curtail the practice is to ensure that the government encourages crop diversification towards less water-intensive crops by extending price incentives and better marketing facilities. In some districts, farmers have started growing kinnow fruit but are often dissuaded due to high price volatility and the absence of a market. The policy of a price deficiency system  as initiated in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh  should be adopted to strengthen the production and marketing of alternative crops. Another option is to replicate the Telangana model of providing farmers an investment support of Rs. 8,000 per acre each year and withdraw price-based support.Punjab faces another serious problem: labour shortage. In the Agricultural Census 2011, average land-holding size has increased from 2.89 hectares in 1970-71 to 3.77 hectares in 2010-11  higher than the national average of 1.5 hectares. Paucity of labour for various farm operations is substituted by machines for which the government extends financial support.A road mapFarmers have already made investments in seed drill machines for sowing wheat after paddy harvest. Increasing pressure by the government on farmers to purchase the happy seeder to abate stubble burning adds to the cost incurred by farmers. Even if the machine is available at a subsidised rate of nearly Rs. 1 lakh, it would remain idle the whole year and become a liability in terms of maintenance. It is not a viable option for small and marginal farmers who hardly earn Rs. 60,000 in a year. Imposing a fine for burning straw is again unreasonable. The fine imposed per hectare is much lower than the cost incurred on a happy seeder.A feasible remedy could lie in the setting up of custom hiring centres or inviting companies to make investments for rental purposes. If the state provides an app-based support system, to rent out tractors and farm implements and earn additional income  there are examples of this in Nigeria and also in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  it would be akin to the Uberisation of agriculture. It would avoid stubble burning and at the same time make farming more mechanised, cost effective and a source of employment.Another far-sighted approach could be in effective use of paddy straw. Unlike wheat residue, which is used as fodder, paddy straw is non-palatable to animals as it has high silica content. Farmers, who have already been sensitised to refrain from burning residue, should be given options such as biomass generation. Now, hardly 20% of straw is managed through biomass power plants, paper and cardboard mills. The government should use geospatial techniques to identify areas where stubble burning is severe and encourage installation of biomass plants at such locations. This will not only reduce transportation costs for the firm or village entrepreneurs but also help the government achieve its target of generating 227GW based on renewable energy sources by 2022. Farmers can also be incentivised to sell the residual for additional income. The residual has uses, such as in paper, cardboard and packing material making and also hydroseeding (defiberised rice straw can be used in hydroseeding for erosion control).Seema Bathla and Ravi Kiran are Professor and Research Scholar, respectively, at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi"
5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

promise",http://www.newindianexpress.com/elections/chhattisgarh-elections/2018/dec/11/raman-singh-doling-out-rice-and-mobiles-he-saw-entertainment-in-rahuls-loan-waiver-promise-1910111.html,2018-12-11,"By PTIRAIPUR: Climbing the populism ladder, the BJP's longest-serving chief minister Raman Singh gave rice, mobiles and even medical advice almost free to a large population, but his bid for another shot at ruling Chhattisgarh saw him touching feet of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath and dismissing Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's aggressive campaign as mere ""entertainment"".He also took jibes at his predecessor Ajit Jogi's alliance with Dalit leader Mayawati for polls in his state with a large population of tribals and other backward castes, saying 'A plough-carrying farmer' does not need an 'Elephant' -- referring to the party symbols of the two leaders who had joined hands to present a third force in an otherwise direct fight between the ruling BJP and the challenger Congress.In the end, the election results showed that farmers, as also tribals and other voters of his state, did not want even 'Lotus' of the saffron party and decided to support the 'Hand' of the Congress.The results, while bringing Congress back to power in this state, also end the rule of the 66-year-old BJP stalwart, who has earned several monikers during his 15-year-long tenure -- 'Doctor Saheb' being a trained Ayurvedic medical practitioner, 'Chaur Wale Baba' for his popular rice scheme and the 'Mobile Wale Baba' for giving free smartphones to 50 lakh women and students.The last time the Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh was in the first three years of the state being carved out of Madhya Pradesh, after which it was Singh who was at the helm -- that too for 15 out of the state's overall history of 18 years.He started as a councillor in his native Kawardha (Kabirdham) district in 1983 before becoming an MLA in 1990 in the undivided Madhya Pradesh and then a Lok Sabha MP in 1999 by defeating Congress veteran Motilal Vora from what became his bastion, Rajnandgaon.Singh, who was inducted into the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government as Minister of State for Commerce and Industry in 1999, was sent back to state politics to lead the BJP in the 2003 assembly polls and steered the saffron party's bid to dethrone the Jogi government of Congress in 2003.While the then Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo, a former royal, was a front-runner for the CM's post at that time, a controversial sting operation extinguished his chances and Singh was put on the hot seat.Singh again led his party to victory in 2008 and 2013 and earned the distinction of being the longest-serving BJP CM since the party was formed in 1980.The only time he suffered a personal poll defeat was to the Congress' Yogeshwar Raj from Kawardha in the MP Assembly polls in 1998.While the Congress has regularly attacked him over issues of corruption, mainly focusing on the civil supply scam, the chit fund scandal and allegations of his son and BJP MP Abhishek Singh holding accounts in foreign banks, he managed to hold on to his own in the state with a slew of populist welfare measures.The BJP's campaign in the run-up to the two-phase assembly polls on November 12 and 20 this year totally centred around Singh, who had started his political journey has a member of the erstwhile Jan Sangh and then of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since the very beginning of the party.Born on October 15, 1952 in a Rajput family in Kawardha town in undivided Madhya Pradesh, to Vighnaharan Singh Thakur, a prominent lawyer of the town, and Sudha Singh, a housewife, Singh obtained a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree from Raipur's Government Ayurveda College in 1975.Party functionaries say that, as a doctor, Singh either charged a nominal fee from his patients or none at all.The Congress, however, has continually alleged that the state's public distribution scheme was defrauded of Rs 36,000 crore and a CBI probe led to several officials being booked in 2015.The party has also routinely raked up allegations that Singh's son, Abhishek, a Lok Sabha MP from Rajnandgaon, was mentioned in the Panama Papers leak, a claim he has denied.Left-wing extremism, however, remained the 'Achilles' heel' for the state, with the Congress claiming that 15 years of BJP rule had worsened the Naxal menace, even as Singh continued to claim that Naxalism was on life-support in the system and the affected districts would soon see peace.Singh's government came under fire when a coordinated attack in 2013 on a Congress convoy in Jhiram Valley in Sukma left several senior party leaders including Nandkumar Patel, Vidyacharan Shukla, Mahendra Karma and Uday Mudliyar dead.While the opposition and some from his own party have been critical of his working style and the behaviour of state bureaucrats, Singh, with his amiable, soft-spoken demeanour, generally managed to win the day against dissidence.In the end, political pundits say, it was Congress president Rahul Gandhi's promise of farm loan waiver that turned the elections away from Singh, despite his claims that farmers in his state were already been given zero-interest rate loans.In the meantime, there were also talks about Singh returning to the central politics though he ruled it out saying, 'Abhi Dilli Door Hai (Delhi is far away as yet)'.During the election campaign, while talking to PTI, Singh had also dismissed any impact of Gandhi's extensive campaign in the state and said the Congress chief was ""sort of an entertainment"" only for people in the state and they do not take him seriously."

IRRI-Indias success had begun with the introduction of IR8  high-yielding rice variety known as miracle rice which helped save India from a famine in the 1960s.According to an IRRI report, though IRRI and India have collaborated for over five decades, Modi was the first Indian Prime Minister to visit IRRI headquarters in the Philippines in November 2017, where he discussed agricultural innovations and research advances for the rice sector. He had also inaugurated the Resilient Rice Field Laboratory at the IRRI headquarters.According to the report, India began its partnership with IRRI through the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1967. The partnership resulted in advances in developing disease- and insect-resistant varieties suited to various rice environments, developing and releasing hybrid rice varieties bred through government and private sector programs, streamlining rice production practices, and improving post-harvest technologies for improved sustainability and productivity.From 2009 to 2012, ICAR and IRRI worked together on 37 research projects, including two major regional initiatives  Stress-Tolerant Rice for Africa and South Asia (STRASA) project and Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA).Indias extensive partnership with IRRI involves about 250 institutions all over the country. The IRRI South Asia Regional Centre is a regional facility that supports research collaboration, training, and service provision to institutions, scientists, and other stakeholders from India and other South Asian and African nations.IRRI scientist Ashish Pathak said that the centre aims to deliver rice research expertise by producing stress tolerant rice varieties and conducting trainings in mechanization.It will support research collaboration, training, and service provision to institutions, scientists, and other stakeholders from India and other South Asian and African nations.It also aims at enabling knowledge transfer through short courses on rice-based agri-food systems and other IRRI education products within the region.Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi visited the centre on Saturday to take stock of the preparations for PMs visit."
5ce5594ee8e3fc56af40b895,Invisible people: Aadhaar versus particularly vulnerable tribal groups,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/invisible-people-aadhaar-versus-particularly-vulnerable-tribal-groups/cid/1679711,2018-12-24,"More than 40 per cent of respondents in a recent survey reported Aadhaar-related problems such as ration cards being cancelled for lack of Aadhaar linkage, children being refused admission for lack of Aadhaar, NREGA wage payments being rejected, and so on (PTI)Particularly vulnerable tribal groups, earlier known as primitive tribal groups, are the sort of people you may never meet unless you take the trouble to look for them. In Jharkhand, they live in small hamlets scattered over the nooks and crannies of the states undulating forests. Without a purpose and some local guidance, it is unlikely that anything will take you there.Last month, the Sahayata Kendra (help centre for rural workers) in Manika block of Latehar district completed a house-to-house survey of all the PVTG families in the block, and also in the adjacent block of Satbarwa in Palamu district. We found 325 PVTG households  spread over 18 hamlets  in these two blocks, compared with 256 listed in the Socio-Economic and Caste Census of 2011. All of them belong to the Parhaiya community. They came across as uprooted people, who have been deprived of their traditional resources and are now struggling to latch on to new sources of livelihood.PVTG families in the area used to subsist mainly on forest-based activities such as hunting, gathering, selling minor forest products (roots, berries, wood, mahua, tendu, lac, herbs, among others) and manufacturing simple items from straw, bamboo and such. Not so long ago, the forests of Jharkhand were dense with flora and teeming with wildlife, but recent environmental degradation has taken a toll. Today, most PVTG families in Manika and Satbarwa subsist on a little farming, casual labour, and residual forest-based occupations such as making ropes or baskets. Some of them work as seasonal labourers in the rice fields or brick kilns of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and occasionally migrate to more distant places.Public facilities in PVTG hamlets are abysmal, in spite of some recent progress. None of the 18 hamlets we visited seemed to have a well-functioning school. Few had their own anganwadis, keeping child development services out of reach of most PVTG children. Health centres, banks and administrative offices are far away and public transport is nil. Government officials rarely visit these hamlets. Isolation, poverty and low education levels have turned PVTGs into sitting ducks for exploitative contractors and middlemen.In this situation, PVTG families depend critically on two entitlements for their survival: social security pensions and food rations from the public distribution system.Under a Supreme Court order of May 2, 2003, in the right to food case, Antyodaya ration cards are to be distributed to all PVTG households. This entitles them to 35 kgs of foodgrain per month from the PDS at a nominal price; in fact, for free in the case of Jharkhand. Among the 325 households we surveyed, 87 per cent were on the Antyodaya list. Further, Antyodaya households reported that they were receiving the bulk of their PDS entitlements: about 33 kgs per month on an average. This is good news of sorts in a state where PDS grain used to be siphoned off with abandon by corrupt dealers. Even the reduced levels of pilferage, however, are unacceptable, and a significant minority of PVTG households is still deprived of Antyodaya cards.Turning to pensions. All PVTG families in Jharkhand are entitled to a pension of Rs 600 per month  if not under an existing old-age, widow or disability pension scheme, then under the state governments special pension scheme for PVTGs. The survey, however, reveals that only two thirds of all PVTG households in the area are receiving a pension. One reason for this is that many pensions have been discontinued in recent years owing to Aadhaar-related problems. The main problem is that all pensioners in Jharkhand are now required to meet the e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) banking norms. This means that Aadhaar must be seeded in their bank account and also that the seeding must be verified through biometric authentication. In the absence of biometric facilities at the bank, pensioners have to go to a Pragya Kendra (customer service centre) for authentication, take a certificate from there to the bank, and then hope that the bank will complete the formalities in good time. Lapses, errors, glitches and delays abound. For pensioners, especially for the elderly, these hurdles are daunting. Many of them do not know what they are supposed to do or how to seek assistance if a problem arises. None of this has changed  so far  after the recent Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar.In our small sample of 325 households, 28 pensioners were currently deprived of their pension, mainly owing to Aadhaar-related problems. Another 30 or so had been temporarily deprived of their pension for several months, sometimes more than a year, at the time when they were struggling to meet the e-KYC norms. In cases of temporary discontinuation, there are no retrospective payments for the gap months after a pension is resumed.The discontinuation of pensions is just one among a long series of Aadhaar-related problems that emerged from the survey. Examples include inability to get an Aadhaar card because of blindness or deformed hands, ration cards being cancelled for lack of Aadhaar linkage, children being refused admission for lack of Aadhaar, NREGA wage payments being rejected, bank accounts being frozen for lack of e-KYC, and problems of biometric authentication at the Pragya Kendras. More than 40 per cent of the respondents had experienced problems of this sort.Aside from the pathologies of Aadhaar, PVTG families have to contend with merciless harassment from local exploiters. In Uchvabal village, a para-teacher, Krishna Ram, was caught trying to siphon off childrens scholarships. In Sewdhara, a PDS dealer, Dinesh Rai, measures food rations using a recycled tin instead of a weighing machine, pruning them to 31 kg per month instead of 35 kg. Pragya Kendra operators routinely take bribes for services, and one of them (in Namudag) tried to extort Rs 2,000 from an illiterate woman who needed help to apply for a pension. Another one, in Rewat Khurd, even siphoned off a Rs 56,000 housing subsidy from the account of an elderly widow who blindly lent her thumbprint for this purpose.These and other acts of exploitation were brought up at a public hearing held in Manika on December 13. Block-level officials, however, did their best to protect the exploiters. The block supply officer, for instance, acted like Dinesh Rais well-wisher. Hopefully, the district administration will crack the whip, but who knows, crooks often have patrons in high places.The experience of the Parhaiyas in Latehar and Palamu confirms something we have already learnt from other states: the PVTGs need special support and it is perfectly possible to help them. The existing support systems, however, are patchy and inadequate. Indeed, in spite of receiving some assistance from pensions and the PDS, the Parhaiyas continue to live in the shadow of hunger. Almost half of the respondents said that some members of the households had to sleep hungry at some point in the preceding three months, and as many as 10 per cent said that they had gone hungry many times in that period. The situation was better among households that had a ration card and a pension, but even they were not exempt from food insecurity. There is a strong case for raising pension amounts and expanding Antyodaya entitlements without delay. Strict action against those who exploit PVTGs would also help. Taking a longer view, PVTG hamlets need better public facilities, especially well-functioning schools and anganwadis. Failing that, PVTG children are unlikely to live much better than their parents when they grow up.The author is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University"

People from all over the world are here. The occasion is the 715th urs of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya , which began on Monday.For Sufis, death is the end of mortal life and union with the almighty. Urs is a celebration of that. Hazrat Nizamuddins urs began with the fateh dua (prayer), followed by a qawwali performance and langar distribution.This year, a delegation of about a hundred people has come from Pakistan to take part in the urs. Only last week, the Pakistan High Commissioner had visited the dargah to present a chaddar.Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia preached and practised the principles of humanity and brotherhood without any discrimination. That is why people irrespective of religion, caste and creed come here in large numbers. You will find that 70% of the crowd here is non-Muslim, said Syed Aziz Nizami, the sajjada nashin.Kanwal Narain Sharma (84) has been distributing tea among the devotees for the past 65 years. The desire to serve tea here every day is my hunger, Sharma said, handing out biscuits to the younger crowd. People come here when they feel troubled or face any problem. And I wholly believe in his (Nizamuddin Aulia) power to heal, Sharma said as someone standing behind him added, Badshahon ka badshah (king of kings).Syed Mohammad has come all the way from Kabul. I come every year. The whole experience brings me great inner peace, he said.There are many from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who come here every year despite difficulties. The difficulties seem worth it at the end. I visit without fail every year, said Mohammad Hasan, a driver from Bihar.At the dargah, the music of qawwali melds with voices of people lining up to receive the days langarbiryani. Nizami says the qawwals arent hired by the dargah but they all volunteer22 or 24 groups, all famous ones from all over the country. At the Urs Mahal outside, musical performances are held separately.Its chilly outside, but hot tandoors and grills cooking naans and kebabs provide some warmth.The urs celebration would continue till December 28, beginning every day at 11am. The qawwalis would continue till late into the night as would the langar and tabarruk, a kind of prasad in the form of sweet rice or gram flour chappati.The nearest metro station to reach the dargah is JLN Stadium."

He asked people if ""some people were being troubled because of a tradition of allowing the middlemen.""When the gathering responded with applause, Modi said for the prosperity of the nation, some pain has to be borne to keep middleman at bay. He also lauded the Union telecom ministry for launching a digital pension project, saying it would benefit pensioners immensely, reflecting the citizen-centric approach of his government.""This is our approach to minimum government and maximum governance,"" the Prime Minister said. People can now track the pension status on their mobile phone and don't have to made rounds of offices for pension-related issues.Referring to strides taken in different sectors under the present regime, the Prime Minister said internet connectivity had increased to 65 per cent in the past two years and India now had 50 crore active internet users. This, he said, was special because the growth of internet was equally big and significant in villages.Under his government, he said, 1.25 lakh panchayats have been connected by broadband of which 29,000 villages are in Uttar Pradesh.Purchases by government departments had been shrouded in doubts and charges of favouritism, he said, adding government's e-market place (GEM) can enable the smallest of traders to sell their products. ""This is the best platform for the MSME sector,"" Modi said.Online loans up to Rs 1 crore are now being disbursed in 59 minutes without any red-tape or exploitation, the Prime Minister said.The quality of Ganga water has considerably improved as tested by scientists. He said while schemes had been made for long, the Ganga remained polluted, but not any longer. ""Jab niyat saaf hai to Ganga bhi saaf hogi (if the intention is clear, the Ganga will be cleaner),"" he said as people applauded and raised slogans of 'Har Har Mahadev'.Talking about the industry in Varanasi and nearby areas, Modi said there were 1.5 lakh weavers and 70,000 power looms in the region, and that right from funds to facilitation in marketing their produce, the state and the Union government were working out things for the weavers. ""We will keep extending job opportunities through such schemes,"" he said.Uttar Pradesh's MSME Minister Satyadev Pachauri informed the Prime Minister that so far loans worth Rs 5345 crore had been given to 65,000 artisans in the state and that Rs 75,000 crore loans will be disbursed by banks in the state.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stones for 14 infrastructure projects and inaugurated 12 projects, totalling Rs 279 crore.Earlier Modi inaugurated the International Rice Research Institute and interacted with scientists."
