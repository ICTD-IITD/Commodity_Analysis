When the countrys per capita income growth rate is 6.1 per cent, our states rate is 12.48 per cent From agriculture to industry to infrastructure, Bengal has made rapid progress. We have set up 70 new police stations, eight coastal police stations, 19 human rights courts, 45 women police stations and 88 fast-track courts, Mamata said, while addressing the Jangalmahal Utsav in West Midnapore district.Accusing the Left Front of plunging Bengal in a state of penury, she said, For 34 years, these people did nothing yet incurred so much debt and ruined three generations of the state, and now they are talking big. What we have done in mere four and half years, many cant match that even in 400 years.The Chief Minister also attacked the Centre for deducting over Rs 1 lakh crore towards servicing debts incurred by the previous Left Front regime. With an eye on upcoming Assembly polls this year, Mamata enumerated the various social security schemes and harped on the all-round development carried out by her government.From new super specialities hospitals to sick newborn care units (SNCUs), from critical care units to mother and child hubs, from fair price medical shops to diagnostics centres, we have made a lot of infrastructural development in the field of health, Mamata said.The CM further claimed that over seven crore people in the state have been brought under food security scheme. Already 7.7 crore people have been brought under the food security scheme. Rice and wheat are being given at Rs 2 per kg, she said.Mamata countered the oppositions campaigns against her by asking them to shut up. If you can fight, then fight. If you can develop, then do it. If you can accept the challenge then do it. But if you cant, then shut up and let us carry ahead with development, the CM said.The five-day Jangalmahal Utsav would focus on tribal music, folk songs from Bengal and also showcase the handicrafts from the south Bengal tribal region. Mamata also distributed prizes for the Jangalmahal Cup in sports like football, kabaddi and archery held in West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum districts.I love coming to Jangalmahal to see your smiling faces. Talents are in plenty in this region, she said, adding there were over 42,000 participants this year for the Jangalmahal Cup and similar sports events were held in the Sundarbans as well.Mamata, who inaugurated and laid the foundation stones for a bouquet of projects in West Midnapore district, asked all participants to register their names in the employment bank. She allocated funds for the construction of a stadium here and another at Kharagpur.Referring to the steps taken in the tribal areas, she said development of the Kendu leaf collectors and insurance schemes for them have been taken up. The region has immense tourist potentials like Mukutmanipur, Ayodhya Hills and Jhargram Rajbari, the CM said and stressed the need for further development of the entire area to attract tourists.She also expressed hope that the two-day Bengal Global Business Summit, beginning from January 8 in Kolkata, would help develop the region.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

A decision was taken to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell to state fair price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from the procurement chain.This has been done by adopting the Centres scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) of foodgrain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and Public Distribution System (PDS). But not all States had switched to it.A finance department report forwarded to the State Food and Civil Supplies Department last month had pointed out major lapses in Maharashtras paddy and rice procurement and warned that a rice scam like the one that occurred in Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was in the making if the millers and the FCI were kept part of the chain any longer. All three States have still kept FCI as part of the procurement chain.Senior officials of the State finance department told The Hindu that a report has been pending approval. The report points out procedural lapses in the existing process, in which paddy procured by the State is sent to a rice mill and the rice is stored in the FCI godowns and later supplied to the PDS shops.The miller was dependent on FCI for verification while he himself was supplying poor quality to pass the verification scrutiny. We had strongly recommended the procedural lapses be corrected earliest, said an official.The State cabinet approved the DPS on Tuesday allowing the State to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers to meet the need of PDS and fair price shops. The scheme will be implemented from March 1, and the responsibility of rolling out the scheme has been left to the State Adivasi Vikas Mahamandal and the State Marketing Federation, and monitoring will be done by district authorities.Under the DCP scheme, the States undertake the responsibility to procure foodgrain, store it scientifically and distribute it through Targeted Public Distribution System.Currently, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala are procuring rice under the decentralised procurement scheme. Due to the decentralised process there has been an increase in procurement of rice in these States, the data shows. The finance departments suggestion has been included in report of the food and civic supplies departments. We have considered those points, reads the note of the cabinet."

With Uttarayan round the corner, more than 1.5 crore kites will change hands to reach retailers and then those who will fly them on January 14 and 15.""For a kite enthusiast, Uttarayan starts well before the festival -at midnight auctions across the state -and ends on January 15 when tukkals (lanterns attached to a string) are flown to bid goodbye to kites till next year,"" said Narayan Patel, a kite trader from Khambhat who supplies the toys to centres such as Ahmedabad and Vadodara.He further said that for people like him, the end of Uttaryan is actually time to begin preparations for next year's festival.""In Khambhat, we make around 25 types of kites. The cottage industry employs more than 3,000 families round the year except during monsoon,"" said Patel.It is interesting that the kite has communal harmony woven into its texture. A study conducted by Sewa found that 70% of kite-makers in 5-6 major centers in Gujarat are Muslims. The remaining 30% belong to the Scheduled Castes and the Chris tian community . However, most of the distributors and retailers are Hindus.Many of the Muslim families involved in kite-making trace their roots to north India. They came to Gujarat during the Sultanate and Mughal periods when kite-flying was considered a royal sport. And even among Muslim families involved in kite-making, it is the women who are the main artisans.Kites are woven into the history and heritage of Gujarat, so much so that they have become a symbol of the state. The annual kite festivals have attracted many tourists - both Indian and foreign- to major cities during Uttarayan. It gives Walled City residents an opportunity to rent out their terraces to tourists. Uttarayan and the kite festival have given a boost to the state's tourism industry, say experts.Even as cries of `kai po che' echo during the festival and after, enthusiasts regret lack of proper documentation of the craft of kite-making.Kirti Thakar, a kite enthusiast and former manager, fair and festivals with Gujarat tourism department, says that kite-making was given industry status but nothing was done about it except for a research report commissioned by the state government in 2003.Ahmedabad hosted india's first international kite festivalEdmund Hillary, who was the first to climb Mt Everest with Tenzing Norgay, and Barbara Carrera, a Bond girl, came to Ahmedabad to inaugurate India's first international kite festival at Shahibaug police stadium in January 1989. ""Hillary was roped in to project kite-flying as an adventure sport.Veterans such as Bhanu Shah and kitemakers Rasul and Naushad played a pivotal role in its success,"" said Kirti Thakar, kite enthusiast and a former government official.Sources of raw materialThe `tracing paper' which forms a kite's body comes from Sivakasi, Tiruppur, Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and Ramnagara in Karnataka.Bamboo, whose strips comprise its skeleton, comes from Kolkata and Assam.Kite-making in gujaratIn Ahmedabad, Behrampura, Danilimda, Gomtipur, Jamalpur, Juhapura, Khanpur, Millatnagar, Mirzapur, Rakhial, Saraspur, Shahpur and Vatva are kite-making centers. The cottage industry employs around 23,000 people. Khambhat is known for its special kites. In Mahuda, around 500 families are engaged in fixing waxed thread to the four sides of the kite to provide it stability.How kites and manja are madeCraftsmen - mostly men - choose the right paper and cut it in the desired shape.This requires expertise and experts are paid handsomely. Khambhat specializes in this art Artisans, primarily women, stick waxed thread to the sides of the kite to provide it shape and stability. Mahuda specializes in this skill Women apply `lahi' (glue and rice paste with copper sulfate) on paper and then stick the kites spine in the middle, and paper tabs on four corners. They also apply the paper triangle (pablo) to the bottom of the kite Last comes the bamboo strip bent into an arc. It provides the tension to keeps the kite in shape and allows it to fly For the manja, artisans grind glass bottles bought from the waste market into fine powder Homemade glue mixed with colour, rice paste and glass powder is applied by the `ustad' (master) to a cotton lineTraditions of khambhat and siddhpurIn most of Gujarat, kites are flown on January 14 and 15 for Uttarayan. But Khambhat and Siddhpur fly kites at different times of the year. Siddhpur flies kites on Dusshera and Khambhat on the Sunday immediately after Uttarayan. The founder of Siddhpur, Solanki ruler iddharaj Jaysinh, is believed to have died on Uttarayan. Hence the town mourns his death and doesn't fly kites on Uttarayan. In Khambhat, the new wind after Uttarayan attracts kite enthusiasts to its beach in the Gulf of Cambay.Rasool patangwalaThe Kite Museum at Sanskar Kendra in Paldi has many kites with creative designs. These are Rasool Patangwala's creations. Patangwala is something of a legend because of his sense of design and experiments. He had flown the country's first `train kite' made of 500 kites designed like a Tricolor. A native of Mathura, Rasool's legacy has been kept alive by his son, Pappubhai, who is also a noted kitist.Naushad patangwalaNaushad and his wife, Zareena, have several hundred designs to their credit. Naushad belongs to a family that has been making kites for generations. He was born in Rampur, UP, and shifted to Ahmedabad with his father five decades ago. His signature kite is `The Star,' an ancient design that does not participate in `aerial fights' but goes straight to `heaven.' Around 40 women work at his unit each season."
590593917be9e04154e002c8,"Assam’s minority report: As the state readies for polls, it would be dangerous to abuse the highly emotive ‘Bangladeshi’ card",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/assams-minority-report-as-the-state-readies-for-polls-it-would-be-dangerous-to-abuse-the-highly-emotive-bangladeshi-card/,2016-01-12,"For five hours, the body of the 15-year-old girl hung on the barbed wire fence, blood streaking her clothes in the January chill, her hair hanging down in a macabre flow. She was shot while climbing over from the Indian side in West Bengal to Bangladesh and was going for her own wedding. Her father had managed to get over unscathed but the child, whose name was Felanee did not make it. That was in 2011. That Felanee was Bangladeshi was uncontested but the killing of an unarmed child sparked a furious outcry against shootings of civilians by BSF on the international boundary.As a result of this incident, Indian border patrols were instructed not to fire live ammunition on suspected intruders (mind you, BSF failed to tackle the real infiltrators, those of armed groups who had skipped across for years, creating mayhem, until the Bangladesh government cracked down and handed over Ulfa, NDFB and Manipuri insurgent leaders to India). Nearly 1,000 persons had been killed in a 10 year period or one death every four days.Those who died included Bangladeshis and Indians, cattle rustlers, petty criminals as well as people who were shot while going about their daily business. Cattle smuggling is a major business along the border; so is human trafficking. Criminal gangs which flourish on either side of the border are unlikely to do so without official connivance.Illegal/informal migration from Bangladesh into India is substantial but there are other interlocking issues. I will focus on two here. One is the scale of the migration  most of the figures I have seen are simply assertions and analysis based on assumptions. The other is the impact that such perceptions are having not just in eastern India, especially in Assam and West Bengal, but also across the country, with antipathy growing against Muslims of Bangla origin.The latter is important especially as Assam is going to the polls in a few months. There appear to be few issues, barring the anti-incumbency factor against the Tarun Gogoi government. That is why one must be extremely careful that the highly emotive Bangladeshi card is not used as a weapon of rhetoric.As far as numbers are concerned, the truth is that decades after the Bangladeshi campaign began in the late 1970s, few have been detected and deported despite many promises. Not even the Centre has a clear idea of how many illegal migrants are in India, not just Assam. For years there has been a sense of fatigue on the issue in Assam.Thus, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi correctly chose statesmanship over local politics by settling the IndoBangladesh land boundary issue, a problem that had been unresolved for decades, he piquantly created a challenge for the Assam unit of his own party which had opposed the deal, claiming it would increase illegal migration.Such complexity is deepened by sweeping media reports which posit a future where Bangladeshi Muslims will be a majority in the state and ignore the fact that it has three major groups of Muslims: Assamese speaking Muslims whose ancestors go back to the 13th century, Muslims of Bangla origin, many of whose ancestors came over 100 years ago, and the post-1971 Bangladeshi Muslims. Indeed, this last point is also conveniently forgotten: those who moved from East Pakistan before 1971are not Bangladeshis.Also ignored is that there is a high fertility and birth rate among Muslims groups in western Assam where large families are the norm. This is a key factor in demographics  especially if one considers the fact that Assam has smaller border with Bangladesh than Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram or West Bengal!There is hostility to in-migration in Assam and the northeast. Most migrants  as the recent movement from Syria shows  seek safe havens. In addition to that, there is greater economic security as Bangladeshs economy has grown to a near middle economy, making risky out-migration less attractive.The combination of selective facts, selective memory and rhetoric can be a deadly combination as seen in 2012 after incidents in western Assam where both Bodos and Muslims were victims. Hate mongering triggered an exodus of lakhs of workers from the region, from places such as Bengaluru. Few locally there would make the distinction between a Bodo, a Naga, a Sikkimese or a Mizo. The northeast is lumped together.What happened in February 1983 should suffice as adequate warning about the vulnerability of this complex area: Over 36 years ago, Aasu launched a powerful anti-immigrant movement that brought successive state governments to their knees, stalled the economy, shut down educational institutions and markets and even blocked oil transportation; in February 1983, the central government forced an election in the state, in the teeth of opposition from Aasu and other anti-immigrant groups. In the ensuing violence, thousands were killed  no one still knows the final toll, but it is said to be well above 3,000  including Muslims of Bengali origin, members of tribal groups, Assamese and other ethnics.The worst massacre was at Nellie, which i covered as a young reporter, in which nearly 2,000 Muslim men, women and children were killed. The sight of hundreds of corpses, of infants, women, old men, huddled on dry rice fields are images which i can never forget. Those who died were certainly not Bangladeshis and had lived there for generations. Their survivors struggle futilely to get justice for the murdered and maimed."

This is a part of the three-day Damodar Mela, unique to the Santhals of Mayurbhanj district and held a day after Makar Sankranti.Over 20,000 people, including women from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, took a dip at the ghat. The tribals believe that the souls of dead persons rest in peace after their ashes are immersed in the holy confluence.Before offering 'pinda' to their forefathers, the tribals immerse the ashes and get their heads tonsured. The offerings placed on three Sal leaves include mud, toothpicks, rice and sweets.""This is a part of their annual ritual called 'Jiling Dahar' or long-term journey. The tribals chant 'Hirla Marangburu Hirla Marangburu' (We are under you) to appease their presiding deity,"" said a tribal researcher Sukadev Murmu.The Santhals also distribute articles belonging to the dead among their community people at the ghat on this day. ""We gave away my father's clothes, torchlight, umbrella, glasses and a folding bed that he used. It is our tradition and we have been following it since time immemorial,"" said Saiba Marandi.The ghat gained prominence during the rule of Pratap Chandra Bhanj Deo, the last king of the Bhanja dynasty in the erstwhile princely state of Mayurbhanj. Earlier, the Santhals used to trek all the way to Thakurbadi, a place near Gopiballavpur in West Bengal, to immerse the urns in the Subarnarekha river.""The tribe observe three rituals - Tel Nahaan, Naieta and Bhandan. Naieta is performed at Baruni Ghat,"" said secretary of Society for Research and Development of Tribal Culture Gurva Soren.The district administration had made elaborate arrangements for smooth conduct of the three-day event."
58f4fe1460de470aa339e3fa,Paddy politics: nose cut off to spite face,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160122/jsp/bengal/story_65242.jsp,2016-01-22,"Jan. 21: The Mamata Banerjee government's plan to buy 45 lakh tonnes of paddy directly from farmers to boost food security has hit a roadblock as ruling party activists have prevented farmers loyal to the Left from selling their produce. The procurement target was increased by over two fold compared to last year's target of 22 lakh tonnes as Mamata has plans to bring more people under the subsidised rice scheme when the National Food Security Act is introduced in the state on January 27. Two Nadia farmers, Sushil Ghosh and Samar Ghosh in Hanskhali block, have lodged complaints with the district authorities saying they were prevented from selling paddy on January 18 when they went to a government kisan mandi. Sources said several other farmers from other blocks in Naida also alleged that they were being prevented from selling paddy because they were CPM supporters. Under the food security act, 6.01 crore people would get subsidised rice from the Centre. The state would give cheap rice to another 1.7 crore people. Till now, a total of 3.2 crore people in Bengal used to get subsidised rice, but from January 27 the number of beneficiaries would increase to 7.7 crore. The state has to procure 45 lakh tonnes for all the beneficiaries. Senior government officials said the state needed more farmers to come up to sell their produce so that it could achieve the procurement target. ""To procure 45 lakh tonnes of paddy, you require at least 1.5 lakh farmers to sell 30 quintals of paddy each to the government.... There are lakhs of sympathisers of Left parties in rural areas. It is not possible to meet the target by bypassing those farmers,"" said a senior food department official. Jyotipriya Mallick, the food and supplies minister, said he was ""not aware of this particular case. But farmers cannot be divided based on political identity."" As the elections approach, the ruling party cannot afford to be selective in terms of reaching out to farmers. Before coming to power, Trinamul used to question the faulty BPL lists of the Left government, saying the Front was selective in giving benefits to the poor. ""It had left an impact in rural areas and was reflected in the results of 2011 polls when the Left parties lost their support base,"" said a senior state minister. ""The finance department has already sanctioned a sum of Rs 1,000 crore.... But politics at the ground level could put the entire exercise in trouble,"" said a minister. The momentum for procurement has been slow, said government sources. Reports of the food and supplies department till Wednesday showed that 12.9 lakh tonnes of paddy was bought, when the state needed to procure the maximum quantum of paddy between November and January. ""The kharif crop, harvested between October and November, produces 110 lakh tonnes of 155 lakh tonnes of total paddy grown in Bengal. If we cannot buy the maximum quantum by January, we may fall short of the target as small farmers sell off their paddy in the local market even at a cheaper rate as they have to repay loans,"" said a senior official. In Nadia's Hanskhali, farmer Sushil Ghosh said Trinamul Krishnaganj MLA Satyajit Biswas was to blame for the paddy sale block on Left-sympathiser farmers. Biswas denied the allegations, saying it was ""conspired by the CPM to malign me before the polls. I just told the officials not take rice which has dust."" He said he had told officials ""to prepare a list so that they (farmers who were turned away) could be given a fresh chance before procurement is finished."" From September last year, the government started procuring paddy across the state through the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation Limited at a rate of Rs 1,410 a quintal. If the farmer brings the paddy to a kisan mandi, he gets Rs 15 more for each quintal as the state wants to promote the rural markets for such direct sale. Sushil said when he went to the mandi with 18 quintals of paddy on January 18, some Trinamul activists did not let him enter the market. Sushil said he somehow managed to speak to the procurement officer, who told him his paddy could not be bought. Sushil, who is a CPM member in the Hanshkhali panchayat samiti, said he had taken paddy to the mandi after cleaning it. ""First of all, I was not allowed to enter. Second, none of my sacks was opened and examined. I am not a dishonest person to contaminate my rice with dust."""

We spent our evenings mostly at each others homes, comfortable in the diverse cultures and families we came from.Maya, half-Tamilian and half-American, always had that foreign touch about her! She was the best athlete in school, thanks to her long strong limbs. The downside to those were that it made her clumsy and tom-boyish! Her very short golden-brown hair and rubber-band braces didnt help either! Her bungalow was designed like the ones in the popular TV series,Beverly Hills 90210! She had a high four-poster bed, and we always hid under it with a lamp on, gossiping about the other girls in school, or giggling and blushing over a cute boy! We also spent hours staring at teen-idol posters (River Phoenix and George Michael), pasted on her wardrobe! Soon we followed the intense delicious whiff coming from her large open kitchen, where freshly baked warm apple-pie, and butter sauted sausages and corn would be waiting for us.Mona, was a flirtatious wild-child. She was slightly older than the three of us and bullied us into trying our first sip of beer and talking to the boys! We were somewhat envious of her curves, (which she developed much before us), and her Punjabi fair-skin and pretty face. I think Jaganathan has a crush on me, and maybe I will kiss him someday, she said, as we listened to her awe-struck! She was feisty and rebellious, but her eyes had a sadness that she could not hide. We would squeeze into her single bed and hold her tight, whenever she felt low, though we never knew the reason. She never told us. Hmm.Madhurika, came from a conservative Brahmin background, and everything about her reflected that. Her hair was always in a neat-long-oiled plat, that reached the back of her knees. She wore thick rimmed glasses, her skirts were pleated and came up to her calves. She looked longingly at Monas hot shorts, but never dared to ask for permission to wear them. She was simply brilliant at academics, and stood first in class year after year. Her de-stressing mechanism was to solve math problems, while we would be busy relishing hot meals (heaps of soft rice with dollops of ghee,yellow parappu-dal, and fried apalam), served on banana leaves by the staff a her home all dressed in white veshtis, with grey vibudhi powder across their foreheads! Come on, lets study, she would say enthusiastically!My half-Marwari and half-Telugu genes made for quite an interesting mix! I was an all rounder, and was surprisingly good at everything I did! A sweet, soft-spoken and sensible girl is how one could describe me. But somehow I was also confused most of the times, with many questions in my head! We would discuss these, at our favourite place, in my red-and-white tiled bungalow the terrace, where we would sit on the ledge, our legs dangling dangerously, biting into my Nanis precious besan ka ladoos, that she would send from Mumbai. This is also the place where we made a promiseof being friends for eternity.forever. Then why did we break it? We did we let our friendship fade away? Wasnt it stronger than that? Where are you girls now? I have heard bits-and -pieces from others, over the years, but is it true?Maya, you went away to America, and married a Bengali there, and you both are now living in Kolkata? Do you have kids? Mona..you became a fashion designer, and eloped with a very handsome rock star to Los Angeles? Why am I not surprised? Madhurikayou are now a double Phd, and I dont know anything more about you. Also, dont you all want to know what happened with me? Well, when I moved to Mumbai, I fell head-over-heels in love with a Punjabi, whom I eventually married and now am a mother to a tween girl and lil boy!Many years have gone by twenty-two to be precise. Why have the four of us not tried to stay in touch? Are we scared that maybe we are not the same people anymore? But how much can we change? Or have we actually forgotten each other? Can we, after all the moments we have had? Maybe we are all too busy with our own lives, building new relationships and ignoring the old ones? I guess, sometimes in life we may drift apartfar far awayyet, if we can manage to find a way back, we must. True friendship, just like true love, is rare to find, and the feelings never go away. This may sound like a clich, but it is as real as it gets.I still think of youll, my Best Friends. Maybe not everyday, but I do. So, you know what.it is never too late. I am going to find you all, whichever corner of the world you might be in! Get to know you all again. We can be there for each other, just like we used to. Maybe we need that now, even more so. At least I know I do. I am so excited to do thisto connect with youll again. But somewhere deep in my heart, I am also a little nervous, because I am hoping, Do you feel the same. An eternal flame?"
594064d97be9e024e459871f,Mamata’s masterstroke ahead of polls: foodgrain at Rs 2/kg for 80% of Bengal population,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/mamatas-masterstroke-ahead-of-polls-foodgrain-at-rs-2kg-for-80-of-bengal-population/,2016-01-28,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata BanerjeeLAUNCHING A scheme that promises to provide rice and wheat at subsidised rate to over 7 crore people, almost 80 per cent of the states population, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday slammed the opposition party for being blind to the states development.From today, 7 crore people in Bengal will receive rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg. I am thankful to the farmers of Bengal for contributing to the stock of grains required for Khadya Sathi, Mamata said after launching the scheme from Red Road.As much as 15 lakh metric tonnes of rice have already been procured, which is more than our target of 10 lakh metric tonnes. The Krishak Mandis have been instrumental in the procurement process. Out of 176 Krishak Mandis, 120-130 are already up and running. We have been providing help to the people of Singur who lost their land, the CM asserted.The much publicised Khadya Sathi scheme, which aims to ensure that 70 lakh people in the state get subsidised food and cereals at half the market price while over 7 crore people would receive 5 kg of food grain every month at Rs 2 per kg, will prove vital in the upcoming elections, TMC leaders believe.The scheme, according to government officials, targets the poor and very poor, many of whom who arent covered under the National Food Security Act.The CM took took the opportunity to attack the CPM, which, she said, has been claiming about no development in the state. They cannot see. I will ask them to open their eyes. I think either they do not want to see the progress or they are sleeping, Mamata said.I talk less and work more. I keep myself busy with work.. Do not make me open my mouth..I will give a fitting reply at the right time, she added.She also accused the central government of reducing allotments for important social programmes like integrated child development services. The Centre can stop them but we cannot stop the benefits being extended to the people of our state. It is our responsibility towards the people, we cannot step back on that promise and commitment.Mamata was quick to point out that the seven crore people who would benefit from the scheme included those communities that the opposition claims have been found wanting  those living in the Jangalmahal region, malnourished tea garden workers and their families, people of Singur who lost their land to acquisition and other homeless in the state.They have been suffering for a long time We have announced a Rs 100 crore package for them. Family of a worker of a closed garden will get Rs 1,500 and rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg, she said. The farmers of Singur would continue to get a monthly allowance from the state government till the court takes a call on the return of their land, the CM said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
58f4d22e60de470aa339c360,Gift Pack,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160204/jsp/opinion/story_67296.jsp,2016-02-04,"Recently, the state education minister declared that shoes would be distributed free of cost among students studying at the primary level in government schools of West Bengal. Reportedly, the chief minister had been so ""touched"" on finding barefoot children in a primary school that she immediately advised the education department to provide them with shoes. Later, the education minister said that this scheme is being undertaken to attract more students to school. This is a touching gesture, no doubt, although one wonders why the chief minister had not noticed the lack before, or happened to notice it in this particular year of the assembly elections. Besides, it is not just primary students who often go without shoes. In the rural and semi-urban areas of the state, the sight of older children walking barefoot to school is fairly common. (If their feet are shod at all, it would usually be with torn slippers or with ""kito"", the cheap, locally-made sandals that are famous for giving blisters.) However, given the way malnutrition impedes the growth of children in poorer families - a reality brought to the fore by the recent National Family Health Survey, which shows that 34 per cent of children under five years are stunted in the rural areas of West Bengal - Mamata Banerjee could easily have mistaken some secondary-level students as primary-level children. A teacher who works at a government school in Gosaba said that she felt as if she was holding a bird when she had to pick up and carry a Class-VII student who had fainted in the classroom. That child had fainted out of hunger. Her breakfast had consisted of a cup of tea with a single biscuit while the previous night's dinner had been a bowl of muri. With the midday meal, slated at 2 pm, still a long way to go, the child had slumped in her seat in the middle of the first half before the lunch break. Incidentally, this child had no warm clothes on even in these wintry days. Perhaps Banerjee should visit some of these rural schools and announce a scheme to distribute free cardigans. It is not that the state government's plans of luring students to school by giving them anything from free textbooks to cycles or shoes is not working. The cycles, for example, are sure to increase attendance although many students are selling off their gift cycles because they are defective. As for the shoes, one doubts how long they will serve their purpose since, in all probability, they, too, will be of poor quality. Most of Banerjee's plans to improve the condition of students skim the surface while the real problems continue to roil in the depths. There is no point in cladding children's feet in shoes if they continue to remain half-clad above the feet, go hungry to school and cannot do well in studies because of impaired cognitive skills resulting from malnutrition. The anganwadi system, meant to provide pre-school education, nutrition and basic healthcare to children till the age of six, is run in a perfunctory manner in most of the rural areas of Bengal. At such a centre in the interiors of Howrah, I found the children showing little or no interest in the khichdi, which is their daily fare. There have been several complaints that the daal and the rice used in the khichdi are substandard. The cooks complain that they cannot make the meals tastier because the allotment amount for ingredients such as oil and spices is meagre and fixed. According to the latest NFHS, 53.7 per cent of the children under five years in Bengal are anaemic. If Banerjee really cares about the poorer children in her state, she can start by making the anganwadi system more efficient. The process of learning will get easier for children once their health gets better. Gifts of shoes or cycles may or may not give Banerjee success in the elections but it certainly cannot do the children any real good."

On Monday, a 72-year-old woman was injured in Howrah's Amta following clash over distribution of digital ration cards.She expressed unhappiness with food officials for lapses in the digital switchover during a meeting at Nabbana on Monday and later declared that the old ration cards will continue.Mamata categorically stated that some CPM workers were trying to create trouble ('CPM er kichu lok dushtumi korche'). ""Ration dealers owing allegiance to CPM are doing mischief with political motive and some people are supporting them,"" she said. She also said she could have used harsher words, but instead she is polite. According to her, some CPM-controlled panchayats are distributing cards selectively triggering trouble. ""I will not allow any disruption in the rationing system, I am taking this as a challenge. The problem will be solved in a week.""She said, ""Those without new digital ration cards can still continue with old cards. Mistakes in the digital cards will be rectified. Those who have changed address, will also get ration. Those who have any kind of address proof should apply for ration card or for Antadaya card.""Bengal government has started providing rice and wheat to 7.5 crore people at Rs 2 per kg under 'Antodaya' project and each family will get 15 kg rice and 20kg wheat per month. The chief minister said that those who have not applied for 'Antodaya, project can still enrol. Bengal government was providing another 50 lakh people with rice and wheat at half the market price. 'Those who failed to take ration can do it within two months, as often people stay out of home.""The government plans to provide rice and wheat at Rs 2 to the entire state population of 9.25 crore. She said ""There will be no discrimination in case of ration-card distribution, all from CPM, Congress and BJP will get ration cards.""She also urged the Centre to continue with the customs waiver on life-saving drugs, otherwise how will they survive. ""We ask the Centre to rethink, as over 80% of the population will be affected. Mostly patients suffering from diabetes, kidney problem and cancer will be worse affected, even chemo therapy will be dearer."""

It is a relatively new oil and we want to create this new category for consumers, he said .Emamis rice bran oil is priced at Rs 90 per litre, which is Rs 2-3 higher than the average price of sunflower oils in the market.Our challenge lies in converting sunflower oil consumers, which is the biggest market segment here, to rice bran oil consumers. We plan sampling sessions across the state and hope to cover at least 20 per cent market share of the households in Karnataka by the end of this year, he said.The company has allocated a marketing budget of Rs 15 crore in Karnataka for this year. We believe that a market share of 20 per cent of the sunflower oil market here, by this year-end, will be good enough momentum for us, he added.Within six months of launch, Emami has been able to capture 50 per cent of the rice bran oil market in West Bengal, claims Agarwal. The success of Karnataka will determine further expansion for the company, he posits."

The meeting took place at the State Secretariat.The development comes after a number of issues cropped up regarding the implementation of the governments related initiative including delay in the issuing of digital ration cards and confusion among beneficiaries about the procedure.The issue of many deserving candidates being left out of the State and Central governments new list regarding food security has sparked protests in various parts of the State. The protests often turned violent as in some cases ration dealers were assaulted by the agitators.With the Opposition parties targeting the State Government over the issue, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked them not to politicise the matter. She alleged that ration dealers backed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were creating problems.During the day, State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused the Chief Minister of complicating the process of ensuring food security by trying project a Central scheme as her own.Meanwhile Paschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity, an organisation working for landless peasants, has pointed out that in implementing the National Food Security Act, the State Government was already spent Rs.1,930 crore.In a press statement issued during the day, the Samity said: It (State Government) has now plans to spend another Rs.2,300 crore to provide everyone under the NFSA with Rs.2 rice and for the two State schemes.Welcoming the decision, they urged the government to ensure adequate funds, infrastructure and smooth administrative functioning in this regard.Many deserving candidates have been allegedly left out of the list of beneficiaries"

(Express Photo) Former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during a CPM rally in Barrackpore on Thursday. (Express Photo)Pitching once again for an alliance with Congress in the coming Assembly elections in West Bengal, senior CPM leader and former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday said people want such a tie-up to oust the ruling Trinamool Congress.Everyone is talking about a tie-up. You need to understand why people are talking about the alliance. The priority at the moment is to get rid of the TMC from here and thus, individuals and political parties should come together for that, said Bhattacharjee while addressing a party rally in Barrackpore in North-24 Parganas district.There can be differences in political ideologies but that should take a backseat at the moment. There is a single-point agenda, which is to defeat TMC, he added.This is the second time that the former chief minister has openly spoken in favour of an alliance. The first time was in January in a rally in Singur.Senior CPM leader Gautam Deb, too, asserted that an alliance with the Congress was imminent. We will go to Delhi and a decision would be taken there. The Trinamool has to be taught a lesson, Deb said.Lashing out at the Mamata Banerjee-led government, Bhattacharjee said the TMC had driven out existing industries from the state and prevented new ones to come. Two software giants  Infosys and Wipro  had tried to set up their units here, providing employment to at least 10,000 persons. It didnt happen because of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. When she was the rail minister, she had announced big ambitious projects at Sankrail, Dankuni and Kanchrapara. Foundation stones for all those projects were laid but none of those took off, Bhattacharjee said.Alleging that the state has gone backwards in terms of industrialisation in the last four-and-a-half years, the former CM said, We wanted to bring in heavy industries such as steel, automobiles and petrochemicals, but Mamata says industries of puffed rice and fritters should be set up here. The state is going backwards.He said the TMC government has destroyed the health care, education system in Bengal. Where are the super-speciality hospitals that she claims that the present government has put up? No new colleges and universities have come up. All she is doing is painting the flyovers and structures put up by us, into blue and white, Bhattacharjee said.Alleging indifference of the state government towards the plight of closed tea garden workers in North Bengal, the Politburo member said, Currently, we are witnessing that tea gardens are being shut one after the other leading to starvation deaths almost every day.

59419c9a7be9e0192d33ab40,I finally saw why running makes my daughter so happy: Parents of sprinter Dutee Chand,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/south-asian-games-guwahati-parents-of-sprinter-dutee-chand/,2016-02-13,"Dutee with her parents and sister. (Express photo) Dutee with her parents and sister. (Express photo)Standing next to each other at one end of the Indira Gandhi Athletics Stadium in Sarusajai were two cotton weavers, a mother and a father, modestly dressed, wearing chappals and looking lost. They had travelled all the way to the outskirts of Guwahati from Chaka Gopalpur, a village in Odishas Jajpur, to witness  for the first time  what their daughter Dutee Chand did for a living.The train journey from Bhubaneswar to Kolkata and onward to Guwahati marked the first time Chakradar and Akkaji, who earn less than Rs 500 a week, had travelled beyond the state capital. They carried with them, in a jhola, home-made rice cakes, Dutees favourite food, and prasad from a temple in their village.The stadium with floodlights, the announcers booming voice blaring through the speakers, stands teeming with spectators and a large number of security personnel made them uneasy until they saw in the distance the familiar figure of Dutee, at the starting blocks for the 200 metres final.Dutee would have been tense, too. The presence of her parents at the venue must have been reassuring. The ongoing South Asian Games was her first international event after the ban that kept her away from track for close to a year.It was a traumatic period for the confused sprinter. More so, because the athletics world, committed to providing a level-playing field, wasnt sensitive to such cases. But Dutee didnt give up until the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) declared void the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) guidelines that debar athletes with hyperandrogenism  deemed excessive but naturally occurring testosterone  from competing in the female category. For the weaver couple from Jajpur, the issue was too complex to understand. Now, watching their daughter on the starting block, they knew the nightmare was over.When the fans cheered as Dutee and her statemate Srabani Nanda, the winner of the race, crossed the finish line ahead of Sri Lankas Rumeshika Ratnayake, Akkaji held her husbands hand as tears of joy rolled down her face.Saraswati Chand, Dutees older sister who accompanied her old parents to Guwahati, says she had to hold back her tears as the family embraced Dutee after the race.Dutee experienced similar emotions. It was a heart-warming moment for the family. My parents had never seen me participate in a competition, even at the state level. I won a silver and bronze (100 metres) but knowing that they were at the stadium makes me feel like I won gold, said Dutee.Saraswati, a former athlete, took the decision to bring her parents to Guwahati. After Dutee made a comeback after her ban was overturned, my parents wanted to watch her in at least one race. I decided to bring them for the South Asian Games because it is a rare opportunity for them to see Dutee run against international athletes, she said.Akkaji and Chakradar had seen pictures in newspapers of Dutee with medals hanging around her neck and had been invited to felicitation functions in Bhubaneswar. The closest they got to seeing their daughter run was when she would dart across the banks for the Brahmani river as a young girl.A day after watching Dutee live, Akkaji recalls the hurtful questions the family had to face. I could not understand why Dutee was disallowed from running with other females. It was a huge relief when she was allowed to run again. For the first time during this visit to Guwahati, I saw why running makes my daughter so happy, said Akkaji.Before heading to the stadium, the family which stayed at a city hotel, went to the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati and prayed for Dutee to win a medal.Now, I can tell everyone in our village that I have seen Dutee run. The whole world was talking about Dutee and as her parents it was our dream to watch her run. I never imagined she could run so fast, said Akkaji.On Friday morning, Dutees parents and sister took a train back to Kolkata from where they will board another one to Bhubaneswar. Dutee was on a plane to New Delhi with the Indian athletics contingent. As the family headed in different directions from the South Asian Games, they knew they would never forget the floodlit evening in Guwahati.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)Parveen Khatoon has the power of invisibility.Inside the 1.30 pm Krishnanagar local from Sealdah, in a train full of dozing college students, domestic helps and suburban housewives out on shopping trips, no one has time for a 12-year-old gaunt girl begging for alms. Her pink panda t-shirt, her tight braid, her flower-printed harem pants, everything blends with the background. All that remains is a voice. Loud, high-pitched and melancholic: Garibon ki suno, woh tumhari sunega, tum ek paisa doge, woh dus lakh dega (If you listen to the pleas of the poor, God will listen to your prayers, you give us one paisa, He will give you 10 lakh rupees). The begging anthem of the country is Parveens fallback song. People look up, coins change hands. It always works, says Parveen, adjusting a sound box around her neck. The box is her only paraphernalia, a radio-like contraption with a speaker. It has about 30 songs in it. I play it for added effect while I sing, says Parveen.Last week, a 13-year-old girl fell off a Dhanbad-Jhargram passenger train in Jamshedpur district, sustaining injuries on her face and hand. While some reports said the girl, who begged for alms by singing in trains, had been thrown off by men who were teasing her, others said she fell while trying to get off the moving train.That girl could have been Parveen. But she dismisses any hint of concern by flexing her non-existent, little-girl muscles. Nothing like this would ever happen to me. I am strong, she says.Her mother, Neelam Begum, 37, however, fears the worst. Everyday, I am worried that I might hear bad news  that she has fallen off a train or that someone did something bad to her. But what can I do? I cant accompany her since I have to go out for work, she says.She is also afraid of Parveen falling into bad company. A lot of these children get into the habit of sniffing Dendrite (an adhesive), says Neelam, who works as a domestic help and earns about Rs 3,000 a month.The family of six  Neelam, her four daughters and a granddaughter  lives in Moulali, a slum in central Kolkata. Her husband deserted them years ago, says Neelam.Platform No. 4 of Dum Dum station is Parveens base for the day. Dum Dum is an arterial station in the citys rail network, connecting Kolkatas suburban trains with its underground rail network.Sprawled on the floor at one end of the platform are Parveens aunt Khaleda, 35, sister Shama, 14, and niece Noor, 7. They are eating their lunch  rice and potato curry  straight out of a tiffin carrier.I wake up at 5.30 in the morning and help my sister cook lunch before I leave for school at 6.30, says Parveen. Her school is a special one run by the Missionaries of Charity at Joragirja, a five-minute walk from her house. We have classes till 10.30, after which I run home to collect my music box and then head to Sealdah station, says Parveen. Her sister, niece and aunt join her soon after.There are about 20 beggar-singers at Dum Dum station alone, says Khaleda, Parveens aunt. They start their day at about noon. We usually dont board trains during the peak office-hour rush. No one has time for beggars then, says Parveen.Its 3 pm now and Dum Dum station wears a deserted look. Parveen is waiting for the 15.05 Habra-Sealdah train. This time, little Noor, all of seven, will accompany her. I started this business when I was seven too. There are six people at home and we all contribute, says Parveen, clutching Noors hand tightly as she starts moving towards the approaching train. During this time of the day, there are mainly college students. They like romantic numbers, she adds, pointing to a young couple engaged in an animated conversation at one end of the train.Parveen announces her presence by breaking into the 1992 Nadeem-Shravan melody from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor: Milne ki tum koshish karna, waada kabhi na karna (Make an effort to meet me, but never make a promise). The young woman looks up and blushes. The man hands Noor a Rs 10 note. Mission accomplished.On good days, we make about Rs 150, on normal days, Rs 100, says Parveen, counting her coins at Sealdah station. Its 3.30 pm and even the ever-buzzing Sealdah station is relatively quiet.Parveen has about 100 songs in her repertoire, from Hindi film classics to Bengali devotional songs. Most of the Bollywood hits are from the 1950s-60s and Nadeem- Shravan melodies from the 1990s.I love the song Tu meri zindagi hai from Aashiqui and also songs from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor, says Parveen. She strategically keeps patriotic numbers such as Ae mere watan ke logon for special occasions such as Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti and Netajis birthday. We also sing patriotic songs when there is an important cricket match, smiles Parveen.At the station, Parveen points to a group of teenagers engaged in an animated discussion. They are Sealdah beggars, we try not to encroach into their territory. We have one route, they have another. But things do get ugly at times, she says, pointing to a scar on her arm.Parveen takes the Sealdah-Dum Dum route about eight times a day. The journey of about 20 minutes each way never really wears her off, she says. What does tire her is the regular harassment by the hawkers association and the occasional threats of the Railway Protection Force.Ticket-checkers never bother us. Even the police just come and shoo us away a few times a year, but hawkers shower us with abuses ever time we walk past them. They say we shouldnt be begging here, that we are creating a nuisance, that we will be run over by a train someday, says Parveen.Sukumar Das, working president of the Dum Dum Station Hawkers Union, says, These children have no idea of the danger they are in. They rush from one platform to the other. They run on tracks. They get into crowded trains. An accident is waiting to happen. They are chased away by the RPF every few months, but they return after a few days, says Das.What else are we supposed to do? asks Parveen as she walks up to another Dum Dum-bound train  for the third time in the day.Its 6 pm and Dum Dum station is abuzz with office crowd. They are the stingiest. Even if they ever give you something, its not more than a rupee, says Parveen.Little Noor and Parveen are about to make the last trip of the day. Back home, there is dinner to be made, tuitions to be attended, homework to be finished and and episode of Sath Nibahana Sathiya to be caught. The 18.07 Bongaon local enters the platform. A surge of humanity rushes towards the train. Parveen grabs Noors hand and disappears into the crowd.Parveen Khatoon is invisible.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
591f436c7be9e025f04e59b6,"Had they said we’re not implicating CM but he has moral responsibility, I’d be in a fix: Oommen Chandy",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kerala-solar-scam-oommen-chandy-saritha-nairkerala-udf/,2016-02-15,"Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy (Source: Express file photo by Ravi Kanojia) Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy (Source: Express file photo by Ravi Kanojia)You have presented a budget that leans heavily towards welfare initiatives, with focus on development. Is it a populist budget on the eve of the elections?It is true that the election is round the corner, but this budget is a continuation of the five presented by former finance minister K M Mani. The mantra of the UDF government has been development and care. There should be development, but with a human face There is a section of the population that needs special, urgent care. They cannot wait for the fruits of development to reach them.Which are these sections?We have prioritised. Those who are mentally retarded, those suffering from cerebral palsy, autism etc they need special attention. We have given huge priority to the health sector. The issue Kerala is facing today is not hunger but access to affordable health-care. Kerala has the best medical treatment but it is not affordable to all The plight of women deserted by their husbands is really sad. We have announced pension for them and free education for their children.What will be your USP for the elections?Kerala has lagged in development The last five years have seen an infrastructure growth like never before. Three major projects  Vizhinjam port, Kochi Metro and airport in Kannur  have taken off. We are building 100 bridges in 400 days. The decision to shut down bars has made a qualitative change in society, flow of liquor mafia money has come down. Suicides have come down, there is a decrease in crime It was my government that started promoting start-ups. It has drawn up a start-up policy We decided to offer 25 kg free rice a month to BPL families, which will benefit 90 lakh people.How confident are you about the polls?We have been winning elections despite all these allegations. When we came to power we only had a majority of two MLAs and many thought we would not complete six months, but we are completing five years. During these five years, I have ensured my government has not functioned like a government that does not have a huge majority For instance, before the bar scandal came up, there was speculation about K M Mani, that he may leave the UDF, but I was sure nothing would happen.But have the controversies affected the image of the party and the government?The people of Kerala know the truth. What are they (opposition) raking up? Biju Radhakrishnan (main accused in the solar scam), who was accused of murdering his wife, was walking free when the LDF was in power. When we came to power, we appointed a team and a special prosecutor. Radhakrishnan had only been charged with sections relating to atrocities on women, but we added the charge of murder and today he is behind bars, awarded a life sentence. It is natural that he would turn against the government and me. There was an allegation that the Left offered Rs 10 crore to that woman (Saritha Nair) but we never attacked the CPM with that because we know we should not trust the claims of a woman who is facing 33 cases But the CPM is doing that because they have nothing else to say.What about your personal image? After K Karunakaran, no other chief minister has faced such personal allegations.K Karunakaran has nothing to do with the spy case. This controversy will in effect only benefit me because the people understand who are levelling these allegations and what their motive is. Look at the bar case. Many had advised us not to shut down bars, we did not care. A section of them said they would bring down my government, but did not succeed. They went to court, but did not get a favourable verdict. A section of them have lost their mental balanceDo you regret taking that decision?I have no regrets and my government will not go back I would not have the strength to fight if there was even one per cent truth in these allegations. I have been crucified for doing a good thing. They are trying to directly implicate me as an accused in all these cases had they said we are not implicating the chief minister directly but he has a moral responsibility, I would have been in a fix.But dont you have a moral responsibility?They (opposition) are not saying that.I am asking.Let that be. They are saying I am responsible, which I cannot accept because I am innocent. And that gives me more strength, the strength of conscience to fight back.Why didnt you file a defamation case over Sarithas claims?Who should I file against? A person who has been sentenced to life imprisonment or a person who is facing 33 cases? My son will file a case. I have appointed a commission. Let the commission decide.Had you resigned when the allegation first came up, do you think the controversy would not have come to this stage and your family could have been spared?These are baseless allegations. I had appointed the commission on their demand. But the CPM did not join, they dont even have a chit of paper as evidence against me. When the commission called them, they merely reiterated the allegations they had levelled in the assembly. I dare them to prove three things  whether the exchequer has lost even a rupee, whether the government has given any benefit to them, and whether there was an laxity in fighting the casesBut the Opposition says Saritha benefited because of your meetings with her. She advertised her so-called proximity with you to collect funds.V S Achuthanandan and (former minister) A K Balan advertised them first. They (Team Solar) sponsored their programme, attended by Achuthanandan and Balan in 2010. Kairali (CPMs news channel) interviewed him as the MD of a big company. They (LDF government) did not pursue a single case against them They were arrested but the government intervened and said these are civil cases and protected them. They (the accused) used the names of Narendra Modi, P Chidambaram and Farooq Abdullah. They say they have given me Rs 1.90 crore but could not even get a letter from my office. They forged my letterhead and they have been sentenced for that forgery.Sreedharan Nair, the complainant in the case, said he gave her money after he and Saritha met with you.Lets examine that. He entered into an agreement and gave three cheques. He came to meet me after two of those had been encashed, only the third cheque was enchased after he met me. This is a big fraud. I appeared before the commission and completed my testimony in two hours. After that I said I was ready to sit there and face all cross questions. I sat there for 14 hours.. Radhakrishnans advocate asked me cross questions, but not even a single question was asked by that womans lawyer. She had raised serious allegations and that was the platform to ask questions, but they didnt.The Opposition talks about inconsistencies in your statements about your meeting with her.I never said I havent met her. My office is always full of people. She may have come to give a representation When Radhakrishnan came to complain about her, I couldnt place her. He reminded me that they had come to give a representation. The controversy began when it came to light that two or three people in my office used to talk to her over phone. I ordered an inquiry and those three people were asked to stay away He (Radhakrishnan) spoke to me about his family matters.These allegations against you and leaders close to you, have anything to do with internal Congress politics?Nothing. The Congress is united, the UDF is united. This is a trick of a demoralised CPM.Will you be the face of Congress in the elections?I cannot say. The Congress never decides chief ministers in advance. The party leadership will decide.But you will contest?I cannot say that. The party will decide. There is no fighting in the Congress on those matters like there is in the CPM.What is your view on a possible alliance with the CPM in West Bengal?We are not opposing anything, whatever the stand in Bengal, because we have complete confidence that we will retain power in Kerala. We dont fear that an alliance in Bengal would help the BJP or the CPM here Let the high command and the Bengal unit decide.How do you see the style of functioning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?I have difference of opinion with many of the decisions taken by Modi. The most important is scrapping the well-established, well-accepted Planning Commission without putting in place an alternative mechanism. It was a short-sighted and wrong decision. Besides, the BJP used to speak a lot about price rise. During UPA there was a huge surge in prices of crude oil in the international market. Prices have come down by a third, but the benefit has not been passed on to the people. We have passed on the benefit. We told the state road transport corporation to slash fares by a rupee. We will tell private bus operators to follow suit.Rahul Gandhi has said only the Congress can defeat the Congress. Will factionalism cost the party?I agree with him. If the Congress remains united and the UDF remain united, the people of Kerala will remain with us. We will return to power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Opposition councillors were united in sending out a message that it was a desperate bid to win over the city's slumdwellers.The confrontation between the ruling and opposition councillors was set as soon as Congress councillor Prakash Upadhyay raised the issue in the KMC monthly meeting. Upadhyay alleged the Trinamool-run civic board announced the scheme without proper infrastructure. ""Every day, we are being harassed by the poor people who want digitized ration cards which will let them get rice at a special rate from ration shops. But neither the shop owners nor opposition councillors know how to oblige them,"" he said. CPM's Mrintunjay Chakraborty said though there were 59 lakh ration card-holders in Kolkata, only 16 lakh have received digitized cards. ""Rest are in the dark ,"" he said.Recating to this, mayor Sovan Chatterjee hinted at a tacit tie-up between the Left and the Congress. ""The opposition councillors have united just for the sake of opposing us. I see an informal alliance between the CPM and Congress as part of a well-devised plan to thwart our attempt to bring all BPL under the scheme of poor families getting rice at Rs 2/kg,"" Despite some initial hardships we are committed to carry on with the scheme and reach the fruits of the scheme to every household which is eligible for it,"" he said."

Sharma also said, ""Electronic data exchange (EDI) is necessary especially for working with copy documents and automation of documents is very important.""He said that there is a need to push Indian commerce department for an early start and set the procedure fast by incorporating VPT in the transit and rail service agreements. ""The Nepal government should establish a liaison office to facilitate trade at Visakhapatnam as Kolkata consulate general's office is too far for the port. It is necessary that the VPT and the stake holders, both government and private, visit Kathmandu and conduct a event to educate on the facilities, equipment, technology and procedures with approximate cost factors to the trade.""Speaking about the facilities required for the Nepalese traders, he said, ""We just want timely information on vessel arrivals, the procedure, time and cost must be appropriate. The liners must coordinate well with port and CFS operators and the train service providers like CONCOR. Due to better culture of the South people we are hopeful that we will get better service. The VPT must have a good understanding with shipping liver for free time to avoid detention and demurrage charges and deposit of containers to CONCOR at Nepalese ICD would further enhance the service and increase the volume.""The cargo to Nepal through India's ports include imports of clothes, electronic shipments for household use, machineries, vehicles and industrial raw materials. Also, cargo such as bulk and break bulk cargo, fertilisers and rice imports are also routed to Nepal through the Kolkata Port until now. Currently, around 700 containers make their way to Nepal from the Kolkata Port every week.He said that Nepal was provided only one port of Kolkata/ Haldia for Nepal cargo and it was felt that having an additional port would provide ""the feel good factor"" for Nepalese in case any disruption in Kolkata port like the natural calamities related to sea happens, strike or port fails to operate.Referring to issues that need to be resolved, he said, ""The cost of doing business like the CFS charges, clearing agents fees and detention charges of liners for Nepalese cargo is too high. The procedure is also lengthy and takes four to five days to clear cargo after vessel arrives. Due to bad coordination between port, CONCOR and the railways the turnaround time from the shipment arrival date to deposits of empty to shipping line yard is even today taking 32 to 35 days.""VPT chairman MT Krishna Babu said, ""We are now inviting a trade delegation of about 20-25 people to visit Vizag and see the facilities available here. We have higher draft and the deputy chairman of VPT is coordinating with railways for easy connectivity. Once they let us know of any further requirements, we will extend the required cooperation for cargo movement through VPT."""

58f524af7be9e01a3579a5d8,Singur no longer Mamata Banerjee's priority,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Singur-no-longer-Mamata-Banerjees-priority/articleshow/51163665.cms,2016-02-27,"KOLKATA: The irony couldn't have been starker. Singur, that propelled Mamata Banerjee to power five years ago, isn't her priority anymore.With just a month to go for the polls, the chief minister washed her hands of the issue on Friday saying, ""I have done my bit for Singur. We have enacted the law to return land to unwilling farmers. Now it is in court. If the court takes five years or 50 years to adjudicate we are helpless."" She was speaking in the assembly, which is meeting for the last time before polls.One of Mamata's first decisions after coming to power in 2011 was to promulgate an ordinance to acquire 400 acres of the 1,000-acre Nano factory land from the Tatas to return it to unwilling farmers. But the decision ran into legal hurdles. The case has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2012. The state had moved the apex court after the Calcutta high court in June 2012 struck down the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011, as unconstitutional. Unable to immediately re turn land to the Singur farmers, the CM even pro mised a Metro coach factory at the Nano factory site when her party was in charge of the railway ministry . That did not materialise either. She then tried to keep small farmers and landless labourers happy by shelling out a monthly dole of Rs 1,000 and 2 kg rice at Rs 2kg to families that didn't accept the compensation cheques.On Friday, the chief minister even buried hopes of an out-of-court settlement between her government and Tata Motors, a proposal that gained currency while the case remained pending in the Supreme Court. In fact, the legal counsel for Tata Motors had floated the proposal in public interest after the state lost the case in Calcutta high court.It is not without reason that former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee kicked off the party's poll campaign from Singur, where a large section of farmers are now left without land or money .Bhattacharjee promised to set up industries in Singur once the Trinamool government is voted out of power."
5904d4607be9e04154dfc758,Love in times of lust in the brothels,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/priyanka-dasgupta-blog/love-in-times-of-lust-in-the-brothels/,2016-03-05,"When dusk settles and the streetlights begin to glow, Munshigunge changes its character. Men, mostly taxi drivers, park their vehicles by the road. Then, depending on their mood and preferences, they disappear into the pigeon-hole sized rooms with their squeeze for the night. The going rates now is Rs 200 per shot.On a good day, a young girl can earn Rs 2000.But such good days are rare. When lust comes for a price, babus turn misers. Some just come, haggle over prices, force themselves on to the girls and then leave without paying the fixed amount. The girls are left behind to deal with a sinking feeling of depression and a gnawing sense of emptiness. With each passing day, they realise how crippled their lives have become and how their fate has been helplessly trapped between their legs!Yet, love happens. Or so they say. Every time a buyer leaves and they scrub their bodies hard to get rid of the stench of exploitation, they secretly dream of leaving the dhanda. Even as they shout aloud that love doesnt exist, deep down they believe otherwise. In privacy, some of the greatest cynics there still hope that men in shining armour will come, if not on a horseback but at least on a cycle, to rescue them.At night when they hit the bed, their dreams comprise montage shots of life in wedded bliss and happiness in domesticity.Each time they get betrayed in love and promise never to tread that path, they also know it is a trap they wont be able to escape for too long.Love is an eternal quest in the red light areas. A mirage of sorts that everyone is chasing. An illusion that curiously gives hope and a sense of meaning for those being forced to sell their all for a price.***On a March afternoon, I walk down Munshigunge with Noor Biwi (name changed) in tow. Noor, now in her 50s, was sold to the brothel when she was only 12. For three months, she was kept confined to a room. Then, a day came when she was readied for her first buyer!I was there in the brothel for a year, she says. Today, she still has friends there. Some girls call her maa. Some imagine that they too can manage to run away from the brothel and settle down the way Noor had decades ago. Others look up to her when she takes a stroll in the bylanes at night trying to ensure that no new girl is trafficked.Noors story, in some ways, comes very close to that of empowerment.As we walk down the road, I ask Noor if she has experienced love.You must be kidding, she flaunts a toothless grin while saying so.The afternoon sun kisses her bare shoulder as she walks in front of me. A few steps ahead, she turns right.A second is all it takes to understand that this is the place where the Noors of the world have been getting sold off in Munshigunge.***A fair-complexioned girl, with tattoos on her arms, reclines on the pavement. Carelessly, she blows rings of smoke into the air. Her cigarette is precariously balanced between her middle and ring finger. At a short distance stands another young girl.Short skirt. Black boots. Crimson lipstick.She stands against the wall, chest heaving seductively and one hand on her left hip. The other browses through her smartphone.Noor doesnt personally know these girls. She is of a different generation. But she knows the others inside. Those, who have been living in the brothel for 20 years now. There is a sense of camaraderie with these girls. A bond of love and care. She doesnt need to knock on the door to enter the 10 ft by 10 ft room that has been home to Razia Biwi (name changed). The paint on the parrot green walls needs a fresh coat. The bed  the paradise for her clients  occupies seventy per cent of the floor space. It is strategically lifted slightly higher than the usual height to make space for a storeroom underneath. Perched on the wall is a television set where Razia has long been entertained by popular soaps like Balika Badhu. That is, when her clients dont pay her to entertain them.***It has been six years since Razia stopped getting clients on a regular basis. She now has a fixed babu who comes twice a week. She insists that I climb up the bed and sit there while she shares her lifes tales.There is a smell of domesticity in the room. Unlike Sonagachhi, nobody here has to share a room with another girl and solicit buyers behind drawn curtains.Privacy is important.Or so, they would like to believe.Its difficult to guess Razias age. She could be in her mid-40s. Or perhaps, late 50s too. Considering the background, its surprising to see her flatteringly decked in gold jewellery. Or may be, gold-plated ones. But whatever the metal, they manage to give an impression of a woman who is taken care of. I have a son who is in his teens! Razia says.Seated on her floor is Asma (name changed). Her 20-year-old son died last year. It was a normal death. Three years ago, my husband died, she explains while I was left wondering how death of a teenager can be normal.Pangs of bereavement dont show on Asmas face. Perhaps, her weathered life doesnt offer the luxury of showing her wounds in public. Asma squats on the floor with a big plate of puffed rice on her lap.Razia is little embarrassed when I ask her about romance. I got married and was sold to a brothel by my husband. Every male member in his family used to get married to girls regularly and then sell them off to brothels. That was their family profession! Do you expect me to believe in love? she asks.Difficult question. But Asma comes to rescue and before Razia can stone-wall the questions, she reminds how the latter had indeed fallen in love with a garage mechanic.Razia blushes. Her face takes on a purple tinge as she goes back in time. He used to work in a garage. I was a line girl. Our eyes met one day when I was sitting by the window and he was standing outside on the road. We would exchange glances. Thats how it all started she says.Razia had just managed to escape her husbands torture then. Her husband, who married her from Kumilya in Bangladesh before bringing her to Kolkata, had lied to her family about his profession. He had told them that he had a utensils shop in the city. Razia, for all practical purposes, could never reveal the truth for the fear of becoming an outcast. The first day he told me to sell my body, I grabbed my husband by the collar and threatened to expose him in my village. But he overpowered me.For five years, he never took me back home. Even when my mother died, he didnt break the news to me. He would insist that I take on a dozen customer every day. There were no timings. I was supposed to entertain anyone and everyone. Back then, they would pay Rs 20 per shot, she says.Razia couldnt keep a single penny on her. Almost on every night after I had solicited buyers, my husband would force himself on me. He would then make me stand against a wall and draw a rectangular box. Then, he would get drunk and start beating me up. The instruction was he would beat me but I wouldnt be allowed to move beyond the area demarcated by the box! Razia recollects.The man would make her abort every time she conceived. His fear was that if I conceived, it would ruin his source of income. I ran away from that brothel in Babubazar. Then, I went to Metiabruz and finally landed in Munshigunge, her voice trails off.The only glimmer of hope, Razia insists, was those hours of silent exchange of glances. We would do isharabazi. He really cared for me. If I was unwell, he would give me money to buy medicines. I knew it had to be love when on the day I tried to abort my child with him, he rushed to the hospital and convinced me otherwise, Razia explains.Motherhood gave a new meaning to her life. But it didnt give her wedded bliss. Religion came in between. The man, a Hindu by birth, left her for Bihar. I got to know that he married a Hindu girl there. We lost touch. Sometimes, he tries to find about the well-being of our son, she says.Love, like ether, vanished from Razias life.***Was this betrayal more than that of her husband? Razia has no answer. Asma insists it is. She felt this was love despite such a cruel experience with her husband. Then, to get deserted is worse, Asma explains, while adding that betrayal in a brothel is never enough for the girls to give up on love. Otherwise why would Razia who was sold off by her husband fall the second time over? She had seen the harsh realities of the world only too often to believe otherwise. Yet, she succumbed like the others, Asma tries to reason.So, are they foolish? Childlike? Or does seeing the world through the rose-tinted glasses of optimism make their realities more endurable?Razia has no answer. Even if she has, she doesnt say so. Her voice, in any case, would have got drowned by the peals of laughter that waft in the air. The girls are partying. It is a ladies party today, she smiles before I ask what kind of a party it is in the middle of the afternoon. It all depends on their mood. They sometimes come together and party hard. Foreign liquor is served. Perhaps, today is one such day, Asma lets me in. I wanted to believe her though I couldnt help remembering being once told that intoxication helps girls endure the pain of taking on multiple buyers. Perhaps, it was their preparation for a long ordeal. Or may be, it was just celebration time! Who knows?***Razia lost faith in love the day her man left her for matrimony. Today, she has a babu. Asma insists that this babu, a driver by profession, is the one who truly loves her. May be, he does. But how does it matter any more? Razia asks.This man comes by twice a week. His children call her chhoti ammi. His wife knows about her. Razia and her 16-year-old son exchange gifts with them. We see a bond developing somewhere Asma insists.Razia smiles. Maybe, there is assurance. But she isnt yet ready to take his familys acceptance as a proof of love. Her eyes glint with impish delight when she says he is my eli-teli babu (meaning a babu who doesnt mean much). Let him feel what he wants. I am happy as long as I get Rs 5000 a month for my upkeep. Acceptance is good but I know he will never marry me. Its religion that will come in the way. So, why get swayed? He comes, we have a good time and then he leaves. I stay back in this room, Razia is happier getting her economics right. Her destiny doesnt allow her to take flights of fancy beyond the green ceiling of her room.***As I walk out of her place, I still dont know if Razia is completely disillusioned. Or does she fear betrayal too much to publicly claim otherwise? Nobody wants to come across as a fool. Perhaps, prudence suggests to keep the faith alive without allowing the world to be privy to it.I meet Noor outside the brothel. In this profession, where lust is what feeds the mouth of deserted women and children who dont know their fathers, love is a complex term, she says. But Noor did find love, didnt she? On the day when a man agreed to help her escape from the brothel? On the day he agreed to marry her and lend his name to their children?Yes, he married me. But this is rare, Noor explains. Every girl in a brothel believes she will meet Noors fate. In that hope, she gives her heart away. Sometimes, her riches too, feeding the babu who soon starts feeding off her.Love here strangely comes for a maintenance fee. And its the girl, who is expected to pay. The logic is skewed. The man insists that maintenance for his upkeep is mandatory for the girl to cough up, even if it means soliciting buyers. His power comes from a weird sense of possession since he is supposedly providing an umbrella to his girl in the brothel! Love sometimes leaks through this broken umbrella of betrayed emotions that get easily entangled in a maze of complexities.***Too many questions keep popping up. They get drowned by the horns of the trucks that speed down the Khidderpore Road. At night, some of these drivers might drop by at the quarters. Some might take a break during the day itself. As I walk back, I remember being told about two kinds of babu-s who frequent the red light districts. During one of my interactions with a sex-workers son from Sonagachhi, I was once explained the difference. There is one kind of babu called the khanewala babu. First they come to the brothels and sweep the girls off their feet. Then, they start living off the girls like parasites. There is another kind of babu who we call denewala babu. They are the ones who are the giving kinds, Ratan Dului had said.His mother had died after being exploited repeatedly by her khanewala babu. Maa had fallen in love with a man and he stayed on with her for 15 years. We would call him uncle. But when drunk, he would turn into a beast and beat maa black and blue, he had told. Ratan and his brother were very small then. But we would still tell maa to leave her babu and not waste her hard-earned money on him. Yet she refused. We were too young to enforce our reasons on her. Maa was blindly in love. Besides, she insisted it was important to have a man for our support and security, he had told me.Ratan failed to understand what kind of security this babu was providing. Arguments stopped the day his mother died when she was 42.Did he believe that this babu had ever loved his mother? This is common in the brothels. The babus dont work. They are okay with the girls soliciting other buyers. My mother has died and now I find the same khanewala babu going around with another girl. He must be 45 now but he looks 30. Men like them cash in on their good looks. In fact, girls themselves propose to such men! he had said.Did such experiences allow him to believe in love? Yes, I still had the faith. I had fallen for a girl. But the girl cheated on me. Now, I am closed to love. I will go for an arranged marriage, he had shared his plans.***Back in Munshigunge, I bumped into Uma Das, a daughter of a prostituted woman. She is a youth leader of Apne Aap, a grassroot movement to end sex trafficking. Some years ago, Uma had met Hillary Clinton and tied a wristband messaged with the line Cool Men Dont Buy Sex. Umas father had married twice. My mother was first sold to a brothel. Then, she came and stayed at the residence of the woman who was my fathers first wife. While staying there, maa fell in love with my father. He was a taxi driver. The initial days were rosy but soon, he started abuse. Whatever he earned, he would blow it up on his drinks. Maa fended for us by working as a domestic help. Baba died in 2000 and I dont have any feelings for him, Uma is candid.She too fell in love with a boy, got married and gave birth to a son. But now, she is caught in a legal custody battle. We met at a tuition. He too belonged to the red-light area. After my pregnancy, he had started torturing me physically. I have seen how love ends, she insists.Yet, her mother tells Uma that she might be lucky in love the next time around. Maybe, 10% of me would still gamble on love. There are many girls in the red light district who live with the thought that someone will give them the dignity of a wife. I have seen that happen only once in my life. A client married my neighbour after he fell for her. Today, they live away from the brothel and have two kids, she says.Uma is practical. She doesnt want to build castles in the air. But love also has a strange charm of optimism. Its an escape route, converting non-believers as well.Uma, for one, isnt ready to be a cynic as yet. She, like so many others living in the fading red light of brothels, doesnt mind giving love a chance. Yet again.Despite the wounds and the heartbreaks, love in brothels comes as a virtual passport to the promised life of dignity. While being courted for lust, the girls live on lusting for love."

He is back in the classroom but this time as a student. He is pursuing Masters in English through correspondence.Majid master speaks softly and in a staccato manner. His eyes hardly betray any emotion. His former party colleagues recall that it was always very difficult to fathom what was going on in his heart and mind.""It was a desire since my college days. I had even enrolled for the course in early 1970s but could not pursue because I was forced to take a plunge into politics,"" says Majid Master sitting in a room in Barasat's Kazipara where he has been taking refuge since May 2011. He was forced to flee Sashan, once his fief, after the change in political regime.The flaming red chair in the cramped and unkempt room is the only reminder of the politics Majid Master once practised. There was a time when Majid Master was the lord of all he surveyed in Sashan. In his fiefdom for over three decades around 60 kilometres from Kolkata - he was a synonym of terror.The battle for Sashan was the battle for big bucks. In his hey days, it is alleged that Majid used to hold meetings around the hundreds of bheris and controlled the entire auctioning process. Only those who paid him lakhs, it is alleged, were allowed to bid. A bulk of this money, the villagers claimed, would go to the CPM's coffers.Majid contests this allegation. ""The impoverished people were benefited. The entire money, through a co-operative, would be distributed among the poor villagers who then used to get to eat,"" says Majid.Out of active politics, Majid Master devotes six hours to his studies every day. On Saturday and Sunday, he attends classes at a study centre in a nearby college.""Most of my classmates are of the age of my grandchildren,"" says Majid, a shy smile appearing on his otherwise sober visage.Majid, who was once religious, now follows the eight-fold path shown by Gautam Buddha.But ask him about the two 'Buddhas' within his party - former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and minister Gautam Deb - his jaws become taut and his eyes betray emotions, albeit for a few seconds. ""I have nothing to do with either of them anymore. I am not in touch with them,"" he says.There is a blue and white bicycle parked outside his room, which his niece got from her school. It is one of the cycles that the Trinamool Congress has been giving to school students and has the Biswa Banga logo on it.""The social impact is already visible. It has become easier for girls in rural areas to travel to school. It has also provided poor families a vital source of transportation,"" says Majid. He continues to praise several of Mamata Banerjee's pro-poor schemes, including the distribution of bicycles.""She is giving rice for Rs 2 per kilogram. She has also kept her promise of not acquiring land forcefully. The poor are benefiting,"" he sums up."
5b2e36349855b7245313fcb9,Singur Farmers May Forgive Mamata for Not Keeping Land Return Promise,https://www.hindustantimes.com/assembly-elections/singur-farmers-may-forgive-mamata-for-not-keeping-land-return-promise/story-3ZZn1I2Y5hzPFl5b0hNT7N.html,2016-03-11,"Five years ago, Singur resident Shyamali Das was so upbeat about elections in her area that she named her grandson Poriborton: A catch word signifying change coined by Mamata Banerjee urging people to vote out the 34-year-old Left Front government.But she doesnt call him by that name anymore.We had lot of dreams once. But our hopes were dashed. I dont call him by that name anymore. Poriborton has lost its meaning, Das tells HT, elaborating about the bigha of land her family gave up in 2006 for a Tata Nano factory that never materialised.Located barely 40 kilometres from Kolkata, Singur is where it all began: The epicentre of massive farmer protests against the state governments forcible acquisition of land for the Tata factory that gave Banerjee a potent issue to script a historic regime change in 2011.But almost a decade later, the villagers who refused compensation packages are dissatisfied with Banerjee as the emotive issue of returning their land remains tangled in court.Didi visited Singur 38 times between 2006 and 2011. And she did not visit us for once since becoming the chief minister, says Krishna Bag, a neighbour of Das.Her father-in-law committed suicide when he realised he couldnt protect his land and both Krishna and her husband  Arun Bag  went to prison.Land was required in Beraberi, Gopalnagar and KGD gram panchayat areas. (Subhankar Chakraborty)They were accompanied in jail by their two-year-old daughter Payel, who went on to become the face of Singurs protests.They arent the only ones. Hundreds of farmers in the area felt let down by Banerjee who rode to power in 2011 on the back of a promise to return 400 of the 997.11 acres of land used in the Nano factory plot.Her (Banerjees) recent comment saying she had nothing to do even if the court took 50 years to pass a judgment has come as a rude shock to us, Bajemelias Gopal Dhara says, adding, During the days of the movement she never told us there could be legal complexities in getting our land back.But in spite of the complaints, Singur is ready to vote for Trinamool Congress Rabindranath Bhattarcharya. Local residents point to development work done by the state government and say none of the other parties  the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Congress or BJP  stood by their movement.Its true that Trinamool failed on its promise to return land but the administration is helping the families of unwilling land-losers with financial and other aids. There is no other way for these people but to bank on Trinamool, says Jaladhar Das of Beraberi, who willingly parted with his one-bigha land for the Nano plant.Every shareholder of land belonging to a farmer who parted with their land unwillingly gets Rs 2,000 and 16 kg of rice at Rs 2 per kg every month.For people not affected by the land acquisition or Banerjees movement against it, the development work Singur witnessed in the past five years is good enough reason to re-elect the Trinamool nominee.Roads, water supply and irrigation system have improved. Singur has got a college. People are regularly getting benefits allotted through various central and state government schemes. There is no reason why Bhattacharya should not win again, unless local Trinamool leaders play spoilsport, Robin Ghosh of Gopalnagar tells HT.Analysts say the development and welfare schemes is motivated by the administrations urge to compensate farmers in view of its inability to return their land.Singurs roads are metalled and without potholes. The drains even inside the villages are lined with bricks and the street lights all function. Their number has also gone up, compared to a few years ago.The culverts on canals and drains have all been refurbished. Locals have no complaint about the number of tubewells and deep tubewells."

But last year's dry spell was worse and the panchayat is still recuperating from its harsh effects. Farmers, who make up 25% of the population in the panchayat, had a tough time growing paddy because 80% of the cultivable land depends on rainwater.The crisis is severe in this part of the state and even government schemes have failed to bring respite. Several canals have been built, but most remain dry throughout the year. This year, the villagers of Dharambahal had to buy rice as the produce was not enough. The 20% irrigable area depends on lakes and dams, which are also affected in summer.Ghatsila block agriculture officer Patit Pavan Ghosh said though the government has installed tube-wells in the villages, ""groundwater level recedes by 5-7ft every year during summer and the villagers have to depend on the limited supply"".Ratan Murmu, mukhiya of Chunuri village, said, ""Recently, the SDO court has planned to dig deep boring wells, but they don't realize that this will lead to the drying up of other wells and escalate the crisis. The government formulates laws but does not realize the consequences of their implementation.""The villagers have been protesting against the state's plan to dig borewells, but without any result. When asked, Ghosh said, ""It all depends on the method of boring and if it is done properly, it will help the villagers.""In Paoro, another village in the panchayat, villagers have similar problems. S K Murmu, a local leader, said they have huge areas of land near the Burudih dam where they cultivate vegetables, ""but this year there hasn't been enough yield"".Ashok Naik, a farmer at Phuldungri, said they could not sell their vegetables to West Bengal as the produce was too low. While the state has not offered much help, the villagers recall the arrival of a team from the central government to gauge the drought situation.The Centre approved Rs 336.94 crore relief for Jharkhand last month, the villagers are still sceptical. Ratan Murmu said, ""The (relief) money always gets lost among middlemen and hardly reaches the poor. We can only wait and see if things are different this time.""But Ghosh sounded hopeful. ""We have been granted relief and several blocks in other districts have been short-listed for receiving the money. We are hoping that in a month or two, our farmers in Ghatsila will also receive the compensation,"" he added.Till then, the villagers' wait for both government and rain relief continues."

According to latest reports, the male elephant had entered the Nadia district.We tried to tranquillise the tusker. It had strayed into muddy rice fields. Though we arranged for vehicles to bring the animal to the main road, it died after the tranquilisation, a senior forest official told The Hindu .A herd of elephants had strayed into Bardhaman from adjoining Bankura district on Saturday night. The tusker accompanied by another elephant started moving through the paddy fields of Bardhaman, considered the rice bowl of West Bengal.A 19-year-old boy was the first to be attacked by the pachyderm. He sustained major injuries and was being treated at a government hospital. The elephant then attacked and killed two persons, identified as Annakali Roy (62) and Narayan Majhi (69), in Bhatar. From there, the jumbos moved to Manteshwar, killing two more persons, Prakash Goria (45) and Suraj Seth (38).At the Denur village, forest officials attempted to tranquillise the animal. Locals said that after several hours, with the help of chains, vehicles and huge belts, the elephant was driven away from the paddy fields. However, forest officials said the tusker had succumbed to the tranquiliser darts by then, adding that it was later buried in a forest in Kaksa.Another herd of elephants killed a farmer, Anil Bagdi (64), in the early hours of Monday in Kashpur area of the district, taking the total toll to five.Major concernMan-elephant conflict has emerged as a major concern in south Bengal where small patches of forests are surrounded by large farmlands. Elephants from the Dalma Forest range often migrate to south Bengal from Jharkhand and due to the fragmented nature of forests, the pachyderms often stray into human habitations.Over the past 10 years, at least 240 persons and more than 50 elephants have died in the forests of south Bengal."
5920837e7be9e04a516a8dcc,Left promises rice at Rs 2 per kg,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/536019/left-promises-rice-rs-2.html,2016-03-22,"Kolkata, March 22, 2016, DHNS 1:43 ISTBorrowing a leaf from Trinamool Congress supreme Mamata Banerjees books, the Lefts poll manifesto promised rice at Rs 2 per kg, if it returns to power.Subsidised ration, focussing more on small and medium industries, and restoring democracy are some other promises the Left poll document made. It was, however, significantly silent on the recent sting operation embroiling top Trinamool Congress leaders in a controversy.The Left, which criticised Mamata for resorting to populist schemes like providing subsidised rice and other food grains, however, seemed to have fallen for similar schemes before the polls. The manifesto, released on Sunday evening, promised rice at Rs 2 kg or a weekly quote of 35 kg wheat flour, if the Left came to power. The 16-page poll document also promised to stop hunger deaths, an issue the Left repeatedly denied when in power, besides providing monthly allowance of Rs 2,500 to workers of closed industries.The manifesto said Mamata failed to bring in investments, setting back the industrialisation process started under Left regime. Even though in successive public meetings since December, Left leaders invoked the name of Singur, where Tata Group was to set up a small car factory, the manifesto did not mention such promises. Focussing more on small and medium industries, instead of heavy industries, the manifesto also steered clear off the contentious issue of land acquisition for industries.Keeping in mind the partys analysis that forcible land acquisition at Singur and Nandigram between 2006 and 2008 was a major factor in driving the Left out of power, the manifesto talked of taking cautious steps and sincere efforts to develop understanding between all stakeholders. Families giving away land will be given profitable value. Initiatives will be taken to give training and employment to one member from each affected family, it stated, taking into account demands of farmers and land owners at flash points like Singur and Nandigram for better compensation.While the manifesto asked for restoration of democracy to the state, the Left called for all secular, democratic forces to come together to fight Trinamool in Bengal and the BJP at the Centre."

In Uttar Pradesh, Ballia is most prone to arsenic contamination followed by Bahraich, Rae Bareli, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Meerut, Chandoli and many more.The technology is ready for field trials. Senior NBRI scientist Debasis Chakrabarty, who conducted the research recently, visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippine and discussed the possibilities of field trials. The institute in principal agreed to help in this regard.""The institute invited us to become familiar with ongoing research work at NBRI and has agreed in principle to conduct field trials subjected to clearance by governments of both countries,"" said Chakrabarty, head of the eight-member team, which carried out research published recently in an international journal 'Metallomics' published by 'Royal Society of Chemistry'.The scientists said the transgenic rice has 'arsenic methyl transferase', a gene isolated from a fungus that accumulates less arsenic and would be less toxic.He explained that arsenic present in groundwater percolates in soil during irrigation and contaminates rice with arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure through groundwater contamination affects more than 150 million people worldwide and over 500 million people in Ganga, Meghna and Brahmputra areas.Rice is the crop most susceptible to absorbing arsenic during cultivation. Cultivating rice varieties that accumulate less amount of arsenic can tackle the challenge of exposure to carcinogens (cancer causing elements) that affect population in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha."

Starvation doesnt need to be imagined in Bengal, its not a distant memory  the word still conjures up images of gaunt ribs, filthy rags and lethargic limbs with unnerving clarity.The reasons for TMCs confidence that their rice politics in the state will surmount all other criticism are rooted firmly in history. In the list of achievements that Mamata Banerjee reiterates at every election rally, is her extension of the National Food Security Act  increasing its reach from 3.5 crore people to 6.5 crore  that is, over 70 per cent of the states population  as her prime achievement.The Bengal famine of 1943 and consequent cases of what the government euphemestically refers to as hunger deaths or death due to chronic ailments neglected in the past have entrenched hunger as a vital issue during elections. The many representations of hunger by artists ranging from Chittaprosad, Somnath Hore, Ramkinkar formed the iconography for hunger in the post-colonial Bengal.In 1944, the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA) toured Bengal with their dramas documenting famine, hunger and the struggle to live  prime among them was Bijon Bhattacharyas play Nabanna (New Harvest). Images from filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen have combined to form the backbone of Bengals collective conscience. Even today the names of these artists, their stories and work are passed on from generation to generation, in some cases even substituting bedtime tales, embedding hunger into the very culture of Bengal.It comes as no surprise then that hunger has traditionally been the electoral issue that rises above all else. The Tebhaga movement initiated by the Communist Party in Bengal from 1946-1947, demanding the rights for landless peasants formed the foundation of the partys future dominance in the state. This was followed by the Food Movement of 1959, a turning point in the political history of the state when food insecurity threatened yet another famine in the state. Protests at Writers Building saw clashes with the police, leaving 80 dead. As young Jyoti Basu compared the incident to Jallianwalabagh in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, cornering the Congress government and cementing his own political status.After coming to power in 1977, the Left Front government amended the Land Reforms Act, making cultivation absentia an exclusionary clause for eviction of sharecroppers  they were to be provided rights and the place of crop share was shifted to sharecroppers homestead plots.Even in the days of its decline, West Bengal politics saw hunger taking centre stage. Subsidised rice was introduced by the Centre and the Left Front government in Bengal in 2009, covering 2.64 crore people living below the poverty line. It soon became the prime incentive offered in areas affected by Left-wing extremism to wean tribals away from Maoists.Mamata Banerjee is not unaware of this. At Silda, an hour away from Belpahari where many had died of hunger in 2004, Mamata Banerjee is introduced as the Anna Data  goddess of food  by her party members. She speaks in detail of the Belpahari famine in 2004, squarely blames the previous Left Front government and reiterates her governments promise of providing food to all. It is no accident that the new secretariat in the state is named Nabanna  after Bijon Bhattacharyas play on famine, nor was it was a mere knee-jerk-reaction when she delinked ration cards from the food distribution scheme.Concerns have been raised in all quarters over whether the available stocks would keep pace with meeting the demand. By March, 300 rice mills had shut down, citing falling prices, shrinking exports as the key reasons. But these are questions that the Mamata Banerjee government is content to leave for later.Right now, as conversations in tea shops and street corners are dominated by du takae chal (rice at Rs 2), some uncomfortable questions are already being asked  how long can this last, where will the money to pay for the rice come from and most importantly what happens if the rice runs out?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Their votes will go to the one local community leaders will suggest. We dont know which symbol stands for which party. Our village headman will advise us on whom to vote, admitted Jyotilal Hansda, a land tiller hailing from the Santhal community. He was speaking for his wife, Hela, and his son, Karmu, who will be voting for the first time this year. Jyotilal and his familys immediate concerns are four square meals. Their source of subsistence is a kind of gruel, made of steamed rice kept overnight in a bowl of water.The accompaniment is often one burnt tomato mashed in with chillies, both vegetables grown in the familys less than half an acre plot. As Jyotilal talked to Deccan Herald on a searing hot, summer afternoon, slurping in his share of the gruel from a plastic bowl, he said that things have always been like this for them.The village headmen instructed which symbol to cast their vote for and they pressed the button next to the suggested symbol, be it the twin flowers and a blade of grass, representing Trinamool Congress, the hammer-sickle-star of the Left or the Congresss upright palm. Jyotilal, however, finds the reigning government acceptable ever since Mamata started providing rice at Rs 2 a kg. Proper roads snaking through the village, an electricity connection, which keeps the two LED lamps, also a part of the governments largesse, and a deep tube-well that mostly provides clean water, have made him believe that this government is good. Now weve the things we need the most. The field provides us with basic vegetables and the nearby ration shop supplies us a monthly quota of 15 Kg rice at Rs 2, he said. Waving her arms around the singe-storey house, with two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, Hela pointed at the walls and talked of how the house with public funds have helped her family survive the extreme temperatures of Purulia, where on summer days the mercury often touches 47 degrees Celsius and in winters it dips down to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius.Even though the house has been built under Indira Awas Yojana, a Central government scheme, she and Jyotilal believe the present government is to be thanked.Baleshwar Majhi, a landless worker mostly dependent on 100 days work under MGNREGA, however, does not seem happy with Mamata.Although not sure who Mamata is, he does not believe she has done much for people like him. Theres hardly any work available. We wish the government arranged for more work, he said. Like most men from his community, he finds solace in drinking undistilled country liquor, made by fermenting day-old rice in water. Political developments mean nothing for him and he does not know of the changes around, he admitted.I have never even seen this man in my life, he said, pointing at a poster of Nepal Mahato, the sitting Congress MLA, who is fighting to retain his seat. When posed the question to him, he asked, Who should I vote for? The village headman, who did not want to be named, admitted that most voters in the area are like Jyotilal and Baleshwar. Affiliated to the Congress, he hopes the villagers will cast for the symbol of his choice and help his candidate regain the seat.DH News Service"

CM Mamata Banerjee with Taldangra assembly constituency TMC candidate Samir Chakraborty Actor turned politician MP Moon Moon Sen during election campaign at Taldangra, Bankura district, West Bengal on March 30, 2016. Express photo by Partha Paul.Launching another scathing attack on the Opposition, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday claimed that the Trinamool Congress would return to power again, and unlike 2011, she would no longer be polite after the Assembly election results are declared.Reiterating her claim that the CPM had unleashed a reign of terror against opposition during its 34-year rule in the state, Mamata alleged that even now they are continuing with such practice. Nine TMC workers have been killed in the state since elections were declared. Election will be over after a month. We will remain here after that. We will not spare any of them (Opposition parties). We had shown enough manners after we won the last Assembly elections. Not anymore, Mamata said while addressing a public meeting at Taldangra area in Bankura district.Referring to the recent sting operation carried out by the news portal Narada News, which purportedly showed several senior TMC leader accepting bribe from a fictitious company, the Trinamool chief said, The CPM leaders have built property worth thousands of crores and now they are calling the TMC thieves, a party which is comparatively younger. Once we are back (in power), we will ask for the accounts of their properties and they will have to answer us.Mamata also claimed that the TMC was no longer a young sapling which would need protection but a mighty tree which stood on its own strength.Taking a dig at the electoral understanding between the Congress and CPM, the CM said those parties which needed support to survive are creepers. CPM has proved that it has no principle after it joined hands with Congress. Both the shameless parties have come together, she said.Canvassing support for her party candidate Sameer Chakraborty in Taldangra, a seat which has been won by CPM for the last 39 years, the Trinamool chief said the Opposition party had not done anything for the people there.Talking about the lack of infrastructure and civic amenities here, Mamata said,The CPM had only converted this place into a breeding place for terror. In the last four years of the TMC government, I have worked for Bankura by setting up the Bankura University, provided four super-speciality hospitals, and started an ambitious water supply project worth Rs 1,100 crore that would benefit around 34 lakh people when completed in two phases.A Rs 1,200-crore water supply project has also been taken up in neighbouring Purulia district, she added.She also alleged that some of the officials of the coordination committees who supported the CPM had tried to sabotage the project under which the state government provided rice and wheat for Rs 2 a kg.Attacking the Centre, Mamata said the BJP government was a dalal (agent) for CPM and Congress. The BJP should rather watch out in Delhi where its government might not stay for another term, rather than trying to form a government in Bengal.Meanwhile, in another rally in Kharagpur, Mamata rooted for Trinamool Congress candidate Ramprasad Tiwari and said the pending development works in the constituency will be a priority work for the government if her party comes to power.I have known Gyan Singh Sohan Pal for long and have great respect for him. Still, I think much needs to be done for Kharagpurs development and Trinamool Congress will do that if it gets the opportunity, the CM said. Gyan Singh, fondly called chacha by his admirers, is the Congress-Left Front alliance candidate from IIT and Railway town Kharagpur, from where he has won consecutive times. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh is also contesting from the seat.CPM has been the arch rivals of Congress for over three decades and many Congress workers were murdered during the Left Front regime. Yet, their lust for power is such that they have now formed a poll alliance. People will defeat them and give them a befitting reply, she said."
58f50a077be9e018510a210e,There is a new flame in the forest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/opinion/story_77293.jsp,2016-03-31,"The term, Jangalmahal, is a misnomer. On my way to Gopiballavpur from Jhargram, I spotted several bald patches in the sal forests on either side of the silken highway that snaked its way through the green canopy that is no longer dense. Bands of sunlight flooded the forest floor where trees had been felled. I was in West Midnapore to get a feel of the imminent elections. Voting would take place in six constituencies in Jangalmahal, including Gopiballavpur, Salboni and Nayagram, on April 4, the day assembly elections begin in West Bengal. Elections energize metropolitan journalists. They suddenly muster the energy to travel to remote areas in a bid to bring to public attention the gaps that exist between the State's claims of development and the bleak ground reality. Their reports, which examine the chasm between promise and delivery of Constitutional entitlements - food, shelter, education, employment - are a democracy's tool-kit to assess the performance of an elected dispensation. But I was travelling in Jangalmahal's pockets - Lodhasuli, Gopiballavpur, Nayagram, Salboni and Jamboni - with a different agenda. I wanted to understand the differences in the way development is perceived by the State and by Jangalmahal's adivasi citizens. My first stop was the Subarnarekha College in Gopiballavpur. The college, which takes its name from the river that lay dry and lifeless nearby, is spacious. But the infrastructure, especially some of the rooms meant for teachers, are small and shabby. Two teachers led me to a lecture room so that I could interact with the students. Many of them, I was told, live in distant villages and had to travel some distance to reach the college. The conversation, expectedly, started with an appraisal of the Trinamul Congress's performance in the constituency. (Chudamani Mahato of the TMC is the sitting MLA.) The students appeared to be satisfied with the condition of the roads, even though buses are not available in some parts after dusk, making commuting difficult, especially for the infirm and for patients. The girl students admitted that some of them had faced harassment - bureaucratic delays as well as insensitive remarks by officials - during their visits to panchayat offices to claim funds under the Kanyashree scheme. A super-speciality hospital has come up in Gopiballavpur (picture, below). But skilled doctors rarely take up postings here. (I visited the hospital the same evening, but could not find either the superintendent or a senior physician to corroborate the allegation.) Other places in West Midnapore have also witnessed frenetic construction activities after the near-annihilation of the Maoist movement. Metalled roads are no longer a dream. Lalgarh, over 60 kilometres away from Gopiballavpur, now has a polytechnic institute as well as a training centre for nurses. Nayagram and Salboni have received new colleges and stadiums and have also been promised modern healthcare. Yet, it was evident that the first glimpses of the State's version of the development process have not weakened the resolve of some segments of adivasi society to express their anxieties concerning the survival of their identity and of indigenous culture. Santhali had been included in the Eighth Schedule years ago (2003). The students voiced their anger with the government's neglect of local dialects and scripts. (The manifesto of the TMC is available in Alchiki though.) The State's attempts to revive vanishing performance arts traditions were also dismissed as elitist and cosmetic. A student who had participated in the Jangalmahal Utsav admitted that she had found the experience of performing on a concrete stage quite alienating. There were also complaints of interventions on the part of the organizers that had led to scripts and performances losing their authenticity during the extravaganza. Their experience of cultural alienation reopens an older debate concerning the reorganization of states. Purulia, which was carved out of adivasi-dominated Manbhum, was made a part of West Bengal. The students were critical of not just the apathy that is causing the slow death of languages but also the government's neglect of heritage structures. Interestingly, not all of these mansions are built by rulers from the adivasi community. In Jhargram, where I was based, I had been struck by the effort - a joint initiative between the state government and the resident royal family- to restore the rajbari. But Chilkigarh palace and the ancient temples on its premises - they can be reached after a brief trek through a forest that was alive with the calls of playful langurs - lie in a state of ruin (picture, below). My conversations with the respondents - students, villagers and activists - made it apparent that a fine line still separates the people from the State. For instance, the former held back from welfare projects that do not complement adivasi sensibilities. Some among them have also begun to differentiate between fundamental rights and political allowances. The cynicism of the students towards subsidized food grain, as opposed to their popularity in Amlasole, is a case in point. Equally telling was the propensity to perceive the manifestations of State welfare - especially the cultural festivals - as dubious initiatives to pollute and co-opt the remaining segments of a shrinking society that has resisted adulteration by modernity. The anxiety is emblematic of the state of siege - real and imagined - that pervades the community's consciousness. The willingness of Jangalmahal's tribal people to insulate - fortify is a better term - themselves from some kinds of State intervention probably stems from a heightened awareness of the pitfalls of identity politics. Adivasi identity was the plinth that supported the Lalgarh movement that had initially been led by the Peoples' Committee Against Police Atrocities. But its appropriation by the Maoists, and, later, its disintegration under political and military pressure has made the community wary of institutional efforts to revive indigenous culture. These tensions are inevitable, given the State's refusal to view development as a layered, but organically linked, idea that brings with it not just motorable roads, schools and hospitals but also helps nurture the fraying links between a community and its culture. From Gopiballavpur, I headed for Nayagram, near the border with Odisha. The landscape changed dramatically. The pucca road turned into a dirt track; agricultural fields gave way to shrub land; only the thinning forest remained unchanged. (The forest officials I met later attributed their inability to check felling to the lack of manpower and funds as well as the nexus between the political establishment and the timber mafia.) In Bihankuria village, I had expected the adivasi families to talk about such measures as the provision of 35 kilogrammes of rice at two rupees or the decision to raise the price of kendu leaves. Instead, the animated discussion turned towards the falling water table, the disappearance of local trees such as piyal, the proliferation of the eucalyptus, and sand mining that has ravaged the Subarnarekha. The ecological crisis in Jangalmahal has gone unrepresented in the political manifestos of all contending parties. Before I left the village, I was given mahua fruits that were being dried. I asked my host if this was a ritual associated with departure. He laughed and said that this was not a gift, but a relic. If I were to visit him again, he was not sure if I would find the mahua trees. I was expected to visit Jamboni and Binpur the following day. As I made my way back from Nayagram, I wondered whether the day's conversations were indicative of an emerging charter of development, one which was far more holistic than the model that has been imposed upon the people by the State. Health and education are priorities. So is employment. Data from the government suggest that over 30,000 people from Jangalmahal have found employment not in industry or agriculture but within the various tiers of the robust security apparatus that is still in place. (I was asked to produce my identity papers twice by the Central Reserve Police Force during my sojourn.) The devastation that has been wrought in Jangalmahal's environment and culture certainly registers in the people's engagement with the idea of development. Whether this consciousness is new remains unclear to me. It could be that the adivasi notion of progress is inherently inclusive. It could also be that education and improved connectivity with the city have brought about a sharpening of perception regarding their own needs. Or that the issues raised by the 'bon party' - the term used to describe Maoists - such as the community's rights over natural resources, linger in public memory. But I did get the impression that Jangalmahal has decided to renew its faith in the democratic apparatus, its limitations notwithstanding, in a bid to negotiate its demands with the State. The armed insurrection, and its crippling consequences, continue to haunt the people. The bon party's ideology and tactic stand discredited. The forest seemed to agree with my thoughts. On a road bathed in the falling light, I noticed the fire lines that had been lit by the forest department shimmering among the trees. Yet this was not the fire that had threatened to burn down the forest. This was a new kind of fire, a flickering flame, that had set the forest alight."

New roads in place of dirt roads snaked through the smallest of villages. Long-standing problem of rural electrification has been taken care of and drinking water crisis has been mitigated to some extent. Yet, the Trinamool leadership seems somewhat shaky over its chances.Since 2011, Mamata has put up a brave front, claiming to have taken care of development in impoverished districts like Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore.Welfare measures like rice at Rs 2 a kilo, laying foundation of colleges, super speciality hospitals, besides distributing largesse in the form of bicycles and educational grants to girl students have somewhat changed the face of rural Bengal. What could mar Mamatas chances is the complex arithmetic of tribal and Dalit aspirations. Constant campaign by the combined forces of the Left-Congress on one hand and BJP on the other, on the issue of graft could also leave a mark.Seemingly an urban issue, a controversial footage showing top Trinamool leaders receiving illegal cash payments, has reached villages.If the Left-Congress combine hammered the issue through poll graphiti, BJP went a step further, distributing DVDs of the footage to grassroots workers, who are screening these at street corners and markets. If that is not all, at Jungle Mahal, Mamatas strongest contender will be Jharkhand Party (Naren), an outfit with significant sphere of influence over the regions tribal populace. The outfit could cause serious damage on April 11, set aside for Jungle Mahal, owing to security concerns due to its Maoist-affected area tag.Being a region with several sensitive booths, the Election Commission has decided on aerial surveillance with two helicopters making rounds during polling hours. As per schedule, 49 Assembly constituencies across West Midnapore, Burdwan, Bankura and Puruliawill go to polls on these two days. Ground reports suggest what initially seemed like a cakewalk for Trinamool, might not be so with doubts having crept in over the last fortnight, both within the ruling party and the electorate. For now, Mamata will have to wait till results are out on May 19 and allay whatever apprehensions she might have over anti-incumbency and talks of graft overshadowing her plank of overall development."

Partha Paul Shiv Kumar and wife Gayatri Devi check their flat near crash site in Kolkata on Wednesday. Partha PaulNUMBER FOUR structure on Kali Krishna Tagore Street, housing 105 rooms, resonates with an eerie silence. Plates laid out on the table in one of the flats has gathered dust over the past week, an almirah in the other room lies open with no one to attend to it. The 80-year-old structure, which nearly touches the Vivekananda Road flyover like other buildings on either side of the road, was deserted by its residents shortly after the March 31 tragedy that claimed at least 27 lives and left more than 80 injured.Nearly a week later, the families are yet to return, convinced that the administrations promises of alternative arrangement and safety are as hollow as their chances of quick return.We left most of our belongings and have been staying at our relatives place. Some police officers had come and told us not to return for 72 hours, says Shubash Sharma, 31, a local trader who deals in electrical pipes. Now, he says, that period has been extended by another three weeks.Where will we go for the next three weeks? Not everyone has a relative here and some are staying at hotels. How long can they pay for the hotel? asks Sharma as he narrates the visit by Deputy Commissioner (central Kolkata) Akhilesh Chaturvedi who has instructed the residents not to come back for the extended period. But Sharma has come back, although without his wife and son.I havent called them back yet because we are not sure how safe it is. We were hoping we would move back in this week as we could barely take any of our belongings with us, said Sharma, who is also worried about his son missing his classes.Gayatri Devi (66) and Shiv Kumar Nagmayal (72) didnt have to worry about coming back. They never left. The only family of the 12 living in the building for over half a century.Where will we go? I am old and this place is all I have. If this building goes down, I will go down with it, says Gayatri. From their flat on the second floor, the point where the flyover snapped like a twig that Thursday afternoon, stares back. Some say that a portion will fall on our building. But I feel that nothing of the sort will happen again, said the husband.Lives of their neighbours, residents of building number 2, hasnt improved either. Women and children have gone back to their parents. We have been guarding the building ourselves as the gatekeepers have run away. And we only have puffed rice and tea for dinner, says Nauratan Sharma, 40, one of the residents.Families here havent left their place, and its not difficult to figure out why. The deputy commissioner said we will get alternative arrangements but it sounds vague. How can we expect him to know anyway, he is the police commissioner, not a minister. And from the government, no one has told us anything about any alternative arrangement, he said.When contacted by The Indian Express, DC Chaturvedi said he is not in a position to say when the families could return. My responsibility is to protect the residents of the area, warn them. The engineers will determine how long the whole process will take, he said.Officials of Kolkata Municipal Development Authority and the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (the latter has been assigned the task of removing the collapsed spans) had inspected the site Wednesday. But among their jobs now is also to deal with the determined residents who are not ready to leave. We need to vacate the houses on both sides of the road in order to avoid any eventuality, said an RVNL engineer on condition of anonymity.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)It has been 46 years since the Sainbai massacre but Rekha Rani Sain still wakes up to screams in the middle of the night.On March 17, 1970, a mob of CPM workers had allegedly gouged out the eyes of her husband Naba Kumar Sain  the eldest son of the family  and killed his brothers Malay and Pranab in front of her eyes. Naba Kumar was killed a year later.The centre of the attack, the Sain residence in Burdwan, is now in ruins. Its walls are covered with wild growth and the main entrance has been blocked by a wall to keep off on-lookers. Political leaders every year visit the one-storey house to garland a martyrs dome that has been constructed.With the wound still fresh in in the hearts of the survivors, the electoral understanding between Congress and CPM has not gone down too well. The reason: CPM cadres had allegedly attacked the family as it supported Congress.Rekha Rani, now 72, had left her residence at Pratapeswar Shibtala Lane  in the heart of Burdwan district  in 1978 and shifted to a rented apartment at Buri Bagan area nearby. Living at Sainbari would have meant reliving the incident every day.My brothers-in-laws Pranab Kumar Sain and Malay Kumar Sain and Jitendranath Rai, a private tutor who had come to teach the kids, were hacked in front of my eyes. I was 26. It all began at 7.30 am people stared pelting stones on our house. Later, they set it on fire, she said.While a few thousand waited outside the house, dozens broke in and killed the three men.My mother-in-law, Mrignayana Devi, tried to stop the attackers but she was hit on her head. Two attackers mixed Pranab and Malays blood with rice and forced it into her mouth She was taken to the hospital she survived, Rekha Rani said.Asked if she would vote, Rekha Rani said: I am not well. If my health permits, I might. But what is the point? My family was killed by CPM cadres for supporting Congress. Now, the same Congress has joined hands with the CPM.Accusing the Mamata government of using the tragedy for its gain, she said: On special occasions, like July 21 Martyrs Day event in Kolkata, I had been displayed on the stage as a showpiece with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee handing over an envelope containing Rs 10,000 No one wants to find out how we are living in impunity, running from pillar to post trying to gather funds for my treatment.Bijay Kumar Sain, the youngest son of the family, said the incident has been interpreted differently by different interest groups. The ruling party wanted me to name people I dont remember being present at the time of the attack. If I followed the diktat, I would probably have got a government job. On the other hand, those allegedly involved in the murders want me to say they were not there at the time of the attack, he claimed.He added: Many of my relatives have accepted jobs and monetary help from the ruling party It is not possible to forget but I would not want to cash in on the occasion.Active in the construction business, Bijay Kumar has built a building right next to Sainbari. I am often invited to functions to mark the day of the massacre but I avoid the same. I garland the dome when everyone has left. I say my silent prayer, he said.Earlier, Bijay Kumar claimed a number of security guards used to protect his family. They were reportedly withdrawn by the Left Front government. The Trinamool government has given me one security guard. It is only a formality they want to show they have provided security to the Sain family. I urge them to take it back. There is no logic behind having one security guard. He has to go for his meals What happens then? he asked.A daughter of the family, Swarnalata, lives at Badamtala. On the fateful day, the family had gathered for a function to be organised for her son Amrit Kumar Jash  then one month old. Amrit, now 46, said he and his mother were lucky to stay alive.Udai Kumar Sain, Rekha Ranis brother-in-law, stays at Sukantanagar. His wife UmaSain is the sitting councillor of Ward 34 in Burdwan Municipality. Mamata Banerjee has promised there would be justice The Congress-Left alliance is not acceptable, he maintained.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Baharul Sheikh who sells jhalmuri, hopes this tangy puffed rice mixture, which he gives away for free while campaigning, will make him popular enough to be in the assembly.Baharul, 32, is the Rashtriya Secular Congress candidate from western Assams Dhubri assembly seat. He is one of the poorest among the 525 candidates contesting in the 61 seats, where second-phase polling is underway.I am contesting because only the poor can understand the problems of the poor and try to do something about it, said Baharul. I know the big parties will buy votes, but I have only jhalmuri to give people I come across while campaigning.His rivals include Union HRD minister Smriti Iranis maternal uncle, Debamoy Sanyal, whom the BJP has fielded again. Iranis grandmother, Agomoni Sanyal, is based in Dhubri.Irani, unlike last time, has not campaigned for her uncle. I hope people vote for change this time, said Debamoy Sanyal.Baharul, a school dropout, fancies his chances because 70% of the voters are Muslim. But he is wary of perfume magnate Badruddin Ajmals All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which wrested the seat from Congress in 2011.North of Dhubri, bordering West Bengal, is the Gossaigaon assembly constituency where the AIUDF is banking on the unlikeliest of candidates  a Telugu-speaking businessman from Andhra Pradeshs Vishakhapatnam district.Ravi Sankar Kasireddy, 40, came to Srirampur, on the Assam-Bengal border, with his fathers friend to join a transportation business. His success and sociable attitude earned him the AIUDF ticket from Gossaigaon, which falls in the Bodoland Territorial Council and has usually been represented by either a Bodo tribal or an adivasi, who are more in number.Mine is the only Telugu family in this constituency and my candidature speaks volumes of the assimilative nature of Assam, said Kasireddy, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Andhra University.Kasireddy too hopes to sail through on the strength of Muslim voters, who have gravitated towards the AIUDF after a series of communal riots since 2012. But he knows incumbent Majendra Narzary of Bodoland Peoples Front, a BJP ally, and Ashim Hasda of Congress are strong contenders."

A wall on East Behala constituency depicts the complexity Lahiri is talking about.IT WAS 2 pm and Subhasis Roy, 42, had not taken a break since the morning. The Trinamool Congress worker from Alimuddin Street, where the CPM headquarters is housed, doubles as the graffiti painter for the local party office. We have to finish this work before evening, said Roy, a former student of Government College of Art and Craft.The work was a piece of graffiti depicting what he called the unholy marriage of CPM and the Congress in West Bengal. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and CPM leader Surjya Kanta Mishra seem to be stuck in a tussle. The Congress leader asks the CPM leader to not run away, the CPM leader seems to be muttering a halfhearted word of assurance. The hand and the sickle too seem precariously poised against each other.The graffiti is one of many in a battle being waged on the walls of Bengal.In a state where ugly vinyl hoardings of candidates in filmstar-like poses had taken over most walls and public buildings, graffiti reflecting creativity and wit are making a comeback. Even in the 2011 assembly elections, the few graffiti on display ranged between the prosaic and the very prosaic. Hammer and sickle peered out cautiously between twin flowers, and somewhere on the side a name would be squeezed. There was little of wit or aesthetics.There has been a systematic decline of humour in public life in West Bengal. So, when I see graffiti that are acerbic and funny, I feel hopeful, said veteran cartoonist Chandi Lahiri. During the era of Bidhan Chandra Roy and Siddhartha Shankar Ray, we had the creative freedom to lampoon leaders of the ruling party. Most of my cartoons were used by opposition leaders for graffiti. But during Left rule, we were forced to exercise caution. This year, the satire seems better, more complex.A wall on East Behala constituency depicts the complexity Lahiri is talking about. A bus with route no 420 on it is depicted on a city road. Signage beside it says the bus goes to Narada and Saradha via Kalighat, where Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee lives. At a corner of the graffiti, bold letters say the Trinamool is so corrupt that no one will buy it even on OLX.This used to be the kind of graffiti that would adorn the walls of Bengal in the 1960s and 1970s. Lahiri gives the example of his favourite creation, a 1960 graffiti in Kolkata that showed a donkey refusing to eat rice offered by then state minister of food Prafulla Chandra Sen. The rice that we got in the market was of pitiful quality. It used to be full of kankar, or grit. We used to call that variety of rice kankarbati, he said.But during CPM rule, Lahiri had to think twice before designing any graffiti that then chief minister Jyoti Basu could deem offensive. Since I was a cartoonist with a leading Bengali newspaper, I was issued a press card. I used to visit the Assembly during sessions to observe the visage of leaders. However, after an anti-CPM graffiti of mine became particularly popular, the state refused to renew my press card, he said..Political graffiti are supposed to depict hard reality in a lighthearted manner, feels graphic novelist Sarnath Banerjee. Political graffiti is an example of true satire, he said. In Kolkata, we saw some really acerbic examples of them Historically, graffiti has always been a guerrilla art form. People from the fringes of society would express their dissent and mock mainstream society on walls.The themes of the graffiti of Trinamool and the opposition CPM and Congress also depict their campaigning tactics. While most CPM and Congress graffiti attack Mamata Banerjee on the Narada sting operation, the Sarada controversy and womens safety in the state, the Trinamools graffiti mock the alliance of CPM and Congress, once such bitter rivals in the state.In East Behala, a wall shows a harassed woman surrounded by names of places where rape cases were reported in the past few years  Park Street, Kamduni, Madhyamgram. One in Howrah depicts the Vivekananda flyover collapse.The slogan in Bengali reads, Trinamool has taken bribes, the flyover has come crashing down."
58f599bd7be9e01a357a3e7c,Rice and fall of great desi crop: India has lost 1.10 lakh traditional varieties,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Rice-and-fall-of-great-desi-crop-India-has-lost-110-lakh-traditional-varieties/articleshow/51861214.cms,2016-04-17,"Rice varieties that could grow during droughts or floods, tolerate saltwater, and carry distinct aromas or medicinal benefits - India has lost 1.10 lakh such traditional rice types. Some fifty years ago, these varieties abounded in the country, which is striving currently to ensure food security for all. Now, however, only 7,000odd local varieties remain and not all are grown.A traditional variety of rice is passed from generation to generation and family to family .""It took almost 12,000 years for these diverse varieties to be created,"" said Dr Debal Deb, a rice conservationist and a biologist.""We destroyed or lost them in just 30 years or so. This is the sad state of our heritage.""Deb has preserved 1,200 desi rice varieties, which were showcased in a unique two-day rice exhibition in Ahmedabad, organized by the Ahmedabad Heritage Venture Lab (AHVL). In all, 1,800 varieties were displayed at the exhibition.""Some varieties can grow without a single drop of water. Others can be grown in ponds that are 3 to 4 feet deep. A few grow even under 12 feet of water,"" Deb said. Rice varieties such as Jugal have two rice grains in one kernel, and Sateen has three.According to Deb, some traditional rice varieties have high levels of micronutrients. Despite billions of dollars of investment, companies have not been able to create genetically modified crop which can pack more micronu trients than the in digenous variants.The value of tradi tional varieties be comes even more important in the imate change, which wake of climate change, which results in shifting rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures.The availability of local varieties is crucial as modern agriculture relies only on limited varieties.Deb blames the green revolution and high yielding hybrid seeds for the extinction of traditional seeds. He also rued the fact that not a single government research institute has evinced interest in carrying out research on local rice varieties because they are not linked to gross domestic product or biotechnology .Since 1996, Deb has been engaged in conservation of hundreds of traditional rice varieties with his extensive germplasm-collection expeditions across 11 states of India.Deb has founded India's largest non-governmental rice gene bank called Vrihi (Sanskrit for rice) and has conserved 1,120 varieties in situ. He runs a research farm called Basudha in Odisha.Gujarat had over 250 varieties of milletA lthough Gujarat may not have many traditional rice varieties, over 250 indigenous varieties of millets were found in the state and most of them are lost now.O ut of the 1,200 varieties preserved and conserved by Deb, one traditional variety called `Garib Sal' has silver in it. This variety was found in one district of West Bengal. The rice was found to be have silver in it. This is the first time a plant was discovered where silver was absorbed from the land. However, this variety is not grown presently anywhere in the country. This type of rice may have been used for medicinal purposes. It is assumed that it was given to people gastric infections as silver kills germs. ""We came across this rice grain while looking for varieties having metals such as iron and zinc,"" Deb added."

As he puts the phone on hold, he quickly verifies the caller's location and voting rights in the state. The software in his computer then helps him narrow down the exact nature of the complaint: defacement of property, display of firearms, gift distribution, liquor and tobacco distribution, token distribution, et al.If it is about gift distribution, Mathu gives the complainant a few more options  is it distribution of cell phones, clothes and towels, gas cylinders, CFL bulbs, rice bags, or utensils? Once the complaint is registered in the control room located on the seventh floor of Fort St George Building in Chennai, the flying squad stationed nearest to the place of the alleged gift distribution gets an auto-generated text message. Mathu or any of his 39 colleagues in the control room of the state's chief electoral office can check the GPS-enabled map on the wall and verify whether the flying squad concerned is actually moving towards the location or not. ""Thanks to technology, our response time to a complaint has gone down from three hours earlier to three minutes in this election. We have about 700 flying squads in Tamil Nadu, but we have taken a call to increase it further. Also, we are deploying 400 income-tax officials to conduct raids, if necessary,"" says Rajesh Lakhoni, chief electoral officer of Tamil Nadu, adding that a deterrent environment is indispensable to contain the growing menace of cash and liquor used in elections. His office has further coordinated with telecom providers to look at mass mobile recharge among voters, and also held discussions with traders' associations to check token-in-lieu-of-cash, a practice often deployed by candidates to avoid large cash movement during elections.A flying squad, which comprises a team of enforcers from the police and income-tax department, is allowed to seize cash beyond Rs 50,000 carried by one person in a poll-bound state. In Tamil Nadu, where elections will be held only in the last phase, May 16, Rs 24.05 crore in cash was seized by flying squads till April 12, although some seized cash had been returned after it was proven that the money was not carried for poll-related reasons. The other poll-bound states are not lagging behind. For example, in Assam, where elections were over on April 11, Rs 12.33 crore was seized. In West Bengal where elections are on till May 5, Rs 11.96 crore in cash was seized whereas in Kerala, Rs 10.4 crore was seized till April 12.If the seizure during the 2014 parliamentary polls in these four states is considered, liquor and ganja are also a big menace, particularly in West Bengal and Assam. In West Bengal, 8.4 lakh litres of liquor and 1,396 kg of ganja were seized in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, whereas in Assam, the figure stood at 3.1 lakh litres of liquor and 566 kg of ganja, according to the data of the Election Commission of India. The data on liquor and ganja distributed in this round of polls is not readily available. Election commissioner Om Prakash Rawat concedes that those who are using black money in elections are ""creative people"" and one step ahead of the EC machinery chasing them. In a first, this time, the EC has spotted instances of ambulances being used for carrying cash.Rawat does not rule out the use of foreign money in Indian elections. ""Until we catch someone, we can't say money from foreign nations also flows in during elections. But I don't rule out the possibility altogether.... In West Bengal, we have caught a hawala transaction this time. Fake currency notes were also recovered by our flying squads both in Assam and West Bengal,"" he says.As this writer travelled in three of the four election-bound states  Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu  and interacted with political parties, candidates and voters  two things emerged very clearly. First, the use of cash and liquor is a common practice across states going to elections, and the state machinery is nowhere near the culprits. Second, distribution of cash in Tamil Nadu, in particular, is much more organised and open than in other states, something which forced the EC to deploy more forces in that state, including 400 additional I-T officials with a mandate to raid houses. Flying squads are not authorised to undertake raids in houses.The Chennai-based secretariat of Tamil Nadu's chief electoral officer, Lakhoni, has been receiving about 6,000 calls every day, out of which about 200 are pure complaints, the rest being queries and suggestions. If the statistics on cash and gift distribution are factored in, the process of bribing the voters in Tamil Nadu has begun early this time.Between March 4 and April 9, as many as 45 complaints in Tamil Nadu were on distribution of clothes, towels and dhotis, 61 were on liquor, 151 on money distribution, 6 on distribution of ornaments and 61 on ""other gifts"". Remember, on April 9, not all candidates were finalised; nomination process was yet to begin and elections were over a month away.The creativity of the culprits comes to the fore when the complainants tell EC officials about the modus operandi for the distribution of cash. As on April 9, Tamil Nadu saw three cases of cash distribution through milkmen, a practice generally deployed by candidates only in the last few days of the poll. Then, there were six cases where newspaper hawkers were roped in to distribute cash, and in two other cases, cash reached voters along with tobacco products. Former MP and DMK secretary TKS Elangovan says his party does not indulge in cash distribution to woo voters though there were complaints against the party that it recharged the mobile phones of voters in Madurai area during the last assembly polls. ""I deny any charge of the DMK distributing money. This election will be fought on issues, not money power. The voters this time won't favour the AIADMK even if it distributes money"", he says. ET Magazine could not elicit a response from the AIADMK.The voters do acknowledge that political parties resort to distributing cash and gifts to woo them. ""Yes, various methods are used to get votes. Many voters take the decision only at the last minute,"" says E Thangavelu, 53, who worked in a Royal Enfield bike factory in Ranipet in Tamil Nadu before joining his wife's flower shop in the temple town of Kanchipuram. He repeatedly says that he has never taken any ""bribe from political agents"" and will not do so this time either. Saravanan, 42, who sells saris in Kanchipuram, concedes that ""token system"" was prevalent in earlier elections. ""I have heard there are stringent rules this time. Many shopkeepers may not accept tokens this time,"" he says. The voters are usually given tokens for denominations like Rs 500, Rs 1,000 etc, with which they can buy anything from designated shops in the locality. The candidates, through their middlemen, later settle the debt with shopkeepers. For EC's enforcement agencies, the tokens have posed a bigger challenge than the movement of hard cash. After all, they are trained to seize cash, not tackle tokens."
5904b0137be9e04154dfa6ba,"Mamata faces a fight: But in north Bengal, the rural impoverished talk positively about Trinamool",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Addictions/mamata-faces-a-fight-but-in-north-bengal-the-rural-impoverished-talk-positively-about-trinamool/,2016-04-21,"Writing on elections in West Bengal is a delicate affair. In Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, voters generally speak up with enthusiasm on who they will vote for and why. Its a different story in a state where political violence has claimed thousands of lives over the last four decades. Hinterland common folk are uneasy about revealing their preference. A dozen variations of the expression, dekhte hobe (well have to see), is what one gets to hear.In a climate of fierce political partisanship, where one is often forced to choose sides, staying anonymous looks like a safer option for survival. Even so, journeying through the picture-postcard villages of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and the stunted expanse of Malda district in north Bengal, one gathers that the Mamata Banerjee government enjoys a fairly positive rating among the rural impoverished.Several marginalised farmers and daily wagers admit to benefiting from state welfare schemes. According to them, PDS functions better than ever. Rice is readily available for Rs 2 (shades of Raman Singhs Chhattisgarh government here) and atta for Rs 3.50 a kg.Like Bihars Nitish Kumar government in its previous avatar, the TMC government has distributed thousands of bicycles among needy school students. These bicycles, painted a political shade of blue, stand out. Miles of roads in rural areas have been laid with fresh tar.Many would love to lump Mamata alongside Lalu Prasad, a mass leader hardly associated with progress. But evidence shows she is closer to the development-driven Nitish. Its possible to argue that TMC lacks a long-term vision for the state. But in contrast to the small-town and mofussil middle-class who are less than satisfied with TMCs five-year performance, the underprivileged in north Bengals countryside have generally positive things to say about her tenure. This class also seems relatively indifferent to the scams (Saradha, Rose Valley) that have put Mamatas party on the backfoot in recent weeks.Throughout north Bengal, flags of the Left parties and Congress flutter on trees and poles like conjoined twins. The erstwhile bitter rivals are new comrades-in-arms. Political alliances, for all their compulsions and contradictions, can be electoral master strokes. Last year, for instance, when RJD supremo Lalu and JD(U)s Nitish rediscovered each other to combat BJP, Bihars caste calculus tilted decisively in favour of the two Mandalites and a piggybacking Congress.In Bengal, this is the question everybody wants a definitive answer to: Is the Left-Congress alliance working on the ground as it unofficially did during the Siliguri municipal elections last year? What one can say for sure is that the unlikely union has energised the duos cadres and party workers, hugely demoralised after the thrashing in the 2011 state polls and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The jot (alliance) and the fervent wish that it can synergise votes is the hook both parties have hung their hopes on.Any election is also about managing public perception. In that regard, the pact has reasonably succeeded. The allies are sharing stage, attending mohalla booth meetings, even occasionally shouting Inquilab Zindabad together. At least publicly, theres a show of unity.But will party workers of both Congress and Left Front, divided for years by ideology and memories of hate, be honest to that public show of bonding inside the polling booth? It appears that a fair percentage of vote transfer among party workers could happen on that account. And thats primarily because theres an increasing realisation that another electoral setback could be ruinous to their future.However, the same may not hold true for the ordinary party voter, who might walk his own line. Most pre-election opinion polls have given a majority to TMC, in greater or lesser degree. But the alliance, boosted by the surround sound of those who benefited during the 34 years of Left rule, has partially dented the self-confidence of TMC. Whether it is enough to alter the final outcome is another matter.Amidst this battle for the top slot, BJP has marked its physical presence far and deep. From the lush hamlets of Jalpaiguri to the water-parched villages of Malda district to the forest areas of Alipurduar, the saffron flag can be seen in most corners of north Bengal.In the 2014 Lok Sabha poll where BJP got 17.02% votes, pundits attributed the surge to the Modi wave. Thats partly true. Over the years, RSS as well as its political wing have set up base in dozens of villages. Shakhas are common.Broadly speaking, their support base includes sections of SCs (rajbonshis, namasudras), a small portion of STs, parts of the non-Bengali population and the anti-Left, anti-Congress middle class. The party stands a chance in Baisnabnagar and Kalchini assembly seats. Its vote-share should be far higher than the 4.06% it got in 2011 assembly polls. However, the 17% peak of LS 2014 could still be a bridge too far. BJP is a party in search of an articulate and widely-accepted local leader.PS: Another saffron votary is making his presence visibly felt. His visage can be seen outside every shop peddling his goods even in the border outposts of north Bengal. No other businessman comes close. Guess who? Baba Ramdev."
58f5b4117be9e01a17c9f384,Trinamool dominates in Satgachia — Jyoti Basu’s constituency,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Trinamool-dominates-in-Satgachia-Jyoti-Basus-constituency/articleshow/51935488.cms,2016-04-22,"SATGACHIA: Jyoti Basu was the Left Front's legendary longest serving chief minister of Bengal. He was also MLA from Satgachia constituency. A little over 50 kms south of Kolkata, today Satgachia remembers Jyoti Babu well but perhaps not very fondly. ""I used to see him at election time, giving speeches in the maidan. But he hardly ever came here. He used to say, 'I am the chief minister of all of Bengal, why should I favour Satgachia just because its my constituency?'"" remembers 77 year old Premchand Deshmukh, a former jute mill worker.Bustling town markets and idyllic village scenes make up Satgachia's picturesque landscape. Dotted with ponds and fields, shaded with coconut, palm, banana and supari trees, krishnachura flowers in full bloom, Satgachia could be the ideal pastoral water colour.Satgachia was one of the first CPM bastions to fall to the Trinamool in 2001, part of the great momentum in which Red stalwarts fell like ninepins in Mamata's anti Left purge. In 2014, 9-time CPM winner Basudeb Acharia humiliatingly lost Bankura to actor Moon Moon Sen. In Barrackpore the 20 year reign of CPM heavyweight Tarit Baran Topdar was brought down by the TMC's Dinesh Trivedi. Satgachia too is part of that pattern. Today the constituency has been represented 3 times by the TMC's Sonali Guha. ""When we ring her up even late at night, she always comes rushing. We could never think of doing that with Jyoti Babu,"" says medical doctor Sheikh Arab Ali. ""He was like a rainbow. We could look at him but not touch him.""""Can anyone forget the great Jyoti Basu?"" asks former Jute mill worker Shankar Pramanik. ""He created something in Satgachia out of nothing. But its the Trinamool which has given us pakka roads, tubewells, ambulance services and a hospital. Jyoti Basu only started the drinking water plant which was completed by the Trinamool.""Left cadres ruled Satgachia with an iron grip from 1996 to 2001, a control that was so total that Jyoti Basu could win in 1977, 82,87,93, 98 without even spending too much time here. The constituency was managed by his deputy Gokul Bairagi, a widely disliked figure who subsequently contested and lost against the TMC. The only photos or remembrances of Jyoti Basu in Satgachia are in the CPM office. Black and white snaps of the forbidding Red supremo in all his stern unsmiling hauteur hang on the walls although the new generation of party workers say they don't remember him at all.""We don't really remember Jyoti Basu, but we do know that when he started representing Satgachia there was nothing here,"" says 28 year old CPM zonal in charge Bishwanath Panja. ""There was never a corruption syndicate in his time as there is now. Jyoti Basu never pushed himself here because the Left doesn't believe in personality cults the way the TMC does.""Tarun Ray, zila parishad official and TMC member says during Jyoti Basu's time the residents of Satgachia were constantly deprived. ""There was no electricity. When the power went off, we would all say Jyoti Basu chole gelen. We saw electricity as rarely as we saw Jyoti Basu."" That is why, he says, TMC wins today by 25,000 to 30,000 votes.Lack of personal contact with voters, reliance on the party machine to deliver victories, a zealous attachment to de-humanising ideology, the familiar pattern of the Left's joyless pulverizing politics plays out in Satgachia as well. Remembers 74 year old Binarani Naskar, ""Jyoti babu had a lot of stamina, he used to walk very fast. But he never sat with us or drank chai with us. Only CPM workers used to control our lives. Today when Mamata comes here she talks to us.""The consistent complaint from Satgachia residents is the lack of job opportunities. Says resident Ankur Bera, ""people in Satgachia are still living by farming and agriculture. There is only one Birla jute mill nearby and that too we never know when its closed or open. There are two schools. But where will young educated people go for jobs?""Voters here say they are proud that Satgachia was Jyoti Babu's constituency although they never felt they belonged to him. ""The Left did not believe in joga-jog (personal contact) with people. Jyoti Babu would come by helicopter and leave,"" says schoolteacher Aparna Pramanik. ""The footsoldiers of the Left were horrible,"" remembers Sheikh Afzal Durji, ""they can never win again here.""In the 'lal durg' or red fortress of Satgachia, today the Trinamool is triumphant. Says farmer Paresh Manna, 70, ""We get rice for Rs 2 from the TMC. The Left used to talk about big things but never did anything."" Says local journalist Kunal Malik, ""If Leftists are supposed to care about the poor then Didi is the true Leftist."""

Gone with them are a host of matinee memories, writes Priyanka DasguptaKolkata: Mini was born two months ago. Days after her birth, her mother was killed in a road accident. Since then, her address is the plastic chair that stands guard in front of the defunct booking counters of Mahua cinema. While Mini curls up on the chair at night, Bishnu Deb Roy and his mother Gayatri Devi sleep on the floor. Mini, the orphaned cat, shares the roof along with the caretaker-cum-gatekeeper of this south Kolkata cinema that downed shutters last year.Welcome to the world of 26 leftover single-screen theatres in Kolkata, which are closing down at a pace that doesn't care for speed-breakers. Welcome to the world that can't match up to the glitz of multiplexes. Welcome to the world of abandoned show reels and empty projection rooms.Last year saw 40 single screen theatres in Bengal closing down. It was at the peak of summer last year  on May 28, to be precise  that Mahua downed its shutters. In the week before its final closure, a cruel joke would do the rounds. The last film to be screened there was 'Belaseshe', the Soumitra Chatterjee-Swatilekha Sengupta starrer. This quirk doesn't escape the 50-year-old Bishnu. ""How ironical that this film should have marked the 'bela sesh' (end of days) for the theatre too. 'Belaseshe' is one name I will never forget. It brought such a sense of closure,"" he smiles wryly, eyes glistening as he walks past the debris, leading the way into what used to once be a favourite entertainment destination for many south Kolkatans.Today, the theatre can almost be mistaken as a set for Mrinal Sen's 'Khandahar'. Just ahead of Gate No. 1 that once led viewers inside is a small earthen oven. The wooden frames that weren't sold off as scrap are now used by Gayatri to light the oven. The fire simmers long enough to let the 75-year-old boil some rice as she stares at the empty auditorium. Her husband used to work here as a mason before the hall opened on February 4, 1977. ""It was an open door for us. There wasn't a single day when I didn't watch a film. In between my household chores, I would catch a few scenes. I never watched a film at one go. But it was fun that way,"" she says.Today, time stands still. The auditorium looks barren. First, the workable machines of the projection room were sold off. Then the AC machine, transformer and generator. Even the plaster of Paris tiles from the ceiling were hammered down. The chairs were sold. What remains as relics are the sponges, torn from the seats. ""A single tile would take 25 days to make. And here, they hammered it down in minutes. When they first starting dismantling, I couldn't even enter the auditorium. Each blow of the hammer seemed to strike my heart,"" Bishnu says.Mother and son wept like inconsolable babies after the final curtains came down after the last show at the theatre. The huge curtain in front has also been removed. Someone told them that a scrap dealer might sell it off to some small-time caterer to make use of as a curtain. But what about that screen? ""Maybe someone somewhere will use it for projections in a village..."" Bishnu's voice trails off.Upstairs in the projection room, nothing much remains, except for some torn bunches of unsold tickets and film reels. Bishnu uncoils one and holds it against the warm April sunlight filtering through the ventilator. At first glance, it's difficult to recognize who the stars are. It's only after a good 15 minutes that he identifies it as a reel from the Amitabh-Rekha starrer 'Silsila'. ""The film had a good run here. Today, all that is just memory,"" he says, rubbing his eyes.The story is no different at most single-screen theatres in the city  Grace, Purno, Ujjawala, Sree have all shut down. Sixty-year-old Chandan Datta had joined as a chief camera operator at Grace on College Street on February 10, 1985. Four years back, when Chandan heard that the hall would close down, he felt like being stranded in the epicentre of an earthquake. ""Before my job, I had to take a verbal, written and medical examination conducted by the government to get my licence. The job of a camera operator was backbreaking, and I had to be on my toes to make sure the two machines were in order. While one reel would run for 17- to 20-odd minutes, I had to keep the other machine ready. The moment one reel got over, I had to start operating the next reel in the other machine. Unless there was a power shutdown, no time loss was allowed in the switchover,"" Chandan says.The job demanded a lot of precision and a sense of responsibility. Once the theatre shut down and digital cinema started taking over, Chandan started adapting himself to another profession. Now, he works at the Bina cinema, where he operates the computers that have movies uploaded on a server. ""This work is less strenuous. One needs a little bit of education to be able to operate the computer and check whether the film is in running condition once the hard disk is uploaded,"" he says. But, once in a while, he still walks along Mahatma Gandhi Road. ""My heart aches when I see the building. People like us don't own the theatres but we put in our blood and sweat to keep it running. Way before I joined, I had heard stories of Dharmendra and Hema Malini coming over to Grace, he says. Today, only a structure plastered with ads remain. Only the address written on the hoarding advertising a computer centre has mention of Grace Cinema as a landmark.Stories about single screen theatres were inspiration for Kaushik Ganguly to pen the script of his soon-to-release 'Cinemawalla'. However, one person he never bumped into while scripting was 43-year-old Pinku Das.Interestingly enough, Das' life story is what movies can be made of. He was an usher at Ujjala in 1986-'87. ""I always wanted to make movies. In order to support my family, I joined as a staff member at Ujjala. Sometimes, I would usher in people. On other days, I would sit at the booking counter. But the owners were very helpful and they allowed me to sit in a room on the third floor and pen scripts,"" Das says. He claims to have penned 11 scripts and one script for a Hindi serial, too. ""I also wrote Satabdi Roy's debut feature film, 'Amar Bandhan', and Prosenjit's directorial debut, 'Purushottam'. When Ujjala was folding up, I had already started directing my first feature film titled 'Eri Naam Jibon' starring Victor Banerjee, Sandhya Roy, Sreelekha and Jisshu. Unfortunately, it got stuck in a legal hassle and hasn't yet seen light of day,"" he says.When Ujjala shut down, Das felt his career as a film director would sail him through. ""But that never happened. I am still struggling. Yes, it feels bad that single-screen theatres are closing down. But what can be done? One has to just adapt to the times. The silver lining is that cinema has survived,"" he says.Even those working for the management feel the pangs of something getting lost forever when the owners are forced to take a decision to shut theatres down. Many insist that once the lights are turned off after the last show, the feeling is like that on the night of Bijoya Dashami... only this is no festival that will return next year. Gobindo Roy, who has worked as executive producer for producer R D Bansal, has long been associated with theatres like Sree, Uttara, Ujjala and Purabi. The last film to be screened at Sree was 'Aashraya'. It was on October 31, 2000. On the same day, Uttara closed down with 'Khauf'. Purabi downed shutters only recently, on April 1. ""I felt like a father whose daughter had just been married off,"" Roy says.It's tough to adjust to the vacuum. Roy recalls that the last show at Ujjala was of 'Tomar Amar Prem' on February 3, 2005. After the show, there is a gnawing feeling of emptiness. One suddenly realizes that one is no longer required to send bills to the amusement tax authority. There isn't anyone to even enquire, 'Ki boi lagchhe? (What movie is running?)'But time has a way of mellowing down the pain. One understands the constraints of owners who run losses of over Rs 1 lakh to simply sustain a theatre each month. ""Some cinemas have litigation problems and lease issues too. Over the years, the attitude of staff has also changed. Earlier, they would feel a sense of attachment towards the theatre. With time, that grew less,"" Roy explains.Arijit Dutta, the owner of Priya, Art Gallery (Jalpaiguri), Netaji Subhas Sadan (Baidyabati), Balaka (Ilambazar), Vidyasagar (Ghuskara) and Vidyasagar (Balurghat), says single screen theatres in Bengal are shutting down like a pack of cards. He is suffering 'disastrously' for all his single screen theatres in the districts. ""For the last three years, Priya is being forced to bear the losses of my five other theatres in the districts. Ten years ago, the Left Front government had given us permission to recover service charge and reduced the taxes. We were given a tax exemption on modernisation/upgrade. We expected the present government to increase the service charge amount and abolition of the government duty on electricity. The government has to realise that single screen is the backbone of regional cinema. Unfortunately, it is only bothered about stars and directors. Cinema halls are too non-glamorous for our government.""Kaushik Sen, the owner of Debasree in Barrackpore, remembers that the hall was established in 1991 with a capacity of 1400. ""There was a time when films like 'Chrodini... Tumi Je Amar' ran for 20 weeks. But after 2010, there was a major dip in sales. The audience just didn't turn up to watch Bengali cinema. I was running a loss of 1 lakh per week. Sometimes, films were pulled down mid-week too. In 2013, the hall was razed to the ground,"" Sen says.For 30-something Shafiqul Islam Shabaz, the last New Year's Eve was the worst day in his life. Shabaz, part-partner of Tasweer Mahal at the Rajabazar crossing, was in mourning while the rest of the city was partying. December 31, 2015, was the day the last film was screened at the theatre. Escalating costs, dip in sales figures and not enough funds to pay staff salaries were some of the reasons Shabaz decided to close it down.Shabaz's friends had proposed to have a party at the theatre after the last screening of a Bhojpuri movie. But he just couldn't bring himself to agree. Mutton biryani can't be gulped down while bidding adieu to a theatre that had been witness to countless happy and sad moments in his life. Shabaz excused himself. His friends had understood, and shifted their party venue elsewhere. ""It was too sentimental for me. There were just 40 people who came for the last show. I recorded video footage of them leaving the auditorium after the movie was over,"" he says.That night, he was unable to control his tears. 2016 began on a sad note. Since that day, he has played the video just once. But reliving the moment of closure is difficult to handle. ""My grandfather was the owner. I used to come to this theatre with my father. When I was in school, it was such a grand affair to be the grandson of a theatre-owner. I'd often get requests from friends who wanted free tickets. It felt good to oblige as well,"" he recalls.After 'Sholay' released, it had run here for 50 weeks at this theatre. 'Coolie' had played for 30 and 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' for 15 weeks in a row. Mithun Chakraborty had dropped by at the theatre when 'Jallaad' was being screened. The day 'Raja Hindustani' played, Shabaz had done his first booking. ""It was the big day of my life and the film ran for houseful for two weeks straight. The film had run for 12 weeks,"" he recalls proudly.But when multiplexes came up around 2005 onwards, the sales dropped drastically. To cut costs, the original staff strength came down from 40 to a meagre six. December 31 was the day when everyone bid the hall a teary farewell.Once in a while, Shabaz now drops by at the theatre. Some accounts-related work need to be taken care of. There are some payments to be made. Well-wishers from his neighbourhood sometimes share his sentiments while rueing the closure. They are as nostalgic as Shabaz, though they know it's difficult to pull along while running in huge losses. Shabaz's nine-year-old daughter too understands that loss. But for her, the glitz of a multiplex can compensate. Shabaz's emotions are still raw.A sweeper comes once in 10 days to dust. Shabaz isn't sure what he will do with the property now. But he has one grand plan left. One day, he will walk inside the theatre and sink into the seat again. For one last time, he will relive the experience of watching a movie there. If possible, he will fetch a print of 'Raja Hindustani' and watch it all by himself in the entire theatre... not alone, but with a myriad emotions to keep him company.ARUNA40/2 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata - 9Opening Date: 21.2.1949Opening film: AjitGLOBE7E, Lindsay Street, Kolkata - 16Opening Date: 23.11.1922Opening Film: A Sporting Double (Silent)Previous Name: Opera HouseGRACE91, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata - 07Opening Date: 11.12.1953Previous Name: Alfred Theatre, Natya Bharati, Deepak and Mitra TheatreLIGHTHOUSE2, HUmayun Place, Kolkata - 13Opening Date: 24.10.1938Opening Film: FantasiaLOTUS106A SN Banerjee Road, Kolkata - 14Opening Date: 26.9.58Opening Film: SadhanaPrevious Name: AnjanMETRO5 Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kolkata - 13Opening Date: 05.12.1935Opening Film: Bonemian GirlsMINERVA (CHAPLIN)Chowringhee Place, Kolkata - 13Opening Date: 28.02.1969 (re-opened)Opening Film: The Taming of the ShrewPrevious Name: Elphinstone Picture Palace, Madan BioscopePURABI40/1, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata - 09Opening Date: 14.08.1936PURNA4, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, Kolkata - 25Opening Date: 14.10.1921Previous Name: Paris Cinema & Varieties Ltd., Russa TheatreSREE1382, Bidhan Sarani, Kolkata - 04Opening Date: 18.03.36 (renamed)Opening Film: Queen of the JunglePrevious Name: Cornwallis TheatreTIGER19, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kolkata - 13Previous Name: Picture House, Plaza, Gaiti TheatreUJJALA14, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, Kolkata - 26Opening Date: 12.01.1946Opening Film: The Bathing Beauty"

(Express Photo by Subham Dutta) The body of Sheikh Fazal Haque, a CPM polling agent who was killed Thursday night, reaches his village Friday. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Simmering tension in a West Bengal village split in two political halves erupted on Thursday night when a CPI(M) worker and a polling agent of the party were allegedly hacked to death by TMC supporters, hours after voting ended in the third phase of Assembly elections in the state.According to police and residents of Lodhna village in the Khandaghosh Assembly constituency of Bardhaman, polling agent Sheikh Fazal Haque (56) and Dukhi Ram Dal (56) were attacked with lathis and iron rods as they were returning home at about 8 pm on Thursday.The two were rushed to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital but died soon after, police said.While both parties blamed each other for the clash that led to the killings, police officers traced the violence to a political upheaval in 2011 when the TMC made deep inroads into what had been a Left stronghold since 1942.So much so, that Lodhna, on the banks of the Damodar river, has since split into two halves  Gainpara, comprising TMC sympathisers, and Metepara, which has stuck with the Left. Haque and Dal were from Metepara. Thursdays attack took place on a narrow bridge connecting Gainpara and Metepara, said police.After an explosion, it seems Haque tried to flee but got entangled in some netting on the edge of a field and was killed there. Dal was chased for a while and then hacked, said Sub-Inspector Mohammad Saifuddin, who was on duty in the area at the time of the incident.One live bomb and residue from several exploded bombs were later recovered from the site, said police.According to a senior police officer, tension escalated after CPI(M)s sitting MLA Nabin Chandra Bag moved to the TMC last November and announced that he would be contesting the Assembly elections.In 2011, the TMC had won 15 of the 25 Assembly seats from the district, with the Congress winning one and the Left Front taking eight. This time, with the Left-Congress alignment threatening to eat into the ruling partys tally, the TMC has been desperate to retain control. While 40-year-old Bag bagged the TMC ticket this time, 30-year-old Asima Roy was the CPI(M) candidate from Khandaghosh, a reserved constituency.A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo) A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo)Here, politics isnt something that ends with elections. The party high command has promised us that we will win in this election. So we are fighting for our party, doing what we can. This is a fight for survival. If TMC wins the elections, we will be killed, said Bijoy Dal, the 35-year-old son of Dukhi Ram Dal.Violence is a way of life here, said an officer at the Khandaghosh police station. This village is notorious for its production of hand-made guns, bombs and fake gold coins. Earlier, when the Left was in power, such villages in Khandaghosh were impossible to enter, he said, adding that three TMC workers were killed during clashes in the Khandaghosh area last June.Most of the villagers at Lodhna  part of West Bengals rice belt  are descendants of sharecroppers who were given land in the 1970s as part of land reforms pioneered by the Left. Being a CPI(M) worker in a village like this used to be a job in itself. It was something we could fall back on in case of emergencies. That changed with the TMC coming into power. So many people are now joining the TMC and voting for them, said Mohammad Rafique, a 65-year-old farmer.Family members of the two killed on Thursday and CPI(M) workers in the village alleged that Haque and Dal were returning home after polling when they were ambushed by over 100 TMC workers armed with knives, sticks, iron rods and bombs.But police said the deaths were caused by clashes between both parties. The CPI(M) workers tried to attack TMC workers but were ambushed instead. No arrests have been made. But we have detained four men and are questioning those who were present there. We will investigate the matter, said Deputy Superintendent of Police D Bhattacharya.But family members of the deceased alleged that police failed to heed repeated warnings of an impending attack by TMC supporters. I had warned police that there would be violence. They are cooking up this story of us attacking them. The simple fact is we dont have the kind of numbers anymore to pull off an attack. About a month ago, I was attacked and had my ribs fractured. The police did nothing, alleged Dal.TMC candidate Bag and the partys block president Alok Majhi denied allegations of their workers involvement in the violence.Describing the attack, SI Saifuddin said, It was very dark about a 100-odd men appeared with knives and bombs. Apart from me, there were five other personnel from the Central armed forces. We were hopelessly outnumbered. We tried to disperse them with a lathi-charge but couldnt.What has added to the resentment among CPI(M) supporters in the village is the discovery of a live bomb from the site almost 20 hours after the attack. The bomb, weighing about 250 gm, was spotted by a TV journalist, said police.Even after we informed police about the bomb, it took them about another half an hour to remove it, alleged Ayesha Begum, a local resident.Said SI Saifuddin, I checked the site myself and found nothing. It is possible the bomb may have been placed later by some mischievous elements.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It is our commitment. The case is in the Supreme Court. You will get justice. There is no cause for worry, the Trinamool Congress supremo said while addressing an election meeting here in Hooghly district.As long as I am alive there will not be any injustice to you. We will continue to give rice at Rs. 2 per kg, she said asking Did the CPI (M), the Congress and the BJP bother to look after you ?Tata Motors had shifted their Nano car plant to Gujarat from Singur in the face of Ms. Banerjees fierce movement against forcible farmland acquisition.After coming to power in 2011, the Mamata Banerjee government hand enacted Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011, that allowed it to reclaim the 400 acres land given to Tata Motors.The Act was, however, struck down by Calcutta High Court.

Accusing them of inaction, Sonia warned against 'ahankari shaktiyan' (arrogant forces) lurking in Bengal.""We supported Trinamool Congress in 2011after they promised to work for the development of Bengal. However, after coming to power, Mamata dumped all her promises. Now, she is beating her drum on development. What kind of development has taken place in this state? Industries have wound up and unemployment is rampant. Youths are migrating to other states in search of jobs. There is corruption. A flyover came crashing down. People have loan burdens worth thousands of crores on their heads. There is a saying that one fish can foul the entire pond. In West Bengal, the atmosphere has been fouled in such a manner that even the hilsa has fled from its rivers. Now, the state has to import hilsa,"" Sonia said.At Canning in South 24-Parganas, where the majority of the population depends of fishing and agriculture, the Congress chief spoke on how fishermen have suffered under Mamata and Modi.""While Mamata has left the fishermen to their own plight, the BJP at the Centre is snatching their livelihood by allowing foreign trawlers to fish in Indian waters. When the Modi government has been unable to save the country's fish, how can it be expected to protect the borders? The Pathankot incident is an example. Bengal also led the country in rice production. Now, rice mills are closing down and the state has to import rice. Both Mamata and Modi assured jobs but nearly 3 crore people still apply for jobs under MGNREGA every day. This shows that there are no jobs. All that the Modi government has done is cut allocations for our policies for women and backward classes,"" Sonia added.According to her, the Modi government is a threat to democracy, secularism and the multi-cultural ethos of the country. She claimed that it was the Congress that set up institutions that made the country great over 60 years of its rule. These institutions are now at threat from organisations like the RSS, she alleged. ""Before the Trinamool came to power, they begged for votes. Now, they are threatening people to vote for them. Both Mamata and Modi are two faces of the same coin. They will destroy the state. Do not fall into their trap. We are fighting the elections with the Left this time for the development of West Bengal,"" Sonia said."

Archive photo A reliever polling agent at a booth in Salt Lake, Bidhannagar, where elections took place on Monday. Archive photoOfficials engaged with the ongoing assembly election have been carrying out their duties under sweltering heat and with bare minimum facilities amid looming threat from workers of nearly all political parties.Speaking to The Indian Express, several poll officials recounted the circumstances under which they have been working since the polling began last month, with many claiming that the work often puts their lives at risk.The security provided by the central or state police forces exists only during the day. As soon as we deposit the EVMs (electronic voting machines), we are on our own. The government, at most, arranges for a vehicle that drops us to the railway station where we often end up spending the night since no trains are available at such late hours, said Swapan Kumar Biswas, an employee of the customs department who oversaw polling at one of the booths in Entally constituency on April 2.Biswas, like many others, was alluding to threats from workers since our work involves taking several steps against the interest of political parties.I feel the government could provide us with adequate security until we have reached our home safe, he said.Aside from the threats, officials complain about the lack of basic facilities such as fans and tube lights and clean washrooms.The washrooms at most of the places where we are posted are in such bad condition that we avoid eating food altogether. I didnt eat for two days and lived only on puffed rice and some biscuits, said Partha Sarathi Das, an employee of National Sample Survey Office who was the micro observer at Sandeshkhali in North-24 Parganas where polling took place on April 25.Govinda Purkait, the presiding officer at a booth inside Gypsy Mission School in South Kolkata for the polling on April 21, said the booth did not even have a fan when he took charge there. The temperature outside was crossing 40 degrees. When I reported it, a huge pedestal fan was brought in but it had no regulator. It kept lying in one corner of the room for the entire time I was there, he said.Manir Hossain, a teacher with a government school, said he had arrived at the booth in Rajarhat on April 24 and had to spend the night there but couldnt sleep because of the mosquitoes.Another micro observer, posted at Khandaghosh in Burdwan district, said on the condition of anonymity that there was only a 60 Watt bulb inside the polling station with no basic facilities. We were afraid even to ask people for food and water as that could be considered as taking favours from political parties, he said. The observer also said workers of some political parties had alluded to rigging the polls. If we intervene, we put our lives at risk; if we dont, we are showcaused by the Election Commission, he added.The Election Commission, which has come under the attack from several quarters over the violence during the polling, offers little help to the officials in charge of overseeing the polling. It is not possible for us to provide round the clock security to all of them, said Dibyendu Sarkar, additional Chief Electoral Officer.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE"
592334ff7be9e01fd59ad2c0,Amit Shah roars in Mamata Banerjee backyard: Her 5 years worse than Left’s 34 years,http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-elections-amit-shah-roars-in-mamata-banerjee-backyard-her-5-years-worse-than-lefts-34-years-2773651/,2016-04-28,"Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons. Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons.Tearing into the ruling Trinamool Congress government, BJP national president Amit Shah on Wednesday said the Mamata Banerjee-led dispensation was worse than the previous Left rule.Five years ago people of Bengal voted for a change because it was required to end the 34 years of misrule by the Left. But after five years we see that the TMC government had been worse than the Communist rule. Now they want another change, Shah said while addressing a public rally at Bhawanipur constituency from where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting.Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons. He said the Trinamool government could have cancelled the contract for building if, as they said, they were unhappy with the project.The flyover didnt fall down due to wind. It collapsed because of the syndicate. All materials  cement, iron, etc are supplied by Trinamool. The flyover is a symbol of corruption, he alleged.Syndicate is a racket for milking builders in the name of supplying inferior construction materials at a premium by people backed by political parties.Continuing his attack against the Mamata government, Shah said the TMC had changed the names of many central schemes and claimed they were being sponsored by the state government. Jan Dhan Yojana is being touted as a state government scheme as is the Rs 2-per-kg rice for the poor. The fact that the Centre pays a subsidy of Rs 27 a kg of rice is never spoken of, he charged.Further, he said, I dont know what else Mamata is but the whole country knows that she is a great painter whose work had been sold for over Rs 1 crore, likely bought by those involved in the Saradha scam .Slamming the Congress-CPM alliance in West Bengal, Shah said that while Rahul Gandhi and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee were sharing stage here, they were criticising each other in Kerala. It proves that these parties are not for any principles but only for their political interests, to retain their seats, he said.The CPM-Congress poll understanding is not a joth (alliance) but a ghot (nexus). We are waiting to see what these parties do in Rajya Sabha, Shah added.Urging people to vote for Netajis grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who is the BJP candidate from Bhawanipur constituency, Shah said, This is your opportunity to pay tribute to Netaji. Defeating the TMC in this seat can change the whole state as CMs loss at her home turf will send the required message across the state.If voted to power, Shah claimed that BJP would stop infiltration from neighbouring Bangladesh into West Bengal. Neither Trinamool nor CPM stopped infiltration of Bangladeshis to India as it is part of their agenda for creating votebank, he said.The BJP president said the party wants fencing along the porous Indo-Bangladesh border to stop infiltration. If the BJP forms its government here, not even one Bangladeshi can enter India (illegally). That is why we had a border agreement with Bangladesh. We want fencing in the border so that there is no infiltration, he said.Ahead of Shahs speech, BJP national secretary and co-convenor for Bengal Sidharth Nath Singh reiterated his trademark quote Bhaag Mamata Bhaag, and said he has vowed to ensure that Mamata is ousted in this Assembly election.Actor-turned-MP Paresh Rawal, who also shared the stage with Shah, said that similar to the previous UPA government which had let all the agencies loose against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, Mamata too has conspired against the Opposition here. They hate the Modi government so much that when they got nothing against him, they coined a word called intolerance and instigated student leaders in the conspiracy, he said.Former state BJP president and national secretary Rahul Sinha alleged that Mamata was not taking any action against her party leaders named in the Saradha and Narada sting cases because she would end up in jail.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But after Mamatas rally Tuesday, anger too is setting in.She said she has been giving rice at Rs 2 per kg to all residents of enclaves. Thats a lie, said Jaynal Abedin, 24, Alis grandson. We havent even got 200 gm rice at that price, let alone a kilogram. Those in the camps who have come from Bangladesh and are being hosted by the Indian government, they are the ones getting free rice.Mamata conceded in her speech Tuesday that there are demands even in the enclaves and if re-elected she promised to deal with all demands. But its this growing discontent that the Opposition is eager to play on. The 9,776 new voters are spread across five constituencies, the highest number concentrated in Dinhata at 5,486. The Forward Blocs Akshay Thakur has accused the BJP-led central government and the Trinamool Congress of betraying the residents of enclaves while TMC candidate Udayan Guha, who switched from the Forward Bloc, credited Mamata with rescuing those who lived in these enclaves.Who cares what they say, Asgar Ali said. Let me explain something. I have seen a lot of things and I dont always remember all of it but I do remember one night, when I had to plough an entire field by myself because I had vowed I would do so. He mused: We were promised rice, kerosene, electricity and roads. If an election card can be made in a fortnight, why not the rest? Its like a game where everyone is lying and cheating. I am going to vote, it has always been my dream. But I dont think I will live to see the enclave change, he said.Change, however slow, is happening in the enclave. A milestone that once marked the territory as Bangladeshi is now obscured by the villages first pucca home. Students who would earlier forge documents to get into school now find themselves faced with the task of explaining the sudden need for a change in address form.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREI cant remember how many different addresses and ages I have given while filling out different forms. I will sit for my school final exams this year and will also vote for the first time. I will have to make sure that my address is the same on both applications, said Alamgir Hosain Mollah, 18.For seven decades, Madhya Moshaldanga has lived a unique existence, not quite a part of any country, its citizens denied all fundamental rights.

Roadside eateries that cater to thousands of office-goers daily kept their shutters down as cooks and other staff who hail from the district took the day off to vote.""Nine out of 10 cooks who work in roadside eateries are from East Midnapore. They are passionate about exercising their franchise and take the day off to travel to their home to vote. We will reopen on Friday,"" said Shailendra Rakshit, owner of Hastings Eating House, a popular hotel adjoining high court.Three other pice hotels in the vicinity - Adarsha Hindu Hotel, Jogmaya Hindu Hotel and Rajlakshmi Eating House on Old Post Office Street - were also shut, inconveniencing lawyers and clients. Eateries near Bankshall Court and City Civil Court were also closed.Asim Patra, a junior advocate who depends on Adarsha Hindu Hotel for his fill of rice and fish at lunch, went hungry on Thursday. The masala dosa that he had didn't fill his apetite. Fellow lawyer Nikhil Kundu was better prepared. The owner of Jogmaya had warned him about the unscheduled closure and he had carried lunch from home.At Dacres Lane, all snack counters were shut except Chitto Babu's. The staff at the famous eatery had a trying time catering to customer surge. ""We are witnessing unprecedented rush and trying our best to serve customers.

5904934d7be9e04154df8af7,The alcoholic mammaries of the welfare state,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/the-alcoholic-mammaries-of-the-welfare-state/,2016-05-08,"Upamanyu Chatterjee once wrote a book titled The Mammaries of the Welfare State. If he visited Tamil Nadu today, he would be tempted to write another called The Alcoholic Mammaries of Tamil Nadus Welfare State. Tamil Nadu gives away more freebies to voters than any other state. Its dark secret is that these freebies are financed mainly by massive revenues from liquor sales.All liquor shops are run by TASMAC, a government monopoly, to maximize revenue. TASMAC makes additional money by leasing space to private bars within liquor shops. Liquor revenue has risen from Rs 2,800 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 30,000 crore today. To finance an ever-growing list of freebies, the state government has aggressively expanded the number of liquor shops, making access easy. These now open early in the morning, leading to stories of drunkenness before noon.In one sense this approach has succeeded: liquor revenues have boomed. But in another sense the strategy has failed. It has created a big backlash from women complaining of abuse and wasted household money. The DMK has blamed chief minister Jayalalithaa for encouraging drunks, and promised to impose prohibition if elected. Jayalalithaa in turn has accused the DMK of relaxing prohibition when it was in power, and proposed phased prohibition herself.Neither party can explain how the freebies will continue if there is no liquor revenue. The history of India is replete with examples of prohibition being introduced to win the female vote at elections, followed by a fiscal crisis caused by lack of liquor revenue, followed by a return to liquor sales. History will surely repeat itself in Tamil Nadu.It is by no means the only state where prohibition has become a major election issue. West Bengal and Kerala, two other states currently holding state elections, also have parties promising prohibition. They too have no convincing explanation of how liquor revenue will be replaced. But none has as long a list of freebies as Tamil Nadu, whose task is therefore most daunting.Jayalalithaa has just released her party manifesto. Her list of freebies includes: free cellphones for rationcard holders; free laptops with internet connections for 10th and 12th class students; maternity assistance of Rs 18,000; maternity leave increased from six to nine months; one hundred free electricity units every two months; waiver of all farm loans (at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore); fisherfolk assistance to be hiked to Rs 5,000; women to get 50% subsidy to buy mopeds or scooters; an eight-gram gold coin for women getting married; a free Amma kit including sanitary napkins; and much more. Note that Jayalalithaa already provides 20 kilos of free rice per family, a free mixer-grinder and fan per family, subsidized Amma kitchens, and subsidized goats or cows for rural families.The state is reputed to be Indias best in delivering many government services, including education, health, MNREGA and the public distribution system. However, complaints of corruption are rising. Industrialists say this has been worsening for 15 years, eroding a oncestrong reputation for being a business-friendly state. One industrialist says that if you do not pay up, an army of inspectors will descend to harass you and threaten to close your establishment. An educationist complains that environment clearance is now required even for educational institutions, with the bribe for clearance fixed at so much per square foot of space.The sugar industry ran up enormous losses in recent years because state-advised cane prices were very high in relation to sugar prices. Modis rescue package for sugar mills in 2014 included raising the amount of alcohol to be blended with petrol from 5% to 10%, with the ethanol price rising from Rs 34.50 to Rs 48.50 per litre. But Jayalalithaa wants to maximize alcohol for liquor production. And so she has limited ethanol supply by sugar mills to oil companies to a trickle. The sugar mills are crying foul, in vain. She says she is industry-friendly, but is friendlier to the liquor industry than any other. Thats what produces the money for freebies.Elections in Tamil Nadu are rarely fought on policy issues. Both sides agree on a mixture of economic development and welfarism. Elections are contested mainly on the personal popularity of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, and on competition in freebies. Using liquor revenue to improve basic state services like education and health is defensible. Using it for freebies is a political race between parties to the fiscal bottom. It can only end in tears."

M Karunanidhi, 91. What makes the oldest candidates in fray in Kerala and Tamil Nadu the most sought-after by their parties? Shaju Philip & Arun Janardhanan find outAddressing an election rally in Assam last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dismissed the competition posed by Congress Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, saying he is so senior to me and, in a few years, he will be 90. Gogoi is 81.In two corresponding elections, there are two 90-plus contenders whom no one can dismiss in a hurry. If V S Achuthanandan is spearheading the CPM comeback campaign in Kerala, M Karunanidhi is doing the same for the DMK in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.This is Achuthanandans eighth Assembly election. He first contested 49 years ago, in 1967, from Ambalapuzha. In all this time, he has been chief minister just once, though few may be able to stop him should the CPM win on May 19.V S Achuthanandan (Photo courtesy: Mathrubhumi) and M Karunanidhi V S Achuthanandan (Photo courtesy: Mathrubhumi) and M KarunanidhiKarunanidhi is fighting his 13th Assembly election. He has not been defeated once in nearly 60 years of contesting polls, having begun from Kulitalai in 1957, and has been the CM five times. He has also been a member of the (now-abolished) Tamil Nadu Legislative Council once.Achuthanandan is now the only surviving leader among the founders of the CPM. Both VS and Karunanidhi are the oldest candidates in the fray in the two states.Heres something more to put that in perspective: in the year 1957, when Karunanidhi won his first polls, Feroze Gandhi won from the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat. 1967, when VS contested the first time, was the year the Congress fought its first general elections without Jawaharlal Nehru at the helm.V S Achuthanandan: Strict regimen, controlled diet, unsheathed ambitionWayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday. PTI Photo Wayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday. PTI PhotoAt 7.45 am, the government rest-house in Palakkad is deserted, except for a police constable lazing in a chair near a room on the ground floor. Minutes later, an elderly man emerges from the room, his mundu folded above the knees. Escorted by an assistant, he carefully climbs down a small ramp to a courtyard.Here, the crimson sun of Kerala politics, Velikkakath Sankaran Achuthanandan, stands facing the sun  eyes closed, lips pursed. After a few minutes, he turns around for his back to soak in the morning rays. About 10 minutes later, he returns to his room.Achuthanandan, popularly known as VS, will turn 93 in October. Before the Assembly elections of 2011, VS, who was then chief minister, had been denied a seat by the CPM on health grounds. After widespread discontent among party workers and the public, the CPM gave in. That election battle was reckoned to be the 87-year-olds last. Here we are, five years later, with VS a natural contender for the CMs post.Apart from being the Left Democratic Front candidate from Malampuzha constituency, the veteran is shouldering the LDF campaign across the state  proving once again his ability to reinforce his relevance. All this doesnt come easy. VS begins his day at 5 am. By 6 am, he is out for his regular morning walk, dressed in track pants and a white T-shirt. While at his official residence in Thiruvananthapuram, he usually goes to the university stadium for a half-an-hour walk, but now that he is in Palakkad district for campaigning, he makes do with the tarred road near the rest-house. As VS walks, two aides keep a careful watch, with one of them showing the way with a torch. VS walks for about 50 metres, taking slow, measured steps, then turns around and walks back. His assistant Kunhikannan says he walks this way for nearly 20 minutes, without exchanging a word with his aides.After the walk, VS rests in his room for a while. This is when he reads the newspapers. He wants all the local Malayalam and English dailies on his table when he returns from his walk, says Kunhikkannan, who has been with VS for four years. This is followed by a bath and a 20-minute-long yoga session. VS took to yoga 12 years ago and does his asanas without anyones help, says Kunhikkannan. It is after yoga that he soaks up the sun.Kolkata: CPI(M) leader V S Achuthanandan, CPI(M) General Secy Sitaram Yechury, Former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Left Front Chairman Biman Bose Former Secretary Prakash Karat, State Opposition Leader Surya Kanta Mishra and others in an open rally during their Kolkata Plenum in Kolkata on Sunday.

PTI Photo by Ashok BhaumikBreakfast comes next. His aides say VS flips through newspapers as he eats his usual steam-baked puttu or idiyappam or appam. VSs fitness at 92 is attributed in part to his diet regimen: No tea or coffee for him; he only drinks hot water or tender coconut water. He has also largely stuck to vegetarian food, though he occasionally eats fish curry. A couple of years ago, VS famously broke this regimen when he went to greet estranged comrade, K R Gouri, on her birthday. Gouri is said to have chided him, Since when have you turned vegetarian?, and forced him to eat fish curry.By 9 am, the veteran CPM leader is ready to receive visitors. Local leaders start trickling in, including A Prabhakaran, the LDF election committee convenor of Malampuzha constituency. Prabhakaran briefs him about the days schedule and tells him he will have to attend a few panchayat-level CPM conventions.I have been coordinating Achuthanandans election in Malampuzha since 2001. This time too he will win with a thumping majority, says Prabhakaran. In 2011, VS had won by 20,017 votes against Congress candidate Lathika Subhash.Half an hour later, VS is ready to leave for the first convention. Two assistants help him into a car, which sports the party flag on its bonnet. As he sinks into his seat, VS slips into the past: of those days without cars, with a lot of ground to be covered on foot. He started out as a strident labour union leader in Alappuzha who went on to become one of the most popular faces of the CPM in Kerala.I became a member of the Communist party in 1940, at the age of 17. I worked among fishermen, toddy-tappers and coconut climbers in Alappuzha. I later joined a coir factory, organised workers there and brought them closer to the Communist movement, he says.There were tough days. In the early 1940s, I would stay in a house at Cherukara in Alappuzha for party work. The house was located in a paddy field with streams. I would walk kilometres along narrow ridges to reach workers. There were no bridges across these streams, only wooden planks, he says. It was in the late 1950s, when he was district secretary of the united CPI in Alappuzha, that his office got its first car.The VS motorcade reaches Kodumbu, 6 km from Palakkad city. The town is decorated with flags and festoons. Hundreds of party workers have gathered at the community hall to hear him. The hall erupts as party workers push to catch a glimpse of the veteran and shout slogans hailing him. VS has to jostle through the crowd to reach the stage, helped by his security guards. As mobile phones go up one by one to record his speech, the 92-year-old greets the audience with folded hands and starts speaking. With his voice ringing through the hall in his famous, much-mimicked style halting and winding  the years fall away.We want to bring back the previous LDF government, which implemented several welfare initiatives, says Achuthanandan. You can realise my responsibility. I have to campaign across the state for LDF candidates, it is your duty to seek votes for Achuthanandan. Think of yourself as V S Achuthanandan when you go campaigning. Thank you, namaskaram.There is fresh sloganeering as VS makes his way back to his car. The next convention is at Mundur, half an hour away. At Mundur too, hundreds of party workers, including women, have been waiting for Achuthanandan. Kanne Karale Viyesse (loosely translated to Our eyes, our heart, oh VS), they shout as the CPM leader reaches.Prabhakaran addresses the crowd here, and makes no effort to hide the ambition of the VS camp should he win. People of Kerala are looking at VS with great expectation and enthusiasm. If an LDF government led by VS does not come to power, Kerala will collapse, he says.When its his turn to address the gathering, VS again tells the party workers to go to the voters as VS and garner votes for him. Its midday by the time the event at Mundur is over, and VS returns to the guest-house in Palakkad for lunch.A few spoons of rice and vegetables make his lunch, says son V A Arun Kumar. What he misses while he is out campaigning is the buttermilk made from goat milk that he has without fail while in Thiruvananthapuram. He has a goat at his official residence in the capital, says VSs additional private secretary K V Sudhakaran.After lunch, VS rests until 3 pm. He then meets visitors before leaving for a second round of campaigning in the evening.Human rights activist Joy Kaitharam has brought along a few guests, including Lakshmi Bhai, the widow of P Satheendra Kumar, an employee of Malabar Cements who died under mysterious circumstances in 2013. The moment Kaitharam introduces Lakshmi to VS, he says, Oh the Malabar cements case! He promises Lakshmi her demand for a job for her son would be met if the LDF government came to power.VS grasps things fast, Kaitharam smiles. If we give written material, he gets the points in one reading. A Suresh, the personal assistant for VS for 12 years, says the veterans popularity can be attributed to this quality and the causes he identifies himself with: social evils, corruption, land encroachment and sex mafia. He patiently hears out everyone who meets him. VS is quick to grasp an issue and understand its gravity.CPM central committee member Thomas Issac underlines what VS means for the party. People, particularly the poor, easily identify with him. There is a huge demand from the party and the public to include VS in as many campaigns as possible.Around 4 pm, VS leaves for two more meetings in his constituency, returning around 7.30 pm to the guest-house.Before turning in for the night, VS again goes for a walk, this time for 30 minutes. Even after a long journey or a busy schedule, he does not skip this routine. During the last Lok Sabha elections, he once stayed on the third floor of a hotel in Malappuram which did not have a lift. He would walk down the steps, come down for his evening walk and again take all those stairs on his way up, says Sudhakaran, his additional private secretary.Dinner is light  a few pieces of papaya and three or four kadali bananas. Most days, he is in bed by 9 pm. Son Arun Kumar says VS usually never discusses politics with family. Controversies do not upset him. His initial years of struggle have given him the strength to stay like a rock when political storms hit him.He is travelling with his father this time because of his age, Kumar adds. I am here just to monitor his food.So what keeps him going at 92? VS, who since last fortnight has also joined social media, smiles, I do my best to remain fit. I have a strict and disciplined life, just like my clean political life.The perpetual rebel* Born on October 20, 1923, in Punnapra village in Alappuzha district, V S Achuthanandan lost his parents early. When 12, he dropped out of school and started working at his elder brothers tailoring shop. He joined the Congress when he was 15, but became a CPI member two years later.* In 1964, he was one of the 32 leaders to walk out of the national council of the CPI to form the CPI(M). He is the only one of the 32 still alive.* VSs biggest strength has been his ability to reinvent himself at crucial moments. As Opposition leader from 2001 to 2006, he associated himself with issues such as womens empowerment, Dalit rights and land encroachment, which sent his popularity soaring.* Within the party though, he has been a perpetual rebel, locking horns with Pinarayi Vijayan over control of the state leadership. In 2007, VS and Vijayan were both suspended from the Politburo for some time.* In 2015, the CPM passed a resolution against VS for his alleged anti-party activities. But his fortunes have since brightened. With the BJP joining hands with Hindu Ezhava leader Vellappally Natesan, VS as an Ezhava is even more important now.M Karunanidhi: A family close by, some prayers next doorM Karunanidhi M KarunanidhiITS APRIL 23, three weeks to go for what is likely his final electoral battle, and M Karunanidhi is getting ready for his first poll rally. Inside the DMK chiefs two-storey house, made in the traditional Tamil style, distinctive only for the party flag atop, there is hectic activity.Personal secretary K Shanmuganathan has been busy in the visitors section since 8.30 am. Another aide walks up and down with a phone, looking on as senior party leaders arrive and four armed commandos of the National Security Guard take positions. A sniffer dog checks Karunanidhis customised Toyota Alphard standing in the lobby.A dozen security personnel conduct a routine drill, checking each vehicle parked on the street with metal detectors.In his trademark safari suit, Karunanidhis aide Shanmughanathan, who has been with the DMK chief since 1976, is turning away people seeking appointments. Others can be seen decorating the door leading to his inner house with garlands, but the freshly drawn kolam (rangoli) in front of No. 15, 4th Street, Gopalapuram, has already been smudged by the people walking in and out.As media cameras wait restlessly outside for Kalaignar, as Karunanidhi is fondly called by his followers, to emerge, news comes that the DMK chief is still having his favourite breakfast  dosa and chutney.Information about what the 92-year-old eats though is tough to come by. It requires a formal mail before a close aide reveals, Minimum four coffees a day is a must. By around 11 am, he will have chicken soup or vegetable soup, before a mini-lunch. He eats a little rice for lunch. Though there are some restrictions these days, gulab jamun and cutlets are his favourites.Around 9.30 am, eldest daughter Selvi is the first to step out, her hands full of flowers. Next to Karunanidhis house, in a narrow lane, is a temple. Rivals say the famously atheist leaders family conducts pujas there. His loyalists insist Karunanidhi stops for no one, not even god.Thats saying much for a leader confined to a wheelchair since 2009, and carrying the weight of his splintered party and family on his shoulders. Apart from the frugal meals, one way that keeps him going is daily yoga at 4 am, followed by the first coffee of the day. According to a close aide, he does all the possible sitting yoga postures he can for 20 minutes. The self-declared rationalist found the middle path when he embraced yoga in 2009.He started doing yoga after he was forced to give up his morning walk, which he would do mostly inside the sprawling compound of Anna Arivalayam, his party headquarters, says the aide.Karunanidhi finally leaves around 3 pm. He first stops at a CIT Nagar residence to pick up third wife Rajathi Ammal and daughter Kanimozhi before the convoy heads for a rally on the banks of Adyar, marking the start of a road trip that will cover half of the states districts and involve at least 35 rallies.Since he cant go to all the 234 constituencies, the party has planned for each rally to cover a dozen or more seats. Some of the rallies are stage events, at others, he would be delivering speeches sitting in his caravan. On the road though, he may not be able to indulge in the one leisure activity aides confess about him  watching old songs on TV, some of them from his films, others bound to be from bitter rival J Jayalalithaas.His campaign van is a customised Force Traveller with a sliding door and a high roof, that can easily accommodate Karunanidhis wheelchair. He has been using similar vans for several elections now. Those who have seen and heard the Karunanidhi of old say the speech delivery is no longer as effortless, but it remains spontaneous, with the leader not referring to any paper during his 20-odd-minute addresses.Instructing a youth who is part of the DMK social media team, Karunanidhis personal secretary Rajamanickam, who is well into his 70s, says the DMK chief knows just what to highlight from his speeches for YouTube and Facebook. Karunanidhi has had own Facebook and Twitter accounts since March 2014.On a Monday evening, as Karunanidhi arrives for a rally at his Thiruvarur constituency, near native village Thirukkuvalai, there are over 10,000 cheering people gathered. The sight is reassuring for a leader who many have been saying should retire.He starts his speech listing the names of Tamil Nadu Congress chief EVKS Elangovan sitting next to him, other alliance leaders and the DMKs district leaders individually, triggering an applause each time. Rajathi Ammal sits behind him, while former Union telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, who was named in the 2G scam, is to his left and never takes his eyes off the DMK supremo. The presence of both sends a message. In the war of supremacy within the Karunanidhi clan, it is Rajathi and Kanimozhi who are by the DMK chief in this campaign. Kanimozhi too carries 2G taint, and Dayanidhi is a surprise inclusion given his absence from public view for a long time.Ignoring this fact, the DMK chief focuses on the alleged corruption of the Jayalalithaa government, talking about money seizures from her partymens houses and demanding a CBI probe.If the presence of Kanimozhi is remarked upon, so is the curious absence of M K Stalin, while eldest son M K Alagiri is more or less silent now. Alagiri remains unpopular, and there is talk still among cadres and voters of him coming back if Karunanidhi returns to power. Others say how Stalin, who is running a virtual parallel campaign with professionals and a strong social media presence, should have been projected as the CM candidate by the DMK.Older leaders close to Karunanidhi say some of his own relatives have asked him to hand over the baton to Stalin. However, says a close aide, Karunanidhi doesnt want to be a father who made his son a CM. He follows Maos theory  I dont want to support anyone, let them grow on their own.READ: The Dravida Family TreeOthers point out that Karunanidhi still remains popular among colleagues, and for the reason that in a state with imperious leaders, surrounded by powerful coteries, he is open. If I call him now and ask for an appointment, he would ask me to come immediately. That is Karunanidhi, says Anbumani Ramadoss, leader of the PMK, and incidentally now a bitter rival.Before the Trichy rally, the DMK men thronging outside his room are all carrying photographs of party leader K N Nehru. Partymen point out that unlike the AIADMK, the DMK also allows its second-level leaders to bloom.Closest friend and advisor M Naganathan, former head of economics at the University of Madras and ex-vice chairman of the state planning commission, says his memories of Karunanidhi revolve around their morning walks together for almost 25 years, until he became wheel-chair bound.Naganathan also vouches that unlike Jayalalithaas actions against him  including sending police to arrest him at midnight in June 2001  Karunanidhi never expresses any kind of venom towards her. She is too junior to him, he has seen her since she entered the film industry as a child. When Kalaignars police went to arrest Jayalalithaa in 1996 (for alleged corruption), she kept them waiting for one-and-a-half hours. Karunanidhi asked the officers to arrest her only when she came out.Dismissing talk that Karunanidhi step down, an old-timer who meets the DMK chief off and on, says Stalin too bows before his father still. Unless there is a constitutional framework imposing an age limit for leaders, it would be foolish to judge a leader by his age. Is V S Achuthanandan at 92 incompetent? Was Jyoti Basu a failure at 96? R Venkataraman was in his late 80s when he became the president of India.Still, even the leader of a party formed with a rationalist agenda can do with some prayers now. Four hours before the Trichy rally is to begin, a brief prayer is held at the hotel Karunanidhi is staying in. Party leader A Raja, another 2G scam survivor, is among the dozen or so leaders gathered as a priest holds prayers for Karunanidhis health.Ask him about his contemporary Achuthanandan, and Karunanidhi is brief, I wish him all the best for his success.The scriptwriter* Muthuvel Karunanidhi was born on June 3, 1924, in Thirukkuvalai, a village near Thiruvarur. A school dropout, he was a screenwriter in the Tamil film industry before entering politics. The film circle in which he was active had political links with the Dravidian movement against Brahminism, and Karunanidhi was a founding member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).* Along with C N Annadurai, he organised local protests against powerful north Indian men imposing Hindi names in 1953.* He won his first election from Kulithalai in Trichy district in 1957, winning a seat in the Assembly of Madras Presidency.* After the DMK parted ways with Periyars Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), won the elections in 1967 and Annadurai became the CM, Karunanidhi became public works minister. After Annadurais death in early 1969, Karunanidhi succeeded him till 1971. He returned to the CMs office in the election in 1971.* The DMK faced a vertical split in 1972 after MGR decided to float AIADMK following a tussle with with Karunanidhi.

""For 1kg of rice, Rs 27 comes from the Delhi treasury, that's why you get it at subsidised rates of Re 1 and Rs 2. Dilli sarkar is concerned about you. But there aren't any photos of Modi or his name on the bags. My happiness is the smile on the faces of the poor people,"" he said, in a veiled comment on the stickers of Jayalalithaa pasted on flood relief materials.Modi is otherwise known to share a good rapport with Jayalalithaa. The confrontational tone comes towards the end of the election campaign, with just a week to go for voting. In 2014 too, Modi had steered clear of taking potshots at Jayalalithaa.On Sunday, Modi also addressed three well-attended election meetings in north, south and south-central Kerala, where he exhorted voters to see through the ""adjustment politics"" between LDF and UDF that ensured each front, in turn, ruled the state every five years and covertly protected the other's vested interests.""A new model of politics has come up in Kerala. It's an adjustment politics, politics of compromise, politics of corruption and politics of contract to save each other... It's a contract rule between UDF and LDF,"" Modi told an election meeting at Kasaragod.In the evening in Thiruvananthapuram, at a huge gathering in Central Stadium, Modi spoke of the special place Kerala has in his heart and asked voters to reciprocate.""It's not important who wins or forms the government in Kerala. What's important is the future of Kerala. It's in the name of development that we seek votes in favour of NDA candidates,"" Modi said, bemoaning the inertia inflicted on the state by its bi-polar politics.In speeches tailor-made to suit each region's main concerns, Modi's over-arching theme was how the BJP could make a difference in Kerala given a chance.In Kasaragod, he dwelt on the CPM's politics of violence, and warned that people involved in murder cases are trying to become CM  a veiled attack on Pinarayi Vijayan who was an accused in the Vadikkal Ramakrishnan murder case in Thalassery nearly 45 years ago. The PM also ridiculed new-found CPM-Congress bonhomie in West Bengal, saying that 'dosti' there and 'gusti' here only exposed the mutual opportunism."

Abul Kasem says he doesnt get enough rice to feed his family.WITH polling having concluded in West Bengal, erstwhile enclave dwellers in Cooch Behar have a far more pressing concern  ration cards. Though the administration has promised to issue the ration cards after the election results are declared on May 19, there is uncertainty among the 13,000 former enclave residents here, who were among those granted Indian citizenship after the country ratified the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh last year.The 13,000 people are residents of villages which were Bangladeshi enclaves before they became Indian territory following the agreement.The lack of ration cards makes the new Indians ineligible for the states welfare measures, particularly the du takae chal (rice at Rs 2 per kg) scheme. We have been issued election cards but no ration cards. This means no rice, no kerosene and no milk powder. Those in the camps get them, but we have to still toil on whatever little land we have, said Saddam Hussein (21), a resident of Madhya Moshaldanga, an erstwhile Bangladeshi enclave now in Indian territory. There are large tracts of highly fertile land here and hence rice (the staple in the region) is aplenty; the problem, however, is that most of it is owned by a small group of farmers. And those below the poverty line havent been issued ration cards.Those with ration cards  around 1,000 people lodged at the three camps in Dinhata, Mekliganj and Haldibari (all once residents of Indian enclaves in Bangladesh)  have another grouse: lack of sufficient food. At present, each family is provided with 30 kg of rice.Families with more than five members are given an additional five kg for every extra member. But this policy isnt working out. My family has 14 members. Its the largest in the enclave camps. But according to the present rationing system, I get 75 kg of rice. In Bangladesh, our family consumed almost double the amount, said Abul Kasem (62).While those at the camps have adapted by creating small kitchen gardens  cultivating pumpkins, gourds and beans  the district administration blamed the rice shortage on insufficient planning by the Centre and its inability to understand cultural differences. The average five-member family in urban areas of Bengal consumes about 20 to 30 kg of rice. But in rural areas, particularly Cooch Behar and the adjoining area of Rangpur in Bangladesh, rice is eaten four times a day. Almost everyone is employed in hard labour and rice is the fuel. Eating habits cant change in a day and the Centre has failed to take this into account, said a state official.Then theres unemployment. While some camp residents have been able to find jobs under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the model code of conduct has delayed payments. In addition, resentment from local residents at the new Indians allegedly getting preference has led to increased tension in the area. They dont want us here. That is to be expected. But we have no money. Whatever money we brought with us is close to finishing and its making us desperate. We were promised that our land in Bangladesh would be sold and we would get the money but we have not received a single penny of it. We havent been able to go back and oversee the sale either.Whenever we ask, we are told after the elections, said Jayprakash Roy at the Haldibari camp.After the migration, the new Indians had submitted a detailed list of their land  about 5 sq km in total  to the district administration. The Bangladesh government had in turn promised to buy the land at market prices and ensure that the money is transferred to those who had opted for Indian citizenship. But this is yet to materialise, the residents said.For enclave dwellers on the Indian side, the land issue has become even more pressing as they dont have pattas (land right documents). Many fear that their properties will be gobbled up by land sharks looking to profit from the government-planned development in the area. The Bangladesh government wants to build police stations, roads and hospitals. We havent been given proof that we own the land that has fed us for generations. Already surveyors are trying to take over, said Sunil Ray, a former resident of Mrigpur enclave, now in Bangladesh.The district administration here hopes that all issues will be resolved soon. District magistrate P Ulaganathan said that with polls over, the problems of the enclaves would be accorded top priority. But Trinamool Congress district president, Rabindranath Ghosh, maintained that much of the problems stemmed from bad planning and delays from the Centre. Take funds for instance. They released some of the money almost a year after they were scheduled to. This was all political because the BJP wanted to put us under pressure, he said.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE"
59048bf27be9e04154df85e8,"What Mamata has learnt from Nitish, Lalu",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/what-mamata-has-learnt-from-nitish-lalu/,2016-05-15,"The urban middle classes hate her, the rural masses love her. The middle classes hate to admit it, but in elections the rural masses matter more.Most of the bhadralok castigate her for ruining university autonomy, filling institutions with her loyalists, and selling not just university teaching posts (as the Left Front used to) but even student seats in the best colleges. They say she has brought her own thugs to every district, replacing those of the Left Front. Often, the old thugs have simply switched sides.She is alleged to have created a web of syndicates  monopoly suppliers of various services and construction materials  that skim money from procurement systems. She has financed a plethora of youth clubs, which intellectuals claim are just gangs loyal to Mamata.She is frankly contemptuous of intellectuals, and proudly says she represents the masses. In this, she resembles Lalu Yadav, who in Bihar spent 15 years empowering backward castes at the expense of the upper-caste elite, often by dubious, thuggish means.A very different image of Mamata comes from her supporters, including a minority of the bhadralok. They say she has promoted economic development, and done more for rural roads, rural electrification and water than the Left Front did in decades. In this respect, Mamata resembles Nitish Kumar, who also focused on economic development and was rewarded with three successive state victories. GDP growth seems to have accelerated a bit, but nowhere near as much as in Nitishs Bihar.In a poor country, all politicians have to show a populist streak, and Mamata is no exception. She has spent much effort promoting cheap health for the masses. She has offered bicycles to schoolgirls, and rice at Rs 2/kilo to ration card holders. Yet this is a very small list of freebies compared with those of politicians in other states like Tamil Nadu.Her main election platform is rural development, not freebies. She defends syndicates and youth clubs as ways of empowering rural people and sharing the benefits of development with a wide range of grassroots folk. She claims thuggery is much reduced compared with Left Front rule. The smell of corruption has hit some of her ministers, yet her personal image is of simplicity and honesty.She has had the guts to stand up to government trade unions that have ousted governments in other states. She pays them dearness allowance amounting to only 75% of basic salary, as against 125% given by the central government. Almost all other CMs have felt obliged to follow the central norm, so Mamata stands out. She has diverted money from civil service salaries to development, and that is both courageous and productive.The Left Fronts land reforms, starting 1977, won it great rural goodwill for decades, but that has now evaporated. The CPM replaced formal government rule largely by cadre rule, and all villages and districts became fiefdoms of CPM cadres. Electricity was perennially in short supply, hitting not just industrial development but rural electrification. Most farmers had to use diesel pump-sets for irrigation, which cost far more to operate than electric pump-sets.Mamata is lucky that, thanks to weak industrialization, the whole eastern grid now has an electricity surplus. Nitish Kumar took advantage of this to extend rural electricity to almost all villages in Bihar, and this spurred his election victory last year. Mamata has also greatly expanded rural electrification, and hopes for a similar electoral dividend.Several chief ministers who have won repeated re-election  Narendra Modi, Nitish, Naveen Patnaik, Shivraj Chouhan  have followed the model of a strong, high centralising CM empowering the bureaucracy to ignore MLAs and panchayat politicians and deliver results (including politically biased ones). Mamata has adopted a milder version of this model. Businessmen like this model, and are surprisingly upbeat on Mamata, even though she came to power  and retains mass rural support  by excoriating the Tatas and other large industries for acquiring land from farmers at cheap rates. West Bengal is doing far better in services and small manufacturing than big industry, and this needs less land.The states main crop is paddy. Once, the state was highly deficit in paddy, but the green revolution has created a surplus, lowering the market price below the minimum support price. Mamata has substantially expanded government procurement of paddy, just as Nitish did in Bihar, benefiting farmers. This could be an important vote winner.In sum, Mamata has learned lessons from Lalu Yadav on the importance of dignity for the masses, and from Nitish Kumar, the importance of rural development. I suspect that will give her a big election victory."

People  holding aluminum buckets and pots or anything that can store water  anxiously wait for their turn at the tubewell that would soon begin to draw water in the form of mud.If you are late, all you get is muddy water, said Sukumar Mahto, speaking about the only tubewell in this part of Purulia, which, the 29-year-old pointed out, is a dry area. This lone tubewell supports not just Kororia but neighbouring villages, too.We are used to harsh summers, but this year has been particularly bad. Children have acquired allergies and illnesses because there is no water. There are no vegetables either, only potatoes, and thats what we have been sustaining on, Mahto said.The ponds around the village began drying up two months ago. Most of them now sit mudcaked, a reminder that they used to be a water body a while ago. A few still have some water left but their levels have fallen drastically. It is these that men, women, children and cattle use for all things necessary  bathing, washing, cooking, and drinking.Similar to Birbhum, but unlike other districts in West Bengal, Purulia is largely a monocrop region, planting and harvesting paddy.Before this long stretch of rainless dry heat set in, Purulia had received a good spell of rainfall in August last year, prompting farmers to try their luck at a second crop  many planted vegetables. But these failed.Purulia, officially, is a semi-drought-hit region. But the situation right now is similar to drought. There is no source of water in the district. The surface water has dried up and the groundwater has reduced at an alarming rate. This started in November last year, so we began giving out crop insurance and extended the Rs 2-per kg rice scheme  meant for the lower income groups  to cover the entire district, District Magistrate Tanmoy Chakraborty said.He added that 1,000 tubewells have been installed where groundwater is still available. Dry wells have been added to low lying areas so they fill up when the groundwater rises.For extra measures, the administration has asked owners of factories and small industries to install taps outside their industrial structures to make drinking water available to the common people.But these industrial owners have their own story to tell.Prashant Jalan (27), who runs a brick kiln with his father, said no work has taken place for the last three months. There is no water to manufacture brick, he said. Work on developmental projects, government sources said, have similarly slowed down because of the scarcity of water.There is literally no water here any more. Factory owners have been asked to install taps outside their buildings so that people could come and drink water from these. We will be installing ours in a couple of days, Jalan said.These taps, however, will receive water only for two hours each in the morning and evening every day.Purulia is a region where the plateau meets the plains so it is a dry area in any case. The people here are accustomed to harsh climate. What we need is a good spell of rain and the monsoons to come, the DM said.The monsoon, unluckily for Purulia and several other parched regions in the country, will be delayed by a week, according to the Met Departments forecast. It will arrive in Kerala some time at the end of the first week in June. Until then, residents of Kororia village and those nearby will have to keep pace with the rising sun.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

After taking over as the chief minister in 2011, she had steered Trinamool Congress through victory in subsequent elections to panchayat, civic bodies and 2014 Lok Sabha.Among various development schemes undertaken by her as the chief minister were Kanyashree schemes for girls and Sabuj Sathi under which cycles were dsitributed among the students, besides Rs 2 kg rice for the 8 crore people in the state.However, multi-crore scams like Saradha and Narada had dented the image of her party as the opposition had made it a prime issue.Born to a middle class family and daughter of a freedom fighter and student of law and education, Banerjee in her initial years in public life was mentored by veteran Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee  now ironically a senior minister in her state cabinet.Banerjee, baptized into politics as a student leader in Chhatra Parishad  Congress student wing in the 1970s, shot into limelight by pulling off a stunning victory over CPI-M heavyweight and former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections in from Jadavpur constituency to become one of the youngest MPs.She soon became a rallying point for the anti-Left Front forces which saw in her an uncompromising, incorruptible and credible fighter in comparison to various senior leaders of state Congress of nineties. After parting ways, Banerjee had often dubbed Congress as the B team of CPI-M.Perfecting the art of the impossible, the maverick and emotional politician, first hogged the limelight by blocking Jayaprakash Narayan`s convoy by throwing herself on the ground when he came to Kolkata to organise the masses against Indira Gandhi before Emergency.Defeated in 1989, she was back in Lok Sabha in 1991 from Kolkata South and retained the seat in 1996, 1998,1999, 2004 and 2009. Banerjees first tryst with the corridors of power came in 1991 when she became became union minister of state for human resources development, youth affairs and sports and women and child development in the P V Narasimha Rao government.Later on after forming TMC, Banerjee aligned with the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government and became Railway Minister in 1999 and Union Minister for Coal and Mines in 2004. Banerjee resigned as Railway Minister and left NDA just ahead of the 2001 assembly polls in Bengal after the Tehelka scam and allied with Congress for the assembly elections but could not dethrone the Marxist party.In 2004 Lok Sabha election Banerjee was the only one from TMC to win. In 2006 asembly polls in Bengal her party managed to win just 30 seats in the 294-member assembly. But being a fighter, Banerjee refused to be cowed down and led the protest against farmland acquisitions in Singur and Nandigram which finally catapulted her to the seat of power in the state.A firebrand orator, she had coined a catchy slogan Ma, Mati o Manush (Mother, Land and People) before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and played on the anti-incumbency factor after more than three decades of Left rule and the creeping disillusionment among several sections, like Muslims, to decimate the Left in partnership with the Congress.Known for her humble lifestyle, the seven-time MP successfully sold a vision of development, cashing in on thedeep resentment among the middle classes and unemployed youths, promising jobs and development. Her nondescript residencea tiled single-storey house in a dingy lane close to the Kalighat templeand equally simple attire comprising cotton saris, jhola bags and cheap hawai chappals, endeared her to the masses.It has not been an easy journey though for Mamata who turned her call for `Parivartan` (change) into a reality with Congress, her ally then, throwing its full weight behind her.

Yet, the feat of Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu and Mamata in West Bengal, or for that matter the winning spree of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti in bypolls, is a pointer that regional parties can outbeat national parties.Jayalalithaas victory has created history in Tamil Naduby beating anti-incumbency trend for the first time in nearly 40 years.The late M G Ramachandrana held that record with DMK chief M Karunanidhi unable to dislodge him from power till he was alive.Both Jayalalithaa and Mamata are seen as successfully delivering on the ground on basic requirements through a slew of welfare measures or freebies, which the national parties loathe to provide due to resource crunch.Besides the famous Amma canteens, where food is available across the state at a cheap price, Jayalalithaas freebies have included 4 goats and a cow to each BPL family, mixer-grinders and fans, free uniforms, school, bags, notebooks, geometry boxes, for all children in government schools, and cycles and laptops for class 11 and 12 students.Six lakh women got four grams of gold and Rs 50,000 as marriage assistance.

It is to be hoped that a similar statement will not have to be made about Mamata Banerjee after her remarkable victory at the hustings yesterday. She deserves to bask in this moment of glory that belongs to her. Moving away from personalities, the election results also point to some broad trends in Bengal's politics and society. The people of West Bengal are not averse to change but they take their time to change things. They perhaps think in what a group of French historians in the second half of the 20th century called longue dure. For over three decades the voters of West Bengal loyally stood by the Left. Nothing seemed to make a dent in this show of loyalty. Then in one great upheaval in 2011 the people decided that the time had come to end the Left regime and to usher in change. Indeed, the removal of the Left became synonymous with Mamata Banerjee's rallying cry of paribartan or change. Having voted her to power, the people have decided to continue to support and trust her in spite of growing criticism of her regime from among the members of the intelligentsia. Change once made in 2011 is now shelved. No one quite knows when it will emerge again and what direction it will take. Perhaps the people of West Bengal think in terms of three decades as marking an epoch. Within this tendency to provide the political leadership with a sense and an opportunity of continuity, there is another trend that is worthy of note. The urban intelligentsia tends to lose faith in a political leader or a party far more quickly than those who live in rural Bengal and in district towns. Voices of criticism against the Left originated in Calcutta, which became Mamata Banerjee's first stronghold and then, only very gradually, did disillusionment spread to the villages. Similarly, critics of Mamata Banerjee's rule (like the present writer) are mostly urban dwellers. Their sentiments and arguments find no immediate echo among the common people, most of whom are in the rural world. The results rub home this point. One of the charges made against Mamata Banerjee's regime - this was highlighted by her critics and opponents - was the one of corruption. Various scams and ponzy schemes came to light; important party members were alleged to have taken bribes and so on. But these charges cut no ice with the voters. Some implications follow from this. First is that the voters do not believe these allegations. Second, the voters feel that even if these allegations are true or partially true, Mamata Banerjee is still worth voting for. This is a comment on Mamata Banerjee's personal standing among the people. And third, issues of corruption are not important enough to affect voting patterns. If the third implication above has any validity, then the yardstick of morality the people of Bengal live by stands in need of a radical review. A scandal like Bofors could bring down a prime minister but Saradha has no adverse impact on the popularity of Mamata Banerjee. A point to ponder. One plank on which Mamata Banerjee's popularity rests is the series of measures she announced as chief minister to benefit the common people. These included gifts of money to small clubs in various localities; the gift of bicycles for girls; monetary subventions for unmarried women over 18 who are studying; making available rice at a cheap price; subsidies to religious leaders and so on. Such measures are usually captured within the rubric of ""populism"". It is a term that carries with it pejorative overtones. Mamata Banerjee has made this her own brand of politics. These announcements immediately make her appear pro-people. The beneficiaries of these proposals are never concerned about what impact these have on the state's finances. The advantages of populism are obvious and Mamata Banerjee is certainly not the only political leader in India, past or present, to practise this kind of politics to garner votes. There is nothing unexpected in Mamata Banerjee's choice of populism since she actively projected herself prior to 2011 as being pro-peasant and anti-industry. In her second innings as chief minister one of the principal challenges before Mamata Banerjee will be to change the investment and the industrial climate of West Bengal. Whatever might be her rhetoric and her public posturing she knows that West Bengal is not seen as an attractive investment destination. On the other hand, having received an overwhelming endorsement from the people she might feel (and indeed will be justified in feeling thus) that there is no need to change anything, least of all her attitudes. Why bring paribartan to populism? There is one taint that Mamata Banerjee will have to remove as she settles into power the second time round. West Bengal's image and reputation have been tarnished by violence. The state is seen as a place where political cadre can do as they please and get away with it because of political patronage. There is continuity in this since this is exactly how the cadre of the CPI(M) behaved when their party called the shots. Mamata Banerjee should guarantee the safety of the people by allowing the rule of law to prevail irrespective of political and party interests. The vote is a vote for continuity in political leadership. But no political process, even a continuing one, can be totally bereft of change. In the vote for continuity is embedded the challenge - even the hope - that things will move towards the better. Mamata Banerjee has successfully made the Left disappear from the political map of West Bengal. But the big question that will continue to chase Mamata Banerjee's tenure as chief minister will centre around how successfully, if at all, she has caused a rupture with Left policies and the Left mindset. Her dependence on populism, her reliance on State control on education, her use of party cadre, her politicization of the police and the bureaucracy, her blurring of the dividing line between the party and the government - all these aspects of her rule have distinct Left lineages. They were all used by the Left Front and brought it dividends. On Mamata Banerjee, however ironical it sounds, has fallen the mantle of the Left. The border of her sari is often blue. It could very well be red."

Trinamool Congress supporters smear colour on a poster of their leader. Photo: PTIThe Trinamool Congress won a spectacular two-thirds majority in West Bengal thanks in large part to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees charisma, energy, never-say-die spirit, and ability to think on her feet. Even in these elections, when she realised that the Left-Congress combine might capitalise on both the series of scams that had hit her party and the widespread unpopularity of her party workers, she swiftly made a public apology.In early April, at a public meeting in Kulti near Asansol, riding on the adulation she enjoys among the people, she said she should be held responsible if any mistakes had been made, but voters should not withdraw their blessings and good wishes from the party.Interestingly, even on Thursday after her magnificent win, grim-faced even in victory, she said she would attend to any shortcomings in her party.Ms. Banerjee has always been far more popular than the cohorts of street warriors she leads, something everyone this writer spoke to emphasised last month, even as complaints floated about her partymen spreading terror in the districts.Without pretensionsIndeed, to understand this victory, one has to understand the nature of Ms. Banerjees appeal and her carefully crafted image built over the years. She is still a hero for her largely lower-middle class urban and rural constituents, who took on the mighty Left machine virtually single-handedly. While in Opposition, she fearlessly led michils (walkabouts) to the bastions of government power in Kolkata, stormed Singur, Nandigram and every other site of state oppression, unmindful of brutal baton-wielding cops. As Chief Minister, she outdid the Opposition in leading protest marches. Through it all she retained a simple lifestyle, and stuck to her entertaining colloquial Bengali speeches that keep the audience hanging on to every word.But beyond the legend, there were other factors in this election. One, the results make it clear that the Left-Congress understanding did not work as well as it should have. While the clearly more disciplined cadres of the Left parties shifted their votes to the Congress, making the latter the second largest party in the State Assembly ahead of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Congress workers appear to have shifted their votes to the Trinamool Congress, a legacy of years of antipathy to the Left.Two, if the battle had initially appeared to be a direct contest between the Trinamool Congress and the Left-Congress combine, at some stage the Bharatiya Janata Party upped its game. Once the BJP realised that the gains it had made in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in the State, when it got around 17 per cent of the vote, could shrink to the roughly four per cent it got in the 2011 Assembly elections, it became more aggressive. It eventually got about 10 per cent of the vote  just 2 per cent behind the Congress  and three seats.Three, a factor that cannot be discounted, according to Left leaders, is the silent polarisation in various pockets. In the past five years of Trinamool Congress rule, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh shakhas have grown at a rapid pace. And in January this year in Malda, riots broke out in Kaliachak after a rally led by Muslims protesting against Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwaris derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad turned violent. It was immediately seized upon by the BJP. In fact, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury credits the Trinamool Congress for the entry of the BJP in West Bengal.Simultaneously, Ms. Banerjees overtures to Muslims (the controversial stipend for imams , and her direct appeal to the community from political platforms) who constitute 28 per cent of the population have also helped create a Hindu vote. The converse of this is that it has helped the Trinamool Congress consolidate the minority vote.Four, if the Congress in the State is sitting smug, saying it hopes to build on the fact that it is the second largest party  even though by a wide margin  disappointment in the CPI(M) is acute because of the extent of defeat. Party leaders said they will analyse the data before pronouncing what went wrong, but one candidly confessed: The problem probably lies with us; we have not done enough for organisational renewal.Finally, the Kanyashree scheme  education stipends for girls, including a one-time payment of Rs.25,000 at the age of 18, provided the beneficiary continues to study  cycles for schoolchildren, the Rs.2/kg rice for the poor and a vast improvement in roads may have helped too, especially in the absence of an alternative that appealed to the people.Thanda thanda, cool coolOn Thursday morning, as it became clear that the Trinamool Congress was heading for a second consecutive triumph, party workers, their faces coloured green, danced through the streets of Kolkata to the beat of the dhak-dhol. Outside Ms. Banerjees home, exultant supporters shouted,  Thanda thanda, cool cool, ghore ghore Trinamool [Trinamool Congress in every home].But a little over 200 km away in Asansol, Trinamool workers in celebratory mode vandalised a CPI(M) office  an ominous start to the partys second term, especially as it comes days after Ms. Banerjee publicly threatening senior police officers who were just obeying the Election Commission and maintaining law and order.smita.g@thehindu.co.in"

Suddenly, a news flashed on the screen: ""Madan Mitra parajito"" (Madan Mitra defeated).Madan covered his face and a stony silence swept the room. Mitra, who expected to win from Kamarhati, knew that his political career was at crossroads.A close aide of Mitra opened the door and murmured ""they sabotaged"". Before the aide could explain, Mitra said, ""I lost because of some councillors."" Mitra had reports that at least two of his key campaigners were seen with a CPM leaders before the polls. But being confined to the hospital made him powerless and he could hardly do anything.Few days before his constituency went to polls, Mitra told one of his aide that this year he needs to win in order protect his family. ""In politics when you are out of power, people don't come to rescue when your house is on fire. This time I have to protect my family,"" Mitra had reportedly told the aide. The aide who stood outside his cabin in SSKM on Thursday said, ""It will be tough for him now. Especially when the party has performed so well this time.""Mitra's wife Archana, who has been inside the cabin since morning, tried to break his silence. She requested Mitra to have some food. For the past few days, Mitra was having problems with digestion. Silently he pulled the rice plate towards him and started eating. Madan's enthusiasts and supporters from Kamarhati were missing sisnce morning. The few who were waiting outside the hospital could not muster courage to meet him.Just then, Madan's son swung open the cabin door and his elder son Swarup came inside with the new-born baby. ""Abar notun kore suru korte habe. Rajnitite kichhui sesh hayna"" (We start afresh. Nothing ends in politics),"" added Mitra, the moment he saw his son. But for Madan, starting afresh will not be easy given his heath conditions.Although Manas Mukherjee managed to snatch the seat from Mitra, Left Front's overall performance had stymied the joyous mood. ""People have not accepted someone who siphoned off money from Saradha,"" added Mukherjee. TMC supporters, however, were happy with the party's performance but Mitra's defeat had saddened them.For the handful of loyalists gathered downstairs the only silver lining is the belief that he will be released on bail. ""He is no longer an MLA now. There is no way he can influence the Saradha enquiry,"" a loyalist said. Mitra is due to appear at the Alipore Court on May 31."

The reason for believing TMC might not win big was a buzz during the election that the Left Front-Congress alliance had momentum on its side. This had something to do with urban middle class disenchantment with TMC.But anyone who had gone around Bengal during the elections would have seen that there was no real mood of anti-incumbency. By and large, rural voters seemed satisfied with the TMC governments investment in infrastructure. Roads and bridges had been built, more people had access to water and electricity and there was some improvement in the state-run health system.This, along with schemes like subsidised rice and free bicycles for students, had meant that rural Bengal was always going to back TMC. Muslim voters, who constitute 27% of West Bengals population, were appeased by stipends to imams and muezzins and scholarships to students. The election results have borne out the governments efforts. Except for districts like Malda and Murshidabad, where Congress has traditionally been strong, and Darjeeling where the Gorkha Janmukti Manch is dominant, TMC did uniformly well across the state.The moving force behind TMCs strong performance was chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself. She ran a whirlwind election campaign, holding some 200 rallies over the course of two months. Mamata turned the tables on the opposition alliance, which had made her the personal target of its campaign, by making the 2016 election a referendum on herself.It is, however, TMCs exceptional performance in urban areas, where discontent with the government seemed to have been strongest, that carried the party over the 200-seat mark. TMC won all 11 seats in Kolkata including the ones where candidates, who had figured in a video sting taking bribes, were contesting. One of the reasons for the TMCs sweep in Kolkata was the unknown opposition alliance candidates pitted against TMC heavyweights.On paper, the Left-Congress alliance had seemed formidable. It had roughly the same share of the vote as TMC in the 2014 national elections. The alliance also displayed surprisingly good chemistry by not only dividing electoral constituencies smoothly, but also campaigning vigorously on a joint platform. It, however, won a combined vote share of 39% and only 76 seats. The alliance was undone by several factors.First, the alliance did not have a face with statewide acceptability. Its CM candidate, Surjya Kanta Mishra, was not up to the task as was evident from his inability to win even from his own constituency. Second, unlike Bihar, where the combination of the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal worked well, there wasnt a smooth transfer of votes from Congress to the Left and vice versa.Third, the people of West Bengal have not forgiven the Left Front for the stagnation it inflicted on the state. This was reflected in the decline of the Left Fronts vote from 30% in 2014 to 26% now, even as Congress marginally increased its vote share. Finally, the alliance did not have a new narrative to offer to Bengal except for being opposed to TMC and Mamata.In 2011, there were huge expectations of poriborton or change that TMC had promised after 34 years of Left Front rule. While TMCs welfare policies delivered a resounding mandate and marginalised issues such as corruption, the party has failed on several counts. Political violence and intimidation, which are a legacy of the Left Fronts tenure, continue unabated in West Bengal. This is largely the effect of mass migration of the Lefts lumpen cadre to TMC.Whereas a heavy security presence ensured a relatively peaceful poll in 2016, earlier civic and panchayat elections in the state have been marked by violence. At the same time, lack of industry and employment opportunities have given rise to extortion rackets or syndicates run by TMC members.During Mamatas second term as CM, expectations might not be as high as in 2011. It is unlikely that she will be able to break free from the constraints of her partys organisation and support base. But given her mandate, the question is whether Mamata will crack down on some of the most corrupt and violent elements in her party. Or will she take it as an endorsement for business as usual?"

She came out of her home at 8.30am and received flower bouquets from visitors who had come from various parts of the city. Didi shook hands with some of them and later handed over packets of sweets to the children.Mamata's residence on Friday turned into a centre of celebration with VIPs, administrators, event managers, journalists and visitors making a beeline to meet her either to chalk out future plans or enquire about the grand swearing-in ceremony to be held on May 27. Banerjee had convened a meeting of the newly-elected MLAs. But before anybody from her team of 210 MLAs could reach her house, Banerjee reportedly held a closed-door meeting with her trusted lieutenants Subrata Bakshi and Mukul Roy. ""The names of probable ministers in the next cabinet were discussed in the meeting,"" said a source.The meeting with the MLAs started with a loud applause for Didi for the historic victory of the party despite threat from alliance. The meeting ended with a note of caution - introspection in the rank and file of the party following failures in some key assembly constituencies, including Jadavpur. The newly-elected MLAs were offered fish fry, fried rice, chicken and sweets.However, Mamata opted for a light lunch - rice and 'kalmi saag' with chilly. After spending a while in her room speaking to family members, she went back to her lucky office room where she held a series of meetings till the evening. The IAS association members led by chief secretary Basudev Bandopadhyay met her. An IPS delegation was in the queue. Mamata called them in and passed on necessary instruction especially in the wake of escalating political tensions.Mamata, however, did not forget to discuss about the swearing-in ceremony which will be held on Red Road. ""This function is very close to Didi's heart. This time she has chosen Red Road to make sure that even common people can become a part of it. We have been flooded with requests for passes from the people of her locality. We will also take our family members there,"" said Karthick Banerjee, Mamata's brother. In fact, she has asked senior Trinamool Congress leaders to form a committee that will look after the preparations for the swearing-in ceremony. ""I will be happy if people in large numbers take part in the ceremony,"" Mamata said."

Disturbing TV visuals of her ministers taking bribe, collapse of a Kolkata flyover killing over 20 people prior to the election had little impact on the results in West Bengal as Mamata Banerjee stormed back to power for a second consecutive term, leaving many political pundits baffled and fumbling for words to explain her unbelievably massive victory both in terms of seats and vote share.How can one explain Mamatas triumph? Is the mandate a yes in favour of her governments development activities or a no to a hastily conjured alliance of two ideologically opposed partners, the Left and the Congress? The story contains both.The no factorTrouble was brewing within the Left-Congress alliance since its inception. Many CPM leaders, from the Polit Bureau to the district committees, were ideologically opposed to the idea of joining hands with the Congress. It is no longer a secret now that many Left voters chose NOTA (None Of The Above) instead of an alliance candidate. Similarly, a large number of Congress supporters refused to vote for Left candidates, they voted for the Trinamool instead. In short, neither the arithmetic nor the chemistry worked for the alliance.The Left-Congress partnership emerged too late, barely two months before the polls, giving it too little time to bloom. Also, after repeated electoral debacles, first in the 2011 Assembly polls and then in the municipal and Lok Sabha elections, the powerful organisation of the Left, which won them so many elections in the past, collapsed completely. So, while Trinamool workers were busy campaigning in the villages, the Left leaders had little option but to use air-conditioned studios of news channels as their primary vehicles of campaign.The silent voters, whose votes finally determine the outcome of every election, did not trust the alliance. Many believed the Left-Congress bonhomie would not last long even if the alliance came to power. As a result, the government would fall, requiring another round of elections. These silent voters chose stability and voted for the Trinamool.The Muslim community influenced electoral outcome in at least 80 of the 294 seats by supporting the Trinamool. The Left could be credited for preventing communal riots, but they virtually did nothing for the Muslims during their 30-year rule. True, Mamata promised much and delivered little, but unlike the Left, she delivered something, felt the Muslims, particularly those in the rural areas.Finally, the Left-Congress leaders expectations on the possible swing in the BJPs vote share in their favour went horribly wrong. True to their calculations, the BJPs vote share came down from 17% to 10%, but the swing entirely favoured the Trinamool.The yes factorStrange though it may sound, but many of the accusations against Mamata in fact helped her. The Trinamool was accused of running a syndicate raj in West Bengal. True, the syndicates fleece realtors, supply low-grade building materials at prices much higher than the market rates, but syndicate members, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, have no other source of livelihood.There are at least 30,000 syndicate members in the Rajarhat-New Town area alone, and the Left-Congress alliances promise of action against syndicates if they came to power worried these young men and they worked body and soul to ensure a Trinamool victory. Syndicates exist in all urban areas in Bengal and all of them worked for the Trinamool. Similarly, the Oppositions charge that the government was wasting tax payers money to give donations to the local clubs alienated the club members, who doggedly worked to ensure Mamatas victory.On the other hand, in spite of the financial constraints and the resulting shoe-string budget, Mamatas government successfully implemented a slew of development projects, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. In spite of repeated incidents of violence against women, Mamata managed to win them over by distributing cycles to girl students. Owning a cycle in a village is like possessing a Maruti car in a city. Interestingly, the idea of distributing cycles was floated by a chief secretary during the last leg of the Left Front rule, but the proposal was bluntly shot down by the then finance minister Asim Dasgupta.Finally, distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg came as Mamatas masterstroke. Better road connectivity, availability of water and medicines increased the Trinamools vote share. Though corruption was clearly visible, local Trinamool leaders were pardoned by the rural voters. Issues like the Saradha chit fund scam, Narada sting operation, flyover collapse and campus violence eroded the Trinamools vote share, but the erosion was confined to urban seats and every Narada-tainted minister won, albeit with a lower margin.So, where does Mamata go from here? Insiders say Delhi is her next target. If the Third Front takes shape after the Uttar Pradesh elections, she hopes to play a major role at the Centre. Till then, she will concentrate on the next panchayat election in West Bengal to further consolidate her position.(The writer is a senior journalist based in Kolkata)"
590494907be9e04154df8ccd,Rule of Right? Daal-chawal only ideology that matters,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/rule-of-right-daal-chawal-only-ideology-that-matters/,2016-05-22,"By now, enough has been said about how the state assembly elections have been a booster shot for BJP, how they have moved India closer to a Congress-mukt Bharat and how the results have been another kick in the guts for Rahul Gandhi. With over 35% of Indians now under the rule of BJP state governments (43% if we count BJP alliances) as compared to just 7% for Congress (15% if we count its Bihar alliance), Amit Shah is rightly exulting at the prospect of BJP domination from Parliament to panchayats. The BJPs replacement of Congress as the dominant national party makes the narrative of rightwing ascendance seductive.Yet, look deeper and the most important lesson coming out of these elections is not a triumph of ideology but its demise and the replacement of blind political loyalties of the past by a new neta-voter relationship that is increasingly transactional. Mamata Banerjee decimated the Left with even more seats than her poribartan year of 2011 and Jayalalithaa rewrote the script of Dravidian politics to become the first Tamil CM to get re-elected since MGR because both inherently understood this fundamental shift in political cultures.Politics in Kolkata and Chennai beats to different rhythms but the one thing that unites the game-changing triumphs of both regional satraps is their single-minded focus on a social welfare net for the rural poor, rural development and a plethora of populist freebies for different interest groups.Consider the Mamata model first. Just like Nitish Kumar in Bihar, she fixed roads (5,212.94km of roads in Bengal were improved and renovated during 2011-2015 as compared to 3,220.28km during 2007-2011), brought rural electrification (over 90% of below poverty line households electrified by January 2016, compared to just 18.18% in 2011) and increased social spending (tripled from around Rs 7,000 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 20,000 crore in 2014-15).Along with the Nitish-like Kanyashree scheme for greater enrolment of girls in schools and the distribution of bicycles to four million schoolchildren, Mamata also borrowed a leaf from Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, who earned the sobriquet of chawal waale baba with his Rs 1 and 2/kg rice schemes for the poor. These schemes have been central to Raman Singhs BJP government remaining in power in Chhattisgarh since 2003. In West Bengal, not only did Didi increase state support for foodgrain almost 12 times, from Rs 516.32 crore during 2010-11 to Rs 6,000 crore, she made rice available at Rs 2 per kilo, entitling almost 80 million Bengalis to subsidized rice.Mamatas focus on PDS and freebies, of course, paled next to what Amma of Poes Garden offered in Tamil Nadu, but West Bengal has a much lower starting base. Jayalalithaas plethora of promises such as subsidized mopeds and her low-cost canteens, medicines, buses, cement, housing, free goats and cows, etc built on a strong culture of social spending in Tamil politics that both AIADMK and DMK have embraced for decades.Her focus on delivery  combined with a superb, tactically fought election, where there was virtually nothing to separate the two parties ideologically  fetched her uniform gains in all Tamil Nadu regions. It also allowed her to break the revolving-door rule of Tamil politics where power has see-sawed between the two main parties for three decades. Jayalalithaa may have returned to power with a reduced majority, but make no mistake: this is a historic victory.The BJPs path-breaking triumph in Guwahati completes the ideological lesson from these elections. Unlike Congress, BJP learnt its lessons and course-corrected after losses in Bihar and Delhi where its local leaders felt sidelined and its message of development got sidetracked by divisive issues. In Assam, not only did it project a local chief ministerial face in Sarbananda Sonowal, it reaped the benefits of local clout through its ex-Congress import Himanta Biswa Sarma and smart alliances with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF). Although this was the first state election being fought after the JNU and beef controversies, the BJP remained focused on local issues during the campaign. The BJPs Assam model offers a good template as the party seeks to expand further from its north Indian heartland.The BJP is dominant nationally and Narendra Modi remains Indias most popular leader  but in a polity where both BJP and Congress put together have won less than half the seats and votes polled in all the 30 assembly elections held since 2012. As this paper has reported, the two got 42% of the votes polled in these contests, 58% went to other parties. Even in the latest contest, Congress won 115 seats, BJP 64, but others won 643. As many as 465 seats were won by parties not allied to either BJP or Congress.This is the most revealing statistic that defines Indian politics today. The Congress may be declining but regional parties continue to hold the bulk of India and more than Left or Right, voters care more about daal and chawal  and who provides it better."

(Source: PTI) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee enjoys watching aquarium fish at her Kalighat residence in Kolkata on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)SLAMMING THE Trinamool Congress for conducting the lavish swearing-in ceremony at the traffic-heavy Red Road, state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury on Tuesday said the party will boycott the programme and launch a protest movement when Mamata Banerjee takes oath as Chief Minister on Friday.We will not attend the swearing-in ceremony of Mamata Banerjee on Friday. There is no meaning in attending the programme when our partymen are attacked by Trinamool Congress workers in post-poll violence, Chowdhury said at a press conference ahead of a meeting with party MLAs and district presidents here.He questioned the need to spend crores of rupees for the swearing-in ceremony of the new government and said it was in sharp contrast to the severe financial crisis faced by the state. At a time when Bengal has been rated as the number one debt-ridden state in the country and is heading for financial bankruptcy, was there any necessity of a celebration of this magnitude at the cost of the state exchequer?, he asked.Referring to the preparations for the ceremony on Red Road, for which vehicular traffic has been closed on the stretch for at least five days, Chowdhury said, Red Road is the lifeline of the city without which the traffic movement is chocked. The celebration is the orchestration of the ruling partys victory and is a splash of power and grandeur.We are in the process of obtaining permission for a protest movement on May 27, the day when the new government would be sworn in. It will be at the Y Channel in Esplanade, the WBPCC president added.Chowdhury further attacked the state government over the alleged post-poll violence and said the Trinamool should ensure that it keeps the promises it made to the people, riding on which it came back to power. Maintaining law and order should be the top priority at the moment. No investment will come here if potential investors see that the condition here was not conducive enough for investment. Already availability of rice at Rs 2 per kg has been stopped at public distribution centres soon after elections, he said.On who could be the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly from Congress, which won on 44 of 294 assembly Chowdhury said a list of MLAs along with their detailed CVs has been sent to AICC which will take a decision soon. It is a legislative process and the name would be determined by the central leadership. I think it would be prudent to leave it up to them. I will give my suggestions only I am asked to, but I cant disclose it to the media now, he said.Asked if the Congress would be present at the Left Fronts two-day sit-in on May 25 and 26 at Esplanade in protest against post-poll attacks on its supporters, Chowdhury said, Obviously we will be there After all we are in an alliance.[with PTI inputs]For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Earlier, on May 19, they had written to PM Narendra Modi about the situation and sought protection.Forward Blocs Akshay Thakur claimed that the chief reason behind the attacks is the enclave dwellers decision to vote for the Left Front candidate from Dinhata.Sitting MLA Udayan Guha, who switched from Forward Bloc to TMC before the election, denied the allegations and promised to support the former enclave dwellers in their protest.After the exchange of enclaves between India and Bangladesh, 9,776 new Indians voted for the first time in the Bengal Assembly polls. Nearly 91 per cent of the former enclave dwellers voted in the polls. They said that soon after the results were declared, the attacks began.We were very disillusioned with the TMC. They distributed elections cards, but not ration cards. They promised rice to us, but it did not come. Afterwards, when we didnt vote for them, they began attacking us, said Joynal Abedin, a 21-year-old resident Madhya Moshaldanga, which was earlier an enclave, in Dinhata.Ulganathan has assured the residents that adequate steps will be taken for their protection, but the latter are not very convinced.These are just promises. Thats all we have got till now. Neither our demands, nor our safety has actually been looked into. We will be forced to sit on a dharna outside district headquarters if this continues, said Alamgir Hussain, another former enclave resident.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Scientists from IIT-Kharagpur and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have uncovered evidence that the Indus Valley Civilization is at least 8,000 years old, and not 5,500 years old, taking root well before the Egyptian (7000BC to 3000BC) and Mesopotamian (6500BC to 3100BC) civilizations. What's more, the researchers have found evidence of a pre-Harappan civilization that existed for at least 1,000 years before this.The discovery, published in the prestigious 'Nature' journal on May 25, may force a global rethink on the timelines of the so-called 'cradles of civilization'. The scientists believe they also know why the civilization ended about 3,000 years ago  climate change.""We have recovered perhaps the oldest pottery from the civilization. We used a technique called 'optically stimulated luminescence' to date pottery shards of the Early Mature Harappan time to nearly 6,000 years ago and the cultural levels of pre-Harappan Hakra phase as far back as 8,000 years,"" said Anindya Sarkar, head of the department of geology and geophysics at IIT-Kgp.The team had actually set out to prove that the civilization proliferated to other Indian sites like Bhirrana and Rakhigarrhi in Haryana, apart from the known locations of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan and Lothal, Dholavira and Kalibangan in India. They took their dig to an unexplored site, Bhirrana  and ended up unearthing something much bigger. The excavation also yielded large quantities of animal remains like bones, teeth, horn cores of cow, goat, deer and antelope, which were put through Carbon 14 analysis to decipher antiquity and the climatic conditions in which the civilization flourished, said Arati Deshpande Mukherjee of Deccan College, which helped analyse the finds along with Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.The researchers believe that the Indus Valley Civilization spread over a vast expanse of India  stretching to the banks of the now ""lost"" Saraswati river or the Ghaggar-Hakra river - but this has not been studied enough because what we know so far is based on British excavations. ""At the excavation sites, we saw preservation of all cultural levels right from the pre-Indus Valley Civilization phase (9000-8000 BC) through what we have categorised as Early Harappan (8000-7000BC) to the Mature Harappan times,"" said Sarkar.While the earlier phases were represented by pastoral and early village farming communities, the mature Harappan settlements were highly urbanised with organised cities, and a much developed material and craft culture. They also had regular trade with Arabia and Mesopotamia. The Late Harappan phase witnessed large-scale de-urbanisation, drop in population, abandonment of established settlements, lack of basic amenities, violence and even the disappearance of the Harappan script, the researchers say.""We analysed the oxygen isotope composition in the bone and tooth phosphates of these remains to unravel the climate pattern. The oxygen isotope in mammal bones and teeth preserve the signature of ancient meteoric water and in turn the intensity of monsoon rainfall. Our study shows that the pre-Harappan humans started inhabiting this area along the Ghaggar-Hakra rivers in a climate that was favourable for human settlement and agriculture. The monsoon was much stronger between 9000 years and 7000 years from now and probably fed these rivers making them mightier with vast floodplains,"" explained Deshpande Mukherjee.They took their dig to an unexplored site, Bhirrana  and ended up unearthing something much bigger.

The study revealed that monsoon started weakening 7,000 years ago but, surprisingly, the civilization did not disappear.The Indus Valley people were very resolute and flexible and continued to evolve even in the face of declining monsoon. The people shifted their crop patterns from large-grained cereals like wheat and barley during the early part of intensified monsoon to drought-resistant species like rice in the latter part. As the yield diminished, the organised large storage system of the Mature Harappan period gave way to more individual household-based crop processing and storage systems that acted as a catalyst for the de-urbanisation of the civilization rather than an abrupt collapse, they say."

People tell me that the Left is losing its relevance here in Bengal. I refer to the 2.15 crore votes in the Assembly elections and say that if the Left is not relevant here, it is not relevant in any part of the world, the CPM state secretary said.Watch Video: Whats making newsHe was quick to point out that no one would be able to distinguish the number of votes secured by Congress and the CPM separately.Mishra reiterated that there was an under-the-table settlement between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress. Whatever the Election Commission claimed, we know what kind of settlement was there between the two, he said.The CPM leader slammed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for giving out bicycles to schoolchildren and rice at the rate of Rs 2 a kg to people to earn favour. Just before the election, schools went on a vacation and the rice meant for mid-day meals were channelised in this Rs-2 scheme to lure people. Now, after the election results are out, supply of foodgrain at public distribution system outlets have dried up, Mishra said.Alleging that Mamatas gimmicks had swayed voters towards TMC, he said, People who had been momentarily benefitted out of these schemes did not want to bother about where the state was going, as long as they stood to gain something out of it. That is a kind of narcissistic attitude which the ruling party had been exploiting to their benefit. But the mandate doesnt legitimise the instances of corruption that the TMC is into.Mishra also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and said that he was making tall claims in his speeches during his visit to the United States, via teleprompters. Mamata must be very happy listening to those. While he is saying to the Hindi-speaking population that I can save you if you vote for me, Mamata is saying the same to the Urdu-speaking crowd, Mishra said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Chandan Bose, the accused in Jawahar Bagh clash, being taken to jail in Mathura on Thursday. PTIRam Vriksh Yadav, the head of the cult outfit Swadhin Bharat Vidhik Satyagrah, had such sway over his followers that continued to live in camps in Jawahar Bagh in Mathura despite being served namak and roti (salt and chapati) and khichdi, alternately as lunch and dinner.The alleged mastermind of the violence on June 2 during police action to evict the squatters, Ram Vriksh had told his followers, who had illegally encroached the public park that police can never attack the camp as they cannot use arms against women and children. The followers who expressed desire to leave the camp for their native homes fearing action from the local administration, were motivated to stay back and told how they can attack the police if they ever raided Jawahar Bagh.These are some of the details that Ram Vrikshs close associate Chandan Bose, who was arrested along with his wife from Basti district Wednesday, revealed during the police interrogation.Bose and his wife were produced in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Thursday, which sent them to 14 days judicial custody. The couple had been on the run after the violence on June 2 saw 29 people, including two police officers and, reportedly, Ram Vriksh, dead.SSP Mathura, Babloo Kumar told The Indian Express that during preliminary interrogation Bose divulged crucial information about the functioning of the camp in the Jawahar Bagh. Bose, who is said to be the second-in-command in the cult outfit, told the police how the followers were assigned different duties in the camp based on the their educational and personal skills.Watch Video: Whats making newsA quack from Buxar, who was also a follower of Jai Gurudev, acted as the doctor in the camp while Bose was handling finances and ration. Those who were skilled in handling arms, used to give shooting training inside the camp while those who had studied management and law were dealing with their respective sections of fund management and legal issues, the SSP said quoting Bose.According to police, Bose told them that there were some 2,500 people living in the camp till June 2, the day when police moved in to evict the area. There used to be a head count of the members every night before they went to bed, Bose told the police.Ram Vriksh used to collect funds to run the camp from the inmates even as many of the rich followers of Jai Gurudev used to donate lakhs of rupees.Bose recalled that recently some from Deoria district donated Rs 10 lakh. But, such big donations came only once in a while. Ram Vriksh used to issue receipts against the donations too, the SSP said.Bose also told the police that those living in the camp were urged to go to their native villages during harvest season and bring back maximum donation of foodgrains. The villagers used to come back with trucks loaded with wheat, rice and sugarcane, the SSP said.The modus operadi of collecting funds was reportedly copied from the Jai Gurudev Trust in Mathura and Pithora.Bose accepted that people in the camp had laptops, mobiles and guns. He, however, could not reveal from where the arms were procured saying that he wasnt in charge of that section.The SSP said that based on Boses interrogation, they now have several leads, which will help them in carrying out the probe.Accused of inciting the violence on June 2, Bose told police that he was a native of West Bengal and had shifted to Ludhiana about 20 years ago. He ran a small garment business and claimed to have came in contact with Ram Vriksh during the latters visit to Ludhiana a few years ago, police said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Odisha was one of them  the BJP won just one out of 21 seats and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which had ruled the state since 2000, won the rest. The BJP was no greenhorn in Odisha, as it was in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, two other states that bucked the Modi wave. The BJP was part of the ruling coalition in the state between 2000 and 2009.What it pointed to was the BJD's, or more accurately, its leader Naveen Patnaik 's grip on the state. It did not matter that the BJD was not part of a national coalition, nor were the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu. Voters in these states backed the regional parties as if it were an assembly election, except that Odisha also had its state polls concurrently, which benefited the BJD in the general election.In its best ever performance, the BJD swept the assembly election too, bagging 117 out of 147 seats (the BJP won 10 and the Congress 16), giving Patnaik his fourth straight term as chief minister. Only two of his present counterparts have won four consecutive elections or more: Sikkim's Pawan Chamling and Tripura's Manik Sarkar. Patnaik's father Biju Patnaik was chief minister of Odisha twice.The BJD and the BJP first joined hands in 1998 and fought every parliamentary and state election together till 2009, when the BJD decided to part ways because the BJP did not agree to give the BJD more seats than in the old seat-sharing agreement. Some cite the Kandhamal riots of 2008, in which the killing of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader led to clashes between Hindus and Christians, as another reason for the BJD severing ties with the BJP; some 38 perished in those clashes that led to the conviction of a BJP MLA.Modi is aware of how far the BJP has to go to even dream of having a shot at power on its own in the state in 2019 and that is why he chose Odisha for one of the five rallies to mark his government's second anniversary.The rally in Balasore, 200 km north of the state capital Bhubaneswar, on June 2, was Modi's second in the state since February. It was also his fourth visit to Odisha since becoming prime minister in May 2014. At the rally he told an estimated 50,000 people that while Odisha is a mineral-rich state, its people continue to be poor, calling Patnaik's government ""soi hui sarkar"" (government in slumber). Modi said neither the Congress at the Centre earlier nor the BJD in the state has given an account of its performance like his government has. Patnaik responded by saying his government believes in work, not propaganda. He accused the Modi government of stopping some schemes for the state and reducing its contribution in others.Sudhir Patnaik, editor of Samadrusti, an Odia fortnightly, says Modi refrains from attacking Naveen, creating confusion in the minds of voters and the BJP cadre. ""People see the BJP and BJD together and that doesn't help the BJP. These days, Modi's rallies are not attracting the kind of crowds they used to."" He adds that the 69-year-old chief minister also rarely hits out at opposition leaders. ""Naveen Patnaik is an astute politician who uses silence to his advantage.""Can the BJP look to its rise in Assam for some lessons in Odisha? After all, the party was not a force to reckon with in Assam after the 2011 assembly polls, in which it won only five out of 126 seats. But it managed to regroup in the years leading up to the 2016 election, which it won through a coalition, helped in no small measure by anti-incumbency against former Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who had won three consecutive terms. The BJP is facing a similar scenario in Odisha, with three years to go for the next poll, so can it capitalise on it?Tathagata Satpathy, a BJD MP, does not think so. ""The BJP had (Sarbananda) Sonowal in Assam. Here they don't have a leader like him."" Sudhir Patnaik concurs: ""Neither the BJP nor the Congress has a leader who can stand up to Naveen Patnaik."" The Congress is the chief opposition party in the state, though the number of its MLAs and its vote share have been falling since 2004. The BJP's vote share, on the other hand, rose between 2009 and 2014.The BJP's Samir Mohanty says its leadership vacuum in the state has ended with Dharmendra Pradhan, Union minister of state (independent charge) for petroleum and natural gas, being accepted by the people to lead the party. ""He is ahead (of the other leaders)."" But Pradhan, observers believe, does not have a pan-state appeal. The other prominent leader, Jual Oram, who is the sole BJP MP from Odisha and is the Union tribal affairs minister, is not in a better position either, though tribals account for nearly a fourth of the state's population. Neither Pradhan nor Oram was available for comment.Differences within the party are also becoming more evident. Recently, Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray stayed away from a party event in the city, protesting against the delay in the upgrade of a local hospital, despite promises by the prime minister. This forced two Union ministers who had been scheduled to attend the event to cancel their plans. Arun Singh, a BJP general secretary who is in charge of Odisha, makes light of it, and says the issue concerned Ray's constituency, not the party.Making things worse for the BJP were the recent bypolls to three local body seats, including one in Cuttack: the party came third in all of them. The BJD, which had held them, lost two to the Congress. Satpathy says while the issues on which these were fought were local, the results are a signal to the party not to be overconfident. Prasad Harichandan, president of the Congress in Odisha, sees the results as a harbinger of better days, but this might be wishful thinking, as these are not Lok Sabha or assembly by-polls.Bhartruhari Mahtab, BJD MP from Cuttack, alleges an understanding between the Congress and BJP in the bypoll in the city, which led to the former's victory. ""The consolidation of anti-BJD votes is happening sporadically."" He said the BJD wants both the Congress and the BJP in the state. ""We want a triangular fight.""What the opposition will be banking on is anti-incumbency as Patnaik will have been chief minister for 19 years when the state goes to the polls in 2019. But Satpathy says there is no anti-incumbency in Odisha, thanks to welfare schemes, like 25 kg rice per month at Rs 1 per kg for the poor, and free bicycles to schoolchildren. These welfare schemes have, to an extent, blunted the impact of a Rs 4,600 crore chit fund scam, in which an MP and an MLA of the BJD were arrested. Also, the Trinamool's comprehensive victory in West Bengal, despite its members being linked to the Saradha scam, makes some wonder whether the chit fund scam will have any impact in the 2019 polls, which will coincide with the general election.A Rs 59,000 crore illegal iron and manganese ore scam, which was probed by a commission before the 2014 polls, did not affect the BJD at the hustings. ""We can't say which issues will become important at the time of the election,"" says BJP's Odisha president Basanta Panda. He rules out the possibility of the BJP going back to join forces with the BJD, at least not before the 2019 election. Singh says the BJP is organising programmes against the government frequently at the mandal and district levels. ""It takes time to fight the party you ran the government with. But we are confident of winning the 2019 election.""""Anti-incumbency will work only if there is an alternative. In 2014, the Congress was not an alternative to the BJD,"" says Harichandan. The Congress is hopeful about the 2019 polls. ""If the BJP could form the government (at the Centre) with a 31% vote share (in 2014), why should we lose hope?"" asks Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the Odisha assembly, Narasingha Mishra. The Congress had a vote share of 26% in the 2014 assembly election.If Modi's rallies are any indication, there is no doubt that capturing Odisha is a top priority for the BJP and with three years to go for the election, it has enough time to work toward its goal. But time is not the only factor; the BJP cannot afford to be rudderless in the state. Modi's frequent visits to the state notwithstanding, the party has to identify and rally behind a leader who can take on the might of Naveen Patnaik."
5923bc047be9e01fcef05835,Redressal policy for water dispute hazy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553627/redressal-policy-water-dispute-hazy.html,2016-06-21,"Redressal policy for water dispute hazyBy Bhaskar Parichha, Jun 22, 2016, DHNS 0:28 ISTExperts feel the need for an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in India.As recent as in March, the National thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had to shut down its 2100 MW capacity power plant in West Bengal because it hadnt enough water to be used as coolant for the equipment.The level in the Farakka feeder canal which supplies water to the thermal plant had shrunk to hopeless levels. That was also the reason why electricity supply to five states was disrupted and some 40,000 families had to remain without power for days together.Drinking water was in short supply in Farakka town. Plying of boats on river Ganga had to be suspended and around 13 barges carrying coal were stuck in the mid-river because of low levels of water. This demonstrates that the Ganges is drying up faster than estimated.According to different reports, in the last decade itself, water level in 91% of countrys water reservoirs has come down. The Central Water Commissions findings are even more frightening  only 29% of water is left behind against their carrying capacity. Whats more, ground water which is the major source 85%  of water in India is depleting endlessly.Across states in India, dependence on water tankers today is greater than before. Water-related scuffles nowadays are common place. Recently, in the villages of Latur district of Maharashtra, prohibitive orders had to be clamped. Water supply to swimming pools has been cut off in Maharashtra.According to NASA, the ground water level in India is diminishing by 0.3 metre annually. Paradoxically, when there is a severe shortage of water, farmers in desiccated areas are encouraged to produce water-guzzling sugar cane. Same is the case with wheat and rice which are water-intensive.On the other side of the spectrum, water disputes are constantly on the rise. In addition to the fact that there isnt enough water for irrigation because of the myopic policies of successive governments, water is causing bad blood among people. In Punjab, after the Sutlej link canal bill was passed in the assembly, fissures have surfaced between Haryana and Punjab over division of water. In Haryana, farmers owning agricultural fields are screaming for water.Of late, state after state seem to be relying on the principle of Harmon. State governments are fostering a gut feeling that they have full control over the water that flows down from the state line.In order to trim down water disputes between states, the Inter-State Water Dispute Act was enacted in 1956. But the water dispute tribunals have consistently failed to implement the accords reached between states.In as much as the tribunal doesnt have coercive powers and its judgments are not binding on the states, the pronoun-cements are flouted and states straightforwardly refuse to abide by the agreements reach-ed. Even the Centre is toothless, as it happened in the case of Ravi-Beas river water dispute.Institutional safeguardsIn reality, the water dispute redressal mechanism in India is a lot ambiguous, hazy and muddled. Those involved in the water row, time and again, has recourse to bullying. Resolution of water dispute is a hell of a job because of the sheer number of players  the Centre, the state governments, the water dispute tribunals, the civil society and so on. Even institutional safeguards meant for development and progress is becoming ineffective.Take for example, the Cauvery river water dispute. From 1968 to 1990, there were as many as 26 minister-level talks between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; but there has been no answer to the row. Because of increasing politicisation, the Cauvery river dispute tribunals proposals have become some sort of a wild goose chase.Experts feel the increasing need of an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in the country. This Central regulatory body must know how to undertake water upkeep seriously. In the same way, we need a mechanism to share our water in the best possible way keeping in mind the social equity, need and lots of common wisdom.Industries, farmers and the common citizenry should be the partners in any talk of water distribution and conservation. We also need a couple of new laws and make stronger the present ones to maintain the ecological balance of Indias rivers. A new law to maintain minimum levels of water too is considered necessary. Politicisation of water is the last thing to be wished.All that is looked for is an attitudinal change among stakeholders. A long time solution to Indias water problem is enormously significant and the sooner we find an answer to the vexing problem of depleting water sources and the corresponding feuds the better. Water is one commodity which can never be put to buy and sell. Commercialisation of water can happen only in the depths of despair."

(Express photo/ Partha Paul).BJP leader Roopa Ganguly on Monday lauded Trinamool Congress governments initiatives such as Kanyasree and Sabuj Saathi.Families have definitely benefitted from Kanyasree projects and through distribution of cycles. If a girl is given a cycle, wont it help her? The money that they get from Kanyashree scheme help them a lot It is definitely a good scheme but it has been propagated with a political agenda. There is nothing wrong with the scheme but there is something wrong in its implementation, she said.Ganguly was speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a symposium on the Role of Womens Empowerment in Facilitating Inclusive Economic Growth, organised by MCC Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kolkata.Under Kanyashree scheme, an annual scholarship is provided to poor girls between 13 and 18 years of age to continue their studies. Besides, if an unmarried girl continues her studies up to the age of 18 years, a one-time grant of Rs 25,000 is deposited in her bank account.If we take out politics and political influence from every little thing in the society, we can actually empower people. Today, every aspect of the society has been politicised. We need to first stop this and then only we can empower the people, especially women, she added.However, referring to the state governments decision to probe the Narada sting operation, Ganguly came down heavily on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. It is such a farce that it is of no use commenting on such issues. She (Mamata) is realising that she is trying to fool the people. She has watched the video footages and found another way to fool the people. She is a brilliant politician, she said.On Mamata governments Khadya Sathi initiative, she said: If I am giving rice at Rs 2 per kg to people, I should have the courtesy to tell them that I am getting it at Re 1 per kg and then giving it to you at Rs 2 per kg.Earlier, while speaking at the symposium, Ganguly claimed said she was twice beaten up at Gopalnagar in Kolkata and in Kakdwip in South-24 Parganas by women who she claimed were wrongly empowered. I was twice beaten up by women before the Assembly polls. Those who had beaten us were empowered women but they were wrongly empowered, she said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The seven tea gardens are Birpara, Garganda, Lankapara, Tulsipara, Huntapara, Dhumchipara and Demdima.After the Centre announced that it was taking over seven of the 14 shut tea gardens belonging at Dooars in Alipurduar, the condition of the workers of these tea gardens has worsened.

The Duncans group, however, had moved Calcutta High Court against the decision.Prodded by the state government, Duncans was paying wages to the workers of its other tea gardens, Mamata said, indicating that the Centres move has left the entire process in a logjam. We will soon initiate talks with the Centre in this regard, she added.Meanwhile, Mamata said the state plans to take over six tea gardens  Red Bank, Surendra Nagar, Dharanipur, Dekhlapara, Bandapani, Madhu and Rahimabad  at Dooars.The six tea gardens have been shut for a long time.

591f0d177be9e025a5d4a160,"Mountain of debt owing to sops, Mamata's bugbear",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/559558/mountain-debt-owing-sops-mamatas.html,2016-07-22,"Mountain of debt owing to sops, Mamata's bugbearDrimi Chaudhuri, July 23, 2016, Kolkata, 23:30 ISTDatelineWhere Amma gives away laptops and scooters, Didi offers bicycles and shoes. Both examples of sops-driven populist politics, Didis (West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) pain seems to have just started, unlike that of Amma (Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa).And the pain can be traced back to the dismal financial condition of West Bengal, an issue Mamata, also Trinamool Congress chairperson and Didi to her supporters  and even some detractors  has never stopped harping on.Unlike Amma, Didi was never a matinee idol or known for an ostentatious lifestyle. Despite coming from opposite ends of the spectrum, both women followed a similar brand of politics. Unlike Jayalalithaa, however, Mamata never had the means to run her drive of populism. With Bengal facing a severe financial crunch, Mamata could be facing something Jayalalithaa is not likely to ever face: bankruptcy.Two months into her second term, which Mamata entered like an unstoppable force, her government seems to have met with an immovable object. Trinamool, the ruling party in Bengal that returned with an unbelievable mandate, is often blamed ofideological bankruptcy. For Mamata, the term could come with a new meaning since Bengal is among the most cash-starved states in India.Mamata has never minced words to state that the biggest challenge before her is not holding on to power but insolvency, notwithstanding the politics of largesse she has turned into her trademark since coming to power in 2011. In the last six years that she has been in office, Mamata has given away millions of cycles to hapless girl students, shoes to others who cannot afford a pair and lakhs of rupees to neighbourhood clubs so they can pursue sporting activities.Even as her politics of largesse continues unabated, the wrinkles on the forehead of state Finance Minister Amit Mitra seems to have set deeper. The matter on top of Mitras head has to be Bengals outstanding debt of Rs 3 lakh crore, a nightmare he had to combat while presenting the state budget in June. While Mitra admitted in the Assembly that the state was facing a debt trap, Mamata went a step further and described it as a death trap.Party insiders have admitted that the mountain of debt on Bengal could go some distance to change Trinamools political priorities. Political analysts have noted with some caution that Mamatas politics of largesse to the bottom of the pyramid, funnelling crores of rupees into social and civic infrastructure  free bicycles and shoes, rice at Rs 2 per kg, metalled roads through villages  might have reaped her rich political dividends but have left the exchequer further crippled. And despite the landslide majority, money remains her top concern.Mitra has often pointed out that during its first term in office, the Trinamool government raised plan expenditure from Rs 14,000 crore to Rs 53,000 crore. That, however, was not enough to keep the debt burden at bay, which is fast devouring the states resources. Going by cold statistics, in 2015-16, the Bengal government paid almost Rs 28,000 crore to its debtors, with the accumulated interest during the ongoing fiscal year likely to stand at upwards of Rs 32,000 crore.Mitra also admitted that even though the states debt stock increased by more than Rs 1 lakh crore till March 2016, around Rs 94,000 crore would go just to service existing debt. While Mamata and the Trinamool leadership are not oblivious to this scenario, with the panchayat elections scheduled for 2018, the ruling party cannot afford to deviate from its path of creating human capital, based on sops. Leaders are aware that this means spending more on social and civic infrastructure, funds for which are fast drying up.Overtakes LeftOfficials have often admitted in off-the-record conversations that even though Mamata counts the debt burden as the only legacy of the 34-year-long Left rule, her government has borrowed more money in the last six years than the Left did between 1977 and 2011. Bengals latest market borrowing came in February, when the state borrowed up a loan of Rs 2,500 crore. With this fresh loan, Bengals total open market borrowing reaches Rs 1,03,546 crore.Statistics from the RBI reveal that the quantum of open market borrowing, which attracts the highest interest rate, has far exceeded the figure during 34 years of Left rule, which between 1977 and 2011 was little over Rs 72,000 crore. In contrast, Mamatas government has borrowed Rs 1,01,046 crore in its first five years, between May 2011 and February 2016. The open secret is that her government has done little to lessen the burden during her first term, with debt repayment amount set to reach Rs 18,359 crore by 2017-2018.Analysts say that Mamata will have to find ways to keep Central funds flowing in from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom she considers her ideological rival, largely owing to her vote bank politics of keeping Muslims in good humour. It is common knowledge that nearly 80% of the states tax revenue was consumed by debt repayments in 2015-16, and even in this fiscal, the situation is no better.Although Trinamool has been able to convince voters about the governments development efforts, Mamata is aware how much the debt burden is bothering the administration and the ruling party.The Opposition parties have often alleged that high market borrowings are essentially used to service sops Mamata has been giving away. She, however, has always argued that borrowings are used to repay debt left behind by the earlier regime.What is waiting to be seen is whether she can generate enough resources to support her politics, along with necessary administrative expenditure, or if she crumbles under the mountain of debt and is forced to change her political path."

Not bad for a 120-year old. So, the monk walked in for the first medical check-up of his life. To put it in perspective, when Swami Sivananda was born, it had only been a year since X-ray was invented, and on Saturday, he didn't bat an eyelid when he was wheeled into an MRI machine.Swami Sivananda walked out with a clean bill of health but for high blood pressure -even then his diastolic was absolutely normal at 80. The secret of baba's health? Mashed green chillies every day . Plus boiled food, daily exercises and the joy of helping.Swami Sivananda's passport and Aadhaar card put his age at 120, but he looks 50 years younger -there's hardly a wrinkle on his cheeks. Doctors and nurses at the private hospi tal were awestruck by the monk's mental and physical agility. They were speechless when he did a sarbangasana at the drop of a hat (or request).Born on August 8, 1896, in Behala, then a village, the swamiji could be the oldest living person. In fact, he is about five years older than Japan's Jiroemon Kimura, who holds the Guinness Record now. Though based in Varanasi, he moves around the country and abroad for spiritual discourses.He seemed quite bemused at his first medical check-up. He has been staying with a devotee in Salt Lake for about a month now. In the last few days, he started complaining of headaches after every discourse with devotees. Prodded by his followers, he agreed to a check-up. All these years, we've nev er heard Swamiji com plain of health problems. When he said he was having headaches, we persuaded him to get a check-up,"" said Dr S C Garai, a disciple.All they found was systolic hypertension (18080). ""Even people in their forties can have such high blood pressure if they lead stressful lives.Swami Sivananda has the heart of a young man,"" said Dr P C Mondal, interventional cardiologist at the hospital.""Clinically, his heart seems to be in good condition.The ECG and echocardiogram reports are awaited. He agreed to take medication for his high blood pressure but asked us if he could postpone it by five days so that he can work on reducing it on his own,"" Mondal said.Born Sivananda Goswami, his parents died on the same day when he was only four years old. His elder sister, who used to beg for food with him, died two years later. Some relatives handed over the child to a guruji who brought the boy to Nadadwip. He moved around before settling down in Varanasi in 1979.What's the secret of his longevity and health? ""I believe in eating simple, living humble and in being compassionate. I feel good when I have tried my best to help those in distress,"" the guru told TOI in perfect English, despite never having got formal education.He had boiled rice, boiled pulses and boiled vegetables with a couple of green chillies from the hospital's canteen for lunch. Chef Suman Bhattacharjee got a pat for the doubled boiled rice as swamiji has lost all his teeth, perhaps the only sign of his age.""As a child who had to sleep on an empty stomach many nights, even boiled food is a fancy . I stuck to boiled food as a habit and not because I was conscious of my health. Fruits and milk are a fancy for the hungry so I avoid them,"" said Swami Sivananda. While many `Godmen' or gurus live in palatial houses, Swami Sivananda lives in a 600 sq ft flat in Varanasi donated by his disciples. Anyone who wants to approach the swamiji with their problems can walk in any time of the day . He sleeps on a mat with a wooden block for a pillow. He performs yoga, pranayama and freehand exercises for two hours daily. The rest of the day he reads, chants and speaks with devotees from any religion.The good days are when he gets to help someone.Every Saturday, he and his devotees distribute food among the poor. He also spends time working with lepers and plans to travel to Puri in December to help lepers and beggars."
58f4faffa3d24b0b70c1bc31,Tearing the curtain of darkness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Tearing-the-curtain-of-darkness/article14518209.ece,2016-07-31,"he story goes, not apocryphal, that every time Mahasweta Devi visited Jharkhand, she would demand that Birsa Munda be unshackled. In Ranchi, on Birsa Munda Chowk, theres a statue of this fiery tribal leader who died in jail during British rule in 1900. The statue shows him wearing a turban and dhoti, his hands in chains. Officials would tell her that the British photographed him in chains and that perhaps became a reference point for all depictions of the tribal hero who died at 25. The chains also symbolised his struggle for freedom, they claimed.An old Ranchi hand recalls her saying:  Shaddhin deshe keno shekole bandha (why is he still in chains when India is free)? as she gathered for a meeting of bonded labourers in the 1980s. Last month, the Jharkhand government decided to free Birsa Munda of his shackles, 116 years after his death, and several years after the writer and activist voiced her demand. She may not be around to see a free Munda, but the downtrodden  tribals, dispossessed, marginalised, landless  and those who are fighting against injustice and are still in chains know that she is there in spirit.Mahasweta Devi had woven a historical fiction around the legend of Birsa Munda in her 1977 novel Aranyer Adhikar (Rights of the Forest), which chronicles the turbulent period of the late 19th century, and particularly the tribal armed uprising against the British led by Birsa Munda to rid the forests and hills of usurpers. She received the Sahitya Akademi award for it in 1979, though Mahasweta Devi, the political and social activist and conscience-keeper, wouldnt bother herself too much with the awards and accolades (Padma Shri, Padma Vibhushan, Jnanpith, Magsaysay) bagged by Mahasweta Devi, the writer.Yet her books sold well. Her stories of the subaltern will live forever as long as theres oppression in the world and the poorest of the poor need a voice. In todays atmosphere of growing intolerance, its imperative to read her work and remind ourselves of her lifelong fight for those who are sought to be silenced.Her compassionate crusade through art and activism to claim for tribal peoples a just and honourable place in India's national life got her the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1997. Accepting it, she had said: My India still lives behind a curtain of darkness. A curtain that separates mainstream society from the poor and the deprived.For justice and honourAs justice and honour still elude a large slice of tribal peoples across Wet Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and the north-eastern States, her narratives on their shackled lives are more relevant than ever.Hajar Churashir Maa (Mother of 1084), one of her most widely read books, was adapted for theatre and film. Even though it was written in the turbulent 1970s at the peak of the Naxalite movement, its message is perhaps even more powerful in the prevailing atmosphere of a million mutinies between state and people.The novel begins with the death of a son and his mother waking up to the terrible fact of him being reduced to a number. Its a chilling portrayal of a social movement that wasnt quite successful, put down by brutal force; and we suffer along with the mother, Sujata Chatterjee, who tries to understand a revolutionary movement that took her son Brati. Her journey is also one of self-discovery and her place in a feudal world.Writing and activism were in Mahasweta Devis genes. Her parents were writers, her uncle Ritwik Ghatak, her husband Bijon Bhattacharya, a radical Left playwright and a member of the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA). At 28, she toured parts of backward Rajasthan alone, to research for a biography on Rani of Jhansi, her first book. From the bonded labourers of Palamu to the denotified tribes of Bengal  Lodhas of Medinipur, Khedia Shobors of Purulia, Dhikaros of Birbhum  Mahasweta Devi spent three decades of her life listening to them to tell us about these lives, outside the margins of society.As Irom Sharmila decides to call off her fast in Manipur, with the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act yet to be repealed, we are drawn to another of Mahasweta Devis famous stories, Draupadi. In a powerful retelling of this Mahabharata character, we have Draupadi, or Dopdi, as a rebel who is cornered by the police in a bid to suppress forces she represents.Draupadi begins with a short exchange between two men in uniform. Whats this, a tribal called Dopdi? The list of names I bought has nothing like it! How can anyone have an unlisted name? The other man responds: Draupadi Mejhen. Born the year her mother threshed rice at Surja Sahus at Bakuli. Surja Sahus wife gave her the name.Since Mahasweta Devi rooted her stories and plots on events she saw or read about, her writing incorporates tribal languages and dialects, folk tales and oral histories. She elevated these stories with her imagination, using various genres and styles. Her prose is brutal and lyrical, her tone ironic, sarcastic.The power of DopdiNo miracle can save Dopdi, and she doesnt want it either. As Dopdi is pursued by her abusers, she stands up to them, laughing hysterically as she tears up her sari, exposing her nakedness in a chilling act of defiance akin to what we saw in Imphal in 2004 when women protested the killing of Thangjam Manorama.In another story, The Breast Giver, the protagonist Jashoda is paid to nurse a brood of children of her master and mistress. This helps her to support her poor disabled family. In yet another story, Pterodactyl, she explores why Adivasis are so misunderstood. For her, the Adivasis were civilised and cultured, and her own class hypocritical.Throughout her life and her writing, Mahasweta Devi tried to ensure that the plight of suffering spectators of a fast developing country didnt go unnoticed. She was drawn to people who led a subhuman existence, people with no access to education or health care or roads or income. Many of them may not be able to read her work yet, but its because of her that their stories are out there.She was not one to shy away from the difficult path. Despite her obvious Left links, during the Singur and Nandigram agitations in West Bengal, Mahasweta Devi, well in her 80s, launched a vehement protest against appropriation of land by the state. Her frail frame at a rally in Kolkata against police firing in Nandigram helped energise the Opposition and Mamata Banerjee to bring about  poribortan  in the State. But then again, when the newly elected Mamata Banerjee government refused permission to the Association for Protection of Domestic Rights to hold a rally in Kolkata against government action against Maoists in Lalgarh, she protested.For Mahasweta Devi, it was imperative to make an attempt to tear the curtain of darkness, see the reality that lies beyond and see our own true faces in the process. With her writing and activism, Mahasweta Devi holds up a mirror to society.But are we looking?Sudipta Datta is a Kolkata-based journalist.Mahasweta Devi, the activist and conscience-keeper, wouldnt bother herself too much with the accolades bagged by Mahasweta Devi, the writer."

Altogether, 1,500 KMC personnel have been picked up from the civic headquarters apart from a section of regular staff at the borough level.The dwindling staff at the one-day mutation counter at KMC headquarters has started refusing fresh applications for mutation of flats. ""We are left with low manpower and cases have piled up. This is why we have been forced to reject fresh applications,"" said a KMC assessment department official.The rapid requisition of civic staff from the assessment department has dented the civic coffers too. ""Revenue collection from property tax and mutation fees has gone down by 25% in the past two months due to withdrawal of staff,"" a civic official said. The situation is, however, worse at the borough level, said an assessment department official. ""We have been forced to postpone issuing mutation certificates at some borough offices. In some boroughs, we lack civic staff who carry files containing mutation documents. We are completely at a loss and can't tell at this point when regular services will resume,"" said a KMC official.The licence wing has also been hit because of staff-shortage. ""Issuing trade licences and renewals have been affected due to shortage of staff, both at the borough level and at the headquarters,"" said a KMC official.The rationing scheme has also hit a section of KMC pensioners as some from the civic finance department have been asked to work for the rationing scheme.This is not the first time the civic guardians had to part with their staff because of this scheme. Early this year, the state had requisitioned 600 staffers from the KMC headquarters for enrolling people in 144 KMC under the BPL scheme. Besides, civic personnel at the borough offices were also asked to join in. The idea was to introduce the BPL scheme in Kolkata before the assembly polls.However, after recording several anomalies in the data, were found with the scheme following which KMC employees have now been asked to do a house-to-house survey. find out the actual beneficiaries under the state BPL scheme. Though the official deadline of this survey was July 26, one of the fieldworkers said it would take more than a month to wrap up the entire process.Mayor Sovan Chatterjee , however said that efforts were being undertaken to ensure that the survey work was done fast, following which normal activities will resume in all civic departments. which the civic personnel were requisitioned."

We have demanded to hike it to `80 per quintal, he said.The millers who convened a meeting here to discuss issues concerning survival of rice milling industry demanded to frame policies properly and implement separate rice Out Turn Ratio (OTR) for each State as per their respective output instead of a uniform OTR of 68 per cent. Eastern India, especially Odisha and West Bengal, never produce rice above 63 per cent of the paddy supplied due to climatic condition. But millers in these two States are asked to provide 68 per cent rice, Saini said.General secretary Santosh Sonthalia said instead of storing entire procured paddy will millers, the State agencies should have their own storage arrangements from where the millers can lift paddy against 100 per cent security from time to time by rotating delivery. The millers warned to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in September if the Government fails to consider their demand. More than 400 millers from different parts of the State and office bearers of State associations from Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry attended."

Source: Subham Dutta At the rally ground in Agartala on Tuesday. Source: Subham DuttaON TUESDAY, when Mamata Banerjee sounded the clarion call for the 2018 Tripura elections, her rally was at once familiar and unfamiliar. While her speech was peppered with references to her governments achievements in West Bengal  what Trinamool Congress has deemed the Bengal model  the rally also marked her return as the firebrand Opposition leader.Mamata declared that for her party, the fact that the rally is being held in Agartala on the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, was not accidental. Usually, I go to Midnapore. But this time, I am here. It is because we are starting a new movement in Tripura today  independence from the communists. There is no space for them in India, she said.The underlying thread throughout her speech was not merely her relentless criticism of the Left Front government in Tripura, but its juxtaposition with her governments achievements in Bengal. While alleging that the Left in Tripura has failed to provide jobs, she invoked the pension schemes in Bengal and claimed her government has given jobs to thousands. Claiming that people of Tripura still needed to travel to Kolkata in order to treat major ailments, Mamata spoke about her government setting up multi-specialty hospitals in Bengal.When CPM was defeated in Bengal, it was found that it had left a huge debt which Trinamool was clearing now, she said. But we are distributing rice at Rs 2 per kg, giving stipends to girls and students, creating livelihood amenities for the poor and have constructed 41 super-speciality hospitals in the last five years. What has the CPM done here? There is no job, no work, no agricultural facilities, no university and no teacher. There is only loot, conspiracy, false assurance and no justice Mamata claimed.She added that while CPM was boasting that it had brought rail to Agartala, in reality, the project had been sanctioned when I was the union minister for Railways in 2010. She also raked up corruption charges against Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar.No party from Delhi will understand Tripura or Bengal. The problems here are different. All they understand is Dilli ka ladoo and Delhis politics The West Bengal government will be with Tripura and aid the state in its development. If we are elected, we will bring about industry, jobs, employment, education and medicine, she said while floating a Bengal model of development, which will be sensitive to the unique needs of Tripura.Introducing Mamata to the audience was dissident Congress leader Sudip Ray Burman, the son of former Tripura CM Samir Ranjan Burman, who prior to 1988 had campaigned alongside the Bengal CM.Mamata began with a reference to her days as a Youth Congress leader, campaigning against the Left regime in Tripura prior to the 1988 Assembly elections that Congress coming to power in the state. I am not a stranger to Tripura. I had campaigned here extensively when Santosh da (Santosh Mohan Dev) had asked me to come here. Today, those who had campaigned with me are sitting on the stage, she said.Earlier, the Congress had extended its friendship to the Left in Delhi that is how the Left formed a government here and I realised that I needed to leave Congress. Now, they have again done the same in Bengal and they have realised that they needed to join me, she added.Watch Video: Whats making newsMamatas rally was planned after Trinamool emerged as the majority Opposition party in Tripura, when six dissident Congress MLAs joined the party in June. This, Mamata, said was the beginning of creating a collective team to oppose the CPM in Tripura. Without such a team, there is no point, she said.She also criticised the BJP  which in the last five years has made inroads into Tripura  claiming that the party was only concerned with spreading hatred and communal strife.What do they do? They cant even pass the GST Bill without our help. During elections, they will suddenly start chanting Hare Rama, Hare Krishna to try and spread communalism. Since we have spoken out against them, about how they are undermining the federal structure, they try and intimidate us with their agencies. But we dont fear them. We have stared into the guns held by the communists in Bengal. The BJP cant stare us down, Mamata said.But in spite of Trinamools exuberance, the path to the 2018 elections would not be easy. While explaining the noticeably empty patches in the rally ground, Mamata alleged that the Left had prevented people from attending the event and cut power in villages to stop them from seeing her.Trinamool insiders, however, said the partys lack of an organisation in Tripura would pose the biggest challenge. There were already four Trinamool Congress factions in Tripura. Now, with Congress leaders joining, there is a fifth one. A lot will depend on Mukul Roy, who has been tasked with fixing the organisational structure in Tripura. If he cant do it, it will effectively help CPM, with Trinamool only cutting into BJPs votes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Suman Tamang Darjeeling, Aug. 12: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today demanded that since the state government had decided to bring the entire population in the Darjeeling hills under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the Mamata Banerjee administration declare the region a backward area and provide other benefits. The Morcha, however, said the state government would not do so and the hidden agenda of covering the entire hills under the AAY was to cut down on the foodgrains it had promised the people of the region before the Assembly elections. Under the AAY being implemented by the Centre through state governments, a financially backward family is entitled to 35kg of foodgrains at Rs 2 per kg a month. The Morcha had assigned members of the partys Study Forum to find out the real motives of the state government in implementing the AAY in the entire hills. D.K. Pradhan, convener of the Study Forum, today said: According to a notification issued by the directorate of district distribution, procurement & supply, food supplies department (memo no: 335(19) FMR/IIS-01/16) dated January 22, 2016, the hill population was included in Hill PDS category. As per the HPDS provisions, 11kg of foodgrains would be distributed per person per month in the entire hills. The provision in the notification reads: The existing population in the hill will now be allotted 6 kg of rice and 5 kg of fortified atta per heard per month @ Rs 2.00 per kg in both cases. According to Pradhan, the 11kg of foodgrains were to be drawn under the Centres National Food Security Act and the special scheme of the state government. The January 22 notification regarding hills reads: The entire population of the hill subdivision will be treated as NFSA plus state special package of for hill (NFSA-Hill) and allocation of 2 kg of rice and 3 kg of atta will be given from NFSA quota. The balance amount of 4 kg of rice and 2 kg of atta will be given as top up over and above the NFSA quota and the expenditure will be borne by the Govt. of West Bengal. Accounts shall be maintained accordingly. After the Assembly elections, Pradhan alleged, the state had decided to implement only the AAY under the National Food Security Act in the entire hills so that it didnt have to bear the additional expenditure of 4kg of rice and 2kg of atta.Under the AAY, a backward family is entitled to 15kg of rice and 20kg of fortified atta at Rs 2 per kg per month. This basically means that a family of four and above will now be getting less amount of foodgrains than what the state government promised. According to the special package announced before the Assembly elections, a hill family of five is entitled to 55kg of foodgrains. The hidden agenda of getting the hill population under the AAY is to ensure that the state government does not have to bear the additional cost of supplying 6kg of foodgrains per person a month, said Pradhan. The Morcha central committee member said it was fine for the Morcha if the state provided 35kg of foodgrains to a family under the AAY and the remaining 6kg per head per month. We also demand that since the hills have been brought under the AAY, which is for the financially backward families, the state declare the hills a backward area and give benefits for the backward region like exemption from income tax, subsides in transport, fuel, gas connections and electricity, said Pradhan."
58f652197be9e031f13b2731,Alpana decision taken at Kala Bhavan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Alpana-decision-taken-at-Kala-Bhavan/articleshow/53703523.cms,2016-08-15,"KOLKATA: It was at Kala Bhavan that the idea of including alpana as part of the fine arts syllabus germinated, through a series of workshops that Rabi Biswas was called in to conduct. Biswas, in fact, has been crusading to revive folk alpana, with foundations like Daricha and Intach playing a key role.To most of us, the word alpana means patterns drawn with rice paste on auspicious occasions. In today's age, when one has very little time to soak and grind rice to make the paste and then take time out to draw the patterns, stickers make for easy use. The result is that one of the most vibrant folk traditions of Bengal is gradually becoming extinct. However, two of the country's premier art schools have taken it upon themselves to make alpana a part of their teaching-learning process, to help start a revival of sorts.The one-year foundation course at Kala Bhavan - compulsory for all students taking up fine arts at the undergraduate level - has been revised to include alpana, both in the Santiniketan gharana that was perfected by Nandalal Bose's daughters Jamuna Devi and Gauri Bhanja, and also the genre inspired by folk traditions. ""All students of painting, sculpture, graphics, design and art history have to first go through the foundation course, get their grades and then be given a chance to choose their specializations,"" said principal Dilip Mitra. "" Alpana now features in the foundation course because we want every student to be aware of both the Santiniketan and the folk traditions. This will save it from extinction.""The most popular among these are the six different kinds of 'Lakshmi brotos', coupled with specific corresponding alpanas. There are brotos in the monsoon for sowing paddy seeds popular in Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia, where the paddy sheaf is the central alpana motif, brotos for the Nabanna festival, for a custom called Punyipukur, where the pond and the lotus are the central motifs, for Dasputul, where the alpana is inspired by the 'Ramayana', the Senjuti broto that characterizes evenings in the month of Agrahayana, with a 52-motif elaborate alpana, the Jampukur broto where the god of death is appeased through rituals and alpanas, and the Hyachra broto to ward off seasonal diseases like chicken pox.Though unrelated to the Visva-Bharati initiative, similar alpana workshops by Biswas were a routine affair at Rabindra Bharati University at its state academy of dance, drama, music and visual art. ""We are toying with the idea of expanding a portion of the painting syllabus to include folk traditions from Bengal, including alpana of the different districts,"" said head of the painting department at RBU, Nikhil Pal."
58f689d67be9e031f13b6dd4,"Decades later, Calapor boasts old-world charm",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Decades-later-Calapor-boasts-old-world-charm/articleshow/53714419.cms,2016-08-16,"On any leisurely afternoon, if one finds themselves wandering through the village of St Cruz, the sight of its green cover, charming mansions and tranquility of the interior roads is bound to transport them to an era bygone.Charming to a fault, the village sits along the luscious green expanse and is lined with houses akin to ginger-bread homes. Tucked in the suburbs of Panaji, this chocolate box hamlet with a population of approximately 20,000 people was one of the early settlements in Tiswadi.Much of Tiswadi is comparatively new, reclaimed from the sea by a continuous process of sedimentation and siltation. With its low-lying tracts crisscrossed by creeks and streams, elevated plateaus and hillocks, St Cruz is as pretty as a postcard.Meaning holy cross in Portuguese, St Cruz was previously called Calapor. The vast expanse of this village stretches from Morombim in the north to the foothills in the south and from its eastern border tipping the villages of Mudra and Cujira. Thereon it goes on to Taleigao that merges into the Arabian Sea in the west.Though well-connected today to neighboring village Merces through the highway, veterans from the village say that residents had to earlier cross the mushy pond and adjacent fields by way of a canoe to get to the other side.The highway connecting with the winding roads of the village offers alternate routes to Merces, Bambolim and Cujira.While St Cruz and Merces were the salt-pan mecca of the state, this traditional practice has declined over the past two decades.Initially Hindu-dominated, there were temples in the village dedicated to various deities like Santeri, Kalbadevi, Maya, Betal, Ramnath, Brahma, Purusha, Panchdevta and Ravalnath. The list reveals definite proof of Kadamba devotion to the mother goddess and the presence of the Nath cult in Goa around 1150 AD.Some sites in the village have names that are pointers indicating what they used to be in ancient Calapor. Bondir- the name of a ward in the village comes from the old wharf along the creek to the east. Another branch of the creek skirts the western flank of the village where laterite stones marking the bund are seen. Even today the inhabitants of the place refer to this area as tarri korem meaning 'near the ferry wharf'.According to local tradition, the area in the vicinity of the chapel of St Anthony is known as Cujir vaddo because it is believed to have been the habitat of a colony of Gujarati tradesmen. This sliver of information is a clear indicator of Goa's trade relations with Gujarat in the past.Like most other villages in Goa, St Cruz is also rife with folklore. Teresa Albuquerque in her book St Cruz Calapor, Profile of a village in Goa, speaks of an interesting relic called don fator (two stones). Stationed close to the highway, one encounters this strange monument of gleaming black stones, about a metre in height, propped next to each other.Legend has it that a generous housewife who was giving tamarind to a needy neighbour was scolded by her mother-in-law for taking things from the house without permission. She is said to have dropped two stones from her hand which turned into don fator.Despite the Muslim invasion in the 14th Century, St Cruz's villagers were bound together by allegiance to their deities and administered the lands in their name. When the Portuguese imperialists arrived, these deities became a target of attack.Temples that even the Muslim rulers had spared ultimately suffered at the hands of the Portuguese. Soon after the destruction of the temples of Ilhas (the new name given to Tiswadi by the Portuguese), Fernao Rodrigues de Castello Branco, the comptroller of finance who was simultaneously acting as governor, convened a meeting of 30 leading gaunkarsof the island.Since their temples were eliminated, they were to surrender the income derived from the produce that had been used towards maintenance of temple personnel. This would now be utilized for the erection of churches on the island and for charitable deeds of the confraternity of the Holy Faith.The Portuguese retained the gaunkari system but called it comunidade. It greatly simplified village administration for the rulers.Thereon the village was fostered and developed by Portuguese influences on architecture and the depth of its history can still be felt today.The village church called Igreja de St Cruz was erected which to this date is a visual spectacle. Though instructions to build the church date back to March 5, 1546, wherein King of Portugal D Joao III instructed the vicar general at Goa, Miguel Vaz, work didn't kick off until 1555.The village is also lined with charming old houses giving passersby the feel of the idyllic Goan-Portuguese village. Even in their interior they conform to the European pattern. They're mostly built in a cubic plot with gardens in front and to the rear, a shaded porch or balcao at the entrance, additional balconies projecting from each room and wide windows.Elaborately furnished in the contemporary western style with heavily carved pieces in the drawing room, huge wall mirrors reflect the array of portraits of the ancestors. One of these gracious mansions is the bleak-looking yet stately edifice built very much in the manner of the high court at Panaji with striking Spanish-styled grilled balconies. Locals refer to it as Correio-Mor. This house is said to have belonged to the celebrated postmaster general of Goa Joaquim Tomas Xavier de Rego.Another mansion worth mention which has become more of an ancestral house for its descendants is the Dempo palace. Around 1846, Srinivasa Sinai Dempo acquired vast landed property at an auction sale. This once belonged to the Augustinian order but was confiscated by the authorities in 1835 after the expulsion of the religious congregations in Goa. This dwelling is outwardly in the Portuguese style of architecture but the living quarters of its older section are said to be traditional.Despite the onslaught of change and modernity, the old mansions of St Cruz have retained their aesthetic appeal.To this date, fractions of population continue to refer to St Cruz by its original name, Calapor. The addition of Cujira to its jurisdiction has not been able to shake the nee off.Even though new premises for Hedgewar School, Mushtifund School and Dempo HSS have been erected at Cujira, locals still swear by the convenience of the St Cruz high school and Efigenia primary school, both of which are located in the heart of the village. A government school and balwadi also serve as education outlets for the financially-challenged migrant population.St Cruz's favourite sport is volleyball and not football. You can see young boys playing volleyball each Sunday morning and the village has produced some of the most famous Goan volleyball playersCharming shops selling patties and other confectionary items continue to be thronged irrespective to the widespread variety of bakeries in the city.The village is now marred by the ugly monstrosity of the construction boom, like most other villages in the state, yet the allure of a quaint dainty hamlet continues to persist.Renowned ResidentsSt Cruz comprises a long list of illustrious citizens who have served not only the state but who've contributed to the country as well. Some of them are:Augustin Fernandes plays as a defender for Salgaocar in the I-League. In July 2015 Fernandes was drafted to play for Atletico de Kolkata in the 2015 Indian Super League (ISL). He is now a defender for ISL's FC Pune City.Anthony Xavier Moraes was the first Goan to achieve the position of chief engineer, roads and buildings, joint secretary to the government in 1929. Walter Anthony Gustave Pinto was a war hero. Often in the theatre of war, between 1943 and 1945 he saw active service in Burma and Thailand. In 1962, he served on the Sikkim Tibet frontier at an altitude of 15,000 ft during the Sino-Indian conflict.Antonio Pedro Fernandes was a diplomat for the Portuguese government. While acting in charge of the consulate from 1919 to 1921, Fernandes most solicitously arranged for 50,000 bags of rice to be dispatched weekly to the famine stricken people of Goa.Printer and publisher Antonio Caetano Fernandes, was the entrepreneurial hero of the village. He ventured into investing in a moving motor printing press and achieved tremendous success. He was the son of famous book binding businessman J D Fernandes.Francisco Paulino Dias was acknowledged as one of the greatest Goan poets in the Portuguese language. Deriving his poetic inspiration from Indian culture and tradition, his work expresses the strong flavour of the soil.Jose Vincente Baldomeiro Fernandes published a number of works in Konkani and was an active member of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal.Christovam Pinto was a member of Partido Indiano. He was thrice appointed as representative of Portuguese India in the Parliament at Lisbon. Because of his extraordinary flair for writing and journalism he was also appointed as the librarian of the prestigious Instituto Vasco Da Gama.Joaquim Luis Araujo was a Goan nationalist who operated from Bombay. He participated in the Quit India movement from there. He also was an active member of the Goan Youth League and in 1947-48 he edited Porzecho Ulhas, a Goan national weekly and participated in the demonstrations against the Portuguese institutions.The earliest medical practitioners were said to be Antonio Jose Pereira (passed out in 1806), Marcos de Araujo (passed out in 1808) and Antonio Annes (passed out in 1813). Prior to the establishment of Escola Medica in 1844, some practical medical expertise was being imparted at Velha Goa back then.Locals speakRoadsTraffic congestion is a serious problem as the village has very narrow roads. Also, migrants indulge in hawking and selling various articles on the busy roads during peak hours. This makes the roads even more congestedKishore Naik, driver, Radha taxi servicesThe 100-year-old man-made lake called Bondvol lake is unattended now. It used to collect water in the monsoon and was released later for irrigation. But now the water continuously flows without any supervision. The wealth of the village has to be reclaimedFr Alexander Pereira, parish priest, St CruzSarpanch's take:Garbage issues are rife in the village with a tonne of garbage being generated from the village on a daily basis. We are trying to acquire land for garbage management and will begin door-to-door collection in September. Traffic congestion owing to narrow roads is a serious issue. We require more funds to have better and broader roads, parking space, gardens and a community hallIndira Fernandes, Sarpanch, St Cruz"

This time, popular cartoon characters like Angry Birds, Doraemon and Chhota Bheem have made their way to rakhi shops as well.Compared to previous years, rakhis with attractive designs have flooded the market. ""We used to get a few rakhis with cartoon characters on them, but this time, there's a visible change,"" said Pratap, who runs Santhosh Stores on Sampige Road, Malleswaram.Vedika P, a school student, who wants to buy rakhis for her seven brothers, is spoilt for choice.""Each of them has dif ferent preferences.Every year, it's a struggle to find the best rakhi for each one of them. If one likes silver rakhi, another wants one with rudraksha beads. The youngest brother, who's 10 years old, wants one with a Chhota Bheem picture. If rakhis are grand, grandeur will be the gifts. I just can't compromise on it,"" said Vedika.Mansoor Khan, who sells puja thalis with raw rice and rakhi, said there's good demand for these plates as they can be used even after the festival. ""We have to give orders for the best rakhis available in the market weeks before we start selling thalis. As 90 per cent of them come from Kolkata, we have to be on our toes to get the eye-catching ones based on demand,"" he added.Online portals, too, are cashing in on the festival fervour. With 5-in1 combos and zari or stone works on them, online shopping has been quite an interesting option for people like Juhi Mathur, a resident of Koramangala. ""I always buy rakhis with rudraksha beads on them but the collection I saw on Amazon blew my mind away . I bought a set of two rakhis for both of them. I've also asked them to place an order for a gift for me on the website itself, I hope at least this time I won't get only a box of chocolates,"" she said.BONDING WITH BHABHISRajasthan's famous concept of tying the Lumba rakhi, specially meant for sister-in-laws, is making waves in the city.Lumba rakhi is a traditional custom of the Marwari community, originally from Rajasthan. Lumba in Marwari means bangle, so the thread which can be tied to it is called the Lumba rakhi.Sanjay S, who has an exclusive rakhi stall in Malleswaram, said: ""Girls generally tie the thread on their brothers' wrists but in the Marwari community a lot of spiritual importance is given to bhabhis (sister-in-laws) on Raksha Bandhan day. Since, they are the better halves of the brothers, they too have the responsibility to protect sisters. We also design couple rakhis for the brother and sister-in-law."""
590474797be9e04154df721b,Trends in progress of sown area of khariff crops shows that it will be difficult to meet targets,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trends-in-progress-of-sown-area-of-khariff-crops-shows-that-it-will-be-difficult-to-meet-targets/,2016-08-18,"The numbers released by ministry of agriculture just before the advance of the southwest monsoons targeted a 7.1% increase in total food grain production in 2016-17. Both khariff and rabi grain output was expected to go up by the same extent to push up total food grain production to 270.1 million tons. This was indeed an ambitious target as it would require that the increase in food grain production be stepped up to the highest level in the last five years.However, the progress of the khariff sowing season has lent hopes that the grain production this year would match the ambitious targets laid out by the government. Numbers released for the period up to the middle of August shows that the sown area in the current khariff season has touched 954 lakh hectares which is 6.5% higher than the sown area in the corresponding period of the same previous year.However, the increase in the sown area has been uneven across the major states. Among the four states with the largest sown area, and which account for close to half the total sown area in the country, only Maharashtra had registered a sizable 15% increment in gross cropped area. One reason for this may be the increase in states rainfall, which went up close to a quarter during the current season.However, the total sown area in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the other major states with the maximum sown area, have remained largely stable. This is surprising because the increase in rainfall in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has been higher than in Maharashtra. Among other states with extensive cultivation Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have also registered a substantial increase in the gross sown area in the current season.But a crop wise investigation of the trends in the progress of the total sown area shows that increase has not been in proportion to the targets set in case of many crops. In fact only in the case of rice and pulses has been the increase in sown area been commensurate with the production targets set. So while the agriculture ministry targets has set that the khariff rice crop be increased by 2.7% and the pulse production be raised by 32.1% the sown area for these crops has increased by 7% and 33.2% so far which indicates that the targets can hopefully be achieved.But in case of other crops the increase in sown area has not been very significant. For instance in the case of coarse cereals and oil seeds the ministry has targeted 16.4% and 36.5% increase in khariff output. However, the trends in the progress of the sown area so far shows that sown area has so far only increased by 6% and 5.1% respectively. To achieve the targeted increase in output the productivity of these crops has to go up substantially in both cases.However, the worst case scenario is seen in the commercial crops like sugar cane and cotton. The targets set out by the ministry would expect sugarcane and cotton output to increase by 2.4% and 17.9% respectively. However, the trends in the sown area indicate that the crop under sugar cane has declined by 8% while that under cotton has fallen by 8.9%. That would make the achievement of the targets difficult if not impossible in the current season.So the overall assessment is that while the good monsoons has improved the prospects of achieving the target set for important crops like rice and pulses it does not seem to have very much improved the prospects of others like coarse cereals, oilseeds, sugar cane and cotton. The country has to roll out more innovative programs to improve productivity of important crops if it is the raise agriculture output to much higher levels."

""Inside the ring, she is all fired up,"" said her trainer Asit Kumar Saha, leaving it unsaid what she might be like outside.Galvanized by Sakshi Malik's bronze at the Rio Olympic Games, the 26-yearold woman wrestler -the most accomplished in the state with two medals under her belt -is now determined to make it big in the global arena.""Sakshi's feat has inspired me to win medals for my country at the international level,"" said Runu, as she watched her two-year-old son run amok on the wrestling mat, sometimes jumping on the other women wrestlers or smothering them with kisses. ""Wrestling runs in his blood,"" she smiled, her kohllined eyes following him.She might be the seniormost woman wrestler in the state, but when it comes to playing with her son, she turns into an adolescent girl, doing cartwheels in the air and breaking into somersaults. But not all is fun and frolic for Runu, who had to work hard to earn her two medals -a silver at the junior National Games and bronze at Federal Games in 2012. Now, to achieve her Olympics dream, she has decided to leave home and live at Panchanan Byayam Samiti at Jorabagan in north Kolkata, the biggest and the best facility in the entire state. ""It is difficult to commute from Howrah. So I stay here so that I do not waste any moment to realise my dream,"" Runu said. Though the only place in Bengal that has a wrestling mat, only 20 women train there. Of them, merely three to four were regulars, said Saha. Among them are Pinky Shashmal, whose father is a tea vendor at Liluah, and Bela Saha, whose father sells scrap.After practice gets over, Runu, along with her fellow wrestlers, returns to her shared accommodation in the club, where she boils rice and makes dal and fish on her stove; fearing indigestion, outside food is not really an option either for her or her son.Before Sakshi became her role model, Runu would idolise boxer Mary Kom from Manipur. ""Both of us are in combat sports,"" she said. Just as it has been for Kom, Runu's never-say-die spirit comes in handy not only in competition but in life, too. Like Kom, who grew amid penury in Manipur, Runu has had a hard life. Not only did she have to fight poverty at her humble home in Howrah's Salap, she also had to struggle against resistance from society. ""It is difficult for a girl, no matter what you try to do,"" Runu said.In a jersey and shorts, Runu looks more like a rookie than the combative wrestling exponent and trainer that she is. But her list of achievements tells a different story , one of her biggest triumphs being tackling stereotypes head-on. Slogging it out in the wrestling ring might take up the lion's share of her day, but she loves visiting the salon, catch movies with her friends, and above all, raise her child. ""The biggest hurdles are in our mind,"" Runu said.It's, however, a hard and long way ahead: the ring demands the highest level of fitness and a diet that Runu, Pinky or Bela can't afford. The trickle of donations is gratefully accepted but isn't enough. But what they don't lack is inspiration. Runu, who hadn't stepped on a wrestling mat till 2010, is convinced if Sakshi could, she can too."

The latest Kharif crop situation shows that rice sown area has been less than 2015 which happened to be a year of drought that gripped over 25 districts of Odisha. The crop-weather watch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation revealed that rice has been sown over 22.89 lakh hectare (ha) area by August 12 which is about 1.78 lakh ha less than the corresponding period of last year.The total rice sown area so far has been about 60 per cent of the overall coverage area. As against 38.39 lakh ha, kharif rice has been sown over 22.98 lakh ha this year. Last year, the rice sown area was about 24.76 lakh ha. Crop coverage of pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta as well as total coarse cereals has been more or less on par with last year's sown area. This time, the total sown area for all crops so far stands at 33.41 lakh ha as against 34.94 lakh ha during the corresponding period last year. Compared with the normal sown area for the year, which stands at 35.88 lakh ha, the shortfall has been 2.47 lakh ha. The crop report of the Agriculture Department, however, gives a different picture. It shows that total area under paddy coverage stands at 28.24 lakh ha, higher than last year's figure of 28.14 lakh ha.In fact, the overall crop coverage stands at 45.73 lakh ha compared to 45.28 lakh ha in 2015. While the crop coverage remains a reason for worry in the backdrop of the spate of farmer suicides, the rainfall scenario has been less than encouraging. As on Sunday, Odisha received 696 mm rain against the normal rainfall of 810 mm, registering a 14 per cent deficit. Between June and August 17, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) statistics showed that nine districts have registered deficit rainfall. However, the ground reality is far more worse as the last week has been pretty much dry for most of the districts. In the week ending August 12, 18 districts reported huge deficit rainfall which has affected farming activities.Nuapada recorded 75 per cent deficit while Balangir reported 71 per cent shortfall. Bargarh, Deogarh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Khurda, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Nayagarh, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur, Sundargarh and Puri also registered deficit rainfall during the week. Although the last week saw two weather systems forming off the Balasore coast, it rained mostly in the northern districts and West Bengal.A third system which formed north east of Myanmar on Saturday went close to Bangladesh and was heading into WB-Bihar region. It may not cause any rainfall. The weather office said another circulation is likely to form around August 25-26 and turn into a low pressure off south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast."

Beside her sat cousins 'sitabhog' and 'mihidana' and rice variants 'tulaipanji' and 'gobindobhog'. They awaited scrutiny for a prized tag that will catapult them as ""novelties"" in the eyes of the world. When they win the tag  the coveted GI  they will get a unique logo, with all producers adhering strictly to a certified process of production.The team of experts from the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry office, Chennai, spent the maximum time over rasogolla, which has recently soured ties between neighbours Bengal and Odisha. Bengal, however, has refused to get into a fight by registering its claim under Banglar rasogolla as opposed to Odisha's 'Pahala rasogolla' or 'kheermohan'.At the end of Monday's examination, sitabhog and mihidana inched closer towards bagging the GI tag, but more technical details were sought on Banglar rasogolla even though the team was more than satisfied with the documentation of its history.The team, led by GI examiner Prashant Kumar and assistant registrar of trademarks Chinnaraja Naidu, expressed their satisfaction over the documentation and technical details of the production of sitabhog and mihidana. ""They will now put these out on public domain on their website for people to comment. After a reasonable period of time, which is a couple of months at the most, if no objection comes, the two sweets will be given the GI tag,"" said Reena Venkataraman, secretary of the state science and technology department.Though the team expressed satisfaction over the documentation done for Banglar rasogolla, the state will still have to submit details on the range of viscosity of the sugar syrup in which the roundels are kept, the range of its texture and sponginess, said officials of the patent office of the science and technology department.Members of the Mistanna Byabasayee Samity were invited to attend the examination process of the sweets and give their views if asked. Among those who attended were Dhiman Das, of the K C Das family, which has been included for the contribution of Nabin Chandra Das towards the invention of rasogolla. Food historian Haripada Bhowmick was also present. ""The experts appreciated how we traced the rasogolla right from Sri Chaitanya's times when it was called chana bora to golak, then golla and finally rosogolla in 1865,"" Bhowmick said.In an effort to prove that Bengal's rasogolla is different from Odisha's pahala rasogolla or kheermohan, the latter two specimens were also reportedly presented to the experts, though they refused to include this variety as part of Monday's investigation. ""The team has done a thorough examination of 'Banglar rasogolla' and will send us an examination report with details of where we need to pad up the information that we have provided. Once we do that, this product will also be put up in the public domain. If no objections come, 'Banglar rasogolla' will also get the GI tag,"" Venkataraman said.The team was satisfied with the tulaipanji and gobindobhog varieties of rice, and these will also be put up in the public domain. The Parliament had recently accepted these varieties as Bengal's original produces, and it will be easy for them to bag the tag."

As the time for the Friday Mass draws near, more visitors start scribbling hurriedly on the slips of blank paper kept near the box and dropping them inside. Those coming to Mother House write their intentions (or wishes) on paper and put them inside this box for Mothers blessings. During the special mass on Fridays, the day Mother passed away, we ask the priest to bless all the intentions and pray for them, explains one of the nuns.The founder of the Missionaries of Charity will be canonised at the Vatican on September 4. But the nun who stepped out of Loreto in 1948, and made it her lifes mission to work for the poorest of the poor around the world has for years been revered as a saint by the people whose lives she touched. Sister Bernadette, 78, of Loreto Calcutta remembers a chance meeting with Mother Teresa at the Kolkata airport years ago. People at the airport kept coming to her and asking for her blessing. She had a paper and she would write God bless you and sign her name on it. She said, you see this, I am putting them in Gods hands, remembers the nun.The Simple Joys of LifeThose who knew her well, lived and worked with her, remember the person behind the public face. She had a great sense of humour. She would always be joking and when she found something funny, she would place both hands on her hips and bend double with laughter, remembers former chief election commissioner of India and Mother Teresas biographer Navin B Chawla.A nun of the Loreto order, 82-year-old Sister Eithne, recalls that same spirit in one of her meetings with Mother Teresa. I remember meeting her here in this house (Loreto House, Kolkata). She came to meet the community, her old friends. What I remember about that meeting is that there was great laughter and fun, she says.At Kolkatas Missionaries of Charity, nuns pray with Mother Teresas statue behind them. (Samir Jana/Hindustan Times)While her avowed mission remained to care for the destitute, everyone around her felt enriched by her love. She always had time for everybody, says Father Dominic Gomes, vicar-general of the archdiocese of Calcutta. After I was ordained, I was asked by the Church to go for my higher studies to Rome. I needed a passport. I made so many rounds of different offices and nothing was working out, he remembers. One day I was at Mother House and Mother noticed that I looked very sad, and she asked me what was the matter. I told her I had been trying to get my passport made for the past three months without any success. She immediately said give all your documents to me. To my surprise, the next day I had my passport.Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity remember how their superior cared for them the same way that a mother would. Sister Tarcisia, who joined St Teresas primary school in Kolkata as a six-year-old when Mother Teresa was the in-charge, talks of her motherly affection. She knew that my health was not strong, so whenever there was some heavy work to be done, moving a table for instance, she would push me out of the way. This from a woman who her biographer recalls as being habitually unmindful of her own health.  She often chose to ignore the advice of Dr Bardhan, her long-standing cardiologist in Calcutta, remembers Chawla. Mother Teresa needed a pacemaker at some point of her life and she was forbidden by the doctor to even go down the stairs. One day I was with her and there was a telephone call. And she said I am going to Bangladesh. Theres a cyclone there, I have got to go. I reminded her of her doctors orders and she said I will tell him later, says Chawla.On Mother Teresas 98th birth anniversary at Kolkatas Missionaries of Charity. (Subhankar Chakraborty/Hindustan Times)There are as many anecdotes about Mother Teresa, as the number of people who came into contact with her. Father Felix Raj, principal of the St Xaviers College in Kolkata remembers her great love for students. Photographer Raghu Rai talks about how she could be tough when needed, but would change if she found reason in what was being said. Recalling his first meeting with her, sometime in the 1970s, he says, Even at that time, the Missionaries of Charity were quite strict about giving access to photographers and journalists. When Rai happened to see three nuns in prayer through the movement of a half curtain behind Mother Teresa, he started taking their photos. On being questioned by Mother Teresa as to what he was doing, Rai answered, Mother, there are these sisters praying and they look like angels. How you melted, Mother, and accepted that moment, he recalls.Chawla talks of her immense will and how she would go to any length for her work. In one of his initial meetings with Mother, when he was secretary to the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi, he remembers that she had come to ask for land to build a facility for the leprosy-affected in the city. I asked her how much land she needed and she looked at me and said five acres. Then we went to see the LG and she told him in detail about the plight of these people and the LG was so moved he was nearly in tears. He also asked her how much land she required and she looked at me with an impish smile and said ten acres! Because she had won him over she got 11 acres. And I saw this in country after country, situation after situation. If Mother Teresa could cajole anything out of anyone for her poor, she had no hesitation in doing so, he says.Read more: Tracing Mothers Journey in Kolkata from Loreto to Missionaries of CharityThe Nay SayersThis very attitude of her, however, in indiscriminately accepting help for her mission has been used by her critics against her, the most vocal of whom had been British journalist Christopher Hitchens. In a documentary titled Hells Angel - Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Hitchens questioned Mother Teresas meetings and closeness with certain political heads of states and business tycoons of questionable repute and in some cases her acceptance of funds or trophies from them. Notable among these were Haitian president Jean-Claude Duvalier and American activist and businessman Charles Keating. Hitchens allegations are echoed by Indian rationalist Sanal Edamaruku, who wrote in an article, Mother Teresa did not serve the poor in Calcutta, she served the rich in the West. She helped them to overcome their bad conscience by taking billions of dollars from them, and felt that Mother had given a bad name to Calcutta by portraying it as a city of hopelessness and death. Chawla admits that in all likelihood, she did meet Michelle Duvalier, Jean-Claude Duvaliers wife. It was true of Mother Teresa that whoever could do her work, she would go there and try and get work done for her poor. I did ask her once how is it that you take money from these dubious people. And she said how is it different from the thousands who come to feed the poor in all my homes. I dont look into their antecedents. Whoever they may be they have a right to give in charity and I have no right to judge them. God will judge them, he says.Queen Elizabeth II standing in left side profile as she presents Mother Teresa of Calcutta with the insignia of the Order of Merit November 24, 1983 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. (Virendra Prabhakar/Hindustan Times)That Cult FollowingHitchens traced the root of Mothers global popularity and adulation to journalist Malcolm Muggeridges devotional representation of her in the book Something Beautiful for God. But he and those he interviewed in Hells Angel accused Mother Teresa of admiring the strength of the powerful almost as highly as she recommends resignation of the poor. He gave the example of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, an industrial disaster in India, when Mother Teresas advice to the victims had been to forgive the multinational company responsible for it. Writer and journalist Mihir Bose whom Hitchens interviewed in the film felt Mother Teresa  accepted implicitly that theres nothing you can do for the poor except take them off the streets and look after them. You cannot change their attitude, you cannot make them feel that they have an ability or the means to improve and change their lives. Father Felix Raj answers the accusation. People have criticised Mother and said instead of giving a fish why dont you teach these people how to fish. She answered, okay fine I am capable of giving a fish but why dont you start teaching others how to fish. Then both of us participate in the mission, he says.Watch | Kolkatas saint: Mother of the PoorForeign physicians who visited the Missionaries of Charity homes in Calcutta have written of poor medical care given to the people there, including a lack of distinction between curable and incurable diseases, no use of pain relief medication and lack of proper sterilisation of medical tools, including needles. It is an allegation also voiced by writer and former volunteer at Missionaries of Charity, Mary Loudon, in Hells Angel. But Mother Teresas supporters explain it as their lack of understanding of her mission. I think they are giving the best possible treatment wherever it is. It is true that when the sisters feel no medical care will help... what is the need of shifting him to the hospital when he may die on the way. At that moment you try to help the person, not shift him to a medical facility, says Father Felix Raj.Less easy to justify is her religious non-acceptance of abortion and birth control measures and here even Chawla admits that he disagreed with her views. So deeply religious herself, did she ever try to convert anyone to her faith, another criticism levelled against her? She has not converted even one in terms of religion. But she has converted all, including me, her conversion is the conversion of the heart, says Father Felix Raj. Chawla explains that Mother never felt the need to convert the destitute because for her every suffering person she picked up from the street was her God.Sishu Bhavan, a place for children near the Mother House at the Missionaries of Charitys office in Kolkata. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)For herself and her sisters though, prayer and devotion to Jesus was sacrosanct. Stepping out of the comfort of Loreto House into the Calcutta of 1948, a city torn by post-partition strife and recovering from the famine of 1943, needed some courage. In the beginning there was no money, even for food. And she had to feed the 12 women who joined her order. She would beg for rice and sprinkle some salt on it. And then she would pray and someone would send vegetables. In the early days she strengthened her capacity to pray, says Chawla.Mother Teresa photographed by Raghu RaiRai remembers her words to the authorities during the refugee crisis when people started arriving to Calcutta across the borders from Bangladesh. My sisters will put up with everything; they will spend all their time, and do their duty, but they will have to come back every evening for their prayers to rejuvenate their spiritual energies, Mother had said to the officer in charge of relief operations.Talking of the first time that he met Mother way back in 1975, Chawla, talks of her trademark white sari with the blue border, which she chose over a nuns habit in 1948. She was bent over, even then, and when she turned, I noticed that her sari, which was clean and shining, was darned in several places, he says. For Mother Teresa, that sari was more than a garment. It was a promise from Jesus that your sari will become holy because it will be my symbol.For the world though, that sari came to symbolise and contain in its folds a love and compassion that was almost beyond human. In later years artists such as MF Husain would use it to symbolise her. His paintings of her were without facial features. Perhaps the artist in him saw in her the embodiment of that universal motherhood, that those close to her felt in her embrace.August 26, 1910: Born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, in Skopje, Macedonia in a devout Catholic family.

58ff1e617be9e0420db2cecf,Tea crisis raises 'nationalise' cry,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160831/jsp/northeast/story_105380.jsp,2016-08-31,"Jorhat, Aug. 30: The tea industry in Assam is facing one of its worst crises this fiscal with prices of made tea declining, exports and production falling and cost of production increasing. Prabhat Bezboruah, vice-chairman of Tea Research Association, said the industry ""is passing through yet another crisis due to a decline in both price and crop in the current year. This is coupled with increase in labour costs and practically all other input prices"". He said in the absence of restructuring, the tea industry was becoming unsustainable and the best option was to nationalise the set-up. Painting a grim scenario, Bezboruah said climate change had distorted the rainfall pattern in Assam with the entire year's quota being deposited in the first seven months while August onwards it becomes unseasonably dry. ""Temperature of 39 degrees Celsius, at which level the tea bush shuts down, is common nowadays. If the weather continues in this line, tea yields will show a dramatic decline,"" he added. He further said major blenders and packers were resorting to blend rationalisation, which means buying cheaper teas for the blend to bring its average cost down. ""Hence we see a scenario where low-priced teas, such as those from south India and Cachar, are up in price by Rs 10 to Rs 22 per kg whereas high quality Assam teas are down by Rs 30 to Rs 50. This trend does not augur well for the industry, as it sends a signal that quality does not pay,"" he said. Amitabh Barooah, who runs Kolakota tea estate near Sonari in Sivasagar district and is a member of the Assam Tea Planters' Association, said with the increase in wages of labourers, staff and sub-staff, there is simultaneous increase in bonus and leave wage, which increases cost of production. Besides, he said, tea estates now have to give ration, which was earlier subsidised by the government, increasing cost of production. ""Earlier, we used to pay about Rs 8 for a kg of rice and Rs 10-12 for a kg of flour but now we pay about Rs 20 and Rs 23 respectively when buying from the open market. This has increased costs tremendously."" Labourers buy this rice and flour for 50 paise each. In West Bengal, Bezboruah said, the government supplies foodgrain to each garden at Rs 3 per kilo and designates the manager to distribute the agreed quantum to workers. ""When the industry visited former chief minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi to cite this glaring inequality between Assam and Bengal, he dismissed it,"" Bezboruah said. The TRA vice-chairman said it was proving difficult to get sufficient workers at the current wage level. ""Unless wages increase is linked with productivity, the industry can hardly bear any further load, as each rupee increase in wages results in a 60 paise increase in cost of production in a typical garden. At the current productivity level of 2.2kg per manday, the industry is clearly unsustainable unless drastic restructuring is done,"" he added. North Eastern Tea Association adviser Bidyanand Barkakoty, affirming that the industry was in dire straits this year, said most buyers and packagers of tea had not maintained a stock this year and there was a possibility of prices rising in September as the overall shortfall in production in August could be 20-25 per cent. A supplier of green leaf said its prices had come down to Rs 17-18 compared to last year when it was Rs 19-20. ""In the absence of coordinated steps to revamp the industry from within, by the labour unions and the government, perhaps the best solution would be for the government to nationalise the entire industry. This will solve the problems that the industry constantly faces in Assam,"" Bezboruah said."

Unlike those produced in China or even in neighbouring West Bengal, rice from the State is found to possess no toxicity.Studies conducted at US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington by Dr SB Qadri and Dr BB Rath in collaboration with Dr BK Roul of the Institute of Materials Science (IMS), Bhubaneswar, have found the evidence in rice husks which are an efficient concentrator of soil minerals.Samples collected from rice fields of Maluda island near Chilika lake and Dhusuri in Bhadrak district were put to study over the last three years for rice husk chemistry. Roul said the study showed varying amounts of minority elements concentrated by the plant in the husk. The Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) technique used to identify elemental composition showed high and medium concentration of manganese and high concentrations of iron from rice husks of these two areas.These elemental concentrations are uniquely present in the husk but not in rice grain and are directly correlated with the soil chemistry, he said.The study found that there is a clear indication of effectiveness of the rice plant to concentrate the mineral content of soil in the husk which can be easily determined using the EDXRF analysis as an indicator of mineral deposits in different locations.Moreover, arsenic is known as a carcinogen readily collected in the rice plant from soil and water. Earlier studies have also suggested that brown rice and white rice contain arsenic of various concentrations from different parts of the world. However, samples of rice husks and kernels obtained from Odisha showed no arsenic content, Roul said, adding rice of Odisha should have been sold at higher price in the global market due to its non-toxicity.The study which establishes food value of rice without presence of toxic elements could be of tremendous help in identifying many varieties of mineral deposits in the soil by simply examining the husks collected from various rice fields of Odisha. Similarly, it would also provide instant information on the soil chemistry and soil mineral of the region.The study by the three scientists points at the fact that nature, during billion years of evolution, protects its grains. The plant produces a coating to prevent damage of grains from pests and the environment, and these protective shells are known as rice hulls or rice husks.Advanced processing of the husk can even produce high value industrial materials such as silicon carbide and silicon oxide and silicon nitride and silicates of zinc, zirconium and cadmium."

We've had enough of those, really . Newage eateries are using a host of exciting ingredients from across the world and far-flung corners of our country  from Bulgur wheat to kokum, unagi to chorizo and more -to rustle up lip-smacking delicacies that will leave you surprised, excited and craving for more! Check these out...SRIRACHA, FROM ASIABUFFALO WINGSBODEGA CANTINA Y BARSriracha, a spicy sauce, is definitely one of the biggest food trends in India this year. Sriracha is highly flavoured, and is used extensively in Thai cuisine. For Bodega Cantina's Buffalo wings, they home-make the Sriracha. ""Our Sriracha is inspired by the original and made with different kinds of chilii and vinegars and then fermented for a long time,"" says owner Urvika Kanoi.LAVASH, FROM WEST ASIALAVASH CRACKERSCRAVE FOODWORKSLavash is a kind of flatbread that is widely consumed through the entire region. Though it is commonly believed to be Armenian in origin, food experts also claim that it has Iranian roots.The lavash crackers at Crave Foodworks are a relatively newer take on the soft flatbread, that's crispy and spicy, and can be had with or without dips or sauces. In this restaurant, it is served with classic hummus or labneh.GUNKAN AND NORI, FROM JAPANIKURA GUNKAN MAKIFUJIGunkan maki is a more complex kind of sushi, commonly known as battleship or warship sushi. Ikura, which is salmon roe or the fully ripe egg mass of the fish -just like caviar -is one of the more uncommon soft toppings used to make this sushi. Another uncommon ingredient used is the nori -a Japanese edible seaweed which comes in sheets. If you are all for gastronomic adventures, this one should be on top of your must-check-out list.KOKUM, FROM THE WESTERN GHATSKOKUM RITASPICE KRAFTIf you are a fan of the ubiquitous margarita, but also have a taste for the indigenous, Chef and owner Sambit Banick will recommend to you the Kokum Rita.""To the classic cocktail, we had a very interesting twist -that of the kokum fruit. I get my kokum saar, which is the extract of the Indian fruit from Khamkaar in Mumbai, a very old and well-known shop that stocks all kinds of pickles and spices. It is authentic and we use to it serve our indigenous take on the Margarita,"" says chef Sambit.BULGUR WHEAT, FROM WEST ASIATABBOULEHCALCUTTA STORIESBulgur wheat originated in Bulgaria and is a broken wheat rich in fibre. Bulgur is a common ingredient in Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Syrian, Israeli, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. For Tabbouleh, which is essentially a salad, the wheat is steamed and tossed with three-coloured bell peppers, cucumbers and black and green olives. Now that's what you call a bowl of freshness.CHIA SEEDS, FROM MESOAMERICASUGARFREE FIG AND DATE KULFICAFE PRANAHChia seeds come from a flowering plant of the mint family, which is native to Mexico and Guatemala. Rich in B vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and loads of other healthy stuff, these seeds are traditionally used in drinks and sherbets. At Cafe Pranah, they use it in the sugarfree fig and date kulfi. ""It is a body coolant and adds a beautiful textural contrast to the richness of the kulfi,"" informs Rahul Arora, chef and owner of the cafe.QUINOA, FROM LATIN AMERICAQUINOA SALADHAKUNA MATATAGradually, but steadily, Kolkata is waking up to the quinoa phenomenon. A gluten free, organically grown seed, it is used in food in the capacity of a grain. The history of this seed goes back to the Inca empire, when it was known as the mother of all food, given its nutrient-rich status. At Hakuna Matata, the quinoa salad also has rocket leaves, grilled veggies, tomato, cucumber and pomegranate yoghurt dressing.PS: Nasa scientists are reportedly looking at quinoa as a plant to be grown in space.DUXELLE FROM FRANCE & MIRIN FROM JAPANSTIR FRIED SCALLIONS WITH MUSHROOM DUXELLE, SPICY MIRIN REDUCTIONSPICE KRAFTAt Spice Kraft, chef and owner Sambit Banick makes it a point to mix and marry cuisines. For their stir-fried scallions and mushroom duxelle, with spicy mirin reduction, the marriage is between classic French duxelles and a spicy Asian sauce. For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.WILD RED RICE, FROM NORTHEAST INDIAWILD RED RICESANTA'S FANTASEAA tribal dish, the wild red rice is big in the northeast food scene. It's unpolished, unlike the white rice we commonly use. ""The unpolished dhenki-chhaat chaal is full of nutrients. It might not look very shiny, but it is much better for our health,"" says Kaushik Ghosh, owner of Santa's Fantasea. In this restaurant, it is served with a gravy that is made from traditional northeastern herbs and the superhot bhut jolokia, or raja mirchi, as it is known in Nagaland.CHORIZO, FROM SPAINCHICKPEA CHORIZOBODEGA CANTINA Y BARA Spanish pork sausage, chorizo is increasingly becoming one of the staples at new-age restaurants in Kolkata. It is spicy, made from coarsely ground pork and seasoned with chili and paprika. It is widely used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. ""Chorizos are centuries old, but it is relatively new on India's palette. We buy it from a Spanish couple in Bangalore, who make the chorizos themselves, to preserve the authentici ty. The spicy pork goes wonderfully with the flavours of chickpea, and present it as tapas,"" shares Urvika Kanoi, head chef and owner of Bodega Cantina Y Bar.CHIMICHURRI, FROM ARGENTINACHIMICHURRI PRAWNSSMOKE HOUSE DELIThis is an Argentinian sauce, which is used as a dip with fried fish or grills. In Smoke House Deli, they make it from scratch, which is their take on the original chimichurri, and use it as a marinade for prawns.""The prawns are marinated in this sauce for 30 minutes, before being grilled and baked,"" said head chef Fatik Mir. Apart from infusing the prawns with a burst of flavours, the vibrant green chimichurri contrasts with the slight pinkish shade of the prawns.UNAGI, FROM JAPANUNAGI NIGIRIFUJISorry to burst your bubble, but Unagi is not the total state of concentration that Ross of FRIENDS claimed to have mastered. It is actually a freshwater eel that is a very common component of Japanese seafood. If that makes you squeamish, remember that Fuji uses this fish with wasabi, gari, rice and sushi vinegar to make a nigiri, which is also another form of sushi. Not take a look at the plate, doesn't this look like art on a plate?RIBOTIDE, FOOD ADDITIVENACHOS WITH CHEESE SAUCECREAM CENTREThe controversy surrounding MSG, a flavour enhancer widely used in southeast Asian cuisine, came as a huge blow to Chinese restaurants and food manufacturers. But then, as they say, when one door closes, another opens up. So now there are powder flavor enhancers in the market, known as Ribotides. These can be used in a way similar to MSG and are considered safe. It is a Japanese derivative and is used in the cheese sauce of Cream Centre, which is served with their nachos. Though the nachos cheese and mozzarella cheese here are both customized with secret ingredients, at least we know that they use a highly expensive flavour enhancer, which accounts for their huge fan following!COUSCOUS, FROM NORTH AFRICAVEGETABLE TAGINE WITH COUSCOUSTHE FACTORY OUTLETCouscous has been a part of Kolkata's menu for quite some time now. However, with the trend moving from traditional grains such as wheat and rice to uncommon ones such as quinoa and buckwheat, couscous is also getting its share of limelight. A traditional North African dish, it is made of moulds of semolina and flour. A dish in itself, more and more restaurants are deconstructing it to suit Indian palettes. It can be served with broth, veggies or meat. Sometimes it's had just by itself -a bowl of comfort food. For the veg tagine with couscous at The Factory outlet, they serve the steamed dish with preserved veggies."
58f6d59fa3d24b0b70c2f7a7,Dark clouds over the PDS,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Dark-clouds-over-the-PDS/article14631425.ece,2016-09-10,"Indias Public Distribution System (PDS) has improved steadily during the last 10 years. The system used to be most ineffective and corruption-ridden, with leakages of around 50 per cent at the national level, going up to 80 or 90 per cent in some States. Around 2007, Chhattisgarh took the lead in reforming the PDS  making it more inclusive, methodical and transparent. Within a few years, the system was overhauled. Today, most rural households in Chhattisgarh have a ration card, and are able to secure their entitlements (typically 7 kg of rice per person per month) on time every month.The Chhattisgarh modelLater on, it turned out that the Chhattisgarh model (so to speak) was replicable. Odisha was among the first States to emulate Chhattisgarhs experience, with similar results. Many other States also initiated Chhattisgarh-style PDS reforms: broad coverage, clear entitlements, de-privatisation of PDS shops, separation of transport agencies from distribution agencies, computerisation, fixed distribution schedules, tight monitoring, active grievance redressal, and more.In the last few years, I have been involved in several surveys of the PDS initiated by independent researchers with student volunteers. In 2011, we studied the PDS in nine States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. We found that the system was working reasonably well for below poverty line (BPL) households: on average, they were receiving 84 per cent of their foodgrain entitlements from the PDS. A similar picture emerged from a follow-up survey in 2013. However, high leakages continued in the above poverty line (APL) quota, which tended to be used by the Central government at that time as a dumping ground for excess food stocks.The National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted three years ago, was  and still is  a chance to complete the process of PDS reform and ensure a modicum of food security for everyone. Under the NFSA, the APL category is abolished and eligible households come under two well-defined categories: priority households, entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at nominal prices, and Antyodaya households (the poorest), entitled to 35 kg per household per month. The PDS is to cover at least 75 per cent of rural households at the national level, rising to 80-90 per cent in the poorest States.Impending setbackIn June this year, we went back to six of Indias poorest States (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal) for an update. We found that four out of six had a fairly good PDS, with most NFSA cardholders receiving the bulk of their entitlements every month and relatively low exclusion errors. The last two, Jharkhand and especially Bihar, still have a long way to go. Even there, however, the situation is much better than it was a few years ago. In Jharkhand, for instance, the transparency of the system has vastly improved, and the official NFSA website is among the best in the country. However, recent progress is in danger of being undone soon due to the Central governments counter-productive push for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. This involves installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at PDS shops, and verifying the identity of cardholders by matching their fingerprints against the Aadhaar database over the Internet.This system requires multiple fragile technologies to work at the same time: the PoS machine, the biometrics, the Internet connection, remote servers, and often other elements such as the local mobile network. Further, it requires at least some household members to have an Aadhaar number, correctly seeded in the PDS database.This is a wholly inappropriate technology for rural India, especially in the poorest States. Even in State capitals, network failures and other glitches routinely disable this sort of technology. In villages with poor connectivity, it is a recipe for chaos. Note that Internet dependence is inherent to Aadhaar since there is no question of downloading the biometrics.Recent developments in Rajasthan illustrate the dangers of forcing biometric authentication on the PDS. During the last few months, the Government of Rajasthan has tried hard to enforce the system. The use of PoS machines is compulsory and every PDS shop has one. Yet, according to official data compiled by Nikhil Dey, only 61 per cent of Rajasthans foodgrain allocation found its way through the PoS system in July 2016, with a similar figure (63 per cent) for August. The rest is either siphoned off or delivered using the old register system  which of the two is hard to say since utter confusion prevails about the permissibility of using registers as a fallback option.Further evidence comes from Ranchi district in Jharkhand where the PoS system is also mandatory. In July 2016, NFSA cardholders in Ranchi district received less than half of their foodgrain entitlements through that system, according to the model website mentioned earlier. The situation was much the same in August.As in Rajasthan, it is not clear whether those for whom the PoS system does not work in Ranchi are getting any grain through the old register system. Officially, that is not allowed, according to local PDS dealers and officials (indeed, some dealers have been suspended for using this fallback option). Even if it happens unofficially, this dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the PoS system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst. The reason is that only PDS dealers know whether and when the register system is permissible, and they have no incentive to share that information with the cardholders. Quite likely, the new system is reviving PDS corruption in Jharkhand, reversing a healthy trend towards lower leakages in recent years.A short visit to a PDS shop just outside Ranchi quickly brings out the multiple vulnerabilities of the new system. Within minutes we met many people who had been deprived of their food rations for months because they had no Aadhaar number; or because their Aadhaar number had not been correctly seeded; or because their biometrics did not work, or simply because the PoS machine returned various error messages.Even those for whom the system works face huge inconvenience. Often they have to make repeated trips to the PDS shop, or send different members in turn, until the machine cooperates. Sometimes schoolchildren are asked to skip classes and try their luck at the PDS shop. This unreliable system causes a colossal waste of time for everyone.By the way, all this is one year after I was told by the Food Departments upbeat consultants that the PoS system is functional throughout Ranchi district.The Aadhaar juggernautIn spite of ample warnings, the Central government continues to push for compulsory Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. Incidentally, this is a violation of Supreme Court orders. The court did allow the use of Aadhaar in the PDS, but not making it compulsory for PDS users. Nor can the government invoke the Aadhaar Act to justify this move: the relevant sections of the Act are yet to be notified.PoS machines seem to be expected to ensure a corruption-free PDS. This expectation, however, builds on a misunderstanding of PDS leakages. The main vulnerability today, at least in the States I am familiar with, is not identity fraud (e.g. bogus cards), but quantity fraud: PDS dealers often give people less than what they are entitled to, and pocket the rest. PoS machines are ineffective in preventing quantity fraud. They may help in reducing identity fraud, such as it is, but that does not justify depriving people of their food entitlements when the technology fails.As with many other applications of Aadhaar, this one is proceeding like a juggernaut, without paying serious attention to the collateral damage. Instead, the Central government peddles bogus figures of Aadhaar-enabled financial savings (often relayed by unsuspecting columnists or economists) to justify further imposition of the technology. It is only when concerned journalists, activists or researchers make enquiries from the victims that we learn about the adverse effects of Aadhaar on the PDS.The Central government and its advisers pride themselves on their commitment to evidence-based policy, but this is a case where evidence is being systematically ignored to press on with technological solutions based on blind faith (handsomely nurtured by commercial interests). The drive to impose biometric authentication on the PDS must stop immediately to avoid further damage. There are better ways of plugging last-mile leakages, including the use of simpler technologies not dependent on the Internet.

The family rushed to Alipore Correctional Home on Friday evening to give him the news. But his homecoming is incidental to his kin and supporters. They are more curious about his political future.""He was calm, as always, and asked me not to rush. He put his hands on my hands and asked me to go home and take care of our grandson,"" said Archana while entering her home at Dhirendra Nath Ghosh Road in Bhowanipore's Sakharipara. ""This is the happiest day in the last few years of my life,"" she added.Alongside Archana was her daughter-in-law, Swati, who had campaigned for Mitra in the assembly election.""Months after I came to this house following my marriage, baba (referring to her father-in-law Mitra) was sent to jail. This is the worst situation any newly-married girl can face. I am happy that after almost two years, my baba will be back home,"" said Swati.She said the entire family had spent a sleepless night on Thursday. ""In the past two years, the circle of our life revolved around home, hospital, jail and court.""Swati said since Mitra was in jail, the family didn't even perform the rice ceremony of her son Maharup, who is now one and a half years old. ""We will perform the ceremony soon,"" she said.According to a relative, Mitra has instructed the family to ensure that no major celebration is held outside his home. In November last year, when Mitra was granted bail, his supporters had whisked him from SSKM within hours after the former minister learnt that CBI was gearing up to challenge his bail in Calcutta high court. Mitra was brought back home in an ambulance violating traffic rules and supporters from several parts of Kolkata had come to his house to celebrate his release. Nineteen days later, the high court cancelled the bail order and sent him back to jail.""We haven't planned any major celebration this time. We have asked the cops to help us and ensure there is no gathering outside our house,"" the relative said. Education minister Partha Chatterjee also made a similar appeal: ""Don't do anything out of excitement that can harm Mitra.""But supporters from Bhowanipore and Kamarhati have started gathering outside Mitra's house with sweets and 'aabir' from Friday evening.

Mitra was rushed in an ambulance violating one way traffic and supporters from several parts of Kolkata had come to his house to celebrate the occasion with flowers and abir. Days later, Calcutta high court cancelled his bail and Mitra was back in jail.""We haven't planned any major celebration this time. We are constantly telling supporters not to go for any over the board celebration that can send a wrong message to the court leading to cancellation to his bail like last time.

As hours went by, the crowd continued to increase, even as police asked them to move away. At one point of time, traffic movement even came to a stop because of crowd pressure.""He is like our dada. No matter if he stays as a minister or not, he would be our hero. He is the reason we follow the party,"" said Ujjal Das, who runs a stationary shop at Kamarhati.Like Ujjal, there were hundreds of others who had come with garlands, sweet boxes and abir, but Mitra loyalists and family members time to time urged them not to distribute sweets or play with green abir outside the house.The organisers of Agradut Uday Sangha , the puja organized at the Sankharipara alley where Mitra lives, said for the last two years, their puja had lost their glitz. ""Mitra was our guardian. This puja is his brainchild. He controls the crowd, takes the final decision on the theme, gets artists to perform for the cultural function and oversees the entire puja rituals. In his absence, we struggled to manage the puja by our own. Now that he is back, we are sure to revive our old glory,"" said Swapan Roy, the club secretary. Another club member standing beside him added: ""We have already won the award even before the start of the puja. Our dada is our biggest award this puja."""

Express Photo by Partha Paul Milan Baidya (centre) is among a hundred officials and 700-odd daily wage labourers who are working to survey the land. Express Photo by Partha PaulIts around noon. The rain has finally stopped, and Milan Baidya gets ready to set out to work again. The 43-year-old technical staff member has been with the West Bengal Land and Land Revenue Department since he was very young. So the work isnt new. But this time, things are different. Its the time-frame, its frantic, Baidya sighs. Looking down at his feet, he adds, At least we now have gumboots.Standing at the edge of what was land earmarked for the Tata Singur project, it is easy to see why the boots matter. Spread across 997 acres, the land once epitomised the dream of a state. Now it is part-swamp, part impenetrable grassland, housing a crumbling factory that never saw any operations  a portrait of a dream deferred.On August 31, the Supreme Court quashed the acquisition of this land in 2006 by the Left Front regime in West Bengal for a Tata Motors plant. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, whose rise to power was partly propelled by the protests she led of farmers here who lost their land, wants the land surveyed by September 14, so that the process of returning plots to respective owners can begin soon. Mamata is planning a rally at Singur that day, to mark the apex court upholding her stand.Its easier said than done.Baidya lists the challenges he and at least a few hundred other officials, ranging from Additional District Magistrate Land Revenue P Maji to non-technical staff, face. In the past 10 years, the fields here have been untended. In most areas, there would be a lot of vegetation by now. This is very fertile land and it means this is now a forest. The place is also full of snakes. The gumboots are for them. We can brave the rain, but not the snakes.Carbolic acid had been poured into the grass to scare the snakes, he adds, but all it had done was chase them away from one end of the land to the other.The nearly thousand acres in contention at Singur had more than 2,000 owners at the time of acquisition. Baidya and others are tasked with returning this carrying a Revenue Department map, wooden stakes to mark out ownership, and the faithful gumboots. This, while taking into account that the ownership of land itself in southern Bengal is typically fractured, with individuals owning islands of land within larger tracts owned by others.Baidyas day starts at 6 am. The abandoned factory has been transformed into temporary barracks for the officials, with some mattresses, covers and thin pillows. Baidya doesnt mind the accommodation, only wishes it had been given a little airing.Lunch is generally rice and fish or egg, while breakfast and evening tiffin have bread and egg, supplemented with pale, sugary tea. Apart from the transformer that the government had set up before 2011 for the Tata factory, a temporary generator has been provided to ensure continuous supply of electricity. Water tankers have been brought in from the district headquarters at Hooghly.Elaborating on the task at hand, Baidya says, If the land was level, the work could have been done in a week. But now, first, the land must be cleared of vegetation. Then, it must be surveyed, and finally ownership recorded and marked. Right now even the first stage is an issue.Almost 3 ft of fly ash had been dumped on the site by Tata Motors to raise the land level. While this has damaged the top soil, making the future of cultivation bleak, it has also made it impossible to work with the heavy harvester machines that the state government dispatched to speed up work.Haradhan Majhi, a farmer and one of the daily-wage labourers employed to operate the harvesters, walks tentatively through the tall grass, towards Baidya. Majhi doesnt have gumboots. The harvester is stuck, he tells Baidya. Someone needs to come and dig around the wheels to get it moving again.One of the 700-odd daily wage labourers working here, Majhi is getting around Rs 200 per day apart from food for the job.Before Majhi starts walking back, Baidya takes off his own gumboots and offers them. While the government has announced that gumboots, gloves and caps would be provided to all workers, there still arent enough to go around. We need to share. This entire work is a long process of sharing, Baidya rationalises.Work goes on from 6 am to 6 pm. Vegetation is chopped, maps are pored over, land marks, buried deep under, are identified and finally, a stake with a piece of paper and number is stuck into the ground. The stake, itself, is unimpressive. But with their task akin to fitting together pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the sight is thrilling, says an official.After work, Baidya and the others exchange stories sitting at the factory. Talk turns to children, growing expenses, and politics. But, most conversations, Baidya says, are about two things  home and land.The 43-year-old understands both. His village Beraberi is not far, and he lives there with his wife and two children. He is the first in his farming family to have a government job.Nothing is more important for the people here than land, Baidya adds. I was a staunch supporter of the Left before Singur happened. But I couldnt rationalise the way land was snatched away. If I supported them for their land reforms, then today I support Mamata Banerjee for her Singur protest, which is why the work here is so important.At the same time, Baidya underlines the dilemma of parents like him. Giving the example of Majhi, he says, Majhi had land here. I also know he wants industry here. He wants his children to not work in the mud and to have proper jobs. Can you blame him?Baidya himself doesnt see a life in either government offices or fields for his two children  a 12-year-old boy who hates studying, and a 16-year-old girl who is at the top of her class. He hopes they will find work in Kolkata, in private offices, where there are increments and less politics.The other topic that looms in every conversation is Mamatas deadline. A podium being erected in the eastern corner of the land for the CMs rally is a constant reminder.If you dont finish the work, Mamata Banerjee will berate you publicly. Which is why everyone is working so hard, Baidya chuckles, before adding, As am I.But, unlike the others who say it is impossible to finish by September 14 or by even the Supreme Court stipulated time of 12 weeks, Baidya remains hopeful. Everyone knows land is the dream of all those whove lived here and are working here.Somewhere in the background, the harvester is still spluttering desperately in the mud. And the rain has started again.So what happens to a dream deferred? In the case of Singur, nature reclaims it violently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

58ff14667be9e0420db2c52d,'There's a real sort of vibe & buzz about Calcutta',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160919/jsp/calcutta/story_108960.jsp,2016-09-19,"BRUCE BUCKNELL is here as the new British deputy high commissioner. He spoke to Chandreyee Chatterjee of Metro about Calcutta, cricket, culture and... cows! Welcome to Calcutta. Have you ever been to Calcutta before? Not before I arrived two months ago. I have been to India though. I did the usual British tourist thing. I went to Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Udaipur with my wife and sister. That was just over 18 months ago actually. And here I am back again. Did you know then that you would be coming to Calcutta? Nope, I had no idea. We have a system within our foreign service of bidding for jobs and I bid for this job well over a year ago, but after I had been to India. I wanted to come to India. Did you talk to anyone before you came over to Calcutta? I spoke to my predecessor (Scott Furssedonn-Wood) and my predecessor's predecessor (Sanjay Wadhwani). Sanjay and I were in the same school many years ago. Sanjay was very enthusiastic about his time here and Scott was enthusiastic as well. I had a good chat about various aspects, about what to expect and the delights of being in Calcutta and then also the fact that I cover quite a big part of India, so there is a lot of variety. What have been your first impressions of Calcutta? Well I have been here for a couple of months but I haven't been in Calcutta the whole time. We have a very interesting induction programme in which I have spent a week in UP and a slightly shorter time in Mumbai, which can't be more different from covering Calcutta and 13 states and one Union Territory. But I think it is really useful to see the other parts of India, to provide some sort of baseline for assessing Bengal with the other states. I've met lots of people so far. The point of the job of course is that we are supposed to get out there. This is our mentality, and this is a phrase that we've been using a lot - 'Global Britain'. But in the first instance it is getting out and seeing and looking and talking to people. The point about India of course is that it is very voluble. There are a lot of people you've got to listen to. There are some impressions (about Calcutta), but I want to take my time. I don't want to jump to conclusions. Your blog says that the British embassy in Belarus, when your were ambassador, was on Karl Marx Street. What was your reaction when you found out that your Calcutta address would be Ho Chi Minh Sarani? My reaction? Well what can I say?! Have you been to Vietnam? You should go to Vietnam. Vietnam is fascinating. This is a country that until about 20 years ago couldn't feed itself. But now it is one of the major rice exporters of South East Asia. Which just shows what can be done in transforming a country. All that is a long time after Ho Chi Minh but he was obviously a national leader in Vietnam. But of course the reason why this street was named Ho Chi Minh was I can see a little bit of political point scoring by the then regional government but we should take these with a touch of humour. You've also said in your blog that the contrast between Belarus and Calcutta couldn't be starker. Can you highlight some of them for us? That was partly seasons, I left in the middle of winter, I've arrived in the middle of monsoon. But the starkness is in just the sheer number of people. This is a tropical country as opposed to a continental one. There are so many differences. People in that part of the world, the Belarusians, are not particularly expressive, here, particularly in Bengal, they are very expressive, which is a very different culture to deal with. London and Calcutta share a lot of similarities, an extensive riverfront, architecture.... Any similarities that you've noticed? Good question, but I find it a little bit early to say. What I would say is London is one of the greatest cities of the world. Calcutta is a great city.... This is a place that clearly has had better times but it is very dynamic in terms of its intellectual capital and the people and the vibrant culture, all the talk and chatter and that Bengali thing, which is part of the reason why I am happy to be here. There is a real sort of vibe and buzz about the place. But the thing that you clearly have to do is to channel that. All these creative people, what are they doing? It is just that Calcutta seems to have lost its drive. India is developing, as I have just seen in Mumbai, I think the trick for Calcutta is to get that sense of identity and focus and to use the talents. Next year will be the India-UK year of culture coinciding with India's 70 years of Independence and one of things we'll be looking at is the Puja to think for inspiration for next year. What will be your main focus as the deputy high commissioner in the city and Eastern India? Well the first focus will be to get to know the region. I cover a large swathe of area and I'll soon be travelling to some of the other states. So that's a key priority. I don't want to rush into setting out priorities but there will be two particular aspects I'd like to talk about. First of all is this sense of collaboration and partnership. We have this history, we have a lot of common interests, and we have a lot of affinities. I hope to go and look at Eden Gardens and enjoy the cricket tour that's coming up. I'd like to find out how the Indians enjoy beating the English at cricket (laughs). There is sport and cricket, but there is more than that. I want to look at the broader aspects of this partnership. We are very open for collaboration.... We have all sorts of scholarship programmes, fellowship programmes like Chevening. We also have research links with India through the Newton Bhabha programme. I would definitely be looking forward to talking to young people and going to universities. One of the areas is perhaps the fact that there is great heritage in the city but there aren't that many visitors. So it is not just Jaipur and Agra, it is also Bengal and Calcutta. There are lots of jewels that I didn't know like the Victoria monument. There are all sorts of aspects that we could actually do more of in the future. How does UK industry perceive the business climate in Bengal today? Bengal hasn't always had a positive image.... You are absolutely right. I think that is a bit of an issue but that's an issue not just for me but for everybody who lives and works in this part of India. As I said earlier, it's the perception. There is always a lag with perception isn't there? You think the perception is foggy London, it's the one I was constantly coming against in Belarus, well actually that was from the 1950s due to the burning coal, London used to be terribly foggy. I think there is that sort of perception back here. Some British companies are invested here - British Telecom, who have taken advantage of outsourcing here. So yes, there is a challenge. Yes there may not be as much obvious interest but Calcutta is a centre/entry point and if there is a bit more investment in infrastructure there is a great possibility to improve the connectivity with and through Bangladesh and beyond. But these aren't things that will happen overnight. But in the mean time, just to see the development of places like Salt Lake, New Town and Sector V... that is changing. Obviously a key focus for my organisation is to promote trade between Britain and India. It is no secret, we are here to sell to India, Indians want to sell to us. It is a two-way flow. And exactly the same with investments. We'll be looking to support that as much as possible. Our mutual prosperity is obviously of great interest to both sides. Coming to your Twitter bio... you've said one of your interest areas is cricket.... Your favourite all-time and current English cricketers? Well I grew up, I was left-handed, when David Gower was playing. He was effortless, very stylish. I don't intend to fly planes like he did but I used to think I was like David Gower! I could hardly hit the ball off the square, but that was me. He was great to watch, he was graceful. I will put my foot in it completely now by saying that of the Indian batsman I've watched, it was Sunil Gavaskar. I mean I grew up seeing him bat. He was just very neat and tidy for such a small man and he played those West Indian bowlers. He was great. Of this generation, I think Rahul Dravid. He was so elegant. He got the elbow up and played so neatly. Right now I think Virat Kohli is the player. There are two of them actually. Kohli and Joe Root. Then there is young Kane Williamson. I haven't actually seen Williamson but Root and Kohli, they play, it's not slog cricket. Kohli's scored more fours on the ground playing 20:20, he doesn't hit sixes, he hits fours. That's what it is. I am somewhat traditionalist in that respect. While on Kohli vs Williamson, will you be watching the India-Zealand Test match at Eden Gardens from September 30? Well I am not in town on September 30 but I will try and catch a bit of the match later if can slip out of office for a bit. Team England is going to Bangladesh in October. Will you be hopping over for it? Well I would like to but the issue would be just time. I mean it is my first three months. If I can take leave I will go. But, you know, I have to do my job (shrugs and laughs). Don't you follow football? I love football. I love a lot of sports. I am slightly amazed by how much interest there is in English football here. I think this season in going to be fascinating. Leicester City winning last year, that was fantastic.... I would have loved to have gone to a Calcutta Derby (East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan). Unfortunately their games are mid-week and mid-afternoon. There is ISL. Atletico de Kolkata.... We gave the world football and when was the last time we won a trophy? Everybody seems happy and that's fine! Which is your team? Well my team... well, I am again a traditionalist. I was born just outside a town called Redding in Southern England and it has had three seasons in the Premier League. It has done very well, partly because of the wealth of the town. I don't have one set team. I'd say I'd prefer Leicester to win again, of course. The other interest area you've mentioned in your Twitter bio is cows... have you caught the irony of being in a country where cow politics is at its peak? I know. You know I wrote that before cow politics came to the fore. That's purely because I'm a farmer's son. I grew up with cows. My father was a farmer, my grandfather was a farmer, my great-grandfather was a farmer. So I grew up with cows. It's just a part of my past. I have gone to extent that I can even tell you roughly what the cow population is in India and what it is in Britain. I think it is one cow for 10 people, roughly in India, and one for every 50 in Britain. I'll write about cows in the future. I am going to discover how much milk you get from cows in India as compared to Britain! What are you looking forward to doing here when you are not being the deputy high commissioner? Well I need to get fit, so I am trying to lose weight. I am definitely going to travel around. We have lots of things to visit. I have got to go and touch the turf at Eden Gardens and cross-examine the groundsman I hope! I am going I hope very soon to Bhubaneswar and I am looking forward to seeing the temples there. There are lots of things; it is so big, so vast, and so diverse. Then there is the Northeast which is another world of places to visit. It is a pretty full agenda really and I am delighted to be here. What is your message for Bruce Bucknell? Tell [email protected]"

Aroma of freshly cooked idiyappam (string hoppers) is in the air. Ignoring the hustle and bustle and the mosquito bites, the crowd waits patiently for their turn. Welcome to Burma idiyappam shop.""Many people prefer idiyappam since it is prepared without using oil. After having a heavy lunch on Sunday, usually non-veg dishes, people prefer to have something light in the evening. I have been coming to the shop for over a decade,"" says J Velmurugan , a regular customer.The shop, which started functioning four decades ago, still manages to remain the best place for the rice noodles, says its owner K Rajkumar . ""My mother-in-law S Pechiammal started selling Burma idiyappam here from the middle of the 1970's. She, along with her husband Subramaniam, was running an eatery in Burma,"" he told TOI.Pechiammal had 10 children, says Rajkumar. ""I married one of her daughters in 1983 and joined the business. I started a separate shop the following year. The experience I got while working at hotels in Bihar and Kolkata helped me in a big way,"" he says.Though the shop lacks the proper ambience, some prefer to have steamy idiyappam with family members. Many throng the place for takeaways.What is the secret to their popularity? Nothing, says Rajkumar's wife Padma Devi. ""We don't use any secret ingredient for making idiyappam. We prepare them using ordinary rice and steamed rice in equal measure. Just like other hotels, we provide a chutney, coconut milk and shredded coconut with sugar as side dishes. May be the secret lies in the traditional way we cook idiyappam,"" she said."

Though no human casualty is reported so far, the elephants have damaged standing paddy and maize crops in several acres.As part of their annual sojourn the elephant herd comprising 12 calves and 6 tuskers from Dalma sanctuary has entered Mayurbhanj forests through their usual corridor in search of food after creating havoc in bordering districts of West Bengal.Locals are scared as the marauding jumbos has been causing widespread damage to paddy and vegetable crops in more than 100 forest side villages in both Mayurbhanj and Balasore districts besides killing people for the past six years.We are spending sleepless nights after knowing that the herd is camping in the jungle close to our village. The residents are guarding their houses by burning timber logs in the night, said a local Guruba Singh.Forest officials have warned local residents not to chase the elephants which may turn violent if they are irritated by fire crackers. They have also been asked not to store any intoxicating substance like rice beer in their houses to keep the elephants away.Baripada DFO Sanjay Swain said 120 forest personnel have been engaged in the border areas to monitor the movement of the elephant herd. They have been asked to prevent the entry of the pachyderms into the human habitations.Since horse-shit keep the elephants away, the officials also have deployed two horses along the Morada border to stop the elephants from proceeding further. According to experts, the neigh, smell of stool and urine of male horses irritate elephants.Last year the pachyderms had failed to enter Dukura, Betnoti and Rasgobindpur reserve forests as six male horses, two each, were deployed in these areas.Meanwhile, a 24-hour control room has been opened at Baripada divisional forest office to monitor the movement of a herd of wild elephants and collect information from the people.The deployed forest staff will provide regular updates about the movement of the herd. We have taken every possible measure to prevent them from entering into human habitations, Swain added."
58f665fe7be9e031f13b3fe2,State lags behind national average in rice production,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/State-lags-behind-national-average-in-rice-production/articleshow/54619452.cms,2016-10-01,"BHUBANESWAR: Between 2012 and '15, Odisha won national awards for excellence in foodgrain productions. But when it comes to producing rice, it has fallen behind the national average despite the area under paddy cultivation being more than other states.Over the last decade the all-India average of rice production stands at more than 2,000 kg/hectare (kg/ha). In the same period Odisha has steadily increased its production from 1,554 kg/ha in 2005-06 to 2,361 in 2012-13. But over the past few years the number has started declining. In 2013-14 the yield was 1,821 kg/ha while in 2015-16 it had dipped to 1,491 kg/ha from 1,989 in 2014-15.Explaining the change, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said in a written reply in the assembly recently: ""Odisha faces natural calamities like drought, cyclone, flood and untimely rain almost every year. Despite all odds, there was a gradual growth in rice production every year due to a number of steps taken by the state government. Effort is on to match the national average.""The reason for the sharp decline in production in 2015-16 was attributed to drought-like situation in as many as 27 of the 30 districts, official figures revealed. Over 200 farmers allegedly committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden though the state government claimed that most of the deaths were due to other reasons.Asked about the low yield despite paddy being cultivated in two-thirds of the total cultivable land, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor of OUAT S N Pasupalak said: ""Factors like low mechanization, poor nutrient management, structure of land and low irrigation potential are responsible for low production of rice in the state.""Among all districts, Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, stands at the top in producing highest amount of rice constantly for past 10 years. Other districts like Boudh, Dhenkanal, Nabarangapur, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur and Sundargarh have been recording high production of rice for past two years.Despite drought in 2015-16, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak produced 2,571 kg/ha and 2,505 kg/ha, respectively, among the highest in the country.""For increase in productivity, Odisha has been promoting modern methods like system of rice intensification (SRI), practice of multiple crops, soil testing, supplying quality seeds and augmenting irrigation potential,"" said an officer in the agriculture department.A number of centrally-sponsored schemes like National Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India, National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana are being implemented in the state to increase the agriculture productivity.Odisha has been winning successive krishi karman awards among category-II states for record foodgrain production.According to sources in the directorate of economics and statistics, states like West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are ahead of Odisha in rice production.."
59042b687be9e02646bdca89,"After Singur ruling, the challenge before Mamata",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573895/after-singur-ruling-challenge-mamata.html,2016-10-03,"After Singur ruling, the challenge before MamataDrimi Chaudhuri, Kolkata, Oct 04, 2016, 23:57 ISTMamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal and Trinamool Congress chairperson, did the unlikely. She kept her promise and returned the land to the protesting farmers of Singur. Ironically, with that, Mamata celebrated the defeat of her own state government!On September 14, a fortnight after the Supreme Court found the acquisition process at Singur in 2006 done without due process of law, and ordered that the land be returned to farmers, Mamata  Didi to her followers and well-wishers  organised a meet at the hamlet in Hooghly district.Supposed to be an administrative event, it turned into a victory rally of her party. She declared that she kept her promises and handed out land deeds and compensation cheques to the farmers.Even though the defeat is to be counted on the columns of the erstwhile Left Front administration, in effect, Mamata was celebrating the defeat of the government she leads. And she could not be happier. What seemed impossible even a month ago is now a reality and she has been able to keep her most difficult promise. For her and for her party, life has come a full circle.This does not make Mamatas job any easier. Even though she managed to keep her word, when the land was acquired, she was in the Opposition. Later, the challenge was to stop Singur from happening and prevent the Left from acquiring the land. After this, the challenge was to wrest power.Now, the scenario has changed. She is the chief minister and cannot claim any unfriendliness with the industry. And with every passing day till January next, when Mamata has her annual Biswa Bangla business summit, things will get harder.With the annual ball in mind  where she invites and pampers captains of industry from India and abroad  her team has been working hard. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the states nodal agency, formed a committee six months ago and top officials have been travelling around the globe, seeking commitments of attendance. Mamata herself had recently been to Europe, meeting honchos from BMW and other companies to ensure the summit is well-attended.The challenge before her is to prove the summit is not just another gathering, but that there will be some serious commitments from the industry.It was keeping these aspects in mind that she announced from the stage at Singur on September 14 about the available land and invited Tata Motors, BMW or anybody else to set up an automobile factory. Insiders say she knows BMW is not likely to come calling, and that her invite was more for the sake of Tata.With her vote bank in mind, she kept at her policy of no forcible land acquisition and announced a number of sops, including state support to set up farming infrastructure once again, from one-time grants to easily available loans.At the same time, instead of ordering officials to demolish the factory shed at Singur, she put the process on hold, urging Tatas to take care of their belongings.This is in sharp contrast to her days of Singur movement, when she inspired supporters to break down the factory wall.Now, the administration has put up posters to prevent the same acts that became the hallmark of her movement back in 2006. Insiders also whisper of the back channels that she has opened up through state Finance Minister Amit Mitra, a former FICCI head.If getting industry is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, she also needs to deal with a number of undercurrents at Singur. At some of the villages in Singur, most residents are share-croppers and landless workers who formed the most militant faction of her agitation.Since they were the least to gain from the factory coming up, they were the most invested in the movement. Under the changed scenario, they dont yet know how long the states monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and Rs 2 per kg rice will continue. They also dont know what will happen after the dust settles since Mamata had nothing much on offer for them.Uncultivable landIn 2006, when the acquisition process started, the most eager section included absentee landlords, who formed nearly 70% of land-holders. Their eagerness stemmed from the fact that share-croppers and landless workers, till then backed by the Lefts farming organisation, Krishak Sabha, held an upper hand over the landlords.Added to this is the realisation that the land might not retain its earlier fertility. Of the total 997 acres acquired for the project, 300 acres have been used to build the shed, roads, drainage and other infrastructure inside the abandoned premises.Uncertainty has cropped up on whether these areas can ever be cultivable again. This has made a large section of land owners consider selling their holdings, now that they have got it back.Land prices plummeted once the Tatas left and even though there are willing sellers, prices remain uncertain. Then there is the local youth, who have seen the worst aspects of the movement and were witness to a changing economic scene. These youngsters coming from the middle class and agrarian families have lost it all to the political upheaval which hit their growing years at every step. And most of them want a factory to come up at Singur.The circle that came full over a decade has led Mamata into yet another circle. A decade ago, as a firebrand Opposition leader on the brink of ignominy, with hardly any political capital to show, things looked much different for her. The landscape, however, looks altered when she stares down from the chief ministers office.Mamata might get her name etched on pages of history but that will not help her get investment, while keeping her rural, agrarian vote bank pacified. In the end, a hard-earned victory could turn into a Greek tragedy, where the heros fate is sealed because of a weak heel."

While artisans are busy completing the welcome arches, decorators have decked up every corner of the city with impressive lighting arrangements, thereby adding sparkle to the festivity. Organisers have spent a huge amount of money on innovative light works using LED lights.The entire Badambadi stretch is replete with rice light strings and the decorations include three massive light gates in addition to the replica of ISKCON temple at Mayapur in West Bengal. Similar decorations can be seen at Dolomundai, Bajrakabati and Haripur where five light gates have come up apart from the roadside decorations. Apparently, each of the puja committees spends between `2 lakh and `5 lakh on illumination. With 48 big pujas being organised in the city, the total figure hovers above `70 lakh during the fourday autumn festival.Malgodown Puja Committee is decorating the entire stretch with rice lights and five tall light gates have been erected at the cost of `four lakh. At Khan Nagar, 10 light gates have come up on a stretch of four km. Ganesh Kumar Das, chief artisan from Cuttack who designed lighting arrangements in Khan Nagar, says he has used various mythological themes to design the gates. At Jobra, Chauliaganj, Sheikh Bazaar, Ranihaat and Mangalabaag, light decorations have come up in every nook and cranny.Similarly in Bhubaneswar, replicas of temples, Dhauli Shanti Stupa and many more heritage sites will give Durga Puja a festive glow. At Saheed Nagar, the Puja committee has erected five massive light gates themed on Sai Baba and Goddess Durga and the budget for light decorations here in `four lakh. At Jharpada and Old Station Bazaar, eight and four majestic light gates have come up. In Nayapalli and Rasulgarh, Puja committees have set up five gates each. While there are 156 small and big Durga Puja pandals in Cuttack, the number is 180 in Bhubaneswar.On the other hand, CESU authorities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar claimed that squads have been formed to check illegal use of power by Puja committees during the festival. Officer in charge of CESU (City Distribution Division, Cuttack) AK Bisoi said as LEDs are used for light decorations, not much power is being consumed by the organisers. Each Puja committees consume between 20 KW and 22 KW of power through light decorations every day, he said and added that use of bulbs and traditional lights increases the power consumption by five times. CESU Superintending Engineer, Bhubaneswar Circle-I Sukanta Kumar Swain said each Puja committee consumes an average of 20 KW power every day and the total consumption in the four days is around 3.6 MW. He informed that eight regular and three special squads have been formed to check illegal connections."

(Photo used for representational purpose) The minister said as per the minimum support price fixed by the Centre, farmers would get Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety of paddy. (Photo used for representational purpose)In a step to prevent distress sale of paddy in the state, Odisha government today set a tentative target of procuring 30 lakh tonnes of rice during the 2016-17 kharif marketing season (KMS) beginning November 1. The Food and Procurement Policy for Kharif Marketing Season, 2016-17 was approved at the cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here today, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said.The cabinet approved a proposal to extend by another three months the period for reducing the rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) on pulses and dals of all kinds under the Odisha VAT Act, 2004, Chief Secretary A P Padhi said. As the state government procures paddy from farmers during Kharif and Rabi seasons separately under the KMS, the target was set to collect 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice, equivalent to 44 lakh tonnes of paddy.The minister said as per the minimum support price fixed by the Centre, farmers would get Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety of paddy. The rate of Grade-A variety of paddy was fixed at Rs 1,510 per quintal, he said, adding that procuring agencies and district administrations would make wide publicity regarding the FAQ (fair average quality) of paddy.While the state-run Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation procures 95 per cent of paddy, other agencies, if necessary, would be deployed in surplus districts, the minister said. He said the Kharif paddy would be procured during the period from November 2016 to March 2017 and Rabi paddy during May and June, 2017.The paddy would be procured from farmers who are registered in the online portals of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. So far 8.29 lakh farmers have got themselves registered with the department, the minister said, adding 95 per cent of the paddy producers have been provided Aadhaar numbers.Aadhaar seeding would be used for paddy procurement and the farmers would be paid online under the P-PAS system. The facility has been extended to 294 of 314 blocks in the state, he said. Replying to a question, the minister said while the state required only 19 lakh metric tonnes of rice for public distribution system, remaining rice is to be given to the FCI.The cabinet also extended another three months for imposition of one per cent VAT, instead of five per cent on pulses of all kinds in view of the demand of traders. Though the government has sustained a loss of about Rs 5 crore twoards VAT in three months due to reduction of the rate of VAT on pulses, it would like another three months extension as sale of pulses has increased, the Chief Secretary said.In another decision, the cabinet approved a proposal of the finance department to reduce the rate of VAT from 14.5 per cent to 5 per cent on LPG cylinder manufacturing. As neighbouring states like West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand maintain 5 per cent VAT on LPG cylinder manufacturing, the Odisha government would also bring it down to increase transaction, Padhi said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f16a83a3d24b245e599e81,Chew on this part of Chorao’s history,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Chew-on-this-part-of-Choraos-history/articleshow/54758239.cms,2016-10-09,"Many names of places are difficult to interpret, as the reason for which they earned the nomenclature have been lost over time. They may be topographic features and other factors that decide the name of a place, but again, changes over decades may have eroded their significance.In Chorao , a small ward called Chamerem gained its name in strange fashion. The small eatery that supplied simple food  culinary delicacies of that time  on the busy Mandovi riverfront prompted locals to name the place Chamerem. But as importance of landmarks keep shifting, the present ferry point has shrouded the other landmark at Chamerem, an interior corner of the island opposite the building that formerly housed the Goa Institute of Management.Chorao or Chudamani, as it is referred in hoary records, was a bustling suburb of former Portuguese capital, Old Goa. Now, reduced to insignificance, the saga of its past grandeur is not totally lost.Fidalgos stayed in Chorao and the first seminary in Asia was set up here on this island, says Salvador Fernandes, a local businessman. The fidalgos would be found often lounging near the ferry point on the south-eastern side of the island, waiting for patmarios (sail boats) to cross over to Old Goa or Ribandar . The wide array of snacks ranging from pao bhaji and samosas to masala dosas were unheard of then.The fidalgos as well as the common folk took great delight in chewing on snacks available then and gulped down hot tea in the shacks.They enjoyed the freshly steamed merem (snack) and sipped the hot cha (tea) at that spot, says Fernandes. And this is how Cha and Merem mingled into a combination of a nomenclature that stuck to the place.Recalling that an elderly village teacher and social worker, Domingo Caetano Abreo, who died a few years ago had told him about it, Fernandes says the snack itself disappeared from the kitchen of local folks.The Chorao ferry point has shifted south to the present spot, where commuters, scooterists and motorists are caught in a whirl of a mad rush to reach office, market, other places or their homes.The Chorao-Ribandar route is the busiest ferry route in the state. According to figures provided by river navigation department, three vessels operating on this route made an amazing 1.02 lakh trips in 2007-08 and 1.31 lakh trips in 2008-09. The department estimated that about 2,99,900 commuters, 1,32,100 two- wheelers and 52,744 cars crossed over on this route. And now, there are more ferry boats, more trips, commuters and vehicles using the route. But there is hardly any time to smell tea or coffee, or the hot samosas in nearby restaurants for the commuters.Riding or driving through the biggest riverine island in Goa, the commuters also pass through Chamerem. But the old ferry ramp is now lost in an overgrown swamp and its view blocked by new structures sprouting along the roadside. Though the hub of the village has shifted from Chamerem to other parts of the island, the burgeoning population is slowly taking up spaces here for housing. There were only a few houses here in the recent past.Chamerem was in the spotlight recently when the first chapel dedicated to St Teresa of Kolkata was inaugurated at its roadside location in September.Some islanders say merem was not one single sweet, but comprised three of them. Khole which was a package of jaggery and coconut rolled by a paste of rice ground to a patem was one of them. The other two were xevieo and ale-bele.Percival Noronha says the Portuguese introduced tea in the 16th century in Goa. Cha e merenda (tea and the evening snack) must have slowly changed into Chamerem, he says."

The motifs are ritualistic images from mythology and scriptures.Joint effortSadly, either brush strokes of acrylic paint or, worse still, printed plastic stickers of the traditional art have taken its place in most of the houses and the myriad community puja-mandaps in and around the city.Now an effort has been mounted to save this art from slipping into oblivion. INTACH, under its cultural heritage programme, has joined hands with the Daricha Foundation, which also works to revive tribal and folk arts, to give alpana a fresh lease of life.INTACH is now exploring whether it can be made into a source of revenue for girls from underprivileged sections.Interestingly, also involved in this revival effort is artist Rabi Biswas, who was fascinated by this art form at a young age and learnt it from his grandmother and village elders. Today, he gives gives lecture demonstrations (lec-dem) and is regarded as an authority in this art form. He is also the pivot around which many revival efforts are woven.Although there is little awareness about alpana among the youth of West Bengal, it has generated interest among people across the seas who see in it a unique art form.Ian Beed, a religious studies scholar from Florida State University, told The Hindu after attending a lec-dem that he was fascinated by the way alpana provided women a vehicle for expression, irrespective of their caste or creed.Alpana is intrinsically linked with religious austerity (called brotos or vrat) practised by women of mostly rural West Bengal for the well-being of the family.Urban women until recently also observed such pujas, whose closure would always be marked by a special puja and alpana drawing with special motifs. So if it is to propitiate Goddess of wealth Lakshmi, it would involve her carrier, the owl, a granary, a conch shell and lotus flower motifs.Young girls and married women alike would draw these designs on walls and floors of their mud houses using rice powder paste."

(PTI Photo) West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. (PTI Photo)A FIVE-DAY food festival, the brainchild of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, meant to celebrate Bengali cuisine globally and provide farmers a platform for their produce, has come in for criticism from the Opposition, which has termed it hypocritical and an insult for a state where poverty and financial crisis have often resulted in many not having enough to eat.The Ahare Bangla food festival, held at the Milan Mela grounds in Kolkata from October 21 to October 25, saw hundreds turning up.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOrganised by the state animal resource development department, the event saw four state organisations, 23 sweet shops and 20 restaurateurs participating. The festival is now in its second year and has an international outreach with stalls from Bangladesh, China and Russia participating. The queues stretched on endlessly. A total 103 food counters served more than 550 items. It was an incredible opportunity for the people to get a taste of classic Bengali dishes alongside new items that they had never tried before, said Animal Husbandry Minister Swapan Debnath.The festival saw a variety of items  from traditional bhapa ilish to emu steaks. While traditional vegetarian dishes were highlighted on October 22, eggs were the delicacy on October 24 and fish on October 25.While the government has been ecstatic at the reception of the event, the Opposition less so. It has alleged that the festival was an unnecessary squandering of tax payers money and an insult to the poor, who cannot even get enough to eat.Ahead of the Assembly elections earlier this year, the ruling Trinamool Congress was confident of its rice politics  extending the scope of the National Food Security Act to reach out to 6.5 crore people instead of 3.5 crore (over 70 per cent of the states population). The Bengal famine of 1943, consequent cases of what the government euphemistically refers to as hunger deaths or death due to chronic ailments neglected in the past have entrenched hunger as a vital issue during elections.A myriad representation of hunger by artists ranging from Chittaprosad to Somnath Hore have formed the iconography for hunger in the post-colonial Bengal, which continues today. Mamata herself is not unaware of this. At rallies, she is often introduced as the anna data  goddess of food  by her party members. It was no accident that the new state secretariat was named Nabanna, after Bijon Bhattacharyas play on famine.For the Left and Congress, the Ahare Bangla festival has proven an ideal platform to hit out at Mamata. Left cadres had hit the street, protesting the wastage of government funds through its Anahare Bangla (Bengal starving) programme. A day before the inauguration of the food fest, Left leaders had organised a protest that defaced the venues gate with posters highlighting starvation in Bengal and deaths due to malnutrition in the tea gardens.The government should give priority to issues like unemployment, factory lockouts, dengue outbreaks and not organise a food festival. It is an insult to those who dont get enough to eat, said Left leader Sujan Chakraborty.The Congress, on the other hand, has alleged that the fest was a gimmick. Party president Adhir Ranjan Chowudhury said: It seems Banerjee is mocking the common people. In a state where farmers do not get paid for their crops and a lot of people cannot buy two square meals a day, what significance does a food festival hold?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He was hardly interested in his family business (his father and elder brother are wholesale rice traders). He claimed he would develop an app of his own. But the second-year student ended up behind the bars with charges of cyber stalking and money extortion slapped against him.However, Kishan is not the only stalker arrested this year. The cyber cell of Kolkata Police is swamped with online harassment and extortion complaints  there has been a whopping 255.8% rise in such cases in the state between 2011 and 2015. The figure for Kolkata is scarier. It shows a 933.3% jump during the same period. In the past six months, there has been a further 5% spurt.""We hardly had three to five such online cases till about 2012. Now, there are about five such cases each month where students turned out to be either online victims or the abuser,"" said a detective department officer.A recent survey by a private body  Uninor  that has been shared with CID has found that one out of two schoolkids were victims of cyber stalking in the country. The survey, which covered 10,500 children in 29 schools, also found that 30% of children who regularly accessed internet had experienced some kind of cyber harm, including cyber stalking, cyber bullying, hacking and defamation. Among them, just 34% spoke to their parents about their online activities.""The smartphone revolution has left us burdened with cases of online trolling. In many cases, these are nothing less than character assassination and sexual abuse. Unlike the computer where you need to log in and log off, there is no concept of logging off from your mobile. With wireless file-sharing technologies easily accessible, your personal data can become public if you are careless about the way you handle your phone,"" explained an investigator.But in many cases, not being selective also leads to trouble. For example, a 15-year-old girl from a reputable English-medium school was stalked online by a 21-year-old school dropout after a chance encounter with her. Days later, he posed as a girl and sent her a friendship invitation. Soon after the friendship request was accepted, he put pressure on her for a meeting, threatening he would otherwise leak her morphed pictures on porn sites. He was arrested after a six-month probe. John Vijay Sagar , an associate professor of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry, NIMHANS, pointed out: ""Of late, we have been witnessing a rising number of adolescents coming in with behavioural changes. When we go through their history over a period of time, we learn that it was owing to the overuse of social media and most of them were addicted to internet. This trend was not there earlier.""According to Supreme Court lawyer and cyber crime expert Pavan Duggal, six out of 10 people aren't aware of what constitutes a cyber crime. ""As a result, they aren't reported. Neither the victims nor the abusers know what is an offence,"" he said."

Well, most of them are a dud, right? Rajith Nair did the same and realised some places were a waste of time. A heritage lover, he opened a special interest travel firm, Travelling Gecko, that identifes lesser-known stories in destinations.After he quit his job in a digital advertising research company in 2012, he and his wife shifted to Kochi to explore with their savings. Two years of exploration and research brought fascinating stories. I stumbled across a royal family, who set the laws and welcomed the Europeans to their land. They lived in residential quarters, with a beautiful home around 200-years-old built by the Dutch. I got in touch with them, told them what I wanted to do. Organise a trip, talk about their history, contributions, take them inside the palace and interact. They were happy and eager, smiles Rajith who also spoke to them about preserving what little is left of their heritage structure.P JawaharAnother example would be Allepey. When you go there during the holiday season and stand by the shore, all you can see are house boats standing in a line almost like a train. Not very scenic. I met a gentleman who organizes boat rides in a traditional country boat that was used to transfer rice and fish. He set up cushioned benches in it. Narrow streams where house boats cant enter, he had easier access. You can see children playing, women working, men on their boats, and even a toddy tapper with his bottle. Now thats a true backwater experience! he explains.Rajith tied up with him. Part of the funds that Travelling Gecko receives go to him, a part to the toddy tapper who would give toddy to taste and part to a family living on an island who prepares a meal for you. Many local people benefit through your holiday.In 2014, Rajith packed his bags and came to namma ooru. The timing couldnt have been better. Madras Week celebrations were going on. The different walks and talks were the perfect introduction to the city. I met Chitra Madhavan, Sriram, Muthiah sir and so many others who helped me learn more. Of course, the books in Madras Literary Society were another source of inspiration.We asked him to share something not many Chennaiites would know. He smiles, The Arms and Weapons Gallery in Egmore museum. You may be familiar with the gallery at Fort Museum but is was another and we got a history lesson that left us overwhelmed.There are two large Chinese bells that carried a story in its inscriptions. People in the gallery didnt know the history; so I hit the books and was amazed. They probably came from the summer palace in China during the Opium War in the mid 19th Century. The British provided high quality opium to the Chinese, who paid them in silver, which was then traded with Indians for tea. In the late 1700s, the Chinese emperor banned opium but private peddlars continued work. He then sent an army to seize all opium from the British and burn themRajith continued to talk about free trade, war and treaties. It was fascinating and for a minute, the museum almost came alive! Rajith has organized 60 trips. If youre looking for an experience, first Travelling Gecko would want you to fill a form about your interests and other details. Rajith spends few days, setting destinations, linking stories and making an itinerary.Chennai has a lot of stories and many have been explored by other history enthusiasts like Rajith. What needs more exploration is George Town and Triplicane. The history, the communities, food storiesthere is so much! I believe in living in the city before I organise trips and tell stories.After Tamil Nadu, he hopes to move to other parts of the country. The Durga Pooja in Kolkata, Ram Leela in Varnasi, Nawabs in Lucknow are some of the stories Im keen on exploring. And the history buffs I meet, inspire me with their stories and experiences, he grins.For details, visit www.travellinggecko.com"

While evasion of commercial taxes including VAT and Entry Tax has been going on since long, the CT Department in the district has failed to check the practice.Rourkela Police with a series of seizures of illegal consignments has brought massive tax evasions to the fore. While police suspect that multiple well-knit rackets are involved in tax evasions, they managed to get vital clues against a particular city-based trader.Zone - II DSP RK Panigrahi informed that on September 29, they intercepted a truck near the godown of trader Naresh Agarwal with edible oil worth above Rs 18 lakh without e-way bills or Central Sales Tax document. The truck driver also confessed that he was taking the consignment to Agarwal. Yet, proprietor of Supreme Trader Sheikh Saukat Ali, who runs his office on the premises of Agarwal, claimed ownership of the oil consignment. But he had not paid Income Tax since 2010 and his firm was registered with CT Department in 2015.The DSP said the oil consignment was brought to Rourkela using forged documents of electrical goods to show that it was sent from Kolkata to Puja Electricals, Jharsuguda. The vehicle also had fake registration number. The truck driver told police that the oil consignment was loaded at Murena in Madhya Pradesh and call records revealed that he was in constant touch with Agarwal and never talked to Ali.On November 4, police again seized a truck-load of wheat flour and fine wheat flour near the godown of Agarwal. This time, his brother Rajesh claimed ownership and paid tax and fine of Rs 95,000 to CT Department and Rs 23,000 to Transport Department for overloading. On the same day, Brahmani Tarang police also seized about 12 tonnes of rice in Saw Mill area from a trader who claimed involvement of Agarwal. Later, the CT Department fined him Rs 2.77 lakh.Rourkela SP Anirudh Singh said Agarwal is not alone in the illegal business and all police stations have been directed to take actions against tax evaders.Sources said revenue target of Commercial Taxes in the district is about Rs 1,040 crore, but actual collection could go beyond Rs 1,200 crore with strict enforcement.National vice-president of Confederation of All India Traders BM Agarwal said strict action is needed to stop tax evasion and hoped introduction of GST would be of great help."

India ended all its ties with South Africa in 1948 but when Nelson Mandela was released from jail in 1990 and the African National Congress (ANC) took initiative to bring the two nations together, it seemed a matter of time before the Proteas toured India.But it was the handiwork of the then BCCI secretary Jagmohan Dalmiya and managing director of United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) Ali Bacher to bring South Africa back. Bacher led from the front as South Africa got the full-member status in the International Cricket Council (ICC). The BCCI supported the move and the three-match series was like a return gift.""Our reintroduction into world cricket, at the ICC level, was proposed by India,"" Bacher, one of the main architects of the Friendship Series, had earlier said.But the South Africans didn't have any clue about the reception that they were to get as they reached Kolkata. A 1,00,000 strong crowd on a smoggy Kolkata morning welcomed Clive Rice's men with firecrackers and trumpets to create an atmosphere which South Africa players weren't accustomed with.Javagal Srinath, who was part of the Indian pace bowling unit, remembers the occasion as something ""unbelievable"". ""It was like a festival and it was surprising to see people waiting for hours to have a glimpse of the South Africans. I made my debut in Sharjah about a week back and it was my first match on India soil. I still remember every moment of that match. It feels difficult to believe it happened 25 years ago,"" Javagal Srinath told TOI on Wednesday. South Africa felt the pressure when they batted and were bowled out for 177 with three overs to go. The crowd was a tad disappointed, thinking that it would all get over very soon, but they were in for a surprise.A tall pacer bowled like lightning in and tore through the Indian top-order. In no time, Allan Donald reduced India to 60-4 and it boiled down to a duel between Sachin Tendulkar and the rookie speed merchant. Tendulkar (62) showed his class and weathered the storm as debutant batsman Pravin Amre (55) gave him company to help India win that match by three wickets.""I came into bat after Azhar departed. We were tottering at 60 for 4 and we badly needed a big partnership. I was a little intimidated with the way Donald was bowling, initially I thought I wouldn't last long. But I told myself this is the chance to prove my mettle on s a big stage and I must give it a shot. It was a big advantage to have Sachin at the other end and it felt like batting in a local match at Shivaji Park once we took charge,"" Amre said.Venkatapathy Raju, the highest wicket-taker for India that game, has fond memories. ""I feel lucky to be part of history. Some of their stalwarts like Kepler Wessels, Clive Rice and Peter Kirsten had decent experience of playing in English County, but the atmosphere at Eden Gardens was something else,"" Raju said.Both the countries have come a long way since then, but this is one comeback no South African will ever forget."

The cautious use of Rs 100 notes, however, has a pattern. People have cut down on expenditures in amusement, eating out, foreign travel and the like. For instance, footfall at Eco Park, New Town, were a low 4936 on Saturday against the usual 12,000-odd number. ""This was due to lack of 100-rupee notes. It improved a little on Sunday soon after cash became available. It touched the 10166-mark,"" a Hidco official said. But then, people used the 2000-rupee note and used cards and PayTM and kept 100-rupee notes to themselves. ""Use of PayTMs doubled on Sunday, the day after and there was a significant increase in paying the entry fee through cards,"" the Hidco official added. The swipe machine at the Eco Park restaurant went out of order after consumers insisted on making payments through debit/credit cards prompting the restaurant owner to accept old 500- and 1000-rupee notes.The electronic transfer has taken away a major chunk of the daily business to malls, leading to demand fall in local markets. Offtake of vegetables and poultry shot up to a new high in the city marts and malls, registering distress sale in Jadavpur retail market. Would this liquidity crunch induced demand fall bring down prices? ""The government wants it, but I fear how far this is going to happen. How can one sacrifice his daily rice or fish or even medicines to do so? People are buying essential items either through credit or through electronic transfers. It has led to a lateral shift of buying from local markets to malls and marts,"" argues economist Ajitava Roy Chowdhury.The local kirana shop or the fish vendor doesn't have enough money to keep the credit cycle going. The informal supply chain has already started showing signs of desperation with primary producers at the far end of the supply chain unable to continue with supply of vegetables and fish on credit. This will lead to supply crunch. ""Imagine a situation where people in metros have cash to buy but the cash has not reached the villages to enable primary producers and aggregators resume business. What will happen to prices then?"" says Roy Chowdhury.The RBI, meanwhile, assured the public to spend freely.The layman, however, keeps the 100-rupee notes for the paan shop, for buying milk, for paying tuitions, for kids. Binod Shaw, a vendor selling paan and cigarettes on S N Banerjee Road said: ""I have placed orders of Rs 2200 today to suppliers all in 100-rupee notes."" A medical store nearby has no dearth of 100-rupee notes. ""We are getting 100-rupee notes from customers though the flow is less than usual,"" the man on the counter said.""I feel that Modi government could have given some time, for instance a month. A person having black money can offload it by buying gold or a property. But then the money goes to someone else. It remains in the system. Few have been able to stash the money somewhere outside the country. The one-month time would have at least saved the common man from the trouble imposed on him,"" says Roy Chowdhury."
590a00767be9e033b96ea0f4,Demonetisation: How the cash crisis can be used to tame rural commercial capital,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-how-the-cash-crisis-can-be-used-to-tame-rural-commercial-capital-4379593/,2016-11-17,"The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts. The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts.In her insightful study of the working of agricultural markets in West Bengal, British development studies scholar Barbara Harris-White has documented in detail how trade in farm produce is controlled through a web of rural and semi-urban agro commercial enterprises.These enterprises  whom she broadly categorises as rural commercial capital  enjoy privileged access to formal credit networks. The monies borrowed from banks and other financial institutions they use for on-lending to farmers against future deliveries of produce. They also control the functioning of agriculture produce market committees  which oversee the operations of regulated mandis  through cornering of trading licenses and restricting new entrants. Further, they ensure all official procurement of wheat and rice undertaken by the Food Corporation of India and state government agencies is channelised through them, thereby guaranteeing both assured business and almost complete elimination of market risk. Through these economic means, apart from ability to court political patronage, rural commercial capital has managed to squeeze out all potential competition in agricultural produce markets, including from petty traders who can never achieve the same size and volume.Watch What Else is Making NewsWhile Harris-Whites work, based on field studies stretching over a decade, has focused on West Bengal, its findings characterise the behaviour of rural commercial capital in other parts of the country as well. Moreover, they continue to hold good even a decade after being published in the form of a book (Rural Commercial Capital: Agricultural Markets in West Bengal, Oxford University Press 2008). Only around 60 per cent of farm households in India today have access to institutional finance. Even among this 60 per cent, a majority has to supplement bank loans with borrowings from moneylenders and other informal sources. The numbers are worse for small and marginal farmers, where barely 15 per cent can even obtain loans from banks, leaving them almost entirely at the mercy of rural commercial capital.Moreover  and this is important  practically 100 per cent of transactions between farmers and rural commercial capital are conducted in cash. The surpluses, which the latter generates in the form of interest on advances and profits on trading of produce, are also retained in cash for further recycling. Needless to add, most of this income is outside the tax net. The resultant liquidity also provides the basis for the enormous reach and power that rural commercial capital enjoys.The above source of power is what has also today become the cause of its nightmare, following the Narendra Modi governments decision to de-monetise high-denomination currency notes. In one fell swoop, the move has left rural commercial capital exposed and vulnerable. While this entrenched lobby has endured many policy shocks in the past, whether it would survive this blow, however, remains to be seen.As of now, the de-monetisation decision has had three broad impacts in agricultural markets across the country. The first is a drastic fall in mandi arrivals. Farmers, having just finished harvesting their first decent crop in over two years, are facing traders who are asking them to postpone deliveries. Even when they are willing to supply on credit and settling payments later  following an old tradition of trust and faith  traders are unwilling to hold inventories in an atmosphere of uncertainty. There is genuine fear today that the Modi government will follow up on its agenda of unearthing black money through a further tightening of the noose. Old timers say that such fear wasnt experienced by the trading community even during the Emergency  which says a lot.Secondly, cash lending has suddenly dried up, which is proving to be more troublesome for farmers than even postponed sales of produce. The reason for it is that the rabi season sowing operations have just commenced. This is the time when all sorts of expenses on seed, fertiliser, labour, etc. have to be incurred. Replacement of the de-monetised currency with new notes would be much slower in the hinterlands than in urban centres. As a result, banks cannot disburse cash loans for seasonal agricultural operations under the Kisan Credit Card window. And with the enormous cash hoards with rural commercial capital ceasing to be legal tender, there is no finance available to farmers even from this informal ATM (any time money) source.Thirdly, even if farmers are in a position to deliver produce in some mandis, further transportation of it has all but come to a halt. The fragmented nature of Indias transport networks means that most trucks, especially medium and small loaders ferrying fresh produce, are individually owned. They again deal exclusively in cash and are simply unwilling now to transport produce in the absence of access to working capital, whether from institutions or the trade. The result is a severe disruption of daily fruits and vegetables produce flows to major markets like Azadpur in Delhi and Vashi in Mumbai.Even as rural commercial capital copes with perhaps its worst existential crisis in recent memory, the current situation offers a unique opportunity for at least cleaning up the countrys agricultural credit market and linking millions of its farm households to institutional finance. The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts. By enabling assessment of the credit requirements of each holding, it will allow the eligible loan amounts to be transferred directly to the account holders. The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development could probably lead the way here. It should launch a mission to universalise access to farm loans, by focusing particularly on smallholders who are the most deprived of this facility.While all this may not be possible immediately and requires careful planning for proper execution, the target should be to go for a full roll-out during the next kharif season. This step can go a long away in breaking the stranglehold of rural commercial capital, which has thrived by tethering farmers to a vicious cycle of tied credit and captive marketing of their produce. It would also put Indias agriculture economy on the path of sustainable growth and prosperity.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: File Photo) BJP seems to take all its vote from West Bengal districts. (Source: File Photo)THE COLOUR is changing in Dhenua, a village in Bardhaman district, West Bengals rice bowl. As acres of green paddy slowly ripens to gold with the onset of winter, the political mood, having changed from red to green in May this year, is slowly tilting towards saffron, it appears. Dhenua, along with more than 150 villages, will go to the polls on Saturday in Monteswar assembly constituency, necessitated by the death of the local MLA, Trinamool Congresss Sajal Panja.Dhenua, now with 4,600 voters, has been unwaveringly loyal to the CPI(M) for over 40 years. Even when the Red Bastion that was Bardhaman started turning green with rapid inroads by the TMC, and Mamata Banerjee swept the district in 2011, Dhenua stood ground. When Monteswar finally fell in May 2016, after a fierce battle, Dhenua remained unbending, having thrown its weight behind three-time CPI(M) MLA Chaudhry Mohammad Hidaitullah, who lost to Panja by 706 votes.But thats changing.Watch what else is making newsWe have been hearing about the Prime Ministers plans to curtail black money, and to bring it back. We are happy. We dont care whether we directly benefit from this  we are just happy that moneylenders who have been oppressing us for years, and have been stashing cash, may finally be served justice, said Shanti Majhi, 50. This is our revenge  we are very happy that they (moneylenders) will now be very unhappy.Monteswor has a Muslim population of 43 per cent  there are 900 Muslim votes in Dhenua alone  but that is hardly bothering Biswajeet Poddar, 42, the BJP candidate. This vote will be split between CPI(M) and TMC. We dont expect to change the government with just one or two elections. But people are increasingly turning towards us. With the scrapping of notes, the votes are now ours, he said. Voters have been coming up to me and saying that I dont need to campaign; that they will vote for the BJP because of Narendra Modi, because of what he has done.About the issue of demonetisation, Poddar said, No one is against the decision in this constituency. Many shopkeepers are still accepting Rs 500 notes. There is no problem. Local TMC supporters said that the by-election is of huge significance to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee: it is the first election since the Supreme Courts Singur verdict went in her favour, the first since TMC was registered as a national party, and the first since the demonetisation decision that Mamata has hit out against, seeking its revocation.The by-election is seen by many as a precursor to the state panchayat polls in 2018, and the 2019 General Election.We are facing off with the Trinamool but in my mind the greater rival for us in both the state and the country is the BJP. They have polarised the country in way that we thought was not possible, said former CPI(M) MLA Chaudhry Mohammad Hidaitullah, managing the partys campaign for the bypolls.On the eve of the bypolls, the lines outside banks remained long almost through the day, and ATMs had signs of No Cash, but workers of all three main parties maintained that the inconveniences have not reached alarming proportions. Demonitisation has not affected anyone in this village. How can it? We never used Rs 500 or Rs 1000 notes anyway.

The challenge before the party was to rally all secular sections and to ensure that the faithful did not get swayed by either of the arguments, he pointed out.More youth, womenMr. Balakrishnan said the party leadership wanted greater number of youth and women to come into its fold. The target is to ensure that by the time the party goes in for the next State conference, at least 30 per cent of the members should be aged below 30 years and that women constitute at least 25 per cent of the members.In Kannur and Kasaragod, the target would be to have 30 per cent women membership. Simultaneously, efforts would also be made to strengthen the class and mass organisations associated with the party.All party district committees would meet for two days in January to work out the details of the proposal, the CPI(M) State secretary said.Mr. Balakrishnan said the CPI(M) and LDF would be ready to join hands with anyone in the fight to save the cooperative sector, which had landed in a crisis following demonetisation. This stand of the CPI(M) would be communicated to the all-party meeting being convened by the government and, in case, there was objection to the proposal, the party and LDF would go it alone with their fight.The party State committee, he said, had also resolved to ask the government to approach the Centre to get sufficient rice to be distributed to non-priority category cardholders at least at Rs.8 a kg.State unit plans an exercise to weed out persons who are not sufficiently active in party work."

He alleges because of demonetisation he could not pay wages to labour.WATCH VIDEO: Shivraj Singh Slams Mamata For Criticising Demonetisation PolicyA bhag chashi or landless farmer, Nandi used to farm onions on one acre that belonged to his landlord. A Santhali tribal, Nandi lived with his family in remote Rahatpur village of Bardhaman district.Villagers said Nandi had been anxious about being unable to pay the labour he had hired to till the field he had rented. He had around Rs 20,000 in an account in the local Samavay Krishi Unnayan Samiti or SKUS. These Samitis are local branches of cooperative banks.He was always very sensitive. His labourers had been taunting him for days. Short of money himself, Nandi couldnt take the abuse anymore, said a villager.Since most famers do not have bank accounts, they deposit their savings in these SUKS branches. Nandi had a certain amount in SKUS but after the directive that no money transactions will take place in cooperative banks, Nandis money was stuck, said Swapan Debnath, who visited the Nandi home in the evening.Nandi is survived by his wife Sundari and son Nirmal. Sundari and their son had gone to another landlords field to work as hired help, leaving Nandi alone at home. When Nirmal, 24, and his mother came back from work they found him hanging from a tree in a corner of their courtyard.He owed his labour team Rs 3,000, said Debnath. Its the farmers who have been hit the most. Nandi was just one such case. Because of this government directive, their cash is stuck and this is harvesting season. Most farmers withdraw their cash in this season and deposit it back after selling their product, before the next season of sowing, Debnath said.Forget the farmers. We have had byelections in Monteswar assembly constituency in Bardhaman and we havent been able to pay party workers. One day we all just survived on puffed rice and tea because we didnt have the notes to buy proper food.

Parshuram has wound up his work for the day. A worker at the site of an mid-size apartment complex near Clive Battery, he discusses with his colleagues the impact of the demonetisation on workers like them.We talk only about this and live in the hope that notes of all denominations will be available at the earliest. We cannot even take a break and return home for a few days, says Mr. Parshuram, who hails from West Bengal. In his mid 40s, he has to support his family that includes his mother, his wife and their two children. We are not getting our full wages. We are able to manage here, but my family is not in a comfortable situation at the moment, he says, but adds that the site supervisor has arranged for over a weeks provisions for more than a dozen workers employed in the site.The non-availability of cash is hurting workers. It is hurting individuals who are constructing independent homes the most. In large projects, builders can mobilise resources but individuals neither have the cash or the support system to do that. Many workers are returning to their native places, promising to come back after a month, said a promoter of budget home projects.Contractors and supervisors who do not have multiple accounts can withdraw only limited amounts of cash and they give only half the workers wages, spending the rest on buying rice and vegetables for them. Most workers who hail from outside Tamil Nadu do not have bank accounts and there is no point in giving them Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, says N. Chidambaresh, president of the Chennai Civil Engineers Association.Wages for construction workers from Tamil Nadu vary between Rs. 500 per day for a helper and Rs. 700 for a mason, while it is between Rs. 400 and Rs. 650 for workers from other States. We are unable to pay the full wages, but we have assured them that they will be taken care of until the situation stabilises, he adds.Builders of bigger projects  special buildings (apartments less than four floors) and multi-storey buildings (over four floors)  say that supervisors are having a tough time distributing wages to the workers. The companies claim they do not have sufficient cash to disburse the entire weeks wages to all of them. Many workers who have managed to save cash have taken a holiday to go to their native villages, but this has not resulted in mass absenteeism and hence construction work has not been affected. The workers would come back the moment the situation eases, they say."

Bengal is the biggest paddy-producing state in the country.The government is still undecided on holding 330 procurement camps at different blocks for the Rabi season. ""Demonetisation has dealt a body blow to the state's agrarian economy . If this uncertainty continues, there will be disaster,"" said state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick . He has convened an emergency meeting on November 26 to decide whether the camps should be cancelled.Agriculture experts say if the situation persists, there will be an unnatural price jump with supply going haywire. According to agriculture department sources, the state has recorded a bumper crop of 1.75 crore tonne paddy this year, but much of this is yet to be reaped. With no cash in hand, around 80% of the farmers have not been able to engage labourers for harvesting. Within a few days, the seeds will drop from the shrubs and it will become extremely difficult to retrieve them, explained an officer from the agriculture department.Ironically, the bumper production had earlier led the food department to upwardly revise its paddy procurement target to 52 lakh tonne in 2016-17 from last year's 40 lakh tonne.""The situation is very grave. Over 80% of the paddy has not been reaped. The liquidity crunch has become severe because of the complete collapse of co-operative banks,"" said agriculture minister Purnendu Bose.Given the situation, it would be futile to hold the procurement camps, the food minister said. ""Each camp runs up a cost of Rs 4,500 per day. The total cost for the first round of procurement runs into Rs 12 crore. If paddy cannot reach the camps, the entire exercise will be futile,"" he said.In Burdwan, the rice bowl of Bengal and the highest paddy-producing district of India, paddy has not been harvested in 60% of the land. ""In Burdwan, 4.20 lakh hectare is devoted to paddy cultivation. But harvesting is very low this year,"" said Burdwan district magistrate Soumitra Mohan.This year, the state has fixed the minimum support price of paddy at Rs 1,470 per quintal (1tonne = 10 quintal). Besides, it is also offering farmers Rs 20 per quintal as encouragement grant. The government is also maintaining transparency by transferring funds through the RTGS system directly to the farmers' bank accounts."

And in all of this stood Fidel Castro as the icon of defiance in the post-Soviet world. For those in Kolkata who have been walking the streets since the ""Tomar nam amar nam Vietnam"" days, Fidel was the last ray of hope in this apparently TINA (there is no alternative) age, who could make people dream about what socialism could be. Castro's connect to Kolkata has been strong since the days of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), when he first touched down at the Kolkata airport in 1973. Later, his slogan  'Socialism or death'  became a popular graffiti in the city.Shyamal Chakrabarty, a fierbrand student leader of the Sixties, fondly recollects how youths in Kolkata rushed to the airport though they couldn't see the leader on transit. ""We couldn't reach up to him. They allowed only Jyoti Basu to meet him,"" Chakrbarty said. Later, though, he caught a glimpse of the leader in Havana. ""We had gone to attend the Youth Conference in Havana. Some of us had scampered out to see the park nearby. It was a soggy afternoon and the park had turned muddy. I and some of the delegate friends, including Somen Mitra (later Pradesh Congress president), could hear an uproar at the conference site. Youths were running after a jeep. We too started running through the park before even giving it a thought. The run took us in front of the jeep, in which we could see Fidel. He waved at us smilingly and left the spot. I still cherish the surprise meeting with the towering personality,"" Chakrabarty said from the Citu all India conference venue at Puri.The romanticism and the unalloyed passion later boiled down to a critical support among the Left youths since the late Eighties. Instead, students in elite institutes started comparing Cuba's performance in the social sector  public health and literacy  with that of India before going all the way for the socialist country. Some also questioned the manner in which Fidel ran his government because by then democracy in socialism had already come under question.What's more, a book  'Fidel and Religion'  published during this time gave a jerk to the usual Left view towards religion. While atheism had become a fad among students in those days, Fidel, in this book based on a long conversation with a Brazilian Catholic priest Frei Betto, held that some Christian values that he imbibed while in school helped him a lot in his future. In a public speech in 1998, Fidel said: ""I feel a great respect for all religions. The Christian religion was the one I best knew, for I spent 12 years  as some of you probably did too  as a boarding student in religious Catholic schools... Those schools were more like a convent than a school because that was a type of life we led for which I am even glad today because it taught me discipline, stoicism, spirit of sacrifice, many positive things. In our culture, as a part of the so called western world, there are undoubtedly components of Christian values. I think that among those values there are ethical humane principles that are applicable to my epoch.""Those who are now in their late forties came to know about Cuba closely when they were in the city universities. Cuba was passing through rough weather due to the blockade. Student-youth groups from the country came down to campuses to talk about their sorry plight. They appealed for support from the Left Front government as well. This became a talking point in Left student organisations against US imperialism. Jyoti Basu, the then chief minister, took the initiative to ship rice and wheat to the people of Cuba, despite criticisms from the opposition. And Fidel responded with his 'socialism or death' slogan, sending out the message that he is not going to buckle under pressure. Later, Basu went to Havana to meet Castro.With Fidel's passing away, the dream is gone."

The drive was for mobilising food and medicine for Cuba, the tiny neighbour of the United States, which was being strangulated by western countries using economic sanctions.The fall of USSR in 1991 almost orphaned Cuba and world over communist movements launched campaigns to save Cuban citizens who had been fighting all odds to ensure the triumph of socialism. By December 1992, the Indian communists sent 10,000 tonnes each of wheat and rice in a ship `Caribbean Princess' that departed from Haldia in Kolkata. Senior leaders of CPM Harkishan Singh Surjeet and M A Baby flew to Havana to personally hand over the shipment to Fidel Castro . They were accorded a warm welcome followed by a near 3-hour conversation with Castro.The communist parties in India were initially reluctant to accept the identity of Cuba.In fact, Jawaharlal Nehru accepted Castro much before the communist movements. ""The guerrilla warfare used by Castro and Che Guevara was not acceptable to Indian communists. They didn't approve the path"", said RMP leader K S Hariharan. ""By 70's their attitude began to change and Cuban solidarity movement became active in the state"", he said.It was the collapse of Soviet Union that reinforced the love of Indian communists for Cuba.""The role played by Cuba in busting the myth that `socialism is an outdated concept' during post-USSR days is significant. By sticking on to Marxist-Leninist principles, Cuba reinforced the idea of socialism and socialism alone"", recalled chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Matching Scandinavia in health and education was a target of both Cuba and Kerala.When the V S Achuthanandan government took over in 2006, health minister P K Sreemathy was sent to Cuba to study their model of health care. ""The free treatment for all was an unparalleled concept. They were practically unaware of vector-borne diseases as cleanliness was paramount in society. The concept of family doctor was one that attracted me most"", Sreemathy told TOI.After the visit, Sreemathy went on to implement Cuban model healthcare in the state and even appointed a family doctor at Vattiyoorkavu as a pilot project.Recently , Castro unknowingly played a major role in dousing factional fire in Kerala CPM.After the election, when there was the big question of who will lead the government, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury suggested Pinarayi Vijayan's name but not before designating V S Achuthanandan as `Kerala Castro', a title that VS could well regard as a coveted honour."

Equally no one has been left with any doubt as to the fact that the policy originates with the Prime Minister, and that they are being asked to bear with short-term inconvenience in order to advance the longer-term national interest.Reams of newsprint have been devoted to the economics of demonetisation. Here I take stock of the questions raised by demonetisation for the direction of Centre-State relations.Unmediated by the StatesAs a policy initiative of the Central government, demonetisation is unique in recent times for reaching everyone in the country directly, unmediated by the filter of State governments. State governments do not appear to have been consulted ahead of the announcement, and in many cases demonetisation has directly undermined the routine administration of policies under their purview. Many have expressed frustration that they are powerless to address hardships faced by people unable to pay for treatment in private hospitals or of farmers unable to access loans from, or make repayments at, cooperative banks.Unsurprisingly, a number of States have complained that the way in which the policy was enacted violates the spirit of cooperative federalism about which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken so often.Furthermore, the design of the new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India include new national symbols that challenge regional sensibilities. For the first time, the new banknotes include Devanagari numerals, threatening to reignite old settled compromises over the national language within Indias federal union. The use of Devanagari numerals is already the subject of a PIL in the Madras High Court.The back-side of the new banknotes also carry the logo of the Union government policy, Swachh Bharat.All of this is in line with broader attempts to refocus political debates around national questions since 2014. Mr. Modi has consistently called for the strengthening of cooperative federalism, recognising that he is reliant on the cooperation of State governments to achieve national policy goals.A matter of identificationFor decades as Indias polity and economy became more decentralised and the States became the centre-ground of political life, they have been the primary level of political identity for most voters.In a situation where voters found it difficult to correctly identify which level of government was responsible for any given policy and chains of electoral accountability became quite opaque, State governments became adept at claiming the credit for Central government initiatives. Voters frequently give the credit for programmes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) or the National Rural Health Mission to their State governments rather than to the Central government.In the post-poll National Election Study conducted by Lokniti, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) during the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 42 per cent of voters who had benefited from MGNREGA gave the credit for the programme to their State government and only 27 per cent to the Central government. This looks vastly different to the situation in Brazils federal setting, for instance, where over 80 per cent of voters in 2010 attributed the countrys flagship social programme, Bolsa Familia, to the President.Mr. Modis election victory in 2014 challenged, although it has not displaced, the idea that the States serve as the primary unit of political affiliation. It was an election campaign that had a more national character and Mr. Modis candidacy and populist leadership style extended the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to farther-flung parts of the country.Once in office, Brand Modi has involved the projection of the Prime Ministers presence and authority across areas of government activity. Programmes have been carefully rebranded in an effort to better enable the Central government to claim credit for them and to limit the ability of the States to do so.Mamata Banerjees challengeStates have had different reactions to this. The most outspoken critic of Mr. Modis style of government at a regional level has been West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation. Just a day earlier she had raised objections to the fact that the Central government now makes MGNREGA payments directly into workers bank accounts. She has also railed against the naming of Central programmes after the Prime Minister, for which State governments are required to provide matched funding.In August, her counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, explained that his State was right to drag its heels over the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme). He called for the scheme to be renamed the PM-CM farmer insurance scheme, or  Kendra-Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana ( Centre-State Crop Insurance Scheme) if the States were expected to bear half the financial burden.Last month, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav distributed ration cards along with bags of wheat and rice  under the National Food Security Act  that carried pictures of him. The BJPs State spokesperson complained bitterly that the State government was playing politics by trying to claim credit for a policy of the Central government.There has not, however, so far been a resounding critique of the Modi governments version of cooperative federalism from most States. Demonetisation itself has been welcomed by Chief Ministers of both BJP and non-BJP ruled States alike, including Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha and Telangana, although some have criticised elements of its execution and potential to hit State revenues.For those critical of the centralising instincts of the Modi government, demonetisation presents an opportunity to refocus debates on Centre-State relations. Yet at the moment, many regional parties seem more intent on continuing a pattern of Centre-region bargaining rather than building new cross-State alliances that would act as a counterweight to the Central government.Even in the absence of a coordinated inter-State opposition alliance, for the Central government there is the risk that the centralisation of credit claiming for government policies could start to reduce the political incentives of opposition-ruled States to cooperate with the Central government in achieving national goals or implementing Centrally designed policies. This matters since State governments remain crucial for policy implementation. It is even more significant after the enhanced fiscal devolution to States following the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which gives States greater flexibility to decide priorities for government expenditure.A deeper debate neededThe time is right to engage in a deeper debate about Centre-State relations and the operation of federalism. There are major constitutional innovations in the offing such as the GST Council, designed to realise a more cooperative model of federalism in which the Central government and the States pool their sovereignty in order to pursue national economic goals. The counterpart to this platform of cooperation should be a deeper discussion about Centre-State relations and a focus on enhancing the incentives for States to cooperate with the Centre while preserving their autonomy.Louise Tillin is Senior Lecturer in Politics at the Kings India Institute, Kings College, London.An outspoken critic at a regional level has been Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation"

However, the Civil Supplies authorities said that 60 per cent of the purchases are through and are expect the remaining to be bought within the next few days.We are not purchasing fine variety of paddy for which quintal rate was fixed at Rs.1,800. So far, through the paddy purchase centres, 1.40 lakh tonnes were bought and another 60,000 metric tonnes are expected to arrive from farmers, said Krishna Prasad, District Civil Supplies Officer.Mr. Prasad said that Rs.1,510 was fixed for Grade-A variety and Rs.1,470 for Grade-B (common) variety.Since the rate is below the expectations of farmers, many of them kept the produce, waiting for the remunerative price. Those who are in urgent need of money are selling the produce at different rates and traders are taking advantage of it.Joint Collector A. Ravinder Reddy said that the Civil Supplies Corporation has not taken any decision yet on purchase of BPT paddy.Meanwhile, Civil Supplies Corporation chairman Peddi Sudarshan Reddy will be visiting Kamareddy and Nizamabad on Tuesday to hold talks with rice millers on the BPT purchases for supply to the social welfare hostels and fair price shops, he said.He said that there is a huge gap between the demand of gunny bags and the supply. Out of the 75 lakh bags required for packing paddy, only 35 lakh are available, and an indent was put to the Jute Corporation in Kolkata.We are trying to bring them from other districts like Nalgonda. Following which, everyday, two to three lakh bags are being transported, said the Joint Collector.Akula Manik, a farmer of Hunsa village in Bodhan mandal, says that he harvested BPT paddy some 40 days ago and is unable to find buyers. Millers are not willing to pay the remunerative price fixed at Rs.1,800 per quintal, he adds."

By November 25, 55% of paddy is harvested, but only 22% Kharif paddy has been reaped so far. The government is thinking of diverting 100-day job labourers to fields for reaping the crop.Bengal's food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Tuesday said: "" After the paddy is procured, it will go to rice mills . Each entry at rice mill will generate three challans, one of which comes straight to food department in Kolkata. Immediately , the fund will be transferred to the bank account of the farmer through RTGS system. The entire procure ment will be monitored at multiple levels so no corruption creeps in.""He added: ""We have Rs 5,000 crore with the department for procurement. Moreover, we are taking a loan of Rs 1,000 crore from the West Bengal Finance Development Corporation. Besides, the Centre is supposed to give us Rs 2,008 crore this year and Rs 481 crore against last year's due.The state has set the minimum support price of Rs 1,490 per quintal (.1 tonne). It has also set a procurement target of 52 lakh tonne paddy which will yield 41.20 lakh tonne rice. The state's requirement out of the procurement is 32 lakh tonne. Six lakh tonne of rice will be sold to Jharkhand. Rest of the rice will be given to state food safety pool and central food safety pool.The food minister also alerted against a fake job racket in the name of paddy procurement. The racket is playing havoc with the youths in rural Bengal. They are duping job-seekers and charging thousands of rupees in the name of recruitment of civic volunteers by the food department. ""We cannot recruit civic volunteers. Civic volunteers are there with the police department. In case of procurement, the civic volunteers will be roped in from the respective superintendent of police of the district. They floated fake websites and I have ordered inquiry by CID,"" said Mullick.Potato clearance deadline extendedThe Bengal government has extended the deadline for clearing potato stock from cold storage by eight more days.Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta on Tuesday said, ""We have asked all the stakeholders in the potato business to clear the stock immediately. The government will not allow any off-take of potato after December 8. There is 8 lakh tonne of potato stock lying in 480 cold storages in Bengal."

Archive photo Tea plantation workers tend to a garden. Archive photoA state minister has claimed that continued delay in wage payments to tea plantation workers in North Bengal could lead to starvation.Speaking at a series of agitations that the TMC held in the region on Tuesday, north Bengal development minister Goutam Deb said, Since most dont have bank accounts, they will face problems in withdrawing wages from banks. The nearest banks are located around 10-15 km away. They will lose a days wages if they go to banks to withdraw their cash. These poor people have no alternative source of income and ultimately it will lead to starvation of the tea workers, he said.WATCH VIDEO: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjees Flight Reportedly Had Low Fuel: Heres What HappenedThe spectre of starvation has been a constant companion for tea garden workers in north Bengal, which, according to some reports, recorded 1,200 hunger deaths after tea estates began shutting shop from 2002 to 2007  a claim contested by the TMC government.Officials admitted that the continuing cash crisis could have devastating consequences for the vulnerable tea estate workers.Deb added, We are trying to tackle the situation through the Food Security Act. We will talk to the administration whether rations can be arranged on credit for tea workers and likewise.We are poor people, said Mithun Lohan, a tea garden worker at Dhumchipara. I dont think the government realises how poor we are. We get rice at Rs 2 per kg from the state. But even then it is difficult for us to ensure that weve enough money to buy food for our family. If we miss a days work to go to an ATM or a bank that means a loss of Rs 120 for me. I cant afford that. Following demonetisation, the RBI has asked tea plantations to open bank accounts for workers.Salaries have always been paid in cash in tea gardens. But on Sunday, banks set up camps at tea gardens and saw hundreds of bank accounts being opened in the first few days. But like Amita Tanti, another worker, explained there were reasons why many had consciously avoided banks.We know our money will be safer in a bank. But there are no ATMs here. We have to spend on travelling at least 10 kms to go to the nearest bank that works. Our problem wasnt that we were getting paid in cash. But that tea gardens, without warning, would shut and not pay wages, she said.Last year, reports of deaths of tea garden workers due to starvation rocked the government, prompting CM Mamata Banerjee to announce relief packages despite her government contesting the claim.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The herd has been damaging acres of standing paddy and orchards in two range areas.DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said a herd of 45 elephants from neighbouring West Bengal had sneaked into Rasgobindpur range though Badsul forest area as part of their annual sojourn. The elephant herd has already crossed Rasgobindpur range and at present they are roaming in Ashanbani forest under Betnoti range. Another herd of about 20 elephants may have moved towards Raibania forest area under Jaleswar range of Balasore district, the DFO said.The herd moves into the forest during day time and returns at night. The forest officials are keeping a close watch on their movement. A team of 120 trained staff, including elephant experiment squads and forest guards, have been engaged to drive them away. A couple of hired horses has been deployed as horse excreta keeps the elephants away. The neigh, smell of stool and urine of male horses irritate elephants, Swain said.Though no human casualty has been reported so far, the herd has damaged standing paddy crops in several acres.We have warned the locals not to chase the elephants as they may turn violent if they are irritated by fire crackers and pelting of stones. They have also been asked not to stock any intoxicating substance like rice beer and mahuli, Swain added.A 24-hour control room has been opened at Baripada forest divisional office and an Assistant Conservator of Forest has been engaged to monitor the movement of wild elephants and collect information from staff and locals, the DFO said, adding that the movement of the elephants herd is now towards Kuldhia wildlife sanctuary of Balasore district."

Most of the artisans in this Maoist hit block make bamboo products for a living and now, these families are neither able to buy raw materials nor sell their finished products in the wholesale market. Denomination of Rs 2,000 currency poses a new challenge for them as it is too big an amount for their petty needs.Mohan Mohali, a resident of the village , told TOI that he along with his three family members manage to earn Rs 6,000 a month but since note ban, the earning has stopped . ""It is a big blow to our livelihood and none of the local leaders, politicians or government authorities have taken pains to see our condition. Now a days boiled rice is our breakfast, lunch and dinner as there is no loose change to buy pulses or vegetables,"" said Mohali.Aasandabur village which is a part of Ojhadih Katania panchayat has nearly 45 houses and apart from one person who has passed Class X, the rest are uneducated and only depend on bamboo-weaving business . Chhatabad, the village adjacent to Aasandabur, has 40 minority families earning their living by making wooden rolling pins and cots and is in a similar plight. ""We usually sell our products in the wholesale market or take our product to Bihar and sell door-to-door. Loose currency is required at every step right from bus fare to daily food expenses. As we belong to a Maoist dominated area, the traders refuse to give us raw materials on loan,"" said Salim Kazi, an artisan who makes rolling pins.Another village of the same panchayat, Rajak Tola, is a hub of broom manufacturers . This village sells brooms across the state and in a few districts of Bihar and West Bengal. Their business has also taken a hit due to the shortage of cash.Tundi block pramukh Kamla Murmu, while speaking to TOI, said that absence of Rs 500 notes is the main hurdle for the artisans. She added that the grievances would be voiced at the zila parishad meet soon. Murmu also said that most of the villagers do not have bank accounts and the usage of plastic money and other alternatives are out of the question as people here are not educated.DC A Dodde said that immediate steps would be taken to help out the poor. He added a team of bankers and district authorities would be sent on Sunday to take stock of the situation and address the grievances."

Thinking back on exhibitions in the country and elsewhere- 10 images that remain in the memory of Indian art.1) Subodh Guptas Kerala Hut at Invisible Realities the Hauser & Wirth Somerset show Reassembled out of wood and terracotta tiles here was a work that was over-illuminated by stark LED lights radiating from within, probing one to speculate on the impenetrable contents of the house. The phosphorescent spill animated the structure, permanently altering its purpose as a residential site and challenging the boundary between the interior and the exterior.2) Modern Master Sayed Haider Raza-When modern master Sayed Haider Raza passed away on July 23rd 2016. This modern master strove to seek a balance of atmospherics: through his colour fields-from his dense tempestuous dappled midnight blue night skies he had embarked on highly keyed blues,crimsons and yellows to give us his rippled concentric Bindus. His journey in the world of abstraction was the epitome of the Bindu gradually coalescing into the Indian idiom of germination and the soul floating freely in a realized landscape.3) Jayashree Chakravarty -Indias quasi abstractionist Jayashree Chakravartys show at Akar Prakar Kolkata was the testimony of a show that had an ecological echo. Her works stood apart for their ability to evolve constantly- thus her easily identifiable works- have a distinct periodic uniqueness. Her use of brush, palette knife, fingers and imprint of what is popularly known as the bubble wrap for desired effect though has not much changed, yet the effect varies from canvas to canvas .Textures and illusions abounded in her works that looked at the requiem of a river-Kuchini. Her felicity with an exciting variety of media like rice paper, tissue and cellophane added to the richness of intent.4) Jamini Roy drawings at Dhoomimal From the Uma and Ravi Jain Estate, it was the set of drawings taken out of a folder weathered and brown that added to the ingenuity and vintage vitality of Indias great master Jamini Roy.The lines lithe and lean and languid celebrated the power of the contour and the discipline that darwings suggest.It brought back the beauty of observation and the passion for everyday sketches.5) Kounteya Sinhas Kolkata at Mother Teresas CanonisationKounteya Sinha made history by taking his Kolkata photographs and standing on streets in Italy and showing and sharing the beauty of Mother Teresas city that made her the Saint. Among colour and black and whites, it was the gravestone of yesteryear with cow dung cakes that spoke of the equivocal tone of history and the co-existence of religions as you saw a stunning image that froze the past and present into a single echo of yesterday once more.6) KG Subramanyan  Manida, as the mentor, muralist, painter, poet and scholar was called passed away on June 29th, 2016 this year and Aakriti gallerys tribute had a host of works that reflected his passion and idea of multiple imageries and myriad moorings in creating narratives that straddled many traditions and historic gleanings. While 300 works graced the walls it was the paper works that fascinated and reflected the fervor and fetish of a revered mentor.7) A. Ramachandran (Vadehras Delhi Rural poems in a pot)  Watercolours and drawings that were washed with snow. The 24 works in Vadehras once again boasted of the beauty of botanics and the realms of rural rhythms that were created with the grace of anatomical perfection. In America, with the snow falling outside his window A.Ramachandran dreamt of Rajasthani belles who sat in conversation amidst the ripple of leaves and buzzing of insects.8) Velu Vishwanadhan  At Delhis Nature Morte Abstract master Velu Vishwanadhans wine toned canvasses spoke of the ripple of mantras and the beauty of resonant rituals in the framework of Bhagvati poojas and sound of bhajnams and flamed Theyyam dances. In its maze-like rooms at Nature Morte Vishwanadhans works were a lesson in abstraction and the journey that traverses so many different idioms and metaphors of multiple manifestations.9) Hema Upadhyay At the international show Megacities was the late Hema Upadhyays works. Exhibited in 2011 at Centre Pompidou Upadhyays 2009 work 8ft x12ft was the piece de resistance of the show. We saw the conflict between regionalization and urbanization, modern values and traditional values, as well as negotiation of the current financial crisis.She portrays a small room created with aluminium sheets, car scrap, enamel paint, plastic sheets, found objects, M-seal, resin and Hardware material. In an interview, she is known to have said:  So much chaos in my work actually came from the city. When I work in my studio in Mumbai, there are lots of elements, of decay, of life, of chaos. Its a double-edged condition when you see development in the making  you see growth but decay, you see modern skyscrapers but the mushrooming of slums, etc. It is the dichotomy which existed within us and outside us as well. Here, it seems to be no chaos but an internal chaos is there in the forest. A construction and deconstruction cycle is taking place. As an artist, I am constantly confronted with the idea of creativity, of how the natural elements or conditions affect the manufactured work.10) Thomas Henriots Pen and Ink on Japanese rice paper In Mumbai at the Nine Fish gallery was French artist Thomas Henriots works created out of pen and ink and pastels.Rivetting landscapes in black and red ink coalesced to create stunning skylines and pure landscapes that celebrated the discipline and genius of this ballet dancer turned artist who was brought to India by the Basu Foundation for Arts that does meticulous shows of famed European artists."

It is also true that we remain inactive during those nine days and, at the end of it, make offerings to our ancestors so that we are all safe, says the 70-year-old at his home in Sakhuapani, a village 500 metres from the Hindalco Groups Gurdari bauxite mine in Gumla district of Jharkhand.WATCH VIDEO: The Earliest Known Ramleela In Chitrakoot Preserved In Its Original FormOn February 24, after reading from a pamphlet purportedly distributed in Jawaharlal Nehru University, which, the minister said, had depicted Durga in poor light and Mahishasur as the victim, Irani had said, What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it.As he speaks about his traditions and way of life, Chamru is almost passive  not apologetic, not defensive, not angry, not seeking answers.Chamru is an Asur, a particularly vulnerable tribal group that dominates Sakhuapanis population of about 2,000 and lives in villages spread over a radius of 10 to 20 km. Besides Jharkhand, members of the tribe live in pockets of Bihar, West Bengal and a few other states. The 2011 Census put the number of Asurs at 22,459 in Jharkhand and 4,129 in Bihar.Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey) Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)The Asurs claim to be descendants of Mahishasur, the buffalo-demon whom Goddess Durga kills after a spirited fight lasting nine nights. Its this mythology in mainstream Hinduism thats celebrated in the form of the nine-day-long Durga Puja, but observed as Mahishasur Dasain among the Asurs, who hold a period of mourning during which they largely stay indoors.Chamru says that even when he was a child, though people had their beliefs and biases, nobody attacked them for it, they merely thought they were different. Those were the days of zamindari. The zamindar of Bishunpur (now the local police station) would ask us to get wood and collect leaves for making pattals for the puja. We would go there, give the zamindar all this and also give him some of our tools. We would then return home before the celebrations began and offer prayers seeking protection from our own ancestors, says Chamru.WATCH VIDEO: Dussehra Celebration At Red FortNow as these cultures are seen as offending, Chamru says these are just beliefs. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you. I cant tell you how our descendants settled down in this part of the country and so on, he says.***Sushma Asur, a tribal activist in Sakhuapani, says the community also celebrates Sohrai, which coincides with Diwali, by applying koronj (or karanja in Hindi) oil on their navel, chest and nose, and eat cucumber. The symbolism here is that when our ancestor Mahishasur was killed, he had blood oozing from his navel, nose and chest. Applying oil on those parts depicts the same. Eating cucumber is a symbol that we are avenging his death by eating the kaleja (liver) of the killer, Sushma explains.In her 20s, Sushma says she has studied up to Class XII and is working with tribal activists to revive our lost traditions, songs and skills. Over the years, she says, there are several of these traditions that have given way to modern practices of the outsiders.Asurs, she says, were once iron smelters, but now the village doesnt have a smelting unit. Chamru says he used to make small weapons, but I have forgotten all that now. According to one of the theories, the Magadh Empire benefited a lot from the weapons the Asurs made. Their iron does not catch rust. And we know there are many Ashokan-era edicts on iron that havent rusted, says Ashwani Kumar Pankaj, a tribal activist in Ranchi.Traditionally, Asurs dont drink cow milk. We want the calf to have all the milk and grow up strong so that it can be used in the fields, says Anil Asur, Sushmas brother. Villagers still dont drink much milk or tea, happy instead to down a glass of rice beer.***Carron tea estate in West Bengals Jalpaiguri district is hundreds of kilometres away from Jharkhands Sakhuapani village. Its here, down a hillock carpeted with emerald-green tea bushes, that Bargi Asur, 83, lives with his family. Reading a Hindi newspaper in the courtyard of his house, Bargi introduces himself as the oldest resident of Asur Line, a colony of about 100 mud and bamboo huts in the tea estate. Bargi says he isnt surprised that the minister said what she did in Parliament. She is not the first person to say our beliefs are wrong. For centuries, we have been afraid to talk about them openly. Now we carry out our rituals almost apologetically, says Bargi, whose son and grandchildren converted to Christianity a few years ago.At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta) At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Bargi himself chose not to convert because he wouldnt be able to adjust to a new way of life. My two sons and my grandchildren work as tea pickers at the estate. Thats what I have done all my life too. I couldnt give them a better life, maybe a new faith will bring some light in their lives, he says.Bargi belongs to a group of about 1,000 Asurs, who moved from Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh in the early 20th Century and work and live near the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. My father moved here in 1914 to work for a British tea planter. We have lived here ever since. Its been more than a century now, he says.Jagannath Singh, 67, a social worker who used to work as a primary school teacher at the Carron tea estate school, says the story of the Asurs is like that of most other particularly vulnerable tribal groups of the country, but with a cruel twist. Apart from abject poverty, they also have to deal with social stigma. The Asurs in Jalpaiguri were recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in 2014, after years of struggle, says Singh.He says that of the 101 Asur families living in Carron tea estate, more than 90 have converted to Christianity. They have little choice. They feel this new identity will give them a better life, he says.Yet, some find ways to keep both their new and old identities. We observe Asur puja twice a year, once during the month of Phagun (March-April) and once during Dusshera. The puja can be performed only by men, and women later participate in a traditional asura dance, says Etwari Asur, 75.Lalita Asur, 38, who works in the estate and had converted to Christianity about five years ago, says life has taught her to be careful about revealing her true identity. Why should I claim to be Mahishasurs descendant? Am I mad? she laughs. A lot of us have taken on different surnames such as Topo and Kajur, says Lalita.Over the years, the Asurs, both of Jalpaiguri and of Sakhuapani in Jharkhand, have migrated to cities in search of jobs, most youngsters dont speak the Asuri language any more and their worries are as mainstream as any other. The only thing they hold on to are memories  of stories told by their parents, of childhood fears and anxieties.Back in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand, Sushma recalls how over the years she began getting acutely aware of the fact that the asurs or demons were always depicted as ugly and were primarily painted black. All demons are dark-skinned, ugly and evil. Now, we trace our lineage to them. Tell me, do we look like anything like that? she asks.

(Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)Expert column: Struggle for survival, not of faithThe term tribal defies any universal definition. Between the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia and the Indigenous People of North America, there is a shared historical fact. They were all there before the colonial powers pushed them to margins. This is not so in the case of all tribal communities in India.Some of the Indian tribes such as the Onges and the Jarawas of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been entirely indigenous. Some others like the Banjaras in Western and Central India and the Gujjars in the Himalayas have been nomadic. And, some, such as several sub-groups of Bhills, have migrated in various historical phases to their present geographical locations. The stories of migration of such communities are found in their oral traditions. The diverse histories of tribes in India are seen among the Particularly Vulnerable Groups as well. The term primitive used for them at one time has fortunately been declared as pejorative.

Anand focussed his attention on the recovery of gunnies as they were lying stagnant with millers. It was a practice of the Civil Supplies Corporation to provide bags to millers for sending the procured paddy for custom milled rice. It was mandatory for the millers to send back the rice after milling in the same bags, they were, however, keeping the remaining bags with them and this resulted in piling up of the bags.The Civil Supplies Commissioner held discussions with the millers in this regard and directed the officials concerned to prepare detailed lists of millers from whom the bags were due.

People have lost confidence in the central government and in the banking sector. Hence, we give the call of Modi hatao desh bachao to the people of India.She also claimed that several lakhs of skilled and unskilled Bengali labourers have been rendered jobless and forced to return home due to demonetisation.Diamond artisans from Midnapore, zari (embroidery) artisans from Murshidabad and construction labourers from Coochbehar and Hooghly have returned in lakhs from places such as Mumbai, Delhi and the south. Demonetisation was responsible for unemployment of so many people. We will send an unemployment list due to demonetisation to President Pranab Mukherjee soon, she said.Mamata Banerjee also claimed that demonetisation has brought back barter system on a massive scale throughout the state.When I was young and went to my village, I saw people exchanging rice for salt, fish for onions. Modis policies have brought that once again as over 700 gram panchayats in the state are not connected with the banking system, she said, adding that prices of potato, paddy, pulses and basic consumption needs will be skyrocketed as farming has been affected by demonetisation.For the real black money holders, Modi is like a god but for the remaining 94%, he has caused a nightmare, she said."

On Christmas, every Christian household has a huge spread for lunch and this wine serves as an accompaniment. City Express spoke to a few Chennaiites who began the process of wine making at home a few months ago.Juhina Sabrina Samuel, moved to Chennai from Kolkata a couple of months ago. She brought along, her family recipe of making wine. I have been making wine for the past 15 years and I specialise in organic wine, she says. She sees to it that there is a variety in flavour when it comes to making wine. This year I have made ginger-mint wine, rice wine, blackcurrant wine and the usual grape wine, she adds.Sunish P Surendran & RomaniAgarwal/MallikaIt is customary to have a glass of wine on Christmas, Mallika Angela Chaudhuri says it is to celebrate the birth of Christ. Homemade wine is non-alcoholic.We drink not to get high because of alcohol, but the sugar in the wine gives us the sugar high which also secretes the happy hormones. The homemade wine is sweeter and not as strong as those in stores.Everyone has a different style of preparing the wine. While Juhina began the process of fermentation six month ago, Smitha Kuttayya Boppanda made it three months back. The fruits are boiled in water along with sugar and yeast is added to it. You need to wait till all the yeast dies.You will know it when you see it. That means the fermentation process is done. After that begins the actual work. You have to strain it 20-25 times, she shares.Smitha has made grape, pineapple, green apple, mango and mixed fruit wine this season. People in Chennai appreciate homemade wine. Sugar acts as a preservative in this wine and we can store it, As long as you store, the stronger it gets, she adds.At Mallikas house, her aunt and uncle make the wine. My Aunt Coleen has a special recipe. We make two varieties of wine- Strawberry-grape and Champagne-grape. The latter is my aunts recipe for which she sources yeast from Australia. It is a hit among our customers, she says.They sell the wine at their takeway restaurant Anglo Auntys Takeaway. Our customers liked it so much so that we have the wine throughout the year, she quips. At their house, the distillation process is different. We ferment the wine for three to four weeks. If we start distilling the third week, the wine is stronger and if it is in the fourth it is softer, she explains.Smitha and Juhina experiment with various flavours. Born and brought up in Coorg, Smitha was always surrounded by fruits and every fruit became wine. I have made guava, ginger and rose petal flavoured wines. But the most unique ones were paan and banana.Last year I made paan flavoured wine and it was the easiest. I just used the betel leaves and the wine was hit-the-roof strong, she smiles. With Chennai being hot throughout the year, one needs to be very careful about storing it in the right temperature. I choose the coolest room in my house to keep it going. Sometimes the weather here is damp and the chances of the wine to spoil are high, she adds.While Juhinas favourite is rice wine, Smitha picks rose. Rice wine seems very bland but as you drink it gives a burning sensation. I also like blackcurrant as I add some cinnamon to give it a rich taste, says Juhina. Mallika chooses her wine, based on the food. Wine basically cleanses your palette. I would choose the champagne to go with thick meaty food and strawberry-grape to go with red meat,she says."

Venkaiah Naidu at a programme organised in Vijayawada on the occasion of Good Governance Day. But the Congress and other parties were blind to the evidence before them and still refuse to acknowledge that the move was basically aimed at removing the disparities between the haves and have-nots, he said. People might contest the decision in courts but the reality would dawn on them sooner than later, that: Losing the hair on their heads due to Chemotherapy is better than dying of cancer. He was drawing a comparison between demonetisation, which he described as cancer, and the pain one has to endure during treatment, instead of resigning to his or her fate.House warming with a differenceWhen about 500 families checked into their new two bedroom houses constructed by the government at Erravelli and Narsannapet in Medak district last week, there was something refreshing about it.The government appointed `purohits to conduct house warming rituals at each of the houses. What is more, it supplied a pair of buffaloes and 10 fowls to 50 households. The elders of the twin villages formed into committees and invited the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to do the honours. He obliged them and turned out to be the benefactor becoming the guest.Finding new protest avenuesCome every Assembly session, particularly after the Telangana movement picked up aggressively after 2009, there used to be incidents of youth scaling either cellphone towers, poles of floodlights in Lal Bahadur stadium or the transmission tower of All India Radio, all located in the vicinity of Assembly, to register their protest and put up a demand on one issue or the other. But, registering protest in that particular way has become difficult in the last couple of years as the police have kept a tight vigil at high rise structures around the Assembly. However, it made such elements find alternative avenues!Recently, a group of DSC-2012 qualified candidates went to the terrace on the sixth floor of the Sankshema Bhavan in Masab Tank to press their demand for appointment as teachers. They locked up the door leading to the terrace and resorted to slogan shouting. The incident tested the patience of the police who finally managed to convince the protesters to come down late in the night.Saving bygunny bagsAn oft repeated quote these days is an idea can change your life. The Civil Supplies Corporation has hit upon a novel idea for saving huge amount. While much is written about the procurement of rice by the corporation, one is seldom aware of the expenditure it incurs on account of packaging the custom milled rice in gunny bags.The corporation has targeted recovery of old gunny this time around as the quantum of gunny bags lying idle with the millers is said to be close to Rs. 66 crore. Huge quantities of gunnies are said to be lying with the millers as they fail to return the excess bags lying with them every season.The corporation is also said to have taken the road route instead of rail for transporting gunnies from Kolkata as it will entail a saving of Rs. 8 crore in addition to cutting down on delays in delivery.Race for top spotEmployees in the Roads and Buildings Department are wondering at the race for top post in their organisation, that of Chief Engineers.A list of 10 probables have been prepared for the two CE posts which is now occupied by in-charge officers.Interestingly, the top-most positions, that of Engineer-in-Chief, are also filled by two in-charge officers of the rank of CE who will retire early next year.Word has it that the government plans to promote the in-charge officers in the post of CE and give them full charge.Hence, the employees are at a loss to comprehend the apparently contradictory moves of readying senior officials for a post when there are no vacancies.Also, it is not known if the post of ENCs will be filled after the retirement of current incumbents.(V.

Despite a high-pitched campaign by the opposition parties, and allegations of corruption against its leaders, the Trinamool finished with 211 seats in the 294-member House. The Congress emerged as the principal opposition party, winning 44 seats, followed by the Left Front with 33 (including one independent backed by the Front), while the BJP and its associates got half a dozen seats.The Trinamool, which had campaigned on the plank of development, highlighting the welfare initiatives like providing rice to the poor at Rs 2 a kg, cycles to students and grants to girls under the Kanyashree scheme, decimated the opposition in 15 out of 20 districts.The verdict was particularly disappointing for the Left Front, the state's rulers for 34 years at a stretch from 1977 to 2011. Front major Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), which had taken the lead in cobbling togerher the alliance with the Congress even at the cost of annoying some decades-old Left Front partners, failed to arrest its journey downhill that had started in the twilight years of the Left rule.What rubbed salt into the comrades' wounds was the fact that they had to cede the principal opposition status to the Congress, despite having contested the lion's share of the 294 elected seats in the 295-member house (one member is nominated).The lead-up to the polls was marred by a low-level of political discourse as many of the speakers from various parties were caught in television grabs issuing life threats to opponents, using indecent language and invectives and even threatening the administration and the police.The Narada sting footage, which purportedly showed Trinamool leaders, including ministers, MPs, state lawmakers and party office-bearers, accepting bundles of cash in exchange of a promise to give lucrative contracts to a fictitious company, hit the public domain in the midst of the hurly-burly of campaigning and immediately generated a big political storm. While the Trinamool questioned the genuineness of the footage, the opposition parties made the ""revelations"" a major poll issue.The Vivekananda Road flyover, at the crowded Posta area in north Kolkata, came apart on March 31, taking 26 human lives and injuring over 100 persons. This led to another bout of allegations and counter-allegations among political opponents in the election-bound state.Months later, a report drawn up by former faculty members of the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur concluded that faulty design, sub-standard raw material and inadequate supervision caused the flyover's collapse.After its assembly poll success, the Trinamool had more reason to cheer as the Supreme Court struck down the land acquisition made by the erstwhile Left Front government for the Tata Motors' Nano project in Hooghly district's Singur in 2006, and ordered that the land be returned to the cultivators.As the supremo of the then principal opposition party, the Trinamool, Banerjee had spearheaded the anti-land acquisition protests, undertaking a 26-day hunger-strike followed by a 16-day sit-in demanding 400 of the 997.11 acres acquired for the project be returned to those farmers who did not want to part with their land. Following a sustained movement, the Tatas relocated the factory from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat.In the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgement, the Trinamool administration went into overdrive to return physical and empirical possession of land to the peasants.Banerjee, affectionately called ""didi"" (elder sister), herself made a couple of highly publicised trips to Singur, sowing seeds in the fields and returning title deeds to the farmers.Buoyed by the judicial verdict, the Trinamool went from strength to strength as front-ranking Congress leaders like Manas Bhunia and several other lawmakers from the opposition ranks crossed over to its fold.The Trinamool got a further boost when it received national party status from the Election Commission, and through the year tried to position itself as the epicentre of the anti-BJP political space nationally. Banerjee raised the intensity of her attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the central government demonetised high-value currency notes.In order to tap investments, the Banerjee government organised the Bengal global business summit, and claimed to have received investment proposals worth at least Rs 2,50,104 crore. How many of these proposals will reach the implementation stage of the industry-starved state remains a big question.However, taking a big stride in medical treatment, the state saw a number of cadaver transplants, with the administration providing green channels in Kolkata to vehicles transferring body parts from one hospital to another.During the year, the state lost one of its cultural icons, writer activist Mahasweta Devi, while death also snatched away 103-year-old bodybuilder and former Mr Universe Manohar Aich.But 2016, in its last lap, brought a piece of good news when poet Shankha Ghosh was chosen for the Jnanpith, the country's highest literary award."
