58fcf1567be9e06c93711b50,Paramilitary forces in Bengal on the edge of outburst,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jan/13/paramilitary-forces-in-bengal-on-the-edge-of-outburst-1559299.html,2017-01-13,"KOLKATA: In the light of a second paramilitary jawan uploading a video highlighting the discrimination faced by them in terms of pay, ration and treatment and a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawan killing four of his colleagues in a fratricidal shootout in Bihar on Friday, the paramilitary forces stationed in West Bengal are not immune to the ongoing cauldron.With a troubled past during the height of Maoist insurgency from 2008-11, more skeletons are likely to tumble out of the closet in the ongoing crisis in the paramilitary forces, fear many associated with the forces.Though the ration provided to the paramilitary forces depend largely on the local availability and the needs of the personnel, discrimination is rife. The para forces in the northeast region are, Border Security Force (BSF), Shasastra Seema Bal (SSB), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel stationed at the Indo-Bangladesh border, Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders and the former Left Wing Extremism affected districts of Jangalmahal in western West Bengal.""We are the first line of defence at the eastern borders of the country, to check illegal immigration and stop cow smuggling. The Army is largely confined to the Eastern Command Headquarters and thebases in Panagarh, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and a few other places. Still, our pay and ration are not at par with Army,"" said a BSF official on the condition of anonymity.As north Indians dominate the three paramilitary forces in the state, rotis are more common than rice that is the staple of the local populace. Non-vegetarian food is generally served once a week and chicken is more preferred than fish, a source said. However, a lot of local Bengali recruits work in the paramilitary forces, more specifically in the BSF and the CRPF. According to their dietary needs, rice and fish are also provided, the source added.However, the central and state paramilitary forces in West Bengal had witnessed a period of intense breakdowns, fratricidal killings and open protests during the peak of Maoist insurgency in Jangalmahal from 2008-11. Psychiatrists feel that may return if the issue is not dealt with care.""CRPF jawans stationed in guerrilla war zone have to deal with a lot of psychological pressure. If that is not assuaged by giving them a sense that they are being taken care of -- by providing good food, healthcare and of course better pay -- we should be ready to witness periodic bouts of outbreak of anger,"" said psychiatrist Manoj Bandopadhyay, who has extensively studied the psychology of soldiers conducting counterinsurgency operations.The Maoist attack on a camp of West Bengal Police's paramilitary force, Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) at Silda in Paschim Medinipur district in 2010 that claimed the lives of 24 jawans opened a can of worms.Alleging discrimination in provision and facilities, the families of the jawans refused to allow the bodies to be taken away from the EFR headquarters at Salua in the same district and blocked the road, preventing any West Bengal police official to enter the camp. The then Inspector General (IG) of EFR, Benoy Chakraborty, covering his face with a black cloth in protest, had told the media about the discrimination his soldiers had to face in terms of pay, rations and other benefits. He was given a showcause notice for his 'masked presser' but no action was taken against him.Finally, the then Left Front finance minister Ashim Dasgupta, on behalf of the then Chief Minister and Home Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, had to visit the camp and placate the families after speaking to IG Chakraborty.Since then, a high wall with concertina wires has been erected around the EFRheadquarters, the pay of the soldiers increased and quarters where the families of the soldiers live have been freshly painted. However, not all issues have been resolved.""Besides Centre taking care of BSF, SSB and CRPF, the West Bengal government must make sure that the demands of the anti-insurgency STRACO force based in Jangalmahal are met. The force is made up of local boys who get much lesser facilities than EFR, leave alone WB Police. Though insurgency has waned, these local jawans are the ones who have prevented the reentry of Maoists from Jharkhand and that means a lot of pressure, which may burst if not fizzed out with better perks,"" psychiatrist Ajay Biswas said."

Hyderabad, where the rice and meat dish is ordered for snacks as well, was the undisputed biryani capital. Delhi bucked the trend, with masala dosa being the most savoured snack.A survey threw up several interesting trends among 0.5 million foodies in Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai and Kolkata.While Bengalureans preferred chicken biryani, masala dosa, idli, butter naan and paneer butter masala on their lunch, snack and dinner platters, for desserts it was death by chocolate, brownie fudge sundae, banana cake, lassi and black forest with ice cream that got them drooling. The areas which saw maximum food orders include Koramangala, Indiranagar, Central Bengaluru, Sarjapur, Bellandur, HSR Layout, BTM Layout, Whitefield, Marathahalli, Sanjay Nagar, New BEL Road, Malleswaram, Jayanagar and JP Nagar Kolkata showed a craze for Chinese and Lebanese food, apart from chicken and mutton biryani. Shawarma, momos and fried rice were among the top five main course items along with biryani. These and other revelations came to light via a survey conducted by online food delivery startup, Swiggy.Barring Delhi, burger reigned supreme in the snacks category in all other cities, along with street food items like chaats. While French fries and cold coffee were gastronomic delights in Pune, Chicken 65 and paneer butter masala were on the main course menu for a majority of foodies in Hyderabad.While most Delhiites craved caramel custard, doughnuts, gulab jamun, jalebi and tender coconut in cups, pongal was the most-loved sweet dish in Chennai. Kolkata retained its love for rasgullas, firni, jalebi, chocolate avalanche and chocolate fantasy.While north Indians showed a greater interest in south Indian food, the latter preferred north Indian delicacies. Chennai showed a healthy appetite for chole bhature."

They arent able to supply the rice varieties even at a higher price, said Hari Sharma of Lalitha Mills, a leading rice dealer. He attributed the shortage during the season to the sale of rice by Andhra rice merchants to the Food Corporation of India (FCI).The state consumes about 38-40 lakh tonnes of rice per annum and Jaya and Surekha varieties account for at least 22 lakh tonnes of the total consumption.The reason for the shortage in Andhra Pradesh could be the drought conditions prevailing in the region, or an artificial scarcity created to jack up the prices, reckoned S Leena Kumari, project co-coordinator (Rice), Rice Research Station, Moncompu, Kerala Agriculture University.The prices of the two varieties, which lingered around Rs 26-27/kg range during Onam last year (September), has spiralled, touching Rs 38/kg.While Jaya variety is preferred in the southern parts of the state from Alappuzha to Thiruvananthapuram, Surekha is the most sought after variety in Ernakulam and surrounding areas. Hari Sharma said there was sufficient supply of other grades of rice such as Kuruva, Swarna and Cherumani which are priced lower at Rs 23-24/kg.We can supply as much of Swarna rice as we want, but theres not much demand for the variety, he said. Swarna is sourced from West Bengal. People in north Kerala have cultivated the taste for Kuruva and Kranti rice varieties, he said.C S Saresh of SA Enterprises, a rice dealer, said a major reason for the increase in prices is the increase in transportation costs. The lorry charges have escalated from Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.09 lakh in the last two months as the return trip carrying plywood from Kerala has come to a halt, said another dealer."

(Source: file) South Africa buckled under pressure as Sachin Tendulkar, bowling the final over with only six runs needed, scripted a memorable victory for his side at the Eden Gardens. (Source: file)Batting great Sachin Tendulkar today recalled how a mongoose proved to be good omen for India in their sensational last-over win in the semifinal of Hero Cup here way back in 1993.South Africa buckled under pressure as Tendulkar, bowling the final over with only six runs needed, scripted a memorable victory for his side at the Eden Gardens.I dont know how many of you have noticed this but because it was the first day and night match, there was a mongoose which kept coming in the second half of the match, Tendulkar, who is the face of IDBI Federal Life Insurance Kolkata Full Marathon, said on the eve of the race.We got some wickets when it came. Then there were some runs and again the mongoose came and we got wickets. So I was waiting for the mongoose to keep coming. The match got rather close and I ended up bowling the last over.Tendulkar had failed with the bat but skipper Mohammad Azharuddin gave him the task to bowl the last over.It was a gamble that paid off and still remembered fondly as Tendulkar bowled three dot balls to Allan Donald preceded by a runout and Brian McMillan failed to get a boundary off the last delivery with the crowd buzzing from behind.When in Kolkata we used to have a joke running around Pehle do wicket lelo, baki ke aath wickets crowd le leta hai (first take the first two wickets, the crowd will look after the rest).Singling out the Hero Cup semi-final on November 24, 1993 as one of his best moments at Eden Gardens, he said: It was quite memorable and completely different, the first day-and-night match where I ended up bowling the last over.The experience to see the entire stadium lit with torches was truly out of this world. They stay with you for the rest of your life.Tendulkar also remembered the epoch-making 1991 series against South Africa that saw their return to international cricket from isolation after two decades. The first match of the three-ODI series saw a sellout crowd of about one lakh.There has been so many memories when it comes to Kolkata. The first big moment for me was when we played against South Africa, who were getting back to the International cricket.We had a spectacular match, Donald had a fiery spell up front but we got a partnership going and ended up winning the game. All in all, the experience was overwhelming not just for South Africa but also for me, Tendulkar, who jointly got the Man-of-the-Match award with Donald for his 73-ball 62 in their three-wicket win on November 10, 1991, said.He also recollected the reception after both the teams landed at the airport.It was incredible, not just inside the stadium but the moment they landed at the airport. On their way to the hotel there were people standing and cheering on both sides of the road.I later spoke to (then captain) Clive Rice who was double my age that time and he still fondly recalled that series, he signed off.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The villagers claimed they have become refugees in their own country yet again. This is not the first time that these people, mostly bidi workers and daily wage earners, have been displaced by the mighty river. It has been going on for the last three decades. The 120-km stretch of the right bank of the Ganges -- from Farakka to Jalangi in the district -- is especially prone to erosion.The displacement due to river bank erosion took place mainly in the districts Suti, Raninagar II, Bhagobangola II and Lalgola blocks. Speaking to The Hindu, the locals said that that if river embankments were set up in between the dry season, from March to July, the displacement could have been minimised. But West Bengal irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that the protection of river banks was the Centres responsibility.Now we are just refugees in our own country. I had to spend the winter living in a temporary shelter with my family of seven. Even the lives of stray dogs are more valued than us, said Golam Hussain, a labourer and a resident of the Char Krishnapur Bhagobangola II block, who has lost his house for the third time since 1989.Habibur Rehman, a resident of the same village was seething in anger when narrating his ordeal. He said that if the Ganges swallowed his land again, he will have no choice but to squat on others land.About 120 km away, in the Kamalpur area of the districts Samsherganj block, Akhtar Hossain (56), a bidi binder by profession, tried to swat away the flies hovering over a plate of stale rice as one of his neighbours told him about the river bank erosion in other parts of district. The Ganges is yet to strike Kamalpur after the last monsoon. But the river is just within a few hundred metres away from our makeshift huts, he said. His family got displaced seven times in last four decades as the Ganges swallowed their house and land.Speaking to The Hindu , irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that the state government was yet to asses the damage due to the latest river bank erosion. Currently we do not have the figures relating to the number of people who got displaced after the river bank erosion. We are in the process of assessing the damage, he said. Pointing out that the prevention of river bank of erosion came under the Centres jurisdiction, he said the state had written to the Centre several times about the issue, but they are aloof."

She drags her unsteady feet till they can't bear her weight any longer and has to be helped back to the chair. But Victoria Thokchom looks undeterred and ready to walk a longer distance. The 26-year-old nurse from Manipur, who had slipped into coma after being hit on the head by a dengue patient with an iron rod last October, needs to undergo a prolonged therapy to get back on her feet. Discharged from hospital on Wednesday after three-and-a-half months, she also needs treatment to regain her speech.""I am happy that my daughter is finally out of hospital but she stares at an uncertain future.

The flip side, however, is that the average Kolkatan burns the least calories. Also, with families increasingly eating out, the advantages of a balanced diet that is inherent in Bengal's traditional recipes may soon not reflect on the people, warn nutritionists and dieticians.Data logged by mobile health and fitness firm HealthifyMe, which analyses self-reported information on what and how much people consume to work out the protein-fat-carbohydrate (PFC) ratio, shows a slightly higher protien and fat intake and a reduction in carbohydrate can make the average Kolkatan's diet perfect. Other cities, however, require substantial changes to their food habit to make it healthy.The National Institute of Nutrition under the Indian Council of Medical Research pegs the average Indian adult's ideal PFC ratio at 20%:30%:50%. From the 5.5 lakh food logs reported by 10,000-plus Kolkatans in 2016, the average PFC ratio of food intake is 16.9%: 28.6%: 54.5%, the closest to the ideal, says Tushar Vashisht , co-founder and CEO of HealthifyMe.Compared to the rest of the country, the percentage contribution of protein to energy is higher while fat and carbohydrate to energy is lower in Kolkata. ""The high protein intake from the regular intake of fish, meat and lentils put people in the city at a lower risk for conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke and obesity,"" remarked Mitali Palodhi, nutritianist-dietician and vice-president of Indian Dietetic Association.Consumption of vegetables is also higher in Kolkata than most other cities. Masoor dal, mixed vegetables and machher jhol are among the most popular meal items while muri or puffed rice is a very popular snack item.In contrast, consumption of fat is highest in Delhi that thrives on paratha, milk/butter and samosa. Such food habit puts them at greater risk of heart disease and hypertension. Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, on the other hand, consume more carbohydrate through their diet of rice, idli and dosa makes them susceptible to diabetes.While the survey shows that Bengal's traditional food is balanced as they contain all nutrients, dieticians are worried that habits are fast changing. ""Increasingly, people are opting to eat out or order in. When one does that, one doesn't know the fat content. It is also disturbing to hear some parents brag that their children don't like rice or roti. One has to get children addicted to home food,"" said Ipsita Chakravarti, chief dietician of CMRI.The lack of balance diet is leading to micronutrient deficiencies like Vitamin D and iron and folic acid. ""These problems would earlier occur mostly among the impoverished people who could not afford a proper meal. But that is not the case now. High consumption of fast food is resulting in these problem across socio-economic groups,"" said Palodhi.Another major problem, says Chakravarti, is sendantary lifestyle. Analysis of HealthifyMe data shows the average Kolkatan burns minimum calories. While a Kolkatan burns 209 kCal a day, it is 232 kCal in Bangalore, 229 kCal in Delhi and 227 kCal in Mumbai."

Instead, biryani, fried rice and momos rule the chart, with dal makhani and shawarma being the surprise entrants, according to a food order survey carried out across 800 restaurants in the city .""Unlike other metros, Kolkatans have diverse food preferences. They are open to experimenting with other cuisines. Only 8% of daily orders received on Swiggy are for Bengali food,"" said Swiggy vice-president (marketing) Srivats TS.RJ Mir, a self-confessed foodie, isn't surprised that Bengali dishes are not much in demand. ""We Bengalis are extremely finicky about our own cuisine. If it's `singi maachher jhol' or `sorshe ilish', it has to taste the way our mom or aunts cook. The belief is that the best Bengali food is cooked at home. So why order from restaurants? If one has to experiment, it is best to do with other cuisines,"" he reasoned.In desserts and snacks though, traditional sweets with an innovative twist are still the favourites. Baked rosogolla from Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick , dab sherbat from Paramount and fish kabiraji from Mitra Cafe are enjoyed not just by the locals, but even by visitors who want to savour Kolkata's best.The pan-India survey that analysed food delivery data collated from 12,000 restaurants has at least one or two local delicacies making it to the top-five food picks in other big cities. While Delhi loves to order butter bun, pav bhaji is Mumbai's favourite.Chennai orders idli, masala dosa is the favourite in Bengaluru and Hyderabad orders veg biryani the most. Only Bengalis savour international cuisines like Japanese, Lebanese, Mexican or exotic seafood. Pradip Rozario , who ushered in the concept of fusion with Italian and Mexican dishes in the 1990s, said Bengalis were by nature the biggest connoisseur of new delicacies. ""If they are fed up with egg or chicken roll, they will give shawarma a try,"" he added.According to Mir, Kolkata's cosmopolitan outlook is reflective in its taste buds. ""We tom-tom with our Bengali `kaalchaar' (culture) but welcome others with open arms. We love our maachher jhol-bhaat but we can never say no to momos and thukpas. If you go elsewhere, you won't find a single food joint that cooks Bengali food the way we love it.

(Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) Shapoor Zadran is a fantasy cricketer for a nation that worships aggressive sportsmen. (Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)Long flowing hair and intimidating pace generated from his 28-stride run-up. Shapoor Zadran is a fantasy cricketer for a nation that worships aggressive sportsmen. As Afghanistan gets an IPL entry and new home in Noida, the countrys most-famous star tells The Indian Express what makes him tick, why he rates Indian players over Pakistanis, and his dream of meeting his Bollywood idol Shah Rukh Khan.Tension simmers under the skin whenever Afghanistan play neighbours Pakistan  mostly its harmless ribbing from the big brother, though at times the chattering can boil over. This one had no words uttered, yet it ended up as an international incident in the blink of an eye. Literally.Because Afghanistans big, strapping quick Shapoor Zadran decided to bowl an outswinger to Pakistan opener Mohammad Hafeez, and followed it with a gesture that mightve simply amused Hafeez, but got the whole of Afghanistan ruffled: Shapoor had just winked at the Professor.Television exploded that day as Kabul networks wretchedly paused the frames of Shapoors follow-through, then zoomed in on his face circling the eye and blew up The Wink. It played on a loop the next 24 hours, and he was summoned home to explain his action.TV zoomed into my eye and it was like all of Afghanistan wanted to know how I couldve done such a thing  Pathan ne aankh maari! I was happy with the outswinger and just like that winked. Jaanbuzh ke nahi kiya tha, par logon ne kuchh aur samazh liya, aur ghar pe ammi ne bulake puchha Yeh tumne kya kar diya? Shapoor recalls of Winkgate.Tall Afghan fast bowlers are expected to glare and scowl, but Shapoor ditched both, and settled for what he thought was a cheeky wink. Its like when talking at a Kandivali hotel in Mumbai after training at the Payyade Club, Shapoor starts vaguely about his early Bollywood heroes  Sunny Deol, Suniel Shetty and Sanjay Dutt, the toughies who growled and beat up the baddies, but forgets about the fist-fighters and instead yaps about his full blown fandom of Shah Rukh Khan  outstretched arms, charming lines, the works.How he wound up with that un-ferocious but merely irreverent wink is evident in his lifelong emulation of Shoaib Akhtar. The Akhtar imitation was more thereabouts than there, in its eventual execution. But more on that later.***On a warm day in Mumbai, with his shoulder-length hair flying as he runs into the light breeze, Shapoor is patching together that glorious run-up which had halted because of a right knee injury six months ago. The left-arm pacer flew down to Mumbai 10 days earlier than his Afghanistan team-mates who will assemble in Noida to start playing their home ties against other Associates, and is keen on hitting the groove and getting used to bowling long spells in the sun.That long run-up doesnt quite culminate in some fiendish pace, though in his third spell, a net batsman lost balance and fell on his backside getting out of the way of a bouncer. But Shapoor clearly likes the drama that bookends his bowling action, and the 28 loping strides turn heads at this cornerpost of Mumbai cricket, a shapeless but decently maintained ground tucked away in one nook of the western suburb.The 31-year-old had got in touch with Umesh Patwal, a maidan cricketer who once served on the Afghanistan coaching staff as batting coach, and these days carries Shapoor on his motorbike through Borivalis zigzag lanes  wind in hair  in what is as much of the Mumbai experience his coach is allowing him right now. The pilgrimage to Mannat has been put off until later by telling Shapoor that Shah Rukh is away shooting in England, and the Afghan buys into the script of his famous Bollywood idol being busy shooting someplace far, rendering the jaunt to Bandstand meaningless. His appetite for drama extends to his Bollywood picks  he cant get over Devdas, and its ostentatious lines.I would like to go but he must be a busy man. Plus, when I reached the airport Umesh told me that I had to bowl as many overs as possible to get back into the groove, he explains. Shapoor has chosen the testing Mumbai hours of 12 noon to 3 pm to train and sweat, and meeting the matinee idol can wait as he tries to bring his career back on track. He has picked a nice stark tan along the way to show for this week of rigour.But its not just the burning sun acclimatisation thats kept him rooted to the hotel-ground-hotel routine with one visit to a nearby mall thrown in. Meeting heroes isnt always fun, Shapoor says, scorched as he is by snubs from before. Wide-eyed and impressionable, he had naturally thought Pashto kinship meant Shahid Afridi would become like an elder brother to the Afghanistan team. He would just wave at us like a celebrity and walk away. Once he was out of the team he started talking nicely and said Eh Shapoor kaisa ho, but at first it was only the hand-wave, he grumps.With idol Shoaib Akhtar, hed been too tongue-tied at first  still a fan who was watching a TV star in flesh. We met 3-4 times but it was just Salaam, Hi, How are you and Bye. Its tough to say anything when you see someone youve only seen on TV, he says earnestly.***Afghanistan pacer Shapoor Zadran is sweating it out in scorching sun and also passing tips to fellow campers. (Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) Afghanistan pacer Shapoor Zadran is sweating it out in scorching sun and also passing tips to fellow campers. (Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)Its why MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli climbed his personal popularity charts. MS came and told us after a match that we were a promising team and would do well. Kohli came and hugged us after a match. If you are a star, thats what you do  you come and hug a junior, a pat on the back. There are expectations from heroes, and its nice when Indians show us that respect. Yuvraj, Rohit Sharma the Pathan reels off names through the emotional gush. Dil bada hona chahiye  in bowling and when winning, he adds.Its what hes got used to receiving in India  warmth and respect, while equations with the Pakistan team remain taut. Maybe sharing borders always amplifies annoyance of the neighbour anyplace in the world, he muses, but theres a bit of chirpy history to turn Shapoor grouchy when talking about Pakistan in contrast to his experience of Indians.Pakistan ki team hamesha bahot bolte hai, zyada bolte hai, he says flapping his fingers to resemble a gabbing mouth. The Wink put him in the eye of a storm at home comically, but Shapoor has peevish memories of other confrontations. Umar Akmal run se zyada baatein tez karta hai. Hell start  aise marunga, waise marunga. Indians bowler ko respect dete hai, gaali nahi, he says, obviously never having caught Kohli in one of his wild moods.***In company of maidan coach Umesh Patwal, who drives him around in Mumbai.(Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) In company of maidan coach Umesh Patwal, who drives him around in Mumbai.(Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)But theres a good vibe about India for the Afghans, never mind the Pakistan comparison. Its what makes Shapoor happy about their home ground moving from Dubai to Noida. India se bahot dosti hai, Mumbai feels like home, Delhi has lot of Afghans wholl come and fill stadiums to watch us. India mein aasaani hai, he explains. Comfort.Yaha zubaan wohi hai. Waha Dubai mein sab Arabi alag hai, he says, speaking of a stronger cultural affinity with South Asia and a shared passion for cricket thats a massive ice-breaker in the subcontinent. He wont blindly tuck into Indian food, though  too spicy, he says as a lesson in subtle spicing of aromatic Afghan rice follows on a day when Aussie Matt Renshaw fled to the loo mid-inning on a ground across the Expressway in Pune.But having acquired a new penchant for salted lassi and having told his hosting hotel in Mumbai to go easy on the chillies, Shapoor thinks the citys growing on him.Its not what hed expected  Afghan cricketers coming to Mumbai think its all Bollywood, rich people, Ambanis and the IPL  but after having lived the clich during an earlier stint, when the Afghans played World Cup games in posh(er) South Bombay, Shapoor is learning about a gritty city that turns the formerly starry-eyed man philosophical.Theres a small pathway beyond my practice ground. Its just a 20-second pillion ride through that lane, but I stopped one day and found that some 20 people live in a single room in the slum. I didnt sleep that night, he says. Zindagi sakht hoti hai, he says.Sakht. Difficult, if one were to simplify the word. Though Shapoor uses it multiple times. He uses it while talking about the times, when deep into the night, Afghan cricketers woke up startled at every bombing in the distance or when footballers would scrunch their noses at the white flannelled and say, Yeh kya hai?.No one respected cricket then, now the whole country loves it. Theres money, prestige and respect, he says. And IPL contracts too.***Cricket was always 50/50 for Shapoor. That is to say he remained undecided about it. My father was angry when I left my studies, and he wanted me to either join his business (car dealership and real estate) or study. They used to laugh when I used the word international. So when I first came on TV, I went and asked them, Kyun, aaya ya nahi main TV pe?Shapoor loves the cameras, and this love is easily mutual. The 62 pacer with the stylishly long mane is a sight when he  like Shoaib Akhtar  streaks in like a bullet train. He recalls hearing about Manoj Prabhakars spells on crackling radio waves earlier, and getting a head rush everytime stumps were struck.But the Shoaib-influenced career is like a remake gone awry. I used to wake up making plans about what I could do to become like him. But it became tough because he was a rightie and me leftie. So it didnt work out too well, I couldnt just copy everything, he says.The hair was styled well enough, but the bowling was picked in bits and pieces and without early coaching, the whole package never could come together. Lekin shauk aa gaya fast bowling ka. Baal vaal toh kar liye, kyunki wo junoon jism mein utar gaya tha, he says.After meditating each morning about becoming like the Shoaib for 6-7 minutes, Shapoor realised his kinesiology wasnt suited for that action  his was more like quilted into place and held together by the fetish and fervour rather than the precise formula.So, while the speedgun spiked at 150  140  dropping down to 132 and resurging at 145, to the experts it remained an indulgent run-up followed by a slightly under-whelming delivery. Very exciting, but an under-achievement when all was played and done. Wasim Akram would spend some time with Shapoor and goad him for 8 months from 2012-14, to trim that runway  its down from 38 strides to 28 now. Now my coaches tell me if Im happy with the run-up I should stick to it. It gives me a sense of rhythm, he contends.It had started when two Shoaib sprints ended in shattered stumps of Dravid and Tendulkar at Kolkata. Wo dekh ke jism mein jhatka aa jaata tha. Jaiseki bowler bol raha maaro sa^&* batsmen ko, he says, stressing its never a personal grudge but a war, against the batsmen, waged by bowlers playing a sport loaded in favour of the mace wielders.***Shapoor believes a certain degree of madness is necessary to even think of becoming a pace bowler. My madness was 38 strides. Par saare bowler deewane hote hai. Deewane nahi hue toh woh bowler nahi hai, he rationalises, pleased with his theory.It is the Pathani stubbornness that was seen in an infuriating number of Shahid Afridi aborted innings  where hed fail to check his instinct. Par wo junoon hi toh hai meri bowling mein, he says in self-assessment. If I change, I will lose my bowling, he declares  those 10 strides less now, more a decision borne out of a creaking body than a crumbling mind.Hes not vain about his bowling though, the bluster kept at bay with self-awareness. A savage Paul Stirling assault during the Qualifiers T20 final left him in shreds. Bahot maar padi 2 overs mein. And he isnt even the greatest of batsmen, he says flummoxed. I learnt the importance of staying calm in the second spell realising that I can only try experiments when Im cool-headed, he would say.Growing up pangs the entire squad experiences on rough days. Like it was tough to understand why Mohammad Shahzaad (Afghanistans mercurial wicketkeeper), whod hit Imran Tahir and Rabada for long sixes, wasnt picked in IPL. Maybe because India has so many wicketkeepers? And well need to get consistent to be noticed, he says.Shapoor wants to pack in Kohli once though. I admire how his bat comes down straight and sharp, hes the best batsman, he starts. So obviously, Shapoor wants to knock his middle stump off. Ek din tez aake danda udaana hai. Nahi kiya aur balle pe ball aa gaya, toh who bahot marega, he laughs.With Afghanistan scheduled to play four-dayers, Shapoor, the original star, wants to put himself in contention for the longest format. Twenty mein ache balls bhi maare jaate hai, he groans, but in Tests, Ill get to prove that I can last long, bowl 10-20 overs, battle with a batsman. Tests will be like pathology lab tests for Afghanistan. Theyll show whats inside our body, he says, not content with being outwardly appended with adjectives like fearless and proud.Every movie would have that dialogue about how Mumbai is this great city  films, skyscrapers, wealth. But now I need to find the resilience of those 20 people struggling but surviving in that one room of a slum in my cricket, he says. He wants to do well enough to muster courage to talk to Shah Rukh about cricket and beyond a Salaam, hi, how are you, bye. Tongue-tied he might well be at present, but not when Afghanistan takes off from a 28-stride bounding runway into the future as a Test nation. He might even wink without fear.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Representatives of a consortium of 26 primary cooperatives formed by Consumerfed are currently holding negotiations with Food Corporation of India officers and rice mills in West Bengal, Surendran informed the Assembly on Tuesday.The negotiations are expected to conclude by Thursday. The consignments will arrive by March 10, he said. Consumerfed had difficulties in procuring rice from Andhra Pradesh as mill owners were reluctant to supply rice due to delay in payment in the past. The agency had run up massive dues, forcing mill owners and middlemen in Andhra Pradesh to cut off supply.The LDF Government has paid Rs 52 crore to 241 suppliers after assuming office. The ar rears now stand at Rs 157 crore and steps are being taken to clear the arrears, Surendran said. Also, the shortage in supply of Jaya and Surekha, the popular varieties in Kerala, prompted Consumerfed to knock at West Bengals doors.Even as rice prices were climbing past Rs 45 per kg, the minister informed the Assembly the hike in rice prices was a national phenomenon. In Andhra Pradesh, the prices ranged between Rs 46 and Rs 49 per kg, while in Gujarat it stood at Rs 30-34. The prices ranged between Rs 29 and Rs 32 in Uttar Pradesh.

The district, which reported 32 farmer deaths in 2015-2016 kharif season, registered its first death of the year on Tuesday.One Khainu Bagarti (55) alias Hadu, who consumed pesticide in Kendpali village under Bargarh Sadar police limits on Monday night, succumbed at VIMSAR Medical on Tuesday.Irate villagers of Kendpali blocked National Highway-6 at Munigad with the body demanding compensation for kin of the deceased.The blockade, that began at 3 pm, continued till late in the evening with hundreds of heavy commercial vehicles stranded on the NH connecting Kolkata and Mumbai.Ananta Bagarti, son of Khainu, said irregular power supply and resultant failure of lift irrigation system had damaged their paddy crop cultivated over three acres of land. Although they owned a deep bore-well, they could not irrigate the crop due to frequent power failure.Water scarcity damaged their crop and having availed private loan of `40,000 for cultivation, Khainu was under severe mental stress over repayment. Finding no alternative to overcome debt burden, Khainu consumed poison, claimed Ananta.Peeved over the failure of WESCO to provide uninterrupted power supply to the village, the villagers blocked the highway demanding Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of the deceased.Bargarh Additional Tehsildar Manas Ranjan Swain and DSP Sk Mujibur Rehman rushed to the spot and tried to end the stalemate, but the villagers refused to budge from their stand. The impasse was resolved after Bargarh Sub- Collector Bhimsen Puinam Kant Ekka handed over financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to Khainus family and assured them to provide proper power supply to the village by March 5.Debt and drought have in the past forced farmers of the State, particularly Bargarh, to commit suicide. The Human Rights Commission too had taken note of the suicides and agrarian crisis that has been on the rise in the last few years.The anger of the farmers and neglect meted out to them had drawn the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had addressed a mega convention of farmers in the district while Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik too took a massive rally and announced sops for the farmers.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too had walked 7 km from Debahal to Attabira in the district and visited the bereaved family of a farmer. But nothing much has changed ever since. With yet another gruelling summer and subsequent drought knocking at the doors of farmers this year, the situation of the farmers is all set to worsen further."

Prices of the Jaya variety have shot through the roof in Kerala in recent week, reaching record levels. As the government admitted in the states Assembly, rice prices have shot up by 21 per cent in the state. And the reason for this is the reduction in rice arrivals from Andhra Pradesh.Andhra Pradesh has begun exporting rice to Africa and the other southern states, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, have increased their procurement of rice from Andhra. As a consequence, prices of Andhra rice varieties have risen.With the Pinarayi Vijayan government facing heat on the rice price issue in the Assembly, the Kerala government hurriedly arranged to buy 1000 tonnes of rice from Andhra Pradesh. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation has finalised a deal with Andhra traders for supply of 1000 tonnes of Lalitha brand Jaya variety rice, Kerala food minister P Thilothaman.As per the deal, Kerala will get the rice for Rs 39.50 a kg. It will be sold in Keralas subsidized outlets at Rs 25 per kg and for Rs 41 in the free sale market.Concurrently, Kerala civil supplies officials are frantically knocking on the doors of West Bengal traders to place urgent orders. The Kerala State Co-operative Consumers Federation Limited (Consumerfed) is conducting the negotiations and the first consignments from West Bengal are expected to arrive in Kerala by March 10.In the Assembly, the Pinarayi government continued to be pilloried over the rice issue.

The BJP had demanded a judicial probe into the matter.The self-styled organisation had a slew of bizarre demands including abolition of elections and the Indian rupee."
58f508237be9e018510a1e5b,Bengal opens farm trade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170303/jsp/bengal/story_138748.jsp,2017-03-03,"Calcutta, March 2: The Mamata Banerjee government today amended the agriculture produce marketing act to allow the entry of major private players in the trade so that better prices were ensured for commodities produced by farmers. But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

The PACS have been asked to procure rice from Consumerfed depots. The rice being procured from West Bengal will cost Rs 27 for the cooperative societies. But the cooperatives will sell it at Rs 25 to economically weaker sections, he said.The Rs 100 crore-consortium set up by the Consumerfed and cooperative societies has given orders for 2,500 tonnes of Suvarna rice from West Bengal. Of this, 800 tonnes has already reached the state and is ready for distribution. The remaining 1,700 tonnes will be ready for distribution by March 10.The Minister said cooperative societies with prior experience in the sale of rice and essential items have been selected for the market intervention. The focus will be on the coastal belt and hilly regions where the price rise has affected people the most. Five kg of rice will be given to each family in the initial phase and the same will be increased to 10 kg per week. It will continue until the prices come down in the open market, the minister said.Surendran said it was the handiwork of a group of Kollam-based rice agents who consistently work towards unrealistic price rise in the domestic market.The consortium members went to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The unprecedented summer has led to price rise of brands like Jaya. The price of original Jaya rice per kg in Karnataka is Rs 36. It was in this background that the team went to West Bengal and identified Survarna rice, which is almost similar to rice varieties popular in Kerala, he said."

We were informed that he would like to spend roughly three days with us. But now we would want him to spend at least a week with us. The party president's visit will not only rev up the karyakartas but will add another dimension to our campaign in the forthcoming municipal and panchayat polls. We suspect that the panchayat polls in Bengal will be held ahead of schedule in November-December 2017.""Ghosh's insistence isn't without reason. The party's electoral ally in the Hills, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, is on a politically sticky wicket. Pushed to the wall by an aggressive Trinamool Congress, which is keen to reap the dividends of crafting out a separate Hill district  Kalimpong  GJM faces a tough test to retain its Hill stronghold.According to sources, GJM is all too likely to rake up its time-tested Gorkhaland card. But it wants BJP to echo the issue in Parliament to assuage its voters back home in Darjeeling and the foothills.The more cornered GJM is, sources said, the more shrill its Gorkhaland pitch is going to be.For the state BJP, however, it has become a tightrope walk. As a national party, it cannot be seen as rooting for separatist voices. Moreover, the Centre is a key stakeholder in the tripartite Gorkhaland Territorial Agreement.Ahead of the 2016 assembly polls, the Centre had authorized the Tea Board to take over management control of seven gardens of the G P Goenka-headed Duncan Industries in north Bengal by invoking a rarely used section of the Tea Act of 1953. The Centre, thus, attempted to send a message that it had acted while the state dithered.A year on, this has led to nothing. Embroiled in a protracted legal battle, the Mamata Banerjee government has made it all too apparent by providing Rs 2-per-kilogram rice and mobile health units to these ailing tea gardens and its 17,000 employees. The state BJP feels this is now turning into a liability ahead of the civic polls.Dissidence in ranks is also hurting the party. A party leader recently graduated from critical social media posts against Ghosh to openly airing his grouse in the media. A senior party MP still chooses to work at cross-purposes with the party's stated line on the child trafficking issue."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties.

Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

Bishnu Kumar Chhetri, the secretary of Kalimpong Krishak Kalyan Sangathan that filed the PIL against the agricultural marketing department of the state government on March 24, said local farmers were incurring financial losses in the absence of a regulated market here. Chhetri said the proposal for the regulated market had been mooted way back in 1975, but the construction of the complex was completed much later in 2005. ""However, even after the completion of the complex and its subsequent renovation in 2012, it functioned only for a brief period. In November last year, the government constituted a 10-member market committee with GTA secretary as the chairman, but the panel does not have a single local farmer or trader as member, which is against the provision of the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (regulation) Act, 1972,"" he said. Chhetri has prayed for an interim order reconstituting the market committee with proper representation of local stakeholders and early operation of the complex. ""In my PIL, I also challenged the transfer of the market complex to the GTA, which the state government did in November 2012."" ""Local crops like cardamom, ginger, orange, vegetables, broom, rice and millets worth close to Rs 1.5 crore are traded annually. If the regulated market starts functioning, the farmers will get almost double the price by avoiding middlemen,"" he added."

They stuff chicken pieces mixed with spices inside a piece of bamboo and bake it on fire. Once it is baked, chicken is served to tourists. The Koyas in around 300 habitats collect honey, gum, custard apple, medicinal plants and make bamboo craft.Many of the Koyas live near Panashala, an exotic tourist spot on the bank of the Godavari river.

The government can ensure the villagers get the price they deserve and prevent over-exploitation of herbs.The agriculture labour charge per day is Rs 800 in Kerala  one of the main reasons why local farmers quit farming.

Vegetable traders in order to have monopoly over the local producers, marketed vegetables from West Bengal, Ranchi and Chhattisgarh at a cheaper rate which had made vegetable farming in Baispur unsustainable.When the villagers left vegetable farming, the traders increased the price again. Here the role of the state government was to check the unscrupulous practices.

Thirty years ago, those artisans used to make more than 60 intricate stitching patterns on clothes.Today, one can come across a few artisans who can create such artistry. This is the main reason why applique work loses its popularity in global craft bazaar. There is need for a proper environment to turn enthusiasm and skill into income generating activities."

Except for vegetables, no produce is arriving at the APMC yard. Similarly, transportation of vegetables from the yard to neighbouring states is unhindered.Supply of tur dal from Kalaburagi, Bidar and Gujarat, bengal gram from Madhya Pradesh, and rice from Raichur, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal has been stopped. In the same way, the transportation of horse gram from the yard to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other states has been stalled.

But migrant workers are cooking their way into peoples hearts even beyond hotels and restaurants.Many a roadside eatery has the migrants lending their touch to give dishes from the north their innate flavour.Chaat stalls on push carts, nearly all of them flaunting the same name board, whether at Karamana, Fort, Vazhuthacaud, or Technopark, are run by men from Chittor in Rajasthan. Raju sells chaat on the Poojappura-Karamana road, and Fateh Lal, aka Devraj, near a private hospital in the Fort area. They have been in the city for varying lengths of time. They had heard about Kerala from family and friends who had been here, and decided to head south in search of a better life. Though unmarried, they have families back home that are engaged in farming, an occupation with poor prospects, they say, owing to the lack of water.Life here is better, they say, because they can earn more, though working seven days a week does not leave much time for anything else. Their day starts early around 5 a.m., to make the puris for pani puri, a time-consuming process. By the time everything is done, it is well past noon. A short break later, it is time to open up shop. Vegetables are chopped once the stall opens, depending on the demand. Not that there is much left to take back home once it is closing time. Most days, whatever sev, puris, or puffed rice they bring is exhausted, letting them pocket a decent profit.From Tamil NaduR. Selvathurai, a Thenkasi native, sells nongu from his two-wheeler parked in front of the Police Training College at Thycaud. With a decade-and-half here behind him, Selvathurai greets many with easy familiarity. While the rest of his family resides back home, the few months he is here, Selvathurai lives at Kollengode. Once the rains hit the State, he packs off to Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu for some time, before heading home to Thenkasi to work as a labourer before returning to the city to coincide with the Sabarimala season.The sugar cane juice business also has a good number of migrant workers. Amit, who hails from a village around an hour from Guwahati in Assam, sells sugar cane juice on the Poojapppura-Karamana road. Not too far away, at the mouth of the Jagathy-Poojappura road, is Sherif, from Kolkata. Amit lives at Kaniyapuram with 16 others, all of them from Assam. He earns around Rs. 500 day, though the sugar cane press is not owned by him. Having been here six years, Sherif speaks Malayalam fluently.Unlike Amit though, he owns his sugar cane press, and saves enough for his family, which includes a pregnant wife, and to send money home. Here, I can save some money. Back home, the salary is less, and it just gets spent.Amit, who has studied till Class 3, says it is not impossible to make ends meet in Assam, but there is more money to be made here. I send Rs. 10,000-12,000 home each month."

Roy was born on April 11, 1887, according to the English calendar but his descendants celebrate his birth anniversary on Poila Boishakh . The family, however, didn't mind the early celebrations online.""I'm really happy with Google's tribute using a painting of a horse done by Dadu. I've seen at least 10-12 different horses done by him,"" said Debabrata Roy , the 76-year-old grandson of the artist who has directed a documentary titled 'The Art of Jamini Roy'.However, Roy was certain that the painter would have reacted very differently to Google's homage. ""I can visualise him getting very angry with such adulation. He would have turned violent. He just didn't like any gadgets. Before his death, I had tried to get his consent for shooting a film on him. But, there was complete non-cooperation from his side,"" he recounted.Contrary to artists who are in search of immortality through art, the painter didn't believe in the permanence of art. ""He didn't even leave behind a will and was least bothered about how posterity would remember him. All he would say is: 'I don't agree. That's why I paint',"" Roy said.Though both the central and state governments have acquired most of the master's works from the family, Roy's collection still has some of his rudimentary sketches. However, he isn't expecting government support to preserve the master's works. ""That's not the government's job. If a private organisation is ready to come up with a permanent space where Dadu's works can be on display, I will love to give them there,"" he said.Describing his grandfather as a 'no-nonsense gentleman', Roy spoke about how the Padma Bhushan winner was ""afraid"" that his grandson, too, would take to painting. ""We can't even imagine his financial struggles. He had to struggle hard to earn one paisa that was needed to buy puffed rice to feed his children. He didn't have money to buy good quality paints. That's why restorers of his early works have such a tough time now. He even used my grandmother's sari as a canvas,"" Roy added.Yet, the artist didn't increase the price of his works because he believed in reaching out to the masses. ""I don't agree with the government's policy that declares his works as 'national treasures'. Artists have no nationalities. Can Van Gogh or Picasso be limited as a national treasure of one country? Sadly, it's impossible to export or take Dadu's works outside India. I think, this policy deprives owners of his works from taking them along if they want to shift out of India. However, I do hear that many of his works are now going under the hammer at international art auctions."""

Following the state crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses and closure of all mutton shops in the city, Bengali homemakers are now being reluctantly trying out combinations of chicken, golda chingri (jumbo-sized prawns), rohu and the smaller variety of fish - pabda (Indian catfish), mourala (Indian carplet), punti (a small freshwater fish) - to make the afternoon menu on the auspicious day as lip smacking as possible.""Sundays and the auspicious Poila Boisakh have always called for kasha mangsho (spicy Bengali mutton curry) on the table. Unfortunately not so this year. Since no mutton is available anywhere in the city, I have drawn up an alternate menu comprising paka rui macher kalia (rohu fish curry), pabda macher jhaal (Indian Catfish curry made with copious spreads of mustard sauce) mango chutney, doi (sweet curd) and mishti,"" said Shipra Sahay, secretary of Nari Samity, Ranchi.Ruby Choudhury, a homamaker and a resident of P N Bose Compound, said while substitutes for mutton and kasha mangsho are hard to find, she has decided to use her culinary skills to prepare two to three varieties of fish, with accompaniments of mango chutney, moong daal, doi and mishti this year.Another homemaker, Namita Chatterjee, a resident of Shivangi Apartment at Hazaribag Road, said her Poila Baisakh lunch menu would comprise fish and payesh (kheer or rice pudding) along with other vegetarian and sweet dish accompaniments.Alpana Mukherjee, a homemaker at Purulia Road , said mutton would be replaced with chicken butter masala and two preparations of fish, sweet pulao and the usual doi and mishti for lunch on Poila Baisakh. Anima Ghosh of Tharpakhna said that golda chingri would occupy a place of importance on the platter while Mita Ghosh , a resident of Kantatoli, said: ""With no mutton, fish is our only option.""At Union Club and Library, where a gala dinner is being arranged for members on April 15, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, secretary, revealed chicken butter masala and fish cutlet would replace mutton this year because of ""extra-ordinary circumstances"". He said: ""We have arranged for a musical discourse by eminent singer Ridhi Bandopadhyay from Kolkata at Plaza Cinema Hall in the evening of April 15. Guests would be treated to Rabindra Sangeet, Nidhi Babur toppa, Nazrul, Rajanikanto, old Bangla songs etc,"" Mukherjee said."
59035ce27be9e0266aeab313,It’s a wok over!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/its-a-wok-over/article18036523.ece,2017-04-15,"A food columnist who writes like an angel (if angels write, that is) once said something so wise that I still recall his words. The remark was not about food, but television. It was around the time that the satellite boom had hit India, and there were channels galore. And this was what the columnist had to say: So much to choose from, but so little to watch.Thats my thought about the restaurant boom in Delhi: there are restaurants in all parts of town, but only a few places that you really want to go back to. In fact, I am a bit like a stuck record when it comes to something that I like: if it works for me, I keep going back there.And that is why, one pleasant afternoon some days ago, I found myself in Side Wok in Malcha Marg. Actually, I must admit that it was my first time there. But I had some great meals at two other outlets of Side Wok  in Khan Market and Connaught Place (they have branches elsewhere, too). So I thought I had to try the one out in Malcha Marg.A friend from Kolkata was in town. Every time I am in his city, he and his wife make it a point to take me out for a good meal. I try and do that when they are in Delhi, but its a tough act to follow for they are die-hard foodies. This time, just one of them was visiting. And since I know about his fondness for Chinese food, I thought it would be a good idea to take him to Side Wok.The decision to go to the Malcha Marg outlet was not just because I had not gone there. It was also because I have always liked this little market in this tony south Delhi residential area. Many years ago, before Delhi became such a happening food hub, I used to often go to Malcha Marg to have a meal at Fujiya, a Chinese restaurant that I am happy to say is still going strong. The other great point in its favour is the fact that parking there is a snap. Theres ample parking space right in front of the restaurant.So I parked my car and looked for a table for three in Side Wok. It was a weekend, and not surprisingly very busy. I was advised by one of the servers to go to Fez, which is a part of the chain that also owns Side Wok. Fez is a Mediterranean restaurant, and I have had some great meals there. We were told that we would be able to order Side Wok dishes at Fez, as well as from Fezs own menu.So we asked for a mixed mezze platter (a delicious offering of fish, prawns, chicken, lamb and veggies, with pita bread, hummus, tzatziki and a great garlic-and-yoghurt dip  all for Rs. 985). From the Side Wok menu we asked for a plate of Singapore vegetable noodles (Rs. 295), mixed fried rice (Rs. 415), spare ribs (Rs. 495) and sliced lamb with fresh red chillies and basil (Rs. 495).It was one of the nicest meals I have had in some time. The mezze platter was wonderful, as one would expect, but the Chinese dishes were superb, too. The pork belly was deliciously moist, and cooked just right. The fork went into the melted fat and tender meat easily, and I loved the sauce, a thick jus with just the right balance of sweet and sour. The lamb had all the right flavours, with the basil complementing the chillies. The noodles were light with crunchy vegetables, and the rice was very, very nice  with plump shrimps, chicken strips and lamb. All in all, it was an excellent meal.The portions are generous, too. We were hungry when we went there, but found that we had to take home some left overs, which turned into our dinner that evening. So I must say its value for money, too.I cheer all the new restaurants coming up in town, but I toast the old ones in particular. Its not easy to keep old clients happy, meal after meal."

Often they are reduced to a mere statistic.But they only wish for a better life and want nothing more than a chance to earn a living.Express met some of these migrant workers and found out what keeps them going in a state far away from home and where people speak an unfamiliar tongue. Everyone acknowledged that language was a big barrier, but that with time, they figure out how to work around it. As many of them work with others who speak Hindi, it fosters a sense of family and belonging.The people in Chennai are very nice but not knowing Tamil is a huge problem, said Rabi Marandi (24) from a village in Jharkhand. There are about two-three others from my village who work with me here and the rest of the people too speak Hindi. But who doesnt miss family?Many of these workers have to live in rooms built of tin or asbestos sheets. During the summer, this can be like a microwave oven as six-seven people share a room.Chennai is extremely hot during summers, said Mohammad Isa of West Bengal who has been coming to the city the last seven years. I dread to come here during this period but what can I do? The work seems to be here. It isnt that there is no work in West Bengal, but it is not regular work.If I had the ability to work in my home town and provide for my family, why would I leave to come here? said 39-year-old Jitendra from Gorakhpur. I have been coming to Chennai for the last 10-12 years. I miss my wife and children terribly and I have to speak to them at least four-five times a day.For 33-year-old Rintu Sheikh from Kolkata, being separated from his three-year-old daughter for months is heart-breaking. I am missing out on watching my daughter grow, Sheikh rues. I just keep pacifying myself that I am doing this so she has a better future. I have four more months to go before I go home and I cant wait to see how much she has grown.Food too is major barrier for migrants from up north. For people used to a staple diet of rotis, rice is a big change. While many of the workers said they made their own food, some confessed they did not have the time or facilities to cook. For those from West Bengal, sweets were what they missed the most.Chennai just doesnt match up in sweets, declared Isa. In my village, my neighbour used to make sweets every day out of fresh milk. I think about it and start drooling!Up close and personalRam SinghAge 23He has been working as a painter here for the last eight years. He is from Gorakhpur, and has a thick Bhojpuri accent. While in Chennai, he relies on some Tamil words he has picked up over the years, and sign language to communicate with non-Hindi speaking workers. I stay with others from UP in a room in Neelankarai. so language isnt a problem, he quips. Its almost like living with family. But if there was work in UP, I wouldve preferred to stay there. He watches movies on his phone in his free time. He cannot stop gushing about popular Bhojpuri actor Dinesh Lal Yadav. I watch at least three films a day, he beamed. I just watched Andaz Apna Apna for the nth time! I dont like Hindi films these days though, and watch Bhojpuri films because they have everything  action, drama, romance, songs.Sumitra Maity Age 37She seems demure at first. Her petite frame could fool anyone, but the 37-year-old woman from a small village in West Bengal works in the scorching heat all day, helping men with construction work. Earlier, she used to make mats but when her husband, Srikantho Maity, met with an accident, a lot of money was spent on his operation. Making mats could not generate enough income for the family. This is the first time Ive left home, she rues as her husband translates from Bengali to Hindi. It has been an experience. While I am happy that I am with my husband, I really miss my daughters. One of her girls is 16 and is married, while the other is 12 and stays with her in-laws in her village. She missed being around women as there is only one other woman at her construction site.Bablu KumarAge 24It isnt just construction workers who flock to Chennai for work. There are those who engage in other work, like Bablu Kumar. A vegetable seller in UP, Kumar (24) becomes a kulfi and ice-cream seller in Chennai every year from Pongal till June. He has been doing this for over 10 years. I would have sold vegetables here also but I dont know Tamil so that is a problem, he said. Selling kulfis in the summer makes sense. I generally go from Neelankarai beach till Thiruvanmiyur beach as most people who buy from me are beach-goers. He does however make a special stop everyday around 11:00 am at a construction site where there are others from UP. I come to this site every morning, he said. I have friends who I can speak to in my language and that feels very good."

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will lay the foundation stone for a dharmashala, the second to be built on the premises by Infosys Foundation, at a cost of Rs 60 crore.Chemotherapy may last weeks, months or years depending on the severity of the case.For the benefit of patients and their attendants, the municipal corporation funded the first dharmashala, the Sri Venkateshwara Dharmashala, in 1984 which accomodates 400 patients. The Infosys Foundation sponsored the second dharmashala a few years later with the same capacity. Now, a third one will be constructed.There are cancer patients from North India who have to stay here for as long as one year for radiotherapy. There are already two dharamshalas, but they are inadequate. The new facility will have a capacity of 300 people. The construction will take nearly a year, Kidwai authorities said.On Saturday evening, a music performance for the patients was under way at Sri Venkateshwara Dharmashala. It is a part of what we call devotional therapy, to take the patients mind off cancer and chemotherapy. We have donors coming to perform, distribute fruits, clothes, buckets and other necessities, said on-duty nurse Dakshayini V.The dharmashala has three floors with a dormitory hall for male and female patients that costs Rs 100 per week, while single rooms with no bathroom cost Rs 200 and single room with attached bathroom costs Rs 300. The patients and their attendants are served three meals a day.Venkatalakshmamma (82) has uterine cancer and hails from Chikkabalapur. Her caretaker daughter Gayathri queues up to collect their share of steaming porridge, rice and sambhar. We have a BPL card so its free for us. The facilities are good here. We would have had spent lakhs together in a private hospital. Her dormmates include patients from Gadag, Shivamogga and other districts.The Infosys Dharmashala has a pain relief centre where we administer the patients with morphine. A lot of end-stage patients are given palliative care there. It is flooded with patients from West Bengal there, said nurse Dakshayini."
5922e1b17be9e01fc7f5b1bb,Here's how Wajid Ali Shah made the Kolkata biryani,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heres-how-wajid-ali-shah-made-the-kolkata-biryani/articleshow/58622647.cms,2017-05-11,"You could take the Nawab out of Lucknow, but could you ever take Lucknow out of the Nawab? Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."

The government sourced rice from West Bengal and the issue was solved. The price of rice in the open market plummeted. Only branded and packaged rice was sold at more than Rs. 50 a kg as alleged by the Opposition.He said ration shops would be modernised. More essential items would be added to the list of subsidised commodities available to PDS beneficiaries.Biometric cards would be issue to all and point of sales machines installed at ration shops."

SubrahmanyamC.V.SubrahmanyamThe alleged Rs. 1,600-crore money laundering case took a new turn with Visakhapatnam Commissioner of Police T. Yoganand stating that Rs. 800 crore was shipped as outward remittances to foreign destinations from one single account in a public sector bank located on Netaji Subha Chandra Bose Road in Kolkata in 2016.Raising doubts over the involvement of several other persons, including the suspected connivance of bankers, he said it was in this same bank that Rs. 90 crore cash was deposited in one single account on a single day. How can such huge amount of cash deposit go unnoticed or unquestioned by the bankers, he questioned.The Visakhapatnam city police on Monday produced before the media the prime accused, Vaddi Mahesh, who was arrested on Sunday evening at the Visakhapatnam airport, as soon as he landed from Kolkata.Addressing the media, Mr. Yoganand said the case has been handed over to the AP-CID for further investigation, as the city police does not have the required trained officers to handle an economic offence case of this magnitude.We neither have the manpower nor the expertise. Moreover, the case has to be dealt pan-India and coordinated with various other investigating agencies, both nationally and internationally, such as CBI, ED and Interpol. The CID also has the powers to declare the red and blue corner notices, as and when required. And the decision to hand over the case was taken after consultation with DGP N. Sambasiva Rao, said Mr. Yoganand.Mahesh is the main and the first one to be arrested among the nine accused, who were named in the FIR that was filed by the Income Tax Department at MVP Police Station in Visakhapatnam last Friday.The case was initially investigated and unearthed by an IT Department team led by Income Tax Joint Director (Investigations) MVN Seshu Bhavanarayana.After three months of investigation, the IT department zeroed in on the accused, Vaddi Mahesh, his father, Vaddi Srinivasa Rao, and two of his cousins, Achanta Harish and Achanta Rajesh, and five others.According to Mr. Yoganand, Harish and Rajesh have been questioned, and the hunt is on for Srinivasa Rao and five others.As per the initial questioning, Mahesh reportedly claimed that they were under invoicing imported rice cookers, alcohol and cigarettes to evade Customs Duty. But this appears to be a wrong statement, as the IT department had filed a FIR stating that Mahesh and his gang had opened 12 shell companies and were operating 30 fictitious accounts to launder about Rs. 1600 crore since 2013 by remitting to five foreign companies  one in China, three in Singapore and one in Hong Kong  fraudulently towards purchase of customised software with the help of forged documents. A few of the accused also posses at least two Aadhaar cards that were used to open the accounts.According to a senior officer from the department of Income Tax, Mahesh was used as a tool, as he was taking a commission of 85 paisa for every US Dollar transhipped.The people behind Mahesh, who deposited the money, were to be caught in the further investigation, he said."

The case was handed over to the AP CID as the city cops do not have the required machinery to investigate the case.""In view of various events that will be held in the next three months and also the lack of an economic offences wing in the city, we have handed over the case to the AP CID,"" the CP said.The case also involves coordinating with other national and international investigating agencies including the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. The case was unearthed by I-T department led by income tax joint director (investigations) MVN Seshu Bhavanarayana.Yoganand said after interrogating Mahesh for a day, it came to light that a few businessmen from north India were also involved in the scam. During interrogation, Mahesh reportedly claimed that the companies were under invoicing prices of imported rice cookers, alcohol and cigarettes to evade customs duty, Yoganand said.The FIR filed by the I-T department stated that Mahesh and others had opened 12 shell companies and were operating 30 dubious accounts that remitted about Rs 1,300 crore since 2013 to five foreign companies in China, Singapore and Hong Kong to purchase customised software with the help of forged documents. As per the IT department's preliminary investigation, Mahesh has opened many proprietary concerns or partnership firms in the names of his employees to facilitate transfer of funds and reported turnovers. The analysis of the bank accounts pertaining to the accused indicates total inward domestic remittance of Rs 680.94 crore. Of this, Rs 569.93 crore was remitted to five foreign companies for the purchase of customised software. But no software was ever purchased from these companies."

With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"

Express Photo by Partha Paul Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. Express Photo by Partha Paul50 years ago, on May 25, an uprising in this North Bengal block changed the politics of the country, and continues to agitate it. But where it all started, the original rebels have little strength left against a new breed of landowners, the land mafia, allowing BJP a foothold in its ideological battle against the Left. Esha Roy goes to the ground.In March 1967, after years of oppression by landlords, the peasants of Naxalbari village in North Bengals Darjeeling district rose up in revolt, in one of the countrys most defining uprisings. Under Charu Majumdar, Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal, the Naxals, as they came to be known, seized land from the jotedars (landlords), grains from their godowns and distributed it among the peasants.The State retaliated by torturing villages, leading to May 24, when thousands gheraoed a police party at Jharujote. Inspector Sonam Wangdi was killed, three officers were injured. The next day, at Bengai Jote, 11 villagers, including eight women and two children, were shot dead by police. The firing would trigger an armed guerrilla resistance that, 50 years later, continues to inspire other such movements in the country, including in neighbouring Nepal and the Maoists. Today, as tea workers pick the First Flush of Darjeeling in Naxalbaris lush tea estates, the blood bath is a distant memory.Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)As the CPI (ML) Liberation and other fractured smaller Left parties prepare for the 50th anniversary of the uprising, the preparations are low-key. The headlines have instead been hijacked by the BJP, after its president Amit Shah chose Naxalbari to begin his tour of the five states where the party is yet to make his mark including, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana. Addressing party workers, Shah said, This is the place where violence had started. Now this is the same Naxalbari where Modijis Sabka Saath, Sabka Bikash slogan can be heard. I have full faith that development will defeat the violence.On May 29, says Naxalbari block BJP president Dilip Barui, the party unit will be inducting 220 new members. Asserting that the party presence in the region once dominated by the Left is steadily growing, Barui says, Local leaders and workers from the CPM, Congress and TMC from Naxalbari, Matigara, Bagdogra, Batasi will be joining us.Barui also points out that in the last panchayat elections, held in 2014, the BJP won one or two seats in every panchayat. In the 2016 Assembly polls, its candidate came in third, close on the heels of the TMC. While the Congress-CPM joint candidate won, the BJP leader says the gap is closing. This is a Left-dominated area. But people know there is no point supporting the Left any longer. The BJP is the future.Abhijeet Majumdar, the Darjeeling district secretary of the CPI(ML) Liberation and the son of Charu Majumdar, says there is more to the BJP campaign than the tussle for Naxalbari. Amit Shah knows that there is only one faction that can stand up to the huge Hindutva surge in the country. After the BJPs victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections, he did not celebrate. Instead his statement was that the BJPs golden era would come only when Bengal and Kerala are taken. He knows it is only with the death of the Left that Hindutva can flourish in the country.The six gram panchayats that make up the Naxalbari block are a patchwork of old tea estates, but now there is a new rush in the air. The National Highway that cuts through the area is being widened to a six-lane road, flyovers are being constructed, hotels and flashy malls have sprung up. And once again, real estate is at a premium.However, unlike that time half a century ago, with its call of Langor jaar, jamin taar (land belongs to those who till it), the battle for land today is more insidious. There are no loud protests or gunfire as the new breed of landlords, the land mafia, mops up chunks. Mani Mahatos 22-year-old primary school for tribal children in Jharujote, a stones throw away from where Inspector Wangdi was killed, shut down in 2011. Well-respected in the area, he no longer teaches, instead selling chaat from a small stall.Mahato recalls how they had all got land after the 1967 movement. But several years ago, people claiming to be descendants of our landlords came, propped up by the land mafia. The mafia told us to give up our land in return for compensation. They also said we would have to fight long-drawn battles in court. We were all scared. So most of us gave up our land. I got Rs 2 lakh for my 1.5 bighas, he says.Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul)He adds that many descendants later turned out to be fake but, when the real ones came, they too struck a deal with the land mafia. The mafia has been selling off land to people from Manipur, Nagaland and Shillong. Nepali families who cant buy land there have come here to settle down. The land grab means that members of the 50-odd tribal families who live in the village and had tilled the land earlier are now daily wagers. Most people have left. They have gone to Kerala, Gujarat and Chennai in search of work, Mahato says.He admits he supported the BJP candidate in the last panchayat polls (he lost by a mere 40 votes). The CPM did nothing for us, nor did the TMC. When they first came to power, I thought maybe this new party will help. We have tried the Congress, the Left, the TMC. Let us give the BJP a chance.Among the early members of the Naxal guerrilla force was Kandra Murmu, 62, who continues to live in Bittan Jote, once a part of the Naxal liberated zone. Like his village, his life is sedate now. Hailing from a family of bhagchashis (share croppers), Murmu tills his one bigha of land. He used to grow paddy, now he grows jute. His son helps. But the battle for land has returned.Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul)When the andolan was over, Charu Majumdar made sure we all got land. Jotedars were eliminated and we got pattas. But it turns out that in legal government documents, the land still belongs to the landlord. I registered my complaint to the panchayat but nothing changes, he says. After a pause, he adds, Its not possible to take up arms again. That atmosphere is just not conducive.Murmu joined the Naxals when 12, and spent many years underground. He is sad at the fate of the agitation he gave some of his best years to. If it wasnt for Naxalbari, zamindari would still exist in the country. But farmers still dont have land rights. It is a different kind of battle now, more difficult. But the government and the political parties are self-serving.Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. We have received reports of this. But the government has issued pattas to tribal families to cultivate these plots and if they are selling these on their own volition, there is nothing we can do, she says, adding their hands are tied without a complaint. We have come to know plots are being sold to outsiders at Rs 3-4 lakh a plot. At some point, we will take action, she adds.Shanti Munda, 74, one of the most well-known faces of the Naxalbari movement, who joined the protests as a young mother with her newborn, says the situation is the same in her Hathighisa village, neighbouring Naxalbari village. There are no jobs here. People cant eat. In order to sustain themselves, they have sold off their land. As many as 16 tea gardens have shut down in the Dooars. In this area alone, four tea gardens have shut down. The government says it is providing rice at Rs 2 a kg for the affected tea garden workers. But you need to be able to earn to even pay that Rs 2, she says.Munda, who unsuccessfully contested the local elections in 1982, winning just 3,500 votes, adds that Modis people keep visiting her. They came one-and-a-half months ago, just before Shahs visit. They said, We will do the work here, what you tried with the bullet, we will bring with the ballot. Another time they came to me and said that they would construct a new village at Hathighisa, make it a model one.Nantu Ghoshs family has owned a Hero cycle dealership for over 35 years in Naxalbari town, which is like any other flourishing Indian town. Rows of shops selling electronics, garments, sweets, furniture jostle for space. The town was never that affected by the Naxals, Ghosh says. There is a BSF camp here, so they mainly steered clear. Nevertheless there was an atmosphere of fear.Now, the 60-year-old believes, the Naxal movement is finished for good. Nothing good can happen in India. There is so much corruption, all parties are the same. If the Naxals couldnt bring about changes, nobody can. We have a Congress MLA here but he won because of the alliance with the CPM. But the Left is waning too. We feel that if there is a party that can compete with Mamata Banerjee now, it is the BJP.Ghosh understands that much of what parties do is petty politics. But adds, The Naxal leaders are all dead Kanu Sanyal died in abject poverty. In this day and age, one has to look after ones family, you have to survive. You cant be a revolutionary.Naxalbari Sharada Shishu Tirtha Vidyalaya was established in 1999 by RSS swayamsevak Sujit Das, who is also the schools Pradhan Acharya (principal). It began as a single rented room in Naxalbari village, but by 2002 had amassed enough funds to buy a two-acre plot in a quieter part of Naxalbari town. The school now caters to 539 students, mostly from Rajbongshi (SC) and Adivasi (ST) communities, and has expanded up to Class VIII. It is one of the largest primary schools in Naxalbari and Das says the aim is to grow up to Class X. He says he has applied for registration with the Education Department. When we started, Naxalbari had just one government higher secondary school and some private primary schools. People wanted to send their children to school. They just didnt have anywhere to send them, says Das.Apart from regular schooling, the students learn yoga, moral science and music, where they are taught patriotic songs. Das says they are encouraged to eat vegetarian food.At shivir camps at the school, children stay for two-three days to learn the correct lifestyle, and are also taken to tribal areas and tea gardens to distribute clothes and food to the underprivileged. We have many such social activities. When Panighata tea garden shut down, we provided food to the 11 tea garden families for a month and a half, says Das.It helps that about 60 per cent of North Bengals votes lie in its tea gardens. Das is also the advisor to the RSS shakha which operates in Naxalbari town. While he does not reveal numbers, he says membership to the RSS is growing. Seventeen of Naxalbaris young swayamsevaks just left for Muslim-dominated Malda district for a camp.The Left realises the danger it is facing. Outside the office of the CPI(ML) Liberation, a large sign says: Resist the onslaught of BJP-RSS combine. As part of the Naxalbari Golden Jubilee Celebrations, the CPI (ML) Liberation has planned marches and a large public event at Siliguri, where Communists from across the country are expected to come. Seventy-five cultural activist troupes from across the country will perform.Sitting inside, beneath photos of Left icons such as Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong, Abhijeet Majumdar, laments that the Left remains disjointed to take on the BJP onslaught. Right after the BJP came to power in 2014, we held a Central Committee meeting in Delhi. We resolved that keeping in mind that the BJP had a corporate-fascist agenda, it was imperative that all the Left parties come together and form a united front. We even invited the Aam Aadmi Party. The first person to respond to this was Prakash Karat. But the initiative remained still-born.The vice-president of the TMCs Darjeeling district unit, Amar Sinha, insists they are not worried about the BJP. In Naxalbari, the BJP is basically the RSS. They are playing their usual dirty communal politics. We conduct awareness campaigns, explain to people what this is. No doubt, some are swayed by the BJP. But many are not.West Bengal Congress general secretary O P Mishra calls Shahs visit nothing more than good optics for the BJP. The Congress-CPM combine is strong here. Mishra also claims that the land mafia in the area is controlled by the TMC. Naxalbari is close to Siliguri and located at the foothills of Darjeeling. So the land prices have been going up. This is being exploited by the land mafia. But when the administration and police are partisan, it becomes difficult for us to do anything. With the tea gardens shutting down, the economic situation has worsened, making people more desperate. Shanti Munda says it may be too early to write the Left obituary. People believe that the Naxals are irrelevant, this is not true. It is not over yet. We will be back.Agrees CPI(ML) general secretary Partha Ghosh. Our numbers may have come down, the Naxals may have been wiped out, but every one who resists is a Naxal  the student in JNU who stood up to Smriti Irani, the Maruti factory worker who resists oppression, those in the movements against POSCO.To read this article in Malayalam, click hereFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Murali KumarTwo-time defending champion Mosinet Geremew will be the man to beat at the TCS World 10k here on Sunday. The 25-year-old Ethiopian is in a rich vein of form, after having won the Yangzhou International Half Marathon in China last month in a time of 60:56.Athletes are strong here, said Geremew when asked why he likes it here in Bengaluru. Its also a good time to run. But I dont like the hot weather.The weather may well put a spanner in the works. In a departure from the past, the Elite mens race will be the last event of the day, starting at 8.50 a.m., nearly an hour and a half later than last year. With the city in the midst of a blistering summer  the heavy rain on Thursday notwithstanding  it remains to be seen how adverse its effect will be.It is scaring the hell out of me, said New Zealands Zane Robertson with a laugh. I went for a run at 5.30 a.m. and it was hot. But I have been training in the desert for this race. I have prepared with the aim of breaking the course record (27:44) here.The 27-year-old, who trains in Kenya, ran the fastest 10km time in the world last year, clocking 27:28 in Berlin and is one of the contenders here.Geremew was once his training partner. So was 10k World Record-holder Leonard Komon, the other big name in the fray.Kenyas Komon, who set the record of 26:44 way back in 2010, has endured more than his fair share of injuries.But after having finished a strong 12th at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in March, he hoped this year would be his best year.Cheptai the biggest drawIn the womens field, the 2016 winner Peres Jepchirchir isnt returning, but the reigning womens world cross country champion, Kenyas Irene Cheptai, will be the biggest draw. Compatriot Gladys Chesir, the fastest woman in the field with a personal best of 30:41, would hope for better luck after a heat stroke cut short her challenge for second spot with roughly a kilometre to go in the last edition.Competition is also expected from former champions Helah Kiprop (2012) and Wude Yimer (2010), who finished second and third respectively in 2016.The Indian Elite field will, however, wear a depleted look. Defending champions G. Lakshmanan and Swati Gadhave are both missing, because of the Federation Cup athletics championships, which will start in ten days time and serve as the selection trials for the Asian Championship in Bhubaneswar in July.So are M.D. Yunus, winner of the 2016 Kolkata 25K, and Monica Athare, the Half Marathon champion at the 2017 Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon."
59355d327be9e061b17371d9,The summer vacations are here again,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/the-summer-vacations-are-here-again/articleshow/58772094.cms,2017-05-21,"By- Partha Sarthi Sen SharmaSummer days are here again. For anybody who has spent his childhood in the North Indian plains, the two abiding memories of his summer perhaps would be the deliciously awaited mangoes and summer vacations.In the peak of summer afternoons, when going out was prohibited by the grown-ups, one remembers the greedy, slurpy helpings of delicious Dussehries and Langdas, all floating in a bucket of water, in verandas that were cocooned with 'chiks'. Just like now, there was a short span of a few weeks when the fruit vendors and bazaars were overwhelmed with a virtual glut of delicious and soft yellow Dussehries and greenish yellow Langdas. Yes, there were others, the Alphonsoes and the Totaparis and a couple of weeks later the Ratauls but delicious as they were, they had their niche fans-like the Talat Mahmoods and Hemant Kumars but the Dussehries and Langdas were the Rafi and Kishore--the bread and butter delicacies of everyday. Nothing could beat the sheer pleasure of sucking on a mango and then peeling and devouring its insides with sticky fingers.Cutting them into pieces and using spoon and fork was reserved only for the occasional guests. An mango shake was a delicacy alright but it lacked the easy spontaneity of eating a mango in its natural form.The other memory of those distant summers is that of the much awaited school vacations. I still remember that due to some strange reason, my government school had a vacation of 50 days, till the last week of June, while all the other schools used to enjoy vacation till early July. The pain of going to school in those last weeks of June, year after year, when my sister could still enjoy 10 more days of summer vacation, rankles to this day! Mostly, most of my friends and we would stay in our homes for large parts of those vacations, even when none of us had ever heard of terms like `staycation'. This was partly because the father didn't have summer vacation, unless he was a school teacher himself, and also because of the money that was required to go for an extended holiday anywhere. In those days, going on vacation usually meant going to a grandparent's house, maternal or paternal, sure in the belief that the grandchildren would always be welcomed with open arms.So, we would be travelling on the Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express chair-car to Kolkata. In those days, the Rajdhani Express ran only to Kolkata and Mumbai.They were, unlike today, the acknowledged pride of the Indian Railways and had a chair-car for an 18-hour journey. The plush coaches with piped music and covered tube lights, attendants in sharp uniforms, tea served in thermos, foil-wrapped chapatis and rice and chicken curry were a class apart. I can still feel the tingle of excitement, re membering how we used to await the journey, standing at the platform of New Delhi railway station, amid the din and heat and dust, waiting for the coaches to arrive. The thought of discomfort of sitting through an 18-hour journey never crossed our tiny minds. We just couldn't imagine anything more in those days and you can't miss what you can't even imagine! Today, too, the summer vacations have started, not for me, but for my daughter and perhaps one would go for a short trip in air-conditioned vehicles to one of the overrated hill stations, stay for a few days in an overpriced hotel and perhaps even enjoy it but the excitement of those childhood summer vacations, with their mango-filled aroma, long train journeys and chik-covered verandas would always remain with me as the most cherished of memories!(The writer is a Lucknow enthusiast and an IAS officer.

593bc9387be9e04956d788b6,Worth going ‘Fidahh’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/worth-going-fidahh/article18587550.ece,2017-05-27,"As Iran elected its president, I was reminded of a band of young Iranian friends I had way back in time. In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food.

I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."

(Source: PTI Photo) The animal markets are meant for farmers and not for traders, Jaitley said, adding that this is the only effect of the notification. (Source: PTI Photo)The row over beef eating and cattle trade kept the political cauldron astir on Thursday despite Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys attempt to calm frayed tempers by insisting the new central notification will not interfere with state laws on slaughtering animals. Following several days of protests, particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Jaitley told a press conference in New Delhi that the ban imposed by the Centre on sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter had nothing to do with state legislations.The animal markets are meant for farmers and not for traders, he said, adding that this is the only effect of the notification.Every state has its own legislation or no legislation (with regard to slaughter of cattle). You have provision in the Constitution Article 48 (Directive Principles) which says that certain category of animals have to be protected, Jaitley said.Prohibition of cow slaughter mentioned in Article 48 of the Constitution is not an enforceable article, but a Directive Principle of State Policy.West Bengals feisty Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been at the forefront of the oppositions attack on the ban, added a new twist to the row, claiming the Centre was planning to omit buffalo from the abmit of its notification to favour certain people close to BJP involved in trade of its meat.Some people close to the BJP are involved in the buffalo meat trade and that is why, they (Centre) are planning to allow the slaughter of buffaloes, she told a public meeting in Tarakeshwar in West Bengal.Assailing vigilantism in the name of cow protection, she said,The BJP has got only 29 per cent of the votes, but they are trying to bulldoze the entire people. Who are they to decide what one will eat? Who are they to decide what one will wear? It is a matter of personal choice.Notwithstanding Jaitleys attempt to pacify those angry at the ban, a top leader of the RSS, the BJPs ideological mentor, denounced beef parties being organised to protest the Modi governments measure as against humanity, and suggested that they should change their ways.Those who are doing this (hosting beef parties) are just a few in the population of 121 crore. They do not represent the opinion of the nation. Their act is against humanity and they should change their ways, veteran RSS leader Indresh Kumar told a press conference at Jaipur.Cow milk is healthier than beef. Milk is medicine while beef makes you prone to diseases. People should understand this and not eat beef, Kumar said.There also was a bit of political churning in Meghalaya where a senior BJP leader, who had announced a beef party in his hometown to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modis three years in office, resigned from the party.BJP district president of Garo Hills Bernard Rimpu Marak, who had joined the party last year, was understood to have been asked to put in his papers. He, however, claimed his resignation was to protest the BJPs stand on beef.In the interest of the Garo people, I have put in my papers today as a mark of protest against the partys stand on beef, Marak told PTI.I have resigned because I am a Christian and a Garo first. Steps taken by the party, especially in the Garo Hills, are not in the interest of the people, he said.Marak had in a Facebook post yesterday said the BJP in Garo Hills will organise a bitchy-beef party to celebrate three years of Modi government. Bitchy is a local alcoholic brew made from rice which is consumed during festivals.Reacting to Maraks post, BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli had told reporters that the party will either sack him or ask him to tender his resignation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It is as much about eating as it is about fasting. Sehri (a pre-dawn meal) and iftar (an evening meal to break the fast) are the two meals every day during this holy month when Muslim families across India relish delicacies, some of which are especially made during Ramzan.The idea of the sehri meal is to eat food that is high in protein, is easily digestible and does not leave you thirsty for the rest of the day. Khajla (a kind of pancake) and pheni (a vermicelli dish) are integral to this meal in North India. Bakeries in Muslim localities make special breads during Ramzan, to be eaten with milk for sehri. Big bowls containing salan (non-veg curry) with pieces of chapatti mixed in it are part of the pre-dawn meal of Muslim families in Delhi and Lucknow.The iftar meal is the one to which believers look forward; preparing which women in the families spend their afternoons. Except dates which find a mention in Islamic history (it is believed that prophet Mohammad used to break his fast with dates) and are common in iftar meals across the world, rest of the delicacies eaten for sehri and iftar are influenced by a given region or states history, culture and cuisine (read the accompanying stories).Fruits and smoothies such as Baebri Boel (a popular drink in Kashmir) are consumed primarily for their nutritional value while snacks such asunnakaya (Kerala), haleem (Hyderabad) and bhajiya (Kolkata) reflect the Indian fondness for all things spicy.HYDERABAD: HALEEMHaleem is much in demand in Hyderabad in the month of Ramzan. (HT Photo.)The one festival that Hyderabadis across faiths wait for is Ramzan. This is the only time when they get an opportunity to relish their favourite local food item  Haleem.Haleem, made of meat, wheat, dry fruits and spices, is now incredibly popular because Hyderabad haleem, was given the Geographical Indication certification in August 2010.After fasting throughout the day, Muslim families look forward to having haleem for dinner.Hyderabadi haleem is made of meat  preferably that of goat or sheep and pounded wheat (not exactly atta) The two are then cooked together in pure ghee.The meat and wheat mixture along with spices are cooked in a bhatti (a cauldron made of iron and inserted in a kiln made of brick and mud) on a low flame, with cooks stirring the mixture continuously using wooden paddles or sticks for 10-12 hours.It is garnished with fried onion, coriander and slices of lemon. Occasionally, boiled eggs are also served with haleem.It is believed that haleem originated in Iran, but became popular in Hyderabad during the reign of the Asaf Jahis or Nizams in the 18th century. Since then, it has gained prominence in the Deccan.According to Ifteqar, a steward at a popular Irani restaurant at Mehdipatnam, haleem is not only tasty, but also highly nutritious. It has carbohydrates in the form of wheat, proteins in the form of meat besides spices, which are good sources of minerals and vitamins. At the same time, it is very soft on the stomach because of prolonged cooking, he said. For vegetarians, there is vegetarian Haleem. The ingredients and recipe remain the same minus meat.

(Kunal Patil/HT Photo.)Rohit Khanvilkar, 36, travels 40 km every year for seven plates of meat hes not likely to find anywhere else. The pharmaceutical engineer makes his pilgrimage from Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, where he lives and braves train crowds and angry traffic to get to Surti 12 Handi, in Bori Mohalla close to Mohammad Ali Road. The 80-year-old eatery is open all year round but sees the biggest crowds in the 30 days leading up to Ramzan Eid.Its the home of the original baraah handi, a banquet of seven dishes that is slow-cooked for 10 hours with spices on sunken granite until the meat is rendered soft and succulent.Ive come here during the rains, after 12-hour shifts, and once, right after a break-up, says Khanvilkar. Its worth the trek. You wont find food this comforting and people this generous, he says, gesturing to .proprietor Gulam Mustafa Hafiz Ismail Surti.Ismail, 68, has been working at Surti 12 Handi for 52 years. If it werent for his weak knees, hed still be at the counter cooking from scratch, he says.There have been several baraah handi knock-offs over the years  some on Mohammed Ali Road, some as far away as Jogeshwari in the western suburbs.You wont find this taste anywhere else. Not outside Bohri Mohalla, and definitely not outside Bombay, says Ismail.  (By Roshni Nair)KOZHIKODE: UNNAKAYAIn Malabar which has a sizeable Muslim population, unnakaya is eaten as part of iftar meal and also as a dessert after dinner. (HT Photo.)Visit any corner of Kerala during the holy month of Ramzan and you will be struck by the mouth-watering aroma of spices, ghee and coconut oil that wafts through the air. Unnakaya  a sweet dish made of banana and grated coconut  is a part of Keralas iftar platter. Some prefer having the rich sweet as a dessert after the main course, which usually comprises biryani, a dish of rice and slow-cooked meat.Banana, the main ingredient in this delicacy, is a good source of vitamin C and potassium. It helps the body fight infectious agents; controls heart rate and blood pressure; and coconut is high in dietary fibre and improves digestion. Unnakaya is more popular in northern Kerala than other parts of the state.Depending on the availability of time and ingredients, some people prepare fresh Unnakaya minutes before sunset, the time at which Muslims break their fast. Those who cannot, especially office-goers, are often buy it from eateries.Recipe:Steam the banana in a pressure cooker with the peel. Remove the peel after steaming.Heat a pan. Add a little sugar to water and boil it. Add grated coconut and stir. Add cardamom, raisin and stir. Set aside.Grate the steamed banana. Once it becomes a paste, shape the paste into small balls. Smear your palm with coconut oil and stuff the coconut-sugar mix into the balls, wrapping banana paste around the filling. Keep wrapping and shapinfg until you are left with the shape of a spindle.Put oil in a pan and heat it. Fry the spindle-shaped banana fillings. Once it turns golden brown, its ready to be served.

(Waseem Andrabi/HT Photo.)Kand Sharbat or Baebri Boel Sharbat is a popular sweet beverage in Kashmir. Basil seeds are the main ingredient. It is found in every Kashmiri households iftar meal. Grandmothers say it gives an instant sugar high but is also loaded with the goodness of milk and dry fruits  a must after fasting for 15 hours.

Besides acting as a coolant, the seeds are beneficial for those diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes because they help regulate blood sugar. Drinking milk with basil seeds before going to bed is also good for constipation.Recipe:Soak the babri beoul seeds in water for one day or 3-4 hours; until the seeds swell.Add milk, cardamons and dry coconut.Add sugar according to taste.Stir the mixture.

Secondly, it will not remain a special attraction if we sell it throughout the year.

(Mujeeb Faruqui/HT Photo)Nukti Khaare, a Ramzan dish that is common across Bhopal, is, in fact, a combination of three snacks: Nukti, a yellow sweet made of gram flour; anardaana, made of slit black gram; and khaarey, which is essentially, sev, crunchy noodles made from chickpea flour paste.While the yellow nukti, also known as nukti daana is found in northern India, the addition of anardaana is unique to Bhopal.The Nukti is typically eaten with Khaare or sev, which is salty.Nukti and khaare are sold separately. They are mixed together before eating. The result, a sweet and salty snack, is a staple iftar dish in many families. (By Punya Priya Mitra)"

Pradip Halder, 48, has appeared for the medical entrance examination 17 times, every year since 2000, and is single-mindedly pursuing his dream to become a doctor someday.Halder, a father of two daughters and a son, took the entrance test this year too and is waiting for the results. His target: to secure a rank within 500 in the SC category that will enable him to secure a seat in a government-run medical college.Read: AICTE approves single entrance test for engineering courses from next yearThe best rank he has got is 1,725. I have to get within the top 500 which can secure me a place in a state-run medical college, Halder told HT.Halder passed plus two level exam in 2000. Since then he has appeared in the medical entrance test every year. (HT Photo)He is also praying that the common medical entrance test does not become mandatory, or even if it, the upper age limit of 30 years for an SC candidate (25 years in the general category) is relaxed. Incidentally, Bengal that does not have any age ceiling. Bengal has got about 2,700 MBBS seats in state-run and private medical colleges.A resident of Pratappur in Krishnaganj of Nadia district in Bengal, a distance of about 125 km from Kolkata, Halder is a poor man. He earns just about Rs 4,000 a month working as an agriculture labourer a month. He has inherited homestead land and does not have any land of his own.When it rains, the walls of bamboo and roof of tin of his house are not even enough to prevent the water from coming in. He could not enroll his name in the BPL list, and therefore, did not get benefits such as cheap rice and a basic house.Halder, whose hairs are graying fast, is not at all perturbed by the jibes that regularly fly at him. Villagers often ridicule me as I prepare and appear for the test every year. But I am not deterred. I will be a doctor one day, he said, the grit apparent in his voice.Read: SC clears common medical entrance test NEET, approves Centres scheduleA resident of a remote Bengal village, where quacks pass off as doctors for the thousands of villagers, Halder is quite an aberration. Why didnt he start practising as a quack, or work as an assistant to a qualified doctor?Halder standing in front of his house. (HT Photo)I dont believe in cheating people. I have confidence in myself and will keep appearing for the entrance test till I qualify, Halder asserted.In 2013, he got in touch with me. I was impressed by his passion, and decided to take him under my wings. His ranks are going up every year. I am really hopeful that he will realise his dream someday, Dr A K Maity told HT. Maity who is a retired government doctor now runs a coaching centre for medical aspirants in Kolkata.Read: Govt bans 32 private medical colleges from admitting students for two yearsSince then every year, Maity brings Halder to Kolkata, puts him up at a shared cheap accommodation for four to six weeks before the entrance examination and helps him prepare for the test. He funds all expenses of Halder during this period.But even he cracks it this time, how will Halder fund his studies? With reference books and hostel expenses, any amount is out of reach of this poor labourer.If I can secure admission, I will fund the studies by some means or the other. There are a lot of kind souls such as Dr Maity who are eager to help me, said Halder. This is the only time the grit in his voice faded and it appeared to be choking a bit.Born in 1969, Halder passed class X from Bengal board in 1986. Then poverty forced him to take a gap. In 2000, he passed plus two level with English, Hindi, physics, chemistry and biology. From that year, began his tryst with the medical entrance exam."
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Till Wednesday, the same hoteliers had stood by tourists and asked them to stay back despite the shut-down call by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). The hoteliers weren't worried as markets were open and transport was unaffected. But things have changed drastically after Thursday's announcement of an indefinite shutdown in the Hills.""What can we do? We can't buy provisions. We are even running short of items like rice and cereals. If this bandh continues, there is no saying when we will get supplies. We are also very concerned as transporters aren't running their vehicles. It is better to ask the guests to leave,"" a hotel owner said.A crowd had gathered at the Motor Stand in Chowkbazar on Fridaymorning. There were tourists, migrant labourers and a large number of policemen. The only things missing were vehicles. Some of the tourists had trekked 3-4 km uphill with luggage to reach the main vehicle stand in Darjeeling early. ""Our family, including children and senior citizens, trekked up from our hotel to reach here by 6 am but there were no taxis or buses. We are still waiting as it is not possible to stay in Darjeeling any longer. There is no food for the children even,"" a tourist from Salt Lake in Kolkata, who reached Darjeeling on Wednesday, said.Among those who left Darjeeling during the day were 18 residents of Odisha who were attending a conference there. Several people from the plains who work at establishments in Darjeeling as daily wageearners also left for home. The police helped by segregating those gathered there according to age, sex and profile and making them queue up. The idea was the help the elderly, women and children leave in the first vehicles that arrived from Siliguri. Finally, four buses  two from North Bengal State Transport Corporation and two school buses  started from Darjeeling with police escort.""We arranged five more buses. We hadn't expected so many tourists. However, they are safe and under police protection. More vehicles will be provided on Saturday if there is demand,"" said transport officer Rajen Sundas.Most tourists expressed their relief after getting on buses. Vinita Gupta of Gorakhpur, UP, reached Darjeeling three days ago with her family and had to spend most of the time indoors. After getting enrolled in the priority list drawn out by the police, her turn finally came at 3 pm.Others like Mira Shaw from Kolkata also expressed their relief after boarding buses to Siliguri. ""I had to wait since early in the morning for my turn. I am relieved that I will finally get my train,"" Shaw said."
5a043afb9855b76bf13bcfeb,Organic products are in high demand in Kolkata,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/organic-products-are-in-high-demand-in-kolkata/articleshow/59219467.cms,2017-06-19,"Spend whatever amount you may, but the rice you buy from the market will have some amount of pesticide in it. The two types of rice  polished and super-polished  go through multiple levels of refinement with chemicals and pesticide. On the one hand, the process drains nutritional value from the grains and on the other, pesticides and chemicals do what they usually do  harm the body in every possible way. A third category, however, is fast gaining popularity. Organic rice, free of artificial food additives, has come as a boon. Similarly, organic vegetables  considered healthier than conventionally grown counterparts  are not only in high demand but also sold regularly in five markets in and around Kolkata, including Behala Senhaati, Naktala Udayan Sangha and Garia chalpatti.Arabindo Mandal, a farmer and seller of organic vegetables, told us that like rice, an average vegetable also lacks nutritional value. He was one of the 19 farmers and handicraft artists, who gathered at the farmers' market at Little India Haat, Vedic Village recently. Be it veggies, poultry products or garments made of organic cotton, the haat had a lot on offer. ""People are now getting aware of the endless benefits of organic food. We want to promote it for the sake of better health and lifestyle,"" said Upasana Carpenter, the spokesperson of Vedic Village.Talking about the health benefits of organic food, Dr Kamalesh Chatterjee said every product we buy from the market smacks of pesticides, fertilisers or colours. Also, lead and arsenic are often found in high quantities in vegetables and other foods. Organic products, however, are free of chemicals, as they are harvested in a natural process without fertilisers. ""From neem, cow urine and some other natural ingredients, we can make more than 25 types of pesticides. If used in proper proportions, they are as effective as any other chemical pesticide,"" said Saheb Mondal, a farmer. ""Naturally, organic food has more antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides,"" said Chatterjee. In case of poultry products, the chicken and ducks are not fed or injected hormones and steroids to increase the production of meat and eggs.The farmers at Little India Haat said they produce everything from paddy, veggies to poultry products. ""Whatever you eat in everyday life, we can produce it in an organic way,"" said Arabindo. According to him, there are multiple NGOs working in different parts of Bengal that support and encourage farmers to start organic farming. Arabindo, for instance, belongs to an NGO that operates in different parts of North 24 Parganas. ""There are 75 farmers working in a 10-acre farm,"" he said. Similarly, Parashuram Swain, a farmer from Odisha, who harvests two types of rice, said the production process is both easy and cost-effective. ""The only problem is the quantity. The artificial methods multiply production quantity, but if we resort to the natural process, there's quality but not quantity,"" said Parashuram.Naturally, organic products are costlier. For instance, a kilo of bottle gourd will cost Rs 25 in any Kolkata market, but its organic counterpart comes at Rs 35. Similarly, a kilo of organic ridge gourd is priced at Rs35, which is around RS 10 higher than the average market price.Despite the high price, demand for these products is going up. The farmers said, besides the five markets in and around Kolkata, they are trying to penetrate other bazars as well. However, due to less supply, they have not been able to meet the demand. Talking about the increasing demand, the farmers said people are more aware now. ""They know how harmful chemicals and pesticides are; so more and more people are consciously avoiding artificially grown products,"" said Namita Sarkar, another farmer.Sushila Jaiswal, who came to spend her weekend at Vedic Village and was spotted at the farmers' market, had an interesting story to share. The 60-something resident of Salt Lake said her grandson is all of eight months and is only fed homemade food. ""We give him a boiled mixture of vegetables and rice and everything in his food is organic. I made sure that he isn't given anything artificial. I know about the pesticides and chemicals in vegetables and did not take a chance with his food,"" she said."

(Source: Indian Express) The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and affects children. (Source: Indian Express)The first case of Japanese Encephalitis in the city this year, detected in a ten-month-old baby, has put the health department on high alert. This is the second such case in the state. The infant, who hails from Kondhwa, is in a stable condition and has been admitted to a private hospital in the area, said Dr Kalpana Baliwant, in-charge of the Insect Control Cell at the Pune Municipal Corporation.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that the serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and primarily affects children.However, Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, These are sporadic cases and our surveillance network has been able to pick up the cases. The first one was from Raigad district and the second case this year is from Pune.The virus that causes JE is transmitted by the culex species of mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields as well as in water-logged areas of urban regions. The disease has assumed epidemic proportions in pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal, with sporadic cases reported from Maharashtra.According to Awate, the problem-prone areas in Maharashtra are Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia. Last year, 12 cases of JE, and one death due to the disease, were reported from the state; two of the cases were from Pune.As many as 100 houses around the society at Kondhwa have been surveyed for the culex mosquito, said Baliwant. We conducted the container surveillance for the last four days and have not been able to find the mosquito. The parents had taken the baby to Mumbai 10 days ago, and its likely that the infection was picked up from there, she said.Awate said field officers from the state entomology section had carried out their own survey. We are waiting for the report but in all probability, it is a sporadic case. Most JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms. However, one in 250 infections result in severe clinical illness, according to the World Health Organisation. JE is a serious virus infection resulting in the inflammation of the brain. The disease is characterised by the onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, coma, seizures and spastic paralysis, he said.This year, 111 JE virus cases and 20 deaths have been reported from across the country. A majority of the cases are from UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. Last year, there were 1,676 cases and 283 deaths in the country, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.Meanwhile, PMC officials have urged local residents to take preventive measures and ensure there are no mosquito breeding sites nearby. While carrying out the container survey PMC officials found the dengue causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito breeding site at a swimming pool in the same society. We have slapped a fine against them, said Baliwant.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

While Uttar Pradesh-based parties SP and BSP were in a tight spot because Kovind hails from the state, NCP chief Sharad Pawar was wavering on whether to announce a candidate on the same day.Opposition leaders were still uncertain if all their plans would fall in line when they turned up at the meeting that decided Meira Kumars candidature. It was then that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury came up with a plan  get the signatures of the leaders of 17 parties on Kumars nomination papers at the meeting venue itself before venturing out of the room after the press conference.Shemin Joy, New DelhiSharmishtas strikesPresident Pranab Mukherjees daughter Sharmishta Mukherjee has not minced words in criticising West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her governments mishandling of the Darjeeling agitation.

In a newspaper article, Sharmishta recalled several instances when row over languages even led to creation of a new country, like Bangladesh, and trouble over Hindi left a divide in the south in the 1950s and 1960s.Sharmishtas piece has come as a surprise to many. Only two months ago, Mamata was not averse to backing her as a Rajya Sabha candidate from the state if the Congress nominated her. Considering that West Bengal CM has had close ties with her father, Sharmishtas criticism of Didi has set tongues wagging. So far, Sharmishta had confined herself to Delhi politics.

Come tomorrow, it just might taste a tad bitter. Your favourite snack  singara kachori , radhaballabi and the like  sold 24x7 at the city's ubiquitous mishtir dokaan and consumed at all times of the day will be taxed under the GST regime Not just that, GST also poses a challenge to the famed Bengali sweet tooth as sandesh, rosogolla, mishti doi and other varieties of sweets are being brought under the tax net. The worst hit though will be those who love chocolates. From chocolate bars to chocolate sandesh, black forest cakes to chocolate ice-creams, anything with a hint of chocolate will sting as Jaitley & Co has put chocolate in the highest GST slab of 28%.Most Kolkatans though are yet unaware of the rude shock in store. On Thursday, septuagenarian Sudip Ghosh of Bhowanipore blissfully relished his kochuri-alur torkari, something he has done every evening since childhood. ""I cannot even visualise mornings and evenings without hinger koch-uri and phulkopir singara,"" he said. In an alley in Burrabazar, Mahesh Agarwal was also biting into the same fare although with a slight different taste. ""Samosa and kachori are my staple diet,"" the trader said.With all major branded stores that retail snacks, sweets and savouries like Ganguram, Haldiram, Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, Banchharam, Kamdhenu, Mouchak, Sen Mahasay, Haldiram, Bikharam Chandmal and Tewari now under the GST net, the kachuri/kochuri-samosa/singara fare sold from these stores will be costlier as namkeen snack items will attract 12% GST. If they are consumed in the store, the GST will be 18%.Industry observers said the effective price of all products is likely to go up by 6%-8%. ""While no GST has been imposed on fish and vegetables as they are perishables, no such benefit has been granted to snacks and sweets that also don't have shelf-life,"" rued Sudip Mullick of Bhawanipore's heritage brand Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick.For them, and Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, north Kolkata's biggest name in sweets, there's an even bigger worry. Some of their best-selling sweets like chocolate rosogolla, chocolate sandesh, chocolate mudpie sandesh, black forest sandesh, rice ball, chocolate chips, chocolate singara and chocolate jalbhara may get badly dented by the 28% GST levied on them.""The impact will be so huge that one cannot possibly absorb the impact. There are two things that can be done. One is to retain the size and hike the price. The other is to retain the price and reduce the size. We haven't yet taken a decision but no matter which of the two it is, the customer will not like it,"" said Rana Nandy of Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.Though all other sweets will be under the 5% category, sweet retailers are miffed at the cottage industry being taxed when it has all along been exempted from sales tax and VAT. ""What is the rationale of 0% GST on lassi and plain dahi and 5% GST on mishti doi? It will be a blow to the traditional eating habits,"" said Subhajit Ghosh of Banchharam.In shops across the city, retailers are worried about chocolate stocks that usually move slowly during this season. With shops unwilling to buy chocolates till fresh stocks with new MRP is launched, chocolate distributors have stopped making the rounds of markets. Foreseeing a possible crisis, big retail chains with deep pockets like Big Baazar and Spencer's have stocked up chocolates. The chocolate market in Bengal is around Rs 80 crore annually.The tax on chocolate is also weighing heavy on confectionaries, boutique chocolatiers like Madhumita Upadhyay whose start-up is not in distress. ""I have written letter to both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Mamata Banerjee on the irrationality of pegging chocolate at 28% when cake and pastry are in the 18% bracket,"" she said.Sumit Deb, managing director of Metro Dairy, feels prices of ice creams across the category including chocolate will go up as price of both key inputs  butter and cocoa powder  is set to rise. GST on ice cream will be 18% from the current level of 16.5% (VAT and Excise). The ice cream market in Bengal is worth Rs 200-250 crore annually, of which 15-20% is chocolate flavour."

He walks 4 km down the hill, crosses the Relli river to reach the nearest blockade at Relli Bridge, some 10 km south from Kalimpong town, to join other protesters of various political parties.We gather by 5.30 am as people in the hills start day early. Blockade enforcers who commute from as far as 8-10 km are allowed to come in their motorbikes. We take turns every day to maintain a register of emergency vehicles who are allowed to pass through our blockade but only with valid pass from Gorkha Janmukti Morcha party office, Rajen said.Blockade enforcer Pemba Sherpa does multi-tasking at 7th mile bridge blockade, 5 km from Kalimpong. I give water bottles to participants of political rallies, stop and verify each vehicle passing through our blockade and also counsel intoxicated youth who try to create ruckus and bring bad name to the Gorkhaland movement, Pemba said.Though the blockade enforcers know that many of the hill residents defy the shutdown by commuting to Siliguri and other parts of the hills during the night, when blockades are abandoned, they plead helplessness because of the family they have to run.I have to cut grass for the cattle and milk the cows after sitting the entire day at the blockade. The family has to run despite the blockade. Every one of us has to work back at home due to which, we return at dusk, said 7th mile blockade enforcer Roshan Rai.When no vehicle is passing their blockade, the enforcers engage in long discussions about the events of the hills. We are not against Bengalis or Mamata Banerjee. We just want our own state. Look at the glory and money of our neighbours in Sikkim and then look at our poverty despite us being more enriched in natural resources than Sikkim, said Relli blockade enforcer Tenzing Bhutia.On the other hand, the blockade enforcers vow not to vandalise vehicles in response to vandalising of Sikkim vehicles in Siliguri. Several Sikkim vehicles were vandalised and Sikkimese people harassed in Siliguri after Sikkim chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling wrote a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh extending his support to Gorkhaland statehood.Those people (vandals in Siliguri) are actually strengthening our movement by attacking the people of Sikkim. We dont want to bring a bad name to Gorkhaland movement by copying them, said Relli blockade enforcer Bikash Chhetri."

(File Photo) Operators of trucks that ferry goods from Siliguri to Sikkim called an indefinite bandh on June 30 to protest the alleged attack on Sikkim-bound trucks by anti-Gorkhaland protesters. (File Photo)The Sikkim government is set to take the West Bengal government to court for losses it incurred because of the Gorkhaland agitation in Darjeeling.Government representatives claimed that ever since the protests began, the West Bengal government and its police have deliberately prevented supply of goods to Sikkim, stopping trucks from entering the state because of the support Sikkim  including its Chief Minister Pawan Chamling  has shown for a separate Gorkhaland.National Highway 10, which connects Siliguri in North Bengal to Gangtok, is the only highway that connects Sikkim to the rest of the country and serves as the states lifeline.Sikkims lone Member of Parliament P D Rai, speaking with The Indian Express, said, We are planning to approach the Supreme Court next week. The circumstances which have been created are unconstitutional. Our food supply and all other essential goods coming to Sikkim have been stopped. In Siliguri, many of our trucks carrying essential goods have been stopped by police in civil clothes, while uniformed police have looked on. Just because we have a particular stand, which has been a known stand for many years, this is being done.Rai said that such disruptions have taken place routinely due to the shared highway with West Bengal, but the past 20 days  since the agitations began  have been particularly bad. Over the past 30 years, Sikkim has incurred losses worth Rs 60,000 crore due to such disruptions. We want the West Bengal government to make good on these losses, he said, adding that in the past 20 days alone, the state has incurred losses of Rs 200 crore.Till the day before Mamata Banerjee decided to hold her cabinet meeting in Darjeeling, there was not a single room vacant in any hotel in Sikkim. But since then, there is not a single room that is occupied. Our economic losses have been huge. Disruptions and agitations will occur, you cant prevent that. But the highway should have been protected by paramilitary to ensure that essential goods reach us. Yesterday, areas in north Sikkim ran out of rice and pulses; we have shipped these items to them today. There is no problem with organic vegetables or dairy in the state, but we import our cereals, and this has been hit. There is no cash in ATMs either, said Rai.Operators of trucks that ferry goods from Siliguri to Sikkim called an indefinite bandh on June 30 to protest the alleged attack on Sikkim-bound trucks by anti-Gorkhaland protesters. Groups of youths protesting the division of Bengal allegedly vandalised two trucks in Dhupguri and New Jalpaiguri, and another in Siliguri carrying milk supply for the Indian Army, on June 30. Tanker associations have also stopped supplying fuel to Sikkim.Very soon, our medical supplies will run out. We are sandwiched between two agitations  for and against Gorkhaland. The West Bengal government needs to pay up, said Rai.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0b40f79855b76bf13cd781,Why Indian farmers are distressed?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/info-nomics/why-indian-farmers-are-distressed/,2017-07-07,"On the eve of Uttar Pradesh (UP) election, Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi promised if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins then farm loan will be waived. BJP won, and the farm loan was waived-off. Sensing a case of political opportunism other states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka  joined the farm loan waiver bandwagon. Farmers usually take loan to grow crops and to buy farm equipment. However, waiving off farm loan does not makes sense economically. The cause of farm distress lies somewhere else. We find reasons for a farmer not realizing the market price has to do with inefficient supply chain management, with farm distress getting augmented because of lower farm size holding and lack of irrigation facilities.Between 2012 and 2015 over 10,000 farmers committed suicide. Globally, India has second largest amount of arable land (next only to USA) but less than 35 per cent of this land comes under irrigation. Fluctuation in Indias agricultural output is due to supply-side shocks resulting from inadequate rainfall. Investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification, rain water harvesting, and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures. Additionally, other factors such as lack of reforms to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power resulting from small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities are also important.If various state governments can addresses these issues it will be beneficial for the farmers than waiving-off farm loan.In India, not only percapita agricultural income is low, and but at times it is not possible to sustain this low income. Also, agricultural output fluctuates more than the outputs of the industrial and services sectors. Official output data shows that during the period between 1991-1992 and 2013-2014, the coefficient of variation for agricultural output is 191.34, in comparison to 50.48 for industry, and 22.03 for services sector. This has led to unequal income distribution in India with rural-urban wage gap at 45 per cent in comparison to around 10 per cent for China and Indonesia. Some 850 million people still live in rural India. India has around 260 million people living in poverty and 80 per cent of them live in the countryside. Increasing and sustaining farm income is important if India wants to reduce poverty.Majority of farming(65 per cent) is rain-dependent. Volatile rainfall patterns lead to lower farm income. The median annual wage for a farmer in India is around US $290 which is barely two months minimum wage in Mumbai  the commercial capital of India. Because of lack of proper irrigation facilities, and weather insurance schemes, farmers typically get stuck to growing low-value crops such as rice and wheat, although there is an ever increasing demand for high-value stuffs such as fruits, and vegetables.Inefficient supply chain management equally contributes to farm distress.In India, if farmers are to sell their produce, they have two options. First is to sell directly to the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in government outlets such as Food Corporation of India (FCI). MSP is the minimum price for a product established by the government and supported by payments to producers in the event of the market price falling below the specified minimum. The second option is to take their produce to the nearby government-designated mandi (market)where in front of state officers they can auction produce to the brokers. Mandis are the markets in smaller towns and cities to which farmers from nearby villages bring their agricultural produce to sell. There are around 7700 government designated mandis spread across India.Typically, MSP is higher than the market price, and one would assume that farmers gain every time the government announces the MSP. However, farmers are seldom able to sell their produce at the MSP. Every village does not have government outlets. FCI has a minimum presence in other major rice and wheat producing states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa. Compared to all-India average of 7340 farmers suicide committed between 1995 and 2010, only West Bengal has higher suicides numbering 19331 between 1995 and 2010. The corresponding figures for Assam, Bihar, and Orissa are 3566, 1235, and 4460, respectively. And, even if there is a FCI outlet, the government may not procure if the farmers bring their produce before/after the dates of procurement. The farmers are at whim of local traders and are forced to sell their produce in the informal market.In India, as much as 83 per cent of the farmers are smallholders, with less than 1 hectare of landholding. These marginal farmers do not have access to cold storage, and have no option but to sell their produce to the middlemen or traders. It is impossible for them to get a space in the state storage facilities without any political connection, and also because the smaller farmers do not have wherewithal to book crate in warehouses. Lack of reforms in the APMC Act prevents these small farmers to sell directly to supermarkets, exporters, and agro-processors. This prevent contract farming which otherwise can entail better price realization for these farmers.Rather than waiving-off farm loans there is a need to rise above party-politics and ensure reforms in the APMC Act. According to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report move to waive-off farm loan is likely to cost various state exchequers a whopping $40 billion (around 2% of Indias GDP).Timely procurement through MSP and training for increasing agricultural productivity will also help. Indias neighbor China produces more wheat and rice in spite of having lesser area of land cultivated in comparison to India. Finally, instead of spending on blanket subsidies (favoring the big farmers), investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification,rain water harvesting and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures."
5a0662fd9855b76bf13c5f47,MGNREGA wages less than minimum farm wages in 15 states: Panel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mgnrega-wages-less-than-minimum-farm-wages-in-15-states-panel-4743412/,2017-07-09,"Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image) Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image)THE COMMITTEE for revision of wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarentee Act (MGNREGA) has found that minimum agricultural wages are higher than MGNREGA wages in 15 states. An upward revision in MGNREGA wages is estimated to require a Rs 4,500 crore increase in its budget.Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month.As per data being examined by the committee, the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers are significantly higher than MGNREGA wages in Karnataka, Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The other states where MGNREGA wages fail to match up are Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the minimum wages are marginally higher than MGNREGA wages.In the 15 states where MGNREGA wages are lower, we tried revising it to bring it on par with the minimum agricultural wages paid by the respective states. Where MGNREGA wages are on par or higher, we decided to protect it as it is. If a revision is done as per this formula, it is estimated that a Rs 4,500 crore addition to the existing MGNREGA budget would be needed, said an official from the Ministry of Rural Development.The Indian Express had earlier reported that despite official claims of this years MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore being the highest ever, the wage revision, at 2.7 per cent, was the lowest ever. It meant a per day, per person wage hike of merely Re 1 in some states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Rs 2-Rs 3 in several others.This was because the finance ministry, on account of financial implications, rejected the recommendations of the S Mahendra Dev committee, which had proposed to bring MGNREGA wages on par with minimum wages paid to unskilled agricultural workers in the states. The expert panel had said that the Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the current consumption pattern of rural households, should be the basis for revising MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL), which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983.The basket of goods for calculating CPI-AL comprises mainly food items. With the implementation of the National Food Security Act, rice and wheat is available for as cheap as Rs 2-3 per kg. CPI(Rural) gives lower weightage to food items, and hence, is found to be a better indicator of wage increase, said a ministry official.The Nagesh Singh panel has found that based on the second recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, if the existing MGNREGA wages are revised as per CPI(Rural), it would mean another Rs 600 crore increase in the budget.CPI(R) should be used to revise the wages every year instead of CPI(AL), as the former is more representative of the current rural consumption basket. Also, wage revision should take place every six months, in keeping with the practice for other trades and occupation, said Ankita Aggarwal from the peoples organisation, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha. Aggarwal said that with such low wages and delays in payments, MGNREGA fails to provide the livelihood security for which it was enacted.Jharkhand Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma had recently written a strongly-worded letter to the Ministry of Rural Development protesting against the growing divergence between the states minimum wage, which is currently Rs 224 per day, and MGNREGA wages of just Rs 168 per day after the wage hike.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a06f9279855b76bf13c6ffd,Three square meals for Rs 34: Here is why prisoners risk assault to seek better food,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/three-square-meals-for-rs-34-here-is-why-prisoners-risk-assault-to-seek-better-food-4746559/,2017-07-11,"Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22. Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22.ACCORDING to many of her former cellmates, it was Manjula Shetyes complaint about a shortage of eggs and paav that cost the 35-year-old inmate her life inside the Byculla Womens Prison. On June 23, the 45-year-old convict serving the final few months of her sentence died after an assault allegedly by jail staff following a scuffle over food rations.For most, its hard to imagine staking life and personal safety for two eggs, but former prison inmates do not find it surprising at all that Shetye picked a grave fight over food. In a place where dal is referred to as pathar ke sanam for the substantial number of stones found wading in it, and rock hard rotis are surreptitiously used by prisoners as fuel to light up small kitchen fires called hundis to spice up their notoriously low quality and bland diet, the longing for decent food afflicts almost every prisoner.Every day you should stand outside the prison gates and monitor the garbage that is strewn out. Almost 75 per cent of the garbage would comprise of rotis and rice that get thrown away because they are unpalatable, says Wahid Shaikh, a former undertrial who spent over eight years inside various jails in the city. Clearly, access to good food is a distant dream for the 29,567 prisoners lodged in Maharashtras jails. Data shows the Indian state spends as little as Rs 52.42 on every prisoner per day to arrange the three square meals prescribed in the diet charts of prison manuals. In 2015, Maharashtra spent Rs 34.22 per prisoner per day, the third lowest in the country. Only Goa (Rs 32.83) and Delhi (Rs 31.31) fared worse.In fact, Maharashtra has historically spent smaller sums on prisoners food than the national average. In 2000, the Indian average was around Rs 13.43 compared to Maharashtras spending of Rs 10.33 per day. Prisoners are served three times a day. They get breakfast at 7 am, lunch at 9 am and dinner by 3 pm. The food is prepared by a revolving team of 25 prisoners who work in two shifts rolling out nearly 18,000 chappatis in one day.As per the law, the food is supposed to be prepared under hygienic conditions under strict supervision of a committee headed by the jail superintendent, but the conditions do not meet even basic hygienic requirements in reality. If you see the place where food is cooked, I promise you will not touch that food again. From rats to insects, almost everything can be found in the kitchen as well as the food. The workers who cook have been allotted a small room in the kitchen where they relieve themselves. Imagine your food being prepared where people piss and defecate, says Shaikh.Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22. This mismatch led the Bombay High Court to take the Maharashtra government to task in 2017, directing it to appoint a three-member committee in each district to monitor prison food.Not much has changed since the HCs observations. Irfan Shaikh, a former convict who completed his sentence in 2017, says food inside a prison is a powerful reminder of a prisoners humanity and the person he used to be when outside. The retributive system of our prisons ensures that a prisoner does not have access to any worldly pleasures. Even food is cooked in such a way that it does not taste like food, it merely serves the nutritional purpose, he says. Only, the nutrition levels in Maharashtras jail are shocking too.In prison, a prisoners diet crashes significantly, lowering their immunity and intake of micronutrients. Stress levels are high. The latent TB bacteria in the body gets active. In a day, an infected prisoner may cough 50 to 100 times. The bacteria in droplets remains suspended in air in an enclosed area infecting other prisoners if the cell is poorly ventilated, says Dr Lalitkumar Anande, senior medical officer at Sewri TB hospital. According to him, even jail staff is at the risk of developing TB infection due to the poor living conditions.Data analysed by The Indian Express showed that prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in Mumbai prisons is eight times higher, at an average 14 per 1,000 population, than in general population, which stands at 1.67 per 1,000 people. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), which provides free TB treatment to patients, provided DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course) treatment to 24 TB prisoners in 2013, which increased to 26 in 2014 and 35 in 2015 at the Arthur Road prison. Apart from living conditions, nutrition levels are directly to blame for the high TB incidence in Mumbais prisons.The Model Prison Manual drafted by the Union Ministry for Home Affairs prescribes that a male prisoner should have an intake of 2,320 to 2,730 kilo calorie (kcal) per day. For female prisoners, it is stipulated to be between 1,900 and 2,830 kcal/day. Prison administration being a federal subject, every state has the right to decide on its food menu, provided it adheres to the nutritional requirements laid down by the prison manual. While prison manuals specify the exact weightage of pulses and vegetables that a prisoner should get, the quality of food served leaves a lot to be desired.The food in prison parlance is called bhatta. It is watery and tasteless. There have been times where I have seen prisoners break down in frustration after having to eat those meals day after day, says a former convicted prisoner who spent time in various jails in Maharashtra. Food accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the total money spent on prisoners in India. This also makes it one of the major expense heads, which is susceptible when officials decide to cut corners.The only way that prisoners could have access to better food was through jail canteens. Every prisoner is allowed to receive a sum of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,200 per month from family, which he or she could spend in the jail canteen. But this facility was shut down in Maharashtra around 2008. Prisoners cant buy food from the canteen any longer. The only time prisoners have access to outside food is during festival days where there is a provision of canteens selling food.Prisoners also access food through the home cooked meal that certain prisoners are allowed to have on the directions of a court. Earlier, under the provisions of home cooked food, huge food containers would be slipped in by rich inmates to feed dozens of fellow inmates. Certain jails have now laid down rules that say an individual cant get more than 850 grams of home cooked food per day inside the prison.Incidentally, barring Northeast and Southern states, besides West Bengal and Jammu & Kashmir, non-vegetarian food is not given free to prisoners in any other state. Certain states have a provision of allowing certain prisoners to access non-vegetarian food from jail canteens on limited days in a year. The administration believes prisoners are sub human and do not have right to enjoy even basic facilities. My experience in prison was that whenever prisoners got access to decent food on certain special days, the entire day passed peacefully without any incident. It does not take much for a caged prisoner to go crazy. However, the days people had access to decent food even the looniest among us would be normal, recalls Shaikh.As a direct consequence of poor nutrition, health problems are routine occurrences for prisoners. A recent survey of 24 sub-jails in Maharashtra by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) observed that prisoners are not medically examined at the time of admission and there are no regular medical check-ups.In Byculla jail, where the women inmates rioted to demand better food and living conditions following Shetyes death last month, almost all inmates suffer from skin infections. The two other most common ailments among the women inmates are TB and HIV. Skin diseases are contagious in nature. In jail, as hygiene conditions are poor, this spreads rapidly as they use the common toilets and in some cases even share their soap and towels. Almost all the inmates complain of this, says a senior official.A former medical officer who was attached with the Arthur Road prison in 2016 says 300 prisoners visit the prison out-patient department on an average every day. Of these, one-third would have skin infections. Most prisoners have rashes on their body for a range of reasons. Prisoners share the same bedsheets, do not wash their clothes often and share soap bars, he says.According to him, fungal infection, measles and herpes were most common. There was usually a shortage of anti-fungal cream and tablets for skin infections. Since treatment usually got delayed, the infection would spread to other body parts, says the former medical officer. With overcrowding and skin infections common, the medical officer says, prisoners need a skin specialist for regular consultation in jails. This is not a life threatening disease. So, jail authority would not send prisoners to hospital for merely skin consultation. What we need is a regular consultant in the prison itself, he adds.According to the CHRI report, Conditions in the sub-jails are extremely unhygienic due to the lack of proper cleaning facilities, which exacerbates health challenges inside prisons. The cells are cleaned by inmates, who lack the necessary supply of phenol and water.(With Rashmi Rajput)For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Local religious leaders also arrived at the scene. The children were kept in the waiting room at the station while we questioned the adults. We served them biryani and dal rice in the afternoon for lunch, an officer with the railway police said.Leaders of religious groups later handed out biscuit packets and water bottles for the children while CWC members spoke to them.It only by 7 p.m. that their story was verified. After checking their documents, including Aadhaar cards and IDs issued by the madrasas, the children and their instructors were allowed to leave, an officer said. Local leaders from the community arranged buses for their transport.Most of the children hail from West Bengal, Bihar and Assam, but study in madrasas in the State. They had gone to their home towns for Ramzan."

Kultali villager Gokul Naskar had realised early in life that honesty was not going to help him feed his 11brothers and sisters, a responsibility thrust on him with his father's death when he had barely turned 18. But a hundred violent robberies and several jail stints later, Daku Gokul (as he was better known) turned a sage and is now Gokul Maharaj of an ashram he set up in Kultali back in 2000.The eldest of 11 siblings, Gokul stepped into the underworld at 18. ""There were no jobs or any proper means of livelihood in Kultali when my father died in 1960. I had to look after the family and feed my brothers and sisters. I saw no other option but to take to dacoity as a livelihood,"" he said.For four long decades -from age 18 to 58 -Gokul lived alife looting gold jewellery, money , sacks of rice and just about anything of value. After his first dacoity , carried out after hiring a boat, Gokul felt the need to form a gang. He organized one with 12 members initially. The gang procured pipe guns and swords and made their own bombs as essential weapons to scare and, if necessary , maim or even kill, targeted victims.The gang that grew with time began carrying out a slew of violent robberies. After opening their account in their homeground of Kultali, the gang soon spread its tentacles to adjoining Basanti in the Sunderbans and even turned pirates, looting launch boats and fishing trawlers plying on the rivers separating islands of the delta. Emboldened by their success but not satisfied with the quantum of each loot in the Sunderbans, the gang ventured into the more dangerous underworld of Howrah and Hooghly .These forays landed Gokul and his partners-in-crime behind bars several times. The turning point for Gokul came after a betrayal by his associates towards the end of the last century . After their arrest, they named him as the mastermind for looting jewellery from a wedding hall in Kultali.""Though I was in no way involved in that mission, they planned and carried it out on their own,"" said Gokul, who nevertheless had to spend his longest stint (two years and 19 days) in jail ""for that false charge"". Once out of jail, he decided never to re-en ter the world of crime again and instead, bemit. Taking his came a hermit. Taking his `diksha' from Shri Shri Archana Burima of Jadavpur, Gokul returned to Kultali, where he collected funds to set up the Sri Sri Thakur Satyananda Krishna Kali Seva Ashram that also houses a temple and a school from Classes I-IV where volunteer teachers continue to teach alarge number of students.Local resident Shyamal Naskar said, ""This is a miraculous transformation. Gokul was always known as a notorious dacoit across Kultali and its adjoining islands. When he first set up the ashram, it was hard to believe how such a person could run a school. But over the years, hundreds of students from our area have attended the school."""

Nothing of this has been reaching Darjeeling town for the last three weeks.And, with ration shops closed since June, 670 ration dealers in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts have their entire June allocation of 9,550 tonnes of foodgrain stacked in their now-shut stores. ""Some of the dealers tried to open ration shops but stopped after they were thrashed by bandh supporters,"" a worried state food and civil supplies minister Jyotipriya Mullick said in Kolkata on Thursday. ""This crisis is entirely man-made,"" he added.It's not that food supplies have stopped entirely. But the response of residents to the trickle that is reaching the Hills reveals their desperation: there was a stampede-like situation when small trucks laden with vegetables reached Darjeeling over the last weekend. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, now spearheading the demand for a separate state, arranged for the vegetables to be distributed among people, well aware that a section was running out of patience. People mobbed these vehicles and GJM supporters had their hands full controlling the crowds.Susma Giri ran behind a truck, holding on to her two-year-old daughter tight in one hand and having a carry-bag in the other. The truck, laden with sacks of cabbage, reddish and squash, came to a halt in front of Darjeeling Municipality, where more than 200 men and women were already in the queue. Giri grudgingly took her position right at the back and waited for her turn.""There is no food at home. Give me some more vegetables,"" Sarita Lepcha , a homemaker who had queued up for two hours, cried out to the men on the lorry handing out the vegetables.The business community in Darjeeling is too scared to speak out but traders confirm not a single lorry containing edibles has been allowed to come up from Siliguri, the primary feeder to the Hills, since the GJM-sponsored total shutdown started on June 15. ""Every single shop is shut in Darjeeling and other towns. Trucks are not being allowed to cross Darjeeling More in Siliguri. There is no stock of food in Darjeeling,"" a senior office-bearer in the association of rice wholesalers of rice in Beech Gali said.The administration says it is monitoring the situation but there is very little it can do. ""Darjeeling has a monthly requirement of 9,550 tonnes of foodgrains, which caters to 8.75 lakh people. This translates to 11 kg of rice or wheat per head every week. We supplied the entire June-July quota by July 11. We have 52,000 tonnes of foodgrains stored in over 50 warehouses in Siliguri to meet further requirements. We have ensured that supplies have reached the three warehouses off Darjeeling,"" minister Mullick said in Kolkata. ""But there is very little we can do if the agitators are bent on inconveniencing the very people on whose behalf they claim to speak,"" he added.Chowkbazar near Darjeeling railway station is the main hub from where vegetables and edibles reach smaller towns like Sonada, Ghum, Tung Sung, Singmari, Aluabari, Patleybas and Dali. But the indefinite shutdown has cut off the entire supply chain and the food shortage in kitchens is gradually reflecting on the streets in the Hills."

Soon, she saw a post by a friend of hers about a cast iron fish that had been invented by a Canadian Dr. Christopher Charles. The idea is that you drop the iron fish while cooking is taking place, so that the iron seeps into the food. All humans need a bit of iron in their diet. Soon, Radhika saw a comment: Once upon a time we used to cook in cast iron pots!Immediately Radhika typed, I still do, the way my grandmother did. Then she posted a few pictures of her cast iron dosa pan and kadai. This was shared in a foodie group. Thereafter, many asked where they could get this.It suddenly struck me that this could be a business, says Radhika at Kochi. She decided to team up with her friend, Priya Deepak and thus was born the Village Fair.Today, the duo sells all types of traditional cookware, ranging from clay pots, kadais, tavas, pans, skillets, grinding stones, and traditional stoneware.The USP is the seasoning. This is being done by a 20 member group of men and women on Vypeen island. In fact, their first volunteeer was Radhikas house help, Lalitha. She knew how to do it, says Radhika. We began with a few orders. When the numbers became big, Lalitha included other family members.The group gets the raw utensils from factories and kilns. Then they wash it in cold water to remove all the mud and the grime. Then it is immersed in rice and starch water for four days. Thereafter, the vessels are scrubbed clean and sandpaper is used to smooth out the rough edges.After that it is placed on the fire and cured with vegetable oil. If it is a kadai, oil is applied inside, and on a dosa pan it is on the outside, says Priya. We then make one or two dosas to check whether the seasoning has happened correctly. The prices range from Rs 1500 to Rs 2500 for cast iron, bronze, from Rs 4000 to Rs 5000, depending on the weight, soapstone is from Rs 1700 to Rs 2000 and clay pots from Rs 680 to Rs 1500.Asked whether it is a bit on the expensive side, Priya says, You are paying for the cookware as well as the seasoning efforts. It is not an easy thing to do.Anyway, owing to a rising health consciousness, there is a growing demand for traditional cookware. People have realised that in modern utensils, once the non-stick wears off, food can become toxic, says Radhika. The advantage of traditional cookware is that once you buy it, you can use it forever.And the food is tastier. There are far more flavours in the food, says Radhika. You have to try it to know the difference.Today, thanks to a thriving online presence, the Village Fair has customers from Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and many other cities. Their first international customer was a couple from New Zealand, Tim and Suzie Hunt. They had come to India earlier, says Priya. And they ordered a dosa pan.In fact, the dosa pan is one of their most popular items. Because people like to cook a nice crisp dosa, and it is much tastier than when you use a non-stick cookware pan, says Radhika.The duo say they have a lot of satisfied customers. They call us a God-send, says Priya. Our business has grown through word of mouth."

(File | PTI)DARJEELING: Clashes between the police and Gorkhaland supporters today resulted in injuries to several persons on both sides at Jaigoan in Alipurduar district, bordering Bhutan.The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and the other hill parties took out a rally at Jaigaon on the 46th day of an indefinite strike called by the GJM in the hills.According to the police, clashes broke out between the securitymen and the Gorkhaland supporters after the participants in the rally, carrying kukris (Gorkha knives), hurled stones and petrol bombs at the police personnel.The police tried to convince the GJM supporters to refrain from attacking, but the agitators remained defiant and broke the first two barricades. They kept hurling stones at the police, who then resorted to using water cannons and firing tear gas shells, besides using batons to disperse the crowd.At this, the protesters turned violent and set a few vehicles, including those of the police, afire.Several police personnel and Gorkhaland supporters were injured in the clashes, the police said.The GJM claimed that the police resorted to indiscriminate firing. The police, however, denied the allegation.Similar processions were taken out at Kalchini.GJM supporters took out rallies at the Chowkbazar area of the hills, carrying black flags as a mark of protest against police action on Gorkhaland supporters.Shouting slogans against the West Bengal government, they demanded an immediate intervention by the Centre.Gorkhaland supporters, armed with knives, swords and kukris, had tried to forcibly enter Siliguri yesterday, demanding that the town be included into the separate state of Gorkhaland.In the Naxalbari area of Darjeeling, the locals took out a rally against the GJM and their demand for Gorkhaland and set tyres on fire as a mark of protest against the ongoing agitation in the hills.In the Sukna area of the hills, which is close to Siliguri, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state took out an anti-GJM rally.The GJM and the other hill parties held an 'Anna Dan' (rice donation) rally during the day as a mark of protest against vehicles, carrying food supplies to the hills, being set ablaze in Siliguri.Each participant in the rally carried a handful of rice and other grains and donated it in a box, which will be handed over to the district administration and, in turn, will be sent to the West Bengal secretariat as a mark of protest.The police and security forces patrolled the streets of the hills and kept a tight vigil at all the entry and exit routes.Barring the medicine shops, all other business establishments, restaurants, hotels, schools and colleges remained closed.The workers of the GJM and various NGOs of the hills were seen distributing food among the people as the food supply has been severely hit due to the ongoing shutdown."

Our friends had called us over, but I  down with a nasty bug  couldnt make it. So they packed for me a big consignment of biryani from Behrouz. You may recall that I wrote about Behrouzs biryani once. It had been delivered home even before we could say gosht, and I remember how I enjoyed their kofta biryani  peppered with little mince balls.The friends generous package carried us over the weekend. And it also reminded me of the biryani that I had eaten just a few days before that  at the Press Club of India.The Club had a biryani festival. And I had some exceptional biryani there. I discovered that the biryani had been catered especially for the club by the Corporate Master Chef of the Clarks Inn Group of Hotels, Sunil Soni, and his able assistant, Junaid, who comes from a bawarchi family of Aligarh.I know biryani lovers are the most quarrelsome group that you can ever find in India, perhaps even more than mango aficionados who can never agree on what could be crowned as the king of the fruit. Likewise, those who like their Hyderabadi kachchey gosht biryani have nothing but scorn for the Awadhi biryani fan club, which, in turn, thinks the Kolkata biryani lovers should get their heads examined. And then there are those who know and love their south Indian biryanis, and shrug and say, Oh these northerners.I think the time has come to judge the biryani not just by its origins, but by the taste. Not everybody who does kachchey gosht ki biryani does it well, and some of the so-called Kolkata biryani outlets in Chittaranjan Park should be told that one potato does not maketh a Kolkata biryani. The true test lies in how good the biryani tastes.And the ones that had been prepared by Soni, Junaid and their men were simply outstanding. I had some of the Hyderabadi gosht biryani and Awadhi chicken biryani. Both were finger-licking good, and that was the unanimous opinion of our four-member household.One reason, of course, was the rice, which was of exceptional quality  long-grained and aromatic, as well as cooked to perfection, which each grain occupying its own glistening space. The meat had been cooked and spiced just right. The rich flavours came from the yakhni  stock  that had been used while the rice was being cooked. And Chef Soni tells me that some stock was also used while the meat  chicken or lamb  was being marinated with spices.The flavours of the biryanis had been enhanced with a touch of pan ki jad, which is powdered and added to the dish, and ittar. And the mildly sweet flavour came from rose petals and plump raisins.I also had the most delicious dessert I have eaten in recent times. Its called gulatthi, and is prepared with thickened milk, khoya, nuts and a bit of saffron. Unlike phirni, it doesnt have rice in it. So the flavours and texture come from the nuts and the khoya. This is a dish that is especially popular in the Aligarh-Rampur area.The biryani at the club was offered at subsidised rates, but Chef Soni (9810380519) and his team can cater for large parties, where a plate of biryani may cost Rs. 400-500, depending on the number of people and other such factors.Now that in every corner of the city you have someone selling some kind of biryani, the dish has been losing its appeal because of the substandard offerings in many of these places. These days, for instance, the moment I see a sign that says Moradabadi Biryani, I am reminded of the flavour of pickle in the rice. And let me tell you its not a happy thought.But this biryani has strengthened my belief that there are unknown jewels still waiting to be discovered. Seek, and we shall find."

Garib-sal, one of 505 types of rice plants tested by scientists, is capable of absorbing silver found naturally in soil and accumulating it in the grain to unusually high levels of 15 mg per kg.The rice was able to accumulate high quantities of silver even when the soil contained only about 0.15 mg per kg.The unusual accumulation of silver in the grain and other parts of the plant, researchers say, throws open the possibility of commercial extraction of the metal through farming.The maximum concentration of silver in the plant is in the grains. Silver accumulation is largely in the bran of the rice grain, and once polished, the silver in the grain is reduced significantly.Polishing grain is crucialIt is not, however, for consumption as food. We do not advocate consumption of the unpolished rice as staple food. If the rice is polished very well then it may not lead to silver toxicity, says Prof. T. Pradeep from the Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, who authored the research.Silver is not known to accumulate in the reproductive tissues of any cereal, and in agricultural crops the amount of silver that gets accumulated is less than 1 mg per kg of dry weight of the plant.Researchers at IIT Madras stumbled upon the rice variety while screening for different metal ions in the 505 rice varieties. Only nine showed high silver accumulation, with Garib-sal the highest.The rice varieties are maintained by Dr. Debal Deb, head, Centre of Interdisciplinary Studies, Kolkata, as part of rice variety conservation efforts. Garib-sal used to be grown by farmers in Purulia, West Bengal. The researchers tested Garib-sals ability to accumulate silver even when grown in soils with very low silver concentration. Even when the soil contains only about 0.01 mg of silver per kg, the rice plant was able to concentrate 0.20 mg of silver per kg in the grains.The rice variety has the ability to accumulate silver about 100 times more than any other rice, says Prof. T. Pradeep. The variety was cultivated in the farm for three successive years in soil containing about 0.15 mg per kg and the uptake and accumulation of the noble metal was nearly the same.Garib-sal accumulated 50 times more silver than another type in control tests."

With the Centre turning back to the statehood demand, the Mamata Banerjee administration has also continued with total isolation of the hills by cutting off Internet.IN PICTURES: Gorkhaland protests in DarjeelingLPG cylinder prices have touched high of Rs1,800 per cylinder and availability of food in markets have touched new low. Food supplies from the plains have been stopped by Bengali organisations of Siliguri, allegedly supported by the police.Though GJM has often distributed eatables to residents of tea gardens where cultivation does not take place, it has never been sufficient.However, one word has kept the indefinite strike going is indigenous knowledge.The indigenous knowledge orally passed down through generations has allowed the consumerism-struck residents of the two hill districts to fall back to their roots.This indigenous knowledge has enabled the residents to scourge the correct locations in the forests for shoots and roots and cultivate indigenous varieties of crop after supplies from the plains stopped. The indefinite strike has also led to increased cooperation between people -- including age-old barter system -- which had faded away as consumerism crept in.""Many of us had started to depend on rice from the plains and stopped cultivating our locally-grown indigenous varieties. Now, many farmers in our village and neighbouring villages are cultivating maize and local varieties of rice and are also fetching bamboo shoots and wild mushrooms from the forests. Many are also preparing fermented soyabean, a must with every meal that was earlier available in the markets, at their homes,"" said Man Bahadur of Yokprintam village, 25 km from Kalimpong town.The soil of this part of the Himalayas also supports cultivation of a variety of vegetables including potatoes, ladies finger, brinjals, tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd among others.With currency notes rendered useless in the wake of the complete shutdown, availability of farm workers has also gone down the abyss, which has also forced people to work together at each other's farmlands.""It seems we have returned to the traditional way of cultivation that our forefathers followed when society was egalitarian. Farm workers are not available due to the strike. So, people nowadays work together in rotation at one person's farm in the village. The next day, they will all work at someone else's land. After work, all the farm workers eat at the residence of the person on whose land they worked. Nobody is small or big in this work. This has brought us closer,"" said Ramesh Rai of Samalbong village in Kalimpong district.Besides this commune-type work, villagers are also sharing their meat. ""Just today, a big chicken was slaughtered at my house. While we kept 1 kilogram, we gave the rest to our neighbours. They would do the same when they slaughter their chickens,"" said Suren Tamang of Seokbhir Khani village of Kalimpong district.However, one crop that has taken a beating due to the strike is ginger. ""While 40 kg of ginger costed Rs 6,000 last year, it has reduced to only Rs 800 per 40 kg due to the strike,"" said Mangal Tamang of Takling village, equidistant from both Darjeeling and Kalimpong towns."
5a0f2ee29855b76bf13d6ee9,Notes of a native son: Hansda S Shekhar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/notes-of-a-native-son-hansda-s-shekhar/articleshow/60027329.cms,2017-08-12,"One of India's best young writers, and good friend of Goa, is fighting a cultural battle with significant implications for the rest of the country. On August 4, an irate crowd targeted the brilliant author Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar in his home city of Pakur, in Jharkhand. Accusing him of being ""the shaitan of Santhal society"", they burned an effigy of the doctor (he works at a government health centre) and winner of the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar Award. The purported offence is ""pornographic writing"" which ""showed serious lack of sensitivity towards the tribal people of India."" But what is really at stake is the question of who has the right to speak for or represent a culture.Shekhar is a startling and unique talent. There is literally no one else like him. Just 34 years old, he writes in an engaging style from and about a cultural universe otherwise entirely absent from Indian letters  the tribal firmament in rapidly changing, contemporary India. It's never fair to burden limitlessly talented young writers with comparisons, but here it is impossible to ignore deeply resonant similitude with the African-American pioneer James Baldwin. Notably, that correlation was first highlighted in Goa, when Shekhar launched his book of short stories, 'The Adivasi Will Not Dance' at the Goa Arts and Literature Festival 2015, at the hands of eminent Konkani writer, Damodar Mauzo.One of the best stories in that collection is being used to manufacture outrage against its author. 'November is the Month of Migrations' is stark and unforgettable, just three pages describing the season when ""Santhal men, women and children walk down from their villages in the hills"" to board trains to West Bengal, where ""they will plant rice and other crops in farms owned by the zamindars"".Trailing along is Talamai Kisku, 20, who is beckoned by a railway police jawan. ""Talamai debates if she should follow, and decides to. He is offering food, after all, and she is hungry."" When he asks, ""Will you do some work for me?"" Talamai knows what work he is talking about. He uses her, saying ""Saali, you Santhal women are made for this only."" But ""She just lies  passive, unthinking, unblinking  as cold as the paved ground...as still as an inert earthen bowl into which a dark cloud empties itself."" Finally, the jawan ""gives Talamai two pieces of cold bread pakora and a fifty-rupee note and walks away. She re-ties her saya and lungi, stuffs the note into her blouse, eats both the bread pakoras, and walks back to her group"".It is a masterly feat to condense and communicate such intense pathos and horror in a few unadorned lines. The scale of Shekhar's achievement is directly akin to all-time great Sadaat Hasan Manto, whose shorter-than-short stories remain the most searing evocations of Partition in 1947. 'November is the Month of Migrations' acutely recalls 'Khol Do (Open It)', where Manto writes about Sirajuddin, desperately searching for his abducted daughter, after a nightmare escape to Lahore. ""A succession of images raced through his mind. Attack... fire... escape... railway station...night...Sakina."" He finds her nigh-unconscious in a hospital. ""The doctor looked at the prostrate body and felt for the pulse. Then he said to the old man, ""Open It"" [meaning the nearby window]. The young woman on the stretcher moved slightly. Her hands groped for the cord which kept her salwar tied around her waist. With painful slowness, she unfastened it, pulled the garment down and opened her thighs.""Shekhar's critics aren't bothered about the obvious literary merit of his work. They are incensed about other things. The author told me via e-mail, ""This is tribal cultural politics. This is the politics of region, script, identity... a very layered and complicated issue. All I can say is those who hate my books without even reading them, will hate them no matter what."" But this turf battle is markedly like what plays out in other parts of India, including Goa. Some Santhals support the tribal-created Ol-Chiki script, and maintain Sarna (their animist faith). But converts to Christianity back the Roman script. Shekhar thoroughly confounds those stereotypes.But why shouldn't that be the case? Why should a few individuals determine what is suitably or insufficiently Santhal, or Goan, or Indian? In this regard, the recently departed poet and scholar Eunice de Souza complained, ""My blood boils when I hear an Indian talking about ""Indian culture"". This is a primitive impulse, finding something coherent and limited and saying, ""This is Indian culture"", and everybody else is excluded."" It should be noted she was a sincere admirer of 'The Adivasi will not Dance', calling it ""a fine book of stories."" This most discerning of critics wrote, ""I'm not interested in the ethnicity of writers, just whether they have something to say that deepens one's understanding of the world. Shekhar does just that...'The Adivasi Will Not Dance' is a remarkable achievement.""The writer is a photographer and a widely published columnist. Views are personal"

The price of goat meat ('mutton', in local parlance) has gone down in the past month. And you can thank the friendly neighbourhood chicken seller for providing stiff competition, which has caused the price dip.While goat meat is selling at Rs 520 at Manicktala and Rs 530 at Rahmania in Kidderpore, it is as low as Rs 480 and even Rs 450 at markets in Gariahat and Behala. Till last month, the price was upwards of Rs 550.Meat traders blame chicken, which is selling for prices as low as Rs 120 across markets. Also, during monsoon, goats tend to develop fatal diseases (pneumonia, enterotoxemia and foot-and-mouth disease) and so, most sellers try to get the goats sold as quickly as possible.Food-loving Bengalis are overjoyed at the uncharacteristically 'downwardly mobile' prices.""At a time when all vegetables  from tomatoes to onions  are getting pricey, chicken and mutton prices have suddenly gone down. We are eating mutton at least twice or thrice a week these days. Earlier, mutton was only a Sunday treat,"" said Gariahat resident Arup Chakraborty Meat sellers at Gariahat said the price of goat meat was Rs 530 till end-June. Since then, there was a gradual decrease in the price, and now it's selling for Rs 480. ""The price has gone down since we are getting goats cheaper. Goat sellers are selling off the animals quickly fearing the animals would contract fatal diseases,"" said Md Asif, a seller at Gariahat.At Rahmania in Kidderpore, the price was hovering near the Rs 570 mark, but it has now come down to around Rs 530.However, 'reyaji mutton (goat meat with just the right amount of fat)', a delicacy and a speciality at their shop, is still priced at Rs 550. ""There has been a slight drop in price across the city. Apart from the cattle disease, another reason is stiff competition from chicken,"" said an employee at the shop.To make the most of the occasion, families of would-be brides and grooms in the upcoming wedding season are in a hurry to change their chicken platters with mutton items. ""We have been receiving requests to alter our price or change chicken items with mutton, but we have told our customers that the current price cannot affect our rate chart in any manner, as when we actually buy the meat, the prices are definitely going to rise again. We have a fixed rate chart and are charging our clients accordingly, irrespective of the changing prices,"" said Dwaraka Dutt of Diamond Caterers.Restaurants across the city, too, are following the same norm but some roadside eateries have slashed the prices of mutton rolls and mutton keema by around Rs 2 to Rs 5 to lure more customers. Industry sources said the prices are sure to increase a week before Viswakarma Puja on September 17 and again before the start of the wedding season.During monsoon, goats are prone to acquiring a number of parasite and bacteria-borne diseases that remain dormant during dry season. With arrival of wet weather, the parasites get the upper hand and their populations explode. The common diseases being pneumonia, foot and mouth disease  fatal contagious disease on the hoofs and mouth  and enterotoxemia  a disease that occurs due to toxin produced by bacteria of clostridium species."

When shirtless, each of the seven pairs of bones that make up his upper ribcage is visible from five feet away. An attending doctor at the Habibpur block hospital in Malda, West Bengal feels his spleen and the verdict is clear: VL, he declares, followed by two other colleagues jotting the verdict and leading the boy aside for a confirmatory dipstick test, a detailed set of photographs, a skin biopsy and a recommendation that he immediately begin treatment.Sarkar presented symptoms considered typical of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), or kala-azar, a disease that is endemic to a contiguous blob of districts spanning West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Caused by the Leishmania donovani parasite, harboured by an insect called the sandfly, the Habibpur block, barely 30 km from Bangladesh, is considered particularly vulnerable to kala-azar outbreaks.A parasitic diseaseKala-azar is a parasitic disease that is confined to humans, meaning that unlike, say, bird flu, there is no other animal that harbours the infection in Asia. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent in 119 districts in four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal), India itself accounts for half the global burden of the disease. If untreated, kala-azar can kill within two years of the onset of the ailment, though the availability of a range of drugs for almost a century has meant that less than 1 in 1,000 now succumb to the disease. According to numbers from the Union Health Ministry, 2016 was the first year that no kala-azar death was reported in India. Experts, however, note that like malaria and several other vector-borne diseases in India, the government only considers lab-confirmed and officially registered deaths and therefore, frequently underestimates both caseload and mortality.Historically, a 20-day treatment schedule with sodium stibogluconate (SSb) injection and the spraying of the malarial insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethan (DDT) in houses and surroundings were the only weapons against the disease.When DDT was used as part of the malaria eradication programme, very few cases of kala-azar were reported. When the use of DDT was stopped a few years later, there was an increase in the number of kala-azar cases.Over a period of time, resistance to the only drug (SSb injection) led to frequent outbreaks and fatalities and the Union Health Ministry, which had committed to eliminating kala-azar by 2010, revised it to 2015. Bangladesh, India and Nepal committed to eliminate the disease from the region, where elimination (as opposed to eradication) is defined as no more than one case per 10,000 population at the upazila level in Bangladesh, sub-district (block PHC) level in India and district level in Bhutan and Nepal.Since 2003, Indias National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is in charge of coordinating with endemic States to eliminate the disease. With funds from a World Bank-supported project (2008-2013), the NVBDCP now funds consultants at State and district level and Kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS) at the States blocks (or clusters of village panchayats) to conduct active surveillance. That means local village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs) are entrusted with constantly visiting houses and looking for patients who may present symptoms of the disease and alert health authorities.Several new medical advances have aided the fight against kala-azar. A rapid diagnostic test, called rK39 can  with a pinprick of blood  indicate the presence of the parasite. With SSb injection on the decline, there are now two mainline drugs, miltefosine  originally conceived as an anti-cancer drug and taken orally  and liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), a drug that once needed to be injected at regular intervals over four weeks but now only requires a single shot. These, besides an array of genetic tests that have obviated the need for painful jabs to the spleen and liver to confirm the presence of parasites, and global and national political commitment in terms of funding research and drug dispensation, has meant that kala-azar may be on the verge of being stamped out. However the 2015 elimination target was missed and postponed to September 2017, again a deadline that wont be met. This, in spite of the number of kala-azar patients plummeting from 36,000 in 2005 to 2,969 in 2017, according to Central government figures.At the campSarkar is one of 57 residents whove made it to the Habibpur hospital as part of biannual medical camps organised as part of the active surveillance process. About 160 were expected but a bus strike has thwarted attendance. West Bengal, like the other endemic States, was to have eliminated kala-azar in 2015, but is set to miss the deadline this year too despite the number of patients in the State coming down from 2,700 in 2005 to less than 50 as of this July.Among the camp attendees, seated on the rows of wooden benches that made up the capacious common hall of the hospital, Sarkar was the only one who presented the typical symptoms  the emaciation, anaemia and signs of a puffed spleen  that have helped doctors quickly ferret out kala-azar cases for almost a century. More than Sarkar, however, what worried the visiting doctors were 20 outwardly healthy occupants of those benches. Most were once kala-azar patients and, as the doctors who screened them found, are stricken in various degrees by a mixture of blotches and ulcers on their hands, legs, backs and, sometimes, on their faces.Painless and never known to trigger the fevers and pains typical of parasitical diseases, the blemished skin is the only sign of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It isnt the kind of disease that prompts villagers of Habibpur block, who besides kala-azar also live under the constant threat of malaria and tuberculosis, to skip farm work or forego a days earnings from manual labour, to line up outside hospitals. One of the patients with PKDL told me that the only reason he wanted treatment was because he was looking to get married, says Dr. Mitali Chatterjee, a medical doctor and researcher at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGME&R), Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital, Kolkata, which is known informally as the PG hospital.PKDL results from the parasites left over from a kala-azar infection that couldnt be slain by the chemical cocktails used to treat kala-azar. Though harmless, the pigmented skin can provide harbour, says Chatterjee, to the parasites and they can make their way onto other sandflies. Like the anopheles mosquito, the sandfly needs human blood to nourish their larvae and in the process can pass on parasites to new people and trigger a kala-azar infection. Roughly a tenth of those with a history of kala-azar will go on to develop PKDL and, potentially, seed a fresh outbreak. The precise reason for this isnt known yet. In the 1970s or early 80s, VL [kala-azar] had almost disappeared and then there was suddenly an epidemic, says Srija Moulik, a research scholar at IPGME&R, it was later traced back to a single case of PKDL. Theres a paper on that.Case and cure filesThe earliest empirical evidence for a link between PKDL as a silent agent provocateur for kala-azar outbreaks and DDT sprays came in the 1990s from C.P. Thakur, a physician and now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP. He reported an unusual trend in kala-azar cases in Bihar. Between 1970 and 1989, 530 individuals were confirmed with PKDL at the Patna Medical College (PMC), with the number of cases rocketing from two in 1970 to 59 in 1989. This was in contrast to no cases of this disease being reported at the PMC from 1958-1970. In the period 1977-1990, there were 3,01,076 cases of kala-azar reported in Bihar alone, with a mortality rate of over 2% (compared with 31,074 cases and a mortality rate below 0.4% for the rest of India). It seems possible, that once DDT spraying stopped, the re-establishment of large sandfly populations and infection of these vectors, largely as a result of them feeding on cases of PKDL, provoked the resurgence of kala-azar, Thakur and co-author K. Kumar reported in the June 1992 edition of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology .Even though this link between kala-azar and PKDL was hinted at since 1922, it wasnt until 2005 that the World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan (who together account for 90% of kala-azar cases) began concerted efforts to eliminate PKDL, as part of kala-azar elimination strategies.In a round-up of the countrys progress in dealing with the disease, at a conference in Bengaluru earlier this year, Chatterjee showed a slide illustrating that in spite of the rapid dive in kala-azar cases across endemic States, PKDL cases in Bihar, which bears 70% of Indias kala-azar burden, had risen to 500 from nil in 2013; from 300 in 2013 to 900 in 2017 in Jharkhand and 50 to 250 in West Bengal, in the same period. To Chatterjee, however, the rise in cases indicates States increased efforts to find kala-azar patients and hidden PKDL cases becoming manifest.At the IPGME&R, one of the nodal research medical labs in Kolkata thats part of the kala-azar surveillance-detection-and-analysis network, scientists are finding out through DNA analysis that the leishmaniasis parasite is an extremely resilient entity and can be dormant in the body and seed infections even after as many as five years.The group of mostly-women scientists, who are trying to cleave apart the mysteries of the parasite, are located a five-minute walk away from a modest building that once hosted the laboratory of Sir Ronald Ross, the India-born British Nobel Laureate who established that mosquitoes were responsible for transmitting malaria. Ross was also the one who christened the kala-azar parasite as Leishmania donovani , after the scientist duo that discovered them.Over the days spent peering through blood samples and skin biopsies from medical camps such as at Malda, Moulik points to yet another possible chink in the governments artillery to weed out kala-azar. The single injection of LAmB, which is now used to treat kala-azar, dramatically reduces the number of parasites in the blood and can cure the infection. However, when PKDL patients were subjected to the same medicine (targeting the same parasite), it didnt completely clear the parasite load. On the other hand, prior to LAmB, the treatment of choice for kala-azar was miltefosin, which is an oral pill taken over 12 weeks. It usually brought about nausea and other discomfort because of which several patients would quit treatment midway. However Moulik points to data in the lab that shows miltefosin did a superior job in flushing out the parasites from PKDL patients. There is a catch though. The ultra-sensitive probes that Moulik employs can spot parasites only if there are at least 10 of them in a microgram of DNA. It is quite possible that a patient might be well and disease-free for a few years but have a miniscule amount of parasites that will multiply at an opportune time in, say, five years, and then radiate the vicious cycle of outbreaks and epidemics that has undermined anti-kala-azar programmes through the years. I believe that if parasite loads go down to 10, the bodys immune system should ideally stave off infection but this is indeed the million-dollar question: How long till we are sure that the parasite loads never increase enough to pose a threat? says Moulik.The ground realitiesThe Habibpur hospital, from where IPGME&R gets a significant number of patient samples, is as large as a single-screen movie hall with X-ray machines, photocopiers, beds and a handful of trained nurses. To get to it, one must cross a stream of stagnant water that, according to local residents, swells up during the monsoon. Within several areas of the hospital, debris is piled up. There is a mossy pool of garbage alongside a water cooler that is inaccessible to the most flexible of gymnasts.The block medical officer is a busy man who must, alongside coordinating a kala-azar camp, dragoon the same set of field workers to fan out into the villages looking for tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy patients. Since 2015, when the government authorities woke up to the urgency of eliminating PKDL, patients are being given financial incentives. All those who complete the course of treatment will get Rs. 2,500 (and the medicines made available through the WHO network) and the village field staff, consisting of ASHAs and KTSs, stand to get Rs. 500 for every such patient. If financial incentives are given, then we get patients, says a doctor who has been part of several field camps, but almost never has a district medical officer accompanied us. They are supposed to.English Mohanpur, an inexplicably-named village a few km away from the hospital, is a slushy hamlet between rice fields. Several tribal communities populate its interiors and Koel, an ASHA worker, says some of the tuberculosis and kala-azar patients also battle alcoholism. Few houses have concrete roofs and fewer still comply with the government directive to spray the houses with the insecticide synthetic pyrethroid, the replacement for DDT. These sprays are needed at regular intervals and need a thorough application in every room including the kitchen. The problem is that the spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell, says Chatterjee. There is also a cluster effect. Families stay very close together and one infected person can spread it to the others.Sripad Mandal, 42, a daily-wage labourer and village resident, was bedridden for three months because of kala-azar. He says he visited the block hospital and was given a course of medicine but that didnt work. He wasnt given a second round of medicine at the hospital and finally had to get himself admitted to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. He now claims to be well. His disease, however, manifested before the government announced financial incentives for completing the treatment. This is the disease of the poorest of the poor. Unless socio-economic conditions are improved and better sanitation is available, I dont see just medicines and drugs completely eradicating kala-azar, says Chatterjee.The problem is that the pyrethroid insecticide spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell.Dr. Mitali Chatterjee,Doctor and researcher, Kolkata"

The accused are Dilip Agrawalla of Mayurbhanj, who is the managing director of Sabitri Industries Pvt Limited in Badchana under Jajpur district and Pankaj Agrawalla of West Bengal, who is director of Ganapati Parboiling Industries Pvt Limited in Bhadrak.While Dilip is accused of non-delivery of rice worth nearly `2.97 crore after taking paddy from Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation, Pankaj has allegedly not delivered rice worth `1.22 crore, informed BK Sharma, Crime Branch Special DG. The Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation had lodged two complaints in this regard after the accused failed to deliver the rice after procuring paddy. Subsequently, two police teams were formed to investigate the matter.Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation limited had provided 62.239 quintals of paddy to Dilip for delivering 42.322.87 quintals of rice last year. However, he delivered only 24.402.12 quintals of rice and in the process, misappropriated over `2.97 crore. Similarly, the corporation had provided 66.046.94 quintals of paddy to Pankaj for delivering 44.911.92 quintals of rice in 2016 under the decentralised procurement system. Pankaj delivered only 36.395.94 quintals of rice and misappropriated over `1.22 crore. Pankaj would be produced in a court in West Burdwan, West Bengal. He will then be brought to Bhadrak on transit remand. Dilip will be produced in JMFC court at Chandikhol."

A short distance ahead are mother and daughter Jil Pyngrope, 75, and Stailin, 40, standing on an incline plucking tea leaves, tossing them into baskets on their backs. Their chuckles hide the gloom of a difficult past.For the inhabitants of Mawlyngot village in Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills , tea is not just another crop but a means for survival and reclaiming pride. Jil and Stailin were part of an alcohol brewing community, until they found a way to better their lot - by brewing delicate flavours of their own brand of tea, Urlong, which means 'dream come true' in Khasi. The tea is now looking to rival the country's popular infusions from Assam and Darjeeling.About 40km from Shillong , at an altitude of 4,800ft, the sleepy hamlet of Mawlyngot is about a century and a half old. Locals say people from the India-Bangladesh border migrated down the river Umsong and settled on the hills. Early inhabitants thrived on smallscale cultivation of yam, corn, millet, potato, chilli and banana but with lower yields and absence of policing, they turned to the easy-to-brew country liquor 'pyrsi' made from rice and millet.Mawlyngot's brewery soon became reason for the community's steady collapse  broken homes, chronic illnesses, drunken brawls and penury. ""As a landless villager with no education, brewing pyrsi was an easy way to earn money. You can't escape addiction when you're brewing alcohol all day. I would often get into fights on the streets,"" says Phroshon Songthiang, 39. Phroshan is now a changed man who manages the community-run tea processing unit.The turnaround began after village headman D L Nongspung stumbled upon camellia shrubs - a plant from the tea family - growing in the area. The soil enriched by the rare presence of blue worms made the place ideal for tea cultivation.For Nongspung, it was ""a command from God"" to wean away Mawlyngot from the spirit. ""What struck me after moving here in 1987 was the number of children dropping out of school. The rate was 60%, and the main reason was families being unable to afford books or fees as they earned less than Rs 1,000 a month from brewing illicit liquor,"" he recalls.With an initial funding of Rs 58 lakh from the tribal affairs ministry and a community contribution of Rs 5 lakh in 2003 and NGO World Vision 's intervention, 25 farmers in the village started learning the art of harvesting tea. It wasn't until 2007 that the first batch of tea leaves was plucked. ""The farmers were eager to switch to a new way of life but the start wasn't easy,"" says Nongspung.Land holding being small and fragmented, farmers would sell their produce locally for a small profit. So they got together to form the Urlong Tea Integrated Village Cooperative Society in 2011, a society that currently comprises 41 farmers who own individual gardens with an implied agreement of interdependence.""They sell the leaves plucked from their gardens to the society-owned tea processing plant for the collective benefit of all farmers,"" explains Nongspung.Besides a daily wage for plucking of Rs 300 for males and Rs 200 for females, land owners get up to 15% share in the annual profit.From an annual sale of Rs 2 lakh for 300kg a decade ago, the turnover has increased to Rs 15 lakh for 3,000kg of green, black and white tea in 2016. Ivashisha Pyngrope, secretary of the tea growers' society, has returned to Mawlyngot after finishing college in Shillong. ""I want to do my bit for my village too,"" says the 31-year-old. ""I've seen my house filled with jerry cans of liquor, my father drink uncontrollably and the family turn asocial,"" she says, but her eyes light up when she recalls the first coat of paint and an almirah her house got after her father switched to tea gardening.""He is sober now, spends quality time with us, eating meals at home, praying at church and discussing the farm,"" she says.Markers of civic progress  schools, electricity, footpaths, a guesthouse and motorable roads - have begun to appear in the village. Seven neighbouring villages are also replicating Mawlyngot's model. Currently a popular item on the racks in Meghalaya, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Delhi, the first flush of Oolong tea has also found takers in Australia. Mawlyngot's cultivation practices are organic and they received certification from the Control Union, which helps Urlong tap the international market.""Mawlyngot is now on the tourist map,"" says Nongspung. ""We're hoping for more people to come find us."""

Companies and traders were bullish about sugarcane and cotton , which have seen an increase in acreage by 9% and 18%, respectively, this year.Floods in parts of Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and weak rainfall in south India have hit crops. Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

And during the five days of Puja, eating at home is a big no-no for most Kolkatans. No wonder, most city restaurants come up with Puja special menus, while others experiment with their regular offerings to woo customers during the festival. For some foodies, happiness is gorging on the traditional Bengali cuisine, while for others, Puja is the time to explore tastes. So, while you chalk out your pandal-hopping itinerary, it's time you also make plans of dropping into restaurants offering your favourite dishes with a quirky twist. Not only do the dishes have a hint of Bangaliana in them, but will also leave you with an ethereal aftertaste, making the festivities a yummy experience. Like the idea?A true-blue Bengali surely knows his fish. From pabda to parshe, from hilsa to katla, there's hardly anyone who can beat the Bangali babu when it comes to choosing the freshest of fish at a Sunday morning market. But while the maachh has remained constant, the jhol has seen transformation of tastes over the years. The plain simple fish curry, made mostly with paanch foron, now sees the inclusion of exotic items like lotus stems and elephant apple, among other things. The latest experiment with the Bengali fish curry is the addition of kamala or oranges, apart from other Indian spices, thereby giving an all new twist to the dish. Here's presenting you the kamala katla jhol. The dish draws inspiration from Pratim D Gupta's film, Maacher Jhol, and is available at 6 Ballygunge Place. Paoli, the leading lady of the film, joined us at the restaurant to experience the delicacy, which is surely going to be the must-have item for every Bengali this Puja.Maachher jhol and Bengalis are inseparable. A fish loving Bengali cannot even imagine a day without his bowl of maachher jhol and bhaat. And giving a quirky twist to the staple Bengali fish curry is the kamala katla jhol. Inspired by the recently released film Maacher Jhol, the dish, as the name suggests, has orange juice as one of the main ingredients. It not only lends a sweet and tangy taste to the dish, but also gives a strong aroma of orange. The chefs of 6 Ballygunge Place indulged in extensive brainstorming and research before coming up with the correct concoction of spices. Garnished with curry leaves and pieces of fresh oranges, the gravy of the dish will leave your tastebuds asking for more. A plate of steaming-hot basmati rice goes perfectly with this item.Biryani has been winning the hearts of Bengalis for ages now. And no celebration is complete without a steaming hot plateful. The aromatic spiced rice  a staple from the kitchen of the Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah  came to the City of Joy in 1856. Over the years, the delectable Mughlai dish has been savoured in different forms  with aloo or without, sprinkled, at times, with golden fried onions, or shredded meat instead of a large chunk. A hot favourite for the Kolkatans this Puja would be Oudh 1590's raan biryani, in which hand-pulled tender shredded meat is generously sprinkled over flavoured rice and the combination is cooked in dum pukht style. The biryani comes without the round golden brown aloo, but the ample amount of meat makes up for its absence. And to give a hint of Bangaliana, the dish is topped with a generous dollop of khanti ghee!Murgir jhol or Bengali-style chicken curry has always been a delicacy, be it during the festive season or on a mundane weekday. The Chatgaiya murgir jhol is inspired by the culinary traditions of Chittagong in Bangladesh and is a typical home-style chicken curry. This dish will be enjoyed by lovers of spicy food, especially since it's simply made using coriander paste and green chilli paste. A plateful of hot ghee bhat is the best accompaniment with this dish.If you gather a bunch of argumentative Kolkatans and ask them about which place serves the best fish fry in town, you can expect the followingmonologue: ""I love Mitra Cafe, but Apanjan's fish fry is fluffy and has a thick slab of bekti fillet...."" But this common Bengali snack has experienced an innovative twist over the years and is available in different shapes, sizes and fillings, apart from the bekti fillet. The Tikki of Joy (name inspired from the City of Joy) is the Kolkata style fish fry, but here the fish is lightly poached as opposed to boiling it, and the coating is made with Japanese Panko style breadcrumbs and then deep fried. It is served with kasundi that's absolutely fresh and zingy.What saves you when you're dead hungry after hours of pandal hopping and want something filling to satiate your tummy? A pizza. And when this Italian staple dish comes with a quirky Bengali twist, your pet pujo is taken care of during the festive season. And when the Bengali's favourite daab chingri comes as a pizza topping, then happiness really knows no bounds. Slow cooked prawns with tender coconut, ground mustard, chilli and fennel are sprinkled generously on the pizza. If you're curious about the mention of Iti aunty, then the chef of Monkey Bar, told us that he once had a delectable daab chingri delicacy prepared by a woman named Iti. He loved the dish so much that he decided to make a pizza inspired by it, using it as a topping, and thus coined this special name.The Bong 's favourite hansher dim diye gorom bhaat gets a modern twist through this dish. The duck eggs are cleverly incorporated by adding diced runny half-boiled duck eggs and the yolk to a mixture of cream, butter and macaroni pasta before it is gratinated with sharp cheddar cheese.Bongs drool over crabs. Fondly called 'Dasarath' in Bengali households, the crabs are mixed with zesty seasonings in this dish, making it a must try this Puja. The well-cooked crab meat are topped with buttered breadcrumbs and served with boiled veggies. Sounds yummy, doesn't it? Trust us, it really is!Khubani is apricots in Hindi. Unlike the regular malai koftas, which are round, these are in the shape of kodma  a type of sweet used in several Pujas in the city. Apart from apricots, the stuffing of the kofta consists of mashed potato, cashew nuts, paneer, chopped garlic and green chillies. The koftas, after being fried separately, is dipped in sweet and spicy makhani gravy. The dish also has a dash of kasoori methi, which gives it a nice aroma.It's not often that we find chirey or flattened rice, a common food item in Bengali households, being used in an exotic dish. In this delicacy, the flattened rice is used in an innovative way along with paneer, green peas, palak, potato, kishmish, khoya and cashew nut. The chirey is used as the crumb in preparing the kebabs and since it also has a cheese filling, as you take each bite, the liquid cheese melts in your mouth! The dish is served with mint chutney. With acrispy outer coating and a soft stuffing inside, the kebabs make for the best accompaniment with beverages.Molecular gastronomy takes over the Bengali rannaghar as the age-old tradition of rubbing fish with spices and mustard oil before deep frying is retained here while preparing this delicacy. The bekti fillets are dry rubbed in a marinade of cream cheese and tangy sweet homemade aam kasundi and then, instead of deep frying, they are vacuum-sealed and poached in a sous vide machine at a controlled temperature, retaining the natural juiciness and flavours of the fish and extracting all the notes and textures of aam kasundi, which would otherwise be lost in deep frying. Sous vide is a method of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in a plastic pouch and then placed in a water bath or steam environment for longer than normal cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours) at an accurately regulated temperature. The dish is served with a creme. Chantilly of whipped cream and Malibu rum.Happiness knows no bound when the kosha mangsho aka spicy Bengali mutton curry  a Sunday staple in the Bong household  finds a place on a pizza topping. Especially during Duga Puja, when you crave to have a traditional Bengali dish, yet look for a quirky twist, Hoppipola's kosha mangsho pizza should be the top choice. Chunks of spicy mutton pieces are placed on a layer of cheese in this thin crust pizza. It's crispy, cheesy, zesty and definitely oh so yummy."

An entire neighbourhood in Nandibagan -located in Kasba's Haltu area -spent three sleepless nights trying to help an 80-year-old get back to her home.The woman, who has been detected with severe signs of memory loss and bronchitis, was given a room inside the local club and offered `khichdi' and rice -the food being served to craftsmen who are camping there to construct a local Durga Puja pandal.The woman, presently admitted in the female ward of MR Bangur Hospital, was found wandering on Tuesday eve ning before members of the Haltu Milan Sangha Club spotted her and asked her to share her address. ""It was around 7.30pm and I found her loitering alone near the SD-8 bus stand on the main Garfa Road . She was almost being run over by a bus and she seemed to have lost her power to even get up. When I walked up to her, she asked for food,"" said Ajoy Banerjee, a local tea shop owner and a member of the club.""Initially, she said she was from Deula located near Mograhat in South 24 Parganas. Then she said she was from Barasat. Since there is a place called Dakshin Barasat , also in South 24 Parganas, we decided to send a few locals to the Mograhat police to enquire,"" said Tapas Chakraborty , another member.The locals then convinced the octogenarian to spend the night at the club. ""Since the pandal of the Nandibagan Sarbojonin is located nearby, we have someone or the other on night vigil. We asked them to keep a watch on her,"" added Chakraborty.Wednesday, though, posed a fresh challenge. ""The woman refused to stay with us saying she was out on a pleasure trip with her son and daughter-in law and that she got lost. She said she was confident of finding her way. Since we were not her guardian, we could not stop her.A day later, some club members found her lying in dirt a little ahead towards Haltu crossing. She was breathing heavily. Officers of Garfa PS saw her and tried to contact an NGO but left without any success,"" said Subhendu Dey, the club secretary.Even as she was brought back to the club, a hunt for her relatives was launched on the social media by some members.By Thursday evening, her condition worsened and she was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital around 10.30pm. Police are yet to trace her kin."

Earlier, the State had to take permission from the Centre to procure essential commodities whose prices had risen beyond the reach of the common man.At present, when prices fluctuate, the State Food and Civil Supplies Department demands a subsidised price list from the Centre and puts up a proposal for procurement with the State government. But this process takes a long time, and until then the crisis usually has already hit a peak. With a decentralised policy for procurement, we will save a lot of time, said an official.Last year, the government had decided to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell it to State fair-price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India from the procurement chain. But the move was made possible by switching to the Centres scheme of decentralised procurement of food grain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and the Public Distribution System (PDS).The government has already started buying sugar, meant for distribution through PDS every month, through a live centralised e-auction conducted through the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX), an online commodity exchange.The auction had received great response and cut out the role of middlemen; it showed us that independent procurement can be done in a fair and transparent way, said a former secretary of the Food and Civil Supplies Department.West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala have adopted decentralised policies. Data shows that due to the decentralised process, there has been an increase in procurement of grains in these States."

There is a different energy that fills the air with the realisation of Pujo asche! (The Puja is coming). The chills in the air, Durga idols on the roadside, fresh flowers adorning the streets, pandal structures show the people of Bengal are getting ready to welcome Maa Durga.To aid in the festivities and soothe the strong pinch of nostalgia, DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Bangalore has come up with The Calcutta Connection  a celebration of the culinary flavours from the East India during Durga Puja. They bring together four special events from Saptami to Dashami, assuring to provide an unparalleled taste of Bengali cuisine in Bengaluru. Thakur (Maharaj) Gangadhar Hati will join the culinary team here to offer an authentic experience.Four culinary events inspired by Durga pujaRajbarir Ranna on Saptami (Sept 27)The diner will get to enjoy the flavours with a touch of nostalgia, as they present the niramish (veg) and amish (non-veg) dishes created with traditional family recipes from the Rajbaris of Bengal.Bagbajar ba Madox?! on Ashtami (Sept 28)North and South Kolkata face-off will have the best of both worlds - favourites from cafs and snack bars in Bagbazar Sarbojanin and the Ilish Paturi and more from Maddox Square.Calcutta-700016 on Nabami (Sept 29)Visit the most iconic place in Kolkata - Park Street. From the Chelo Kebabs of Peter Cat to Kwalitys Fish Orly with Tartar Sauce and the desserts from Flurys and Upper Crust, you can have it all.Opar Bangla on Dashami(Sept 30)A culinary experience from the eastern part of Bengal.Specials from menuThe taste of every single dish presented is the closest Bengali food I have ever had. There was absolutely nothing bad at The Calcutta Connection. Here is my top five picks that were simply awesome.Golborir Kosha MangshoInspired by an old restaurant that is considered as a heaven for meat lovers in Kolkata, this is the best Kosha Mangsho I have ever had. The perfectly cooked mutton, that beautiful brown colour, the bubbles of different spices, the aroma filling your nose... absolutely lip-smacking stuff. The taste multiplies when you have it with luchi.Machcher PaturiI was speechless after I had a first bite of this Bengali classic. Machcher Paturi is prepared by wrapping fish Bhetki in a banana leaf with mustard paste. It is slowly cooked in steam and served. The strong flavour of mustard is the soul of this dish. This is something, you would not want to miss.Shiraz Mutton BiryaniThe taste of Kolkata Biryani is one thing that has been tough to forget over the years. The boiled potatoes, the basmati rice, the aroma of Asghar Ali attar specially used in Biryanis and the finely cooked mutton evoked the wonderful memories I had in Kolkata.Lau er Ghanto Bori DiyeThis is Bottle Gourd curry in a Bengali style with vada. The beauty of this dish lies in its simplicity. When so much of action is happening on the plate with the likes of fish and mutton, it tends to get sidelined. But a small portion of it with rice or chapati will restore your faith in it. It is usually cooked with minimal spices, coriander being the most dominant among all. The aroma of ghee adds the needed finesse.Darjeeling Tea Panna Cotta and Gold Flake SmokeTea in one hand and cigarette in another is a common sight in Bengal. Taking a cue from this, the chefs have prepared this dish."

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

In 2001, some poor and marginalised women of the village produced mudhi and marketed it though a self-help group (SHG) Mayurbhanj Mudhi Association (MMA).Around 130 women from the locality joined the association and have made puffed rice business lucrative. Their success story has inspired several others in the nearby villages. Now, around 80 to 90 quintals of mudhi are being produced every month.Some farmers even cultivate rice to meet the demand for mudhi. Price of mudhi per bag has been increased from `140 to `150, said Anup Kumar Behera, who has been volunteering to monitor the SHGs operation. He said the rural market is consuming approximately 60 per cent of the produce while the rest are exported to other towns and States.MMA secretary Kabita Behera said the cooperative has been following several strategies for strengthening its market linkage. Apart from selling it in the weekly market, the bloated rice is being exported to West Bengal, Jharkhand, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Mumbai, she added.With the support of the district administration and NGOs, they displayed the famous Baripada mudhi during State and National level exhibitions and trade festivals. Though the SHG is running with a small workshop at Sangrami Mahila Mandal, it is has no adequate space to cater to the needs of their business. Earlier, they had urged a former collector to provide a government building for smooth functioning of the association. But so far, no action has been taken in this regard."

Das and his father will provide a vital service during the Durga Puja, which is incomplete without the almost continuous and hypnotic beats of huge drums, better known as dhaks.The drummers, or dhakis, are struggling to earn money during the five-day festivities in the capital. Das and his father are among the 200-odd drummers who have arrived here from tiny villages in West Bengal districts of Malda, Murshidabad, Midnapore and Birbhum. They are struggling financially as the floods last month destroyed their rice crop and fields.Playing dhaks at various pandals in the capital could help these part-time drummers recoup financially. Train services in north Bengal were severely affected by the floods since August and this forced the dhakis to hire buses to travel to Delhi this year, spending an exorbitant amount of money on travel. ""My father and my younger brother too came to Delhi to earn more. We need money badly,"" reveals Gokul, a resident of Egra in Midnapore.With people struggling to cope with the aftermath of devastating floods, many drummers could not even decorate their dhaks with the distinct feather frills that give the Bengal drums their unique look. ""There are no more feathers available and we are completing some of our work here by replacing feathers (usually dropped by Siberian cranes during winter season) with pieces of plastic. It has been really bad for us these days, some of our drums were also damaged due to the floods,"" says Malda resident Rabi Das, who is waiting on a footpath outside the New Delhi Kali Bari for a Durga Puja organiser to offer him a contract. Perhaps, this is the last time Rabi will play the dhaak during Durga Puja as he plans to sell his instrument to meet his expenses.The floods also forced some of the dhakis to cut trees growing on their land to make new drums. They usually save Rs 5,000 through the year for travel and stay in Delhi. ""We are staying at the New Delhi Kali Bari to save on expenses this time,"" says Ranjit Das , who has been hired for Chittaranjan Park B-block Durga Puja. He and his fellow drummers will earn Rs 12,00015,000 for five days.The traditional musicians are struggling as younger people are not keen on following a poorly paid career and competition from recorded music is eating into their income. ""Playing the dhak needs a lot of energy and also calls for a lot of movement and dancing, which most people do not wish to pursue. This is a dying profession, which even my children would not pursue until there is some incentive,"" says Prashanto Das, resident of Bolpur in Birbhum district. ""We've agreed to pay them more due to their plight. This is afestival of happiness, we don't want them to go back with gloom,"" said Swapan Ganguly , from the New Delhi Kali Bari Durgotsav Committee."

They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

On Thursday, the lab announced that while half of them had low levels of the good cholesterol or HDL, two in every five had high levels of bad cholesterol of LDL.In Chennai, more than 8% of the people have very high levels of cholesterol and at least two out 10 are on the borderline. What was more worrying was that nearly one in ten has either high or very high levels of the bad cholesterol.Metropolis Healthcare head Dr Kirti Chadha said lifestyle, lack of exercise, junk food, increased stress level and smoking has pushed up risk of heart diseases.Most senior doctors say they aren't surprised by the numbers. ""High levels of cholesterol have been one of the leading causes of heart diseases in the country,"" said diabetologist Dr RM Anjana. ""Nevertheless, the numbers will be far higher in epidemiological studies compared to data from labs, where many people could be on medications,"" she said.Meanwhile, another survey by Suffola life 2017, which aimed to understand the barriers to heart health, among 1,306 respondents across Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata found long working hours, work stress, lack of sleep and long travel were key reasons.In Chennai, 85% of people said temptation for food comes in their way of putting efforts towards having a healthy heart. Studies have also shown that most people in the city eat high amount of carbohydrates such as rice and sugar and low levels of protein-rich food. While 80% also complained that long working hours and work stress prevent them from making efforts towards healthy practices such as exercise, 72% of them blamed it on distraction from phones and tablets.But more than 6 out of 10 people pointed out that the city does not have adequate space walking or exercising. Mumbai-based endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi said while there is a rising awareness about heart health, compliance and action is a big area of concern in India.Studies have shown that active lifestyle, which includes daily chores at home like cleaning, moping and gardening can reduce the risk of heart diseases and death."

She would always have a set of new clothes bought from Fancy Market to mark the day.On Saturday, as Darjeeling, weary after a strike that lasted an unprecedented 104 days, woke up to Dashain , Rumba was clear that this time she would forego the red tika she was famous for and wear a black tilak instead. ""It's for the lives we lost during the recent agitation for Gorkhaland,"" she said. ""It's also a pledge that we will not back down and persist with our demand for a separate homeland for the Gorkhas of India.""For the Gorkhas, Dashain is a time when they pray, eat, drink and wear their best clothes with an urgency that no other festival sees. In the all-round revelry that follows, everyone does brisk business. Meat vanishes from bazaars by early afternoon. Eateries and booze shops are always crowded. Many spend their month's earnings in a day partying with friends and relatives, dancing to local folk tunes.It was different this year. Dashain was ""very political"", as Krishna Rai, a school teacher, put it. Large sections of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha 's leadership have been arrested. Its chief, Bimal Gurung , wanted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is in hiding.There is simmering resentment against the Mamata Banerjee government, first for trying to impose Bengali as a language in the Hills and then for what considerable sections of society view as human rights violations during the past few months.The daughter of a senior cop who retired some years ago after serving the Bengal government all his life said he has been slapped with sedition for speaking up against ""Kolkata's attempt at cultural colonisation of the Darjeeling Hills"". He is now trying to escape the same police force he worked for. ""On what grounds has he been charged with such a stringent section,"" she asked, requesting not to be named. ""We are seeking a separate state, not country."" Recently, a petition reached NHRC regarding Manika Thami, a porter in Darjeeling.Thami was picked up by cops on July 8 for carrying weapons that no one found in her person. She is still in detention along with her daughter.If there is anger and grief at the death of 11 people who lost their lives in the latest round of agitation for Gorkhaland and the perceived excesses of the Bengal police, there is also confusion among the general public. With Gurung out of sight, Banerjee picked a team to take charge of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, the semi-autonomous body that the GJM chief was heading. Opinion regarding their intention as far as the cause of Gorkhaland is concerned is deeply debated.""The leadership is divided. But people are one,"" Rumba said. ""We will march on for Gorkhaland."""

The players of Mexico, the fourth team in the group, reached the city on Wednesday evening and will get to taste the city's famed sweetened yoghurt if the team manager gives the nod.""All the teams have strict dietary requirements and curbs on desserts. But mishti doi is one thing that the managers of three teams have taken fancy to. We are serving it in all three meals  breakfast, lunch and dinner  and the boys are loving it,"" said Neelabh Sahay, the executive chef at Novotel, where the teams are camping for the entire tournament.The yoghurt typical to Bengal has passed the stringent scrutiny of dieticians and managers off all three football teams that checked into the Fifa-designated hotel in Kolkata for the forthcoming Group F matches. The group matches will be played at Salt Lake stadium between October 8 and 14. Thereafter, the venue will also host a pre-quarter final, a quarter final, the playoff for the 3rd place and the all important final on October 28.The four teams have been housed on four different floors of the hotel but the players have all their meals on the first floor, where four banquet rooms have been reserved for each team. The two major meals of the day comprise approximately 600 gm meat, portions of carbohydrates, proteins and fruit juices. Each team has different dietary requirements that is catered by different sets of chefs. Only the England team has a travelling chef to supervise the meals being prepared in a different kitchen at the hotel.""Tenderloin forms an integral part of the diet of all the players. We have got chefs who specialise in their kind of cuisine. We served spaghetti bolognese, grilled bekti with minted green peas and strawberry milk shake for lunch on Wednesday,"" said Sahay.While all the players are gorging on misti doi, some have also begun experimenting with other Indian dishes. The Iraq players loved nan, tandoori roti and daal tadka. Sahay's team plans to offer them malai tikka kebab next. For team England, the chefs want to serve chicken curry, paneer curry and daal tadka. All teams managers are willing to let their boys try out Indian food provided there is nothing in it that makes them sweat. So hot spices, chillies and peppers are a strict no-no.The chefs have also been told to keep nuts and seeds out of the main course as many youngsters are allergic to them. ""Any dish that has nuts or seeds has to be kept on a separate table and labelled so that someone who is allergic does not eat it by mistake. So not all get to savor the nutrition bars that we serve with puffed rice and groundnuts,"" the master chef said.The team managers often double up as food minders, keeping a hawk eye on temptations that may lure their wards. The England team manager did not allow the players to bite into the football-shaped welcome cake. But the managers of team Chile and Iraq did. ""When the Chilean team came on Sunday and we offered them the cake, the boys cut it but were in two minds whether to eat it or not. When we asked their manager if they can be allowed to have a bite and the manager agreed, the players gave a loud cheer and the cake disappeared within minutes,"" recounted a front office staff.Even as the players brace up for the matches in what is being termed the group of death and stick to a strict schedule, the child within them surfaces whenever they spot chocolate. The eyes acquire a glint, the lips purse into a smile. A platter of Fifa-themed chocolates was a pleasant surprise that each player received when they checked into their rooms."

Bangladesh, therefore, has been forced to reduce import duty on rice from 28% to 2% in phases to tide over the crisis, which has been blamed largely on erratic rainfall.This, claim retail market operators in Kolkata, has fuelled export of rice from India  largely Bengal  which has, in turn, created a shortfall in the Bengal market.But the Bengal government has denied this demand-and-supply rationale behind the price rise and squarely blamed the middlemen and speculators. ""There is no deficit in our foodgrain stocks. A section of middlemen and speculators has jacked up retail prices by spreading all these rumours. We are keeping a close watch and will take strong action against such dishonest traders,"" Bengal agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta told TOI.Government statistics, wholesalers and rice mill owners support Dasgupta's contention. Bengal has produced 15.9 million tonnes of rice in 2016-17 and the domestic dem-and is 14.9 million tonnes, making for enough buffer to absorb any sudden spurt in export. ""A spike in exports alone cannot be blamed for this. A section of traders is using this as a ploy to increase retail prices,"" Arijit Saha, owner of a rice mill in Hooghly, said. ""Exports alone cannot create such a shortfall that will lead to a spike in the internal retail market,"" a Sealdah wholesale market insider said, adding: ""Some middlemen have spread these rumours and spiked the price.""Whatever the reason, several Kolkata households have already made small adjustments to their taste to keep the monthly expense bill same. Thakurpukur businessman Arghya Saha's family used to buy the Mini Kit variety till a week ago, when it used to cost Rs 32 a kg. But, with the price of this variety going up to Rs 38, they have started buying the Ratna variety, which now sells at Rs 34 a kg. ""This, too, has gone up. the regular price was Rs 28,"" Saha said. Other popular household varities have become more pricey as well; they include Swarna Madhu and Chhatrish Chaal.But it is not only the varities cooked at home that have become costlier. The Basmati sold loose, which is a key ingredient of Bengal's favourite biryani, is now pricier by Rs 5-7 a kg. ""Branded Basmati varieties, like Nafis, Wagha, Kohinoor and Adaab, have also become more expensive but that is because of GST. Branded Basmati, anyway, is used by only big restaurants,"" New Market retailer Naresh Bhai said.But this spike will not have an immediate impact on restaurant food prices. ""Restaurants will absorb the hike now,"" Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar said. ""We will wait for at least six months before going for a price revision though neighbourhood biryani joints may be forced to hike prices,"" he added."

""The glitzy Fifa event has done the place much good. Outdoor illumination is not only crucial in making a town safe and functional after dark, it also indicates celebration,"" he says.The neighborhood, especially Broad Street, the thoroughfare leading to the stadium, has suddenly transformed into a vivid landscape, ignited by lighting fixtures. Everything -from the rice lights spiraling the tridants and the spotlights flashing atop trees to the newly-installed lamp posts -has given a visual upgrade to Salt Lake.The luminosity extends to the boulevards, that have been recently built, and the renovated older ones.

One is suddenly aware of the existence of such a huge public infrastructure (street-lighting) which was not so apparent all these years,"" says conservation architect and AA Block resident Manish Chakraborti ""The street-lighting was given as much importance as the interiors of the stadium. If the stadium has 2kilowatt metal halide lamps, 400watt bulbs have been installed on the streets. About 250 new metal halides and 100-odd LEDs have been installed at a cost of Rs 25crore,"" says a PWD official. ""The lighting overhaul gives the township an extra glow, in the backdrop of 88,000odd spectators (capacity of Salt Lake stadium) visiting the place. Since LED is dimmer, metal halides have been used for street-lighting,"" said a PWD (electrical) official. Adding to the illumination are the pavement edges painted for the glow-in-the-dark effect. ""The lighting was planned so that it could synchronize with the landscaping,"" said an official pointing at the red and black paver tiles laid on the sidewalk.Conservation architect and former chairman, project committee, West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC), Partha Ranjan Das, who lives in AE Block, has some misgivings though. ""The light is a bit overdone. One can understand the need for white lights inside the stadium. For the streets, the white should have been mixed with yellow or other colours.Have the lux levels for the streets been adhered to, I wonder."" Artist and chairman, WBHC , Shuvaprasanna, wishes more professional hands are involved. ""All those foreigners who've come for the match must have got a well-lit view of Salt Lake from the sky.

5a14b8439855b76bf13e727b,Vietnamese tiger rides on foreign capital,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/vietnamese-tiger-rides-on-foreign-capital/article19822119.ece,2017-10-08,"Two years ago, a spanking new international terminal building was added to Hanois Noi Bai Airport. The Japanese ensured that the elegantly designed ultra-modern glass and steel structure would impress foreign visitors, whose numbers were bound to grow as Vietnam opened up to the rest of the world. Vietnams focus on its new terminal, which over time will service 15 million passengers, is in itself an indicator of the countrys intent to engage with the globe.Just like China and the Tiger economies, Vietnam has correctly diagnosed that its prosperity will have to ride on a judicious integration with the world economy. That means inviting foreign capital, which would come owing to the countrys low labour costs and business-friendly rules. A complementary focus on infrastructure  highways, railroads, ports, airports and services  would also ensure that Vietnam soon becomes a significant trading nation.A short distance from the airport, the imposing Nhat Tn Bridge comes into view. This too has been built by the Japanese and is among the largest cable-stayed bridges in Southeast Asia. At night, the five spans of the bridge, representing the five gates of the ancient capital, are each illuminated in distinct colours.The Philips Color Kinetics, which has been responsible for the illumination, claims that a staggering 16.7 million colours can be generated to light up the bridge that spans the Red river.The Red river begins its journey in mountains south of Dali, in Chinas Yunnan Province and enters Vietnam in the Lo Cai Province. Joined by two major tributaries  the Black river and L river  it terminates at the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea. The delta area is the heart of Vietnams rice production, and has been central to its food security. The river has also been pivotal for the rise of Vietnams Haiphong port.Korea, the biggest investorApart from the Japanese, the Koreans are investing big in Vietnam. In fact, Republic of Korea is, by far, the largest foreign investor in Vietnam. Last year, Seoul pitched in $5.5 billion, edging out Japan, which invested $868 million.Samsung is Koreas flagship investor. It is estimated that nearly half of its smartphones are churned out by its two factory complexes in Bac Ninh Province and Thai Nguyen Province, near Hanoi.Indias engagement with Vietnam has so far taken a different route, with geostrategy taking precedence over economics. Vietnam is the centrepiece of Indias Act East policy, which has the consolidation of its ties with the ASEAN at its heart. However, there is now a clear recognition of the need to impart a greater balance to New Delhi-Hanoi ties.We are hopeful that in the coming years the economic and people-to-people dimensions, including tourism, would be added to an extraordinarily solid, special and friendly relationship, says P. Harish, Indias Ambassador to Vietnam.Indian shipping could also benefit greatly as Vietnam consolidates its position as an international export hub serving the Indian market. Industry specialists point out that rapid development of ports along Indias east coast would be vital if India is to take advantage of its favourable maritime geography. Modern Indian ports along the Bay of Bengal from Chennai to Kolkata can also become profitable trans-shipment nodes for shipping goods from Asia to other parts of the world, said an industry specialist who did not wish to be named.Japan and Korea are taking advantage of the liberalisation of Vietnams economy by making big-ticket infrastructure investments. Can India follow suit?"
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

The BJP had in a similar manner raised the issue of alleged impropriety by Congress president Sonia Gandhis son-in-law Robert Vadra.We will walk that extra mile to expose the true face of the BJP. We will take this issue to each household and every nook and corner of the country. Justice may be poetic. The jury is out.The people of India will decide, Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said.The party sought Shahs resignation as the BJP chief till the probe was over in line with past precedents, citing BJP veterans LK Advani and Nitin Gadkari as examples. Apart from demanding an inquiry into the matter by sitting Supreme Court judges, it also wanted the Prime Minister to break his silence on the issue and immediately sack Shah.On Monday, the Congress held news conferences on the controversy in 12 cities across the country. While Anand Sharma held the fort in Delhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala and Sachin Pilot attacked the BJP in Jaipur.Raj Babbar raised the issue in Lucknow, RPN Singh in Ranchi, Rajni Patil, Pawan Khera abd Bhupesh Baghel were deputed to Raipur, Ajoy Kumar and Prasad Harichandan to Bhubaneswar, Gaurav Gogoi to Kolkata, Ripun Bora, Tarun Gogoi and Debbrat Saikia address the press conference in Guwahati, Prithviraj Chavan and Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil in Mumbai, Jairam Ramesh in Ahmedabad, Virbhadra Singh, Ranjeeta Ranjan and Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu in Shimla.On Tuesday, Babbar, Pritam Singh and Indira Hridayesh will address a news conference in Dehradun, Deepak Babaria and Arun Yadav in Bhopal, RPN Singh and Ashok Tanwar in Chandigarh, M Veerappa Moily in Mangalore, Surjewala and Nilesh Awasthi in Jabalpur.The Youth Congress is also organising a protest on the issue on Tuesday. We demand CBI and ED investigations on the matter. We also demand resignation of Amit Shah and want the PM to come out and give a statement on the issue, Youth Congress spokesperson Amrish Ranjan Pandey said.In the past, the Congress had sought to put the BJP on the mat by demanding the resignations of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Raman Singh over a multi-crore exam-rigging scandal, better known as Vyapam, and the rice scam respectively.It had also demanded the resignations of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhra Raje for helping former IPL chief Lalit Modi get travel documents in the UK.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had launched an investigation against Modi in 2010 following the allegations of misconduct, indiscipline and financial irregularities, and banned him for life in 2013 after a committee found him guilty of these charges. He later moved to London.The Congress had also attacked the NDA government over the escape of liquor baron Vijay Mallya. He had left India in March last year after defaulting on repayment of loans worth several hundred crores that Kingfisher Airlines, now defunct, owed to banks.The party sought to Link the escape of Mallya and Lalit Modi to Modis failure to deliver his poll promise to bring back black money stashed abroad, alleging that the government had allowed them to flee the country and swindle thousands of crores of public money."

A total of 69 species of butterflies belonging to 54 genera and five families were recorded from the study area. Family Nymphalidae was the most dominant among the five families with 22 species, followed by Lycaenidae, comprising of 19 species, the paper titled A study of butterfly diversity in Singur says.Five of the species found in Singur are rare and to be protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They include species like the Tree Flitter, Striped Albatross, Pea Blue, Common Indian Crow and Danaid Eggfly. The other interesting species found here include the Zebra Blue, the Common Banded Peacock and the Indian Skipper.The paper, authored by researchers Pritam K. Dey, Arajush Payra and Krishnendu Mondal, was published in June 2017 in the environmental journal e- planet . The study was carried out from March 2015 to November 2016, and most butterflies were observed between 8 a.m. and noon.Detailed study in futureThe presence of 69 species of butterflies in Singur points out that the butterfly diversity of the region is high. This is a preliminary study. More detailed studies in future can bring out more species. What is striking about Singur is that the area is not only rich in butterfly diversity but also in the diversity of frogs and birds, Mr. Dey said.Researchers found butterflies in the rice and vegetable fields of the area, as well as in bushes and shrubs along railway lines and National Highways.No forested landSingur has no forested land and the area is known for rice, potato and vegetable cultivation.Mr. Dey said that more intensive studies on different ecological parameters that can help access diversity of Singurs fauna are being planned.The presence of so many species of butterflies has provided a great deal of joy to the farmers who had waged a long battle against the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) led West Bengal government against the acquisition of 997 acres of agricultural land for Tata Motors Nano car plant in Singur.While our struggle was aimed at the return of the land acquired for the proposed car plant, we are happy that it has helped the environment of Singur. There would have not so many butterflies had the car plant been operational, said Mahabdeb Das, a farmer who was at the forefront of the land acquisition struggle. He was pleasantly surprised to learn about the butterfly diversity of the region.On August 30, 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the Left Front governments acquisition of 997 acres of land for the car plant in Singur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee returned the acquired land to farmers on September 14, 2016."

While the acceptable levels of lead in blood are pegged at less than 0.05 mg/litre for children and less than 0.25 mg/litre for adults, the presence of the element varied from a minimum of 5 times (in fish) to 2,911 times (in vegetable) of that limit.File picture. The presence of lead in samples of fish was found to vary approximately between 5 to 71 times higher than the permissible limits in adults and 26 to 356 times the limit suitable for children. (HT Photo)The GSI team identified diesel exhausts of the city traffic and soil in the nearby areas where vegetable is grown as the major sources of excessive lead. The lead has come from diesel exhausts. This type of study is rare in the world. A few have been conducted in the US and France. A new machine has helped us to pinpoint diesel as the chief source of lead and there is no ambiguity in the findings, Dipayan Guha, director of geochronology and isotope geology division of GSI told HT.The outcome of the study, conducted by project director Dipayan Guha and a team of six scientists, was published in Environmental Science and Technology and Environmental Science and Pollution Research. The studies began in 2014 and continued till March 2016.Read: How indoor air pollution is leading to stunted growth in Indias childrenIn rice the presence of lead was a minimum of seven times (of the limits for adults) to a maximum of 30 times. It implied a level that is 36 times to 149 times of the safe limits for children. The presence of the element in chicken is as high as 38 times the permissible limit for adults and 191 times of that for kids.Samples of rice were found to contain lead that was 58 times more than the permissible limit for adults and 287 times of the ceiling for children. (HT Photo)The maximum Pb concentration in rice was 14.39 mg/kg in the Khidirpur sample from west Kolkata. Vegetables sold in the sampled markets had a Pb concentration ranged from a low of 3.28 mg/kg to a very high value of 145.47 mg/kg, read a GSI statement.The GSI team collected samples of polished rice, red lentil (masoor dal), chicken, fish (without scales), spinach, biscuits, spices (cumin seeds) and tulsi from 12 roadside markets from north, south, east and west of Kolkata.Even if one washes the items in water, one can get rid of 50% of the lead, said Guha.Read: Killer in the air: WHO says polluted environments kill 1.7 mn children a yearThe maximum concentration of lead was found in the soil at and near Dhapa, the citys principal dumping ground.The GSI team also found the lead content in the street dust alarming. The mean concentration of Pb found in the 29 sites was 383.2 mg/kg with a range from 23.82 mg/kg to a very high value of 2,697.24 mg/kg at Amherst Street in north Kolkata, a GSI release said.The GSI spokesperson told HT that they chose samples from the roadside markets since common people buy from these.Since much of the contamination is caused by exposure to air, one can expect that packaged items sold in closed conditions will have less lead, said the spokesperson.Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the state Pollution Control Board, told HT there was no immediate relief in sight. CNG is not available in Kolkata and is only expected to reach here in 2020. Even after it reached the city, it will take a lot of time for the commercial vehicles to switch from diesel to CNG. The autorickshaws, however, have already to LPG, said Rudra."

There are hundreds of units that produce veneer, plywood, and block boards, located mainly at Vengola, Rayamangalam, Vazhakulam and Asamannoor panchayats and in Perumbavoor municipality. Except quality control, most skilled and unskilled work is carried out by migrant workers, notes the study conducted by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) with support from Thummarukudy Foundation.Skilled workersEngaged informally at the units are workers from Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam, while the skilled workforce mostly comprises workers from Assam.The monograph on migrant workers in the district, jointly written by Benoy Peter and Vishnu Narendran of CMID, records their presence in the construction industry; hospitality sector; furniture industry that is thriving at Nellikuzhi where eminent craftsmen from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh known for their wood carving skills function; textile and apparel units around Kizhakkambalam; cement factories on Willingdon island; fishing industry at Thoppumpady, Munambam, and Vypeen; rice mills at Kalady, and other industries at Airapuram, Angamaly, South Vazhakkulam, Edathala, Edayar, Binanipuram, Nellad, and Kalamassery.They are also engaged as housekeeping staff in luxury hotels (the only exception being men and women from the northeast manning lobbies of hotels), fuel stations, restaurants, malls, and hospitals.Work at quarriesSeveral workers from Odisha and West Bengal have been engaged as gardeners. Quarries spread along the district also have migrant labour.The study has identified Nagaon-Ernakulam and Mushidabad-Ernakulam as the two arterial, and the longest, migrant corridors that have emerged in India in the past two decades.It also throws light on the education facilities available for wards of migrant labourers in the district."

The government rushed supplies and tried to improve the villagers lives. When Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011, she made the village her showcase project -- constructing roads, providing water supply and electricity, and subsidised ration.But despite the spotlight, Hindustan Times has found that the tribal-dominated village has been living in darkness with no electricity for more than two months, because the sole transformer was struck by lightning and has not been repaired, or replaced, since.The reason: Most of the consumers live in abject poverty and cant afford to pay pending electricity bills. Amlashole lies near the Bengal-Jharkhand border at the heart of Jangalmahal that was once dominated by Maoists.Power to Amlashole is supplied through a transformer located at Kendgara Para.Incidentally, the village is inhabited by tribals such as the Mundas and Sabars, who are not only poor but also socially marginalised . During British rule, the Sabars were even categorised as a criminal tribe under the Criminal Tribes Act 1871.We are poor people who earn our daily bread with meagre wages doing odd jobs. How will we pay electricity bills? The chief minister is giving a lot of things to Jangalmahal including rice at Rs 2 a kg, she also can give free electricity to us, said Madan Sabar, a villager.The villagers pointed out that during her visit to Amlashole in January 2014, Banerjee assured supply of all basic necessities to the impoverished area.During her three-day visit to the district on October 9-11, the chief minister instructed the officials that they should not ignore the complaints and problems of the tribals.The people of Amlashole submitted a complaint. We are taking steps to repair the transformer, Ujjwal Roy, the divisional manager of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company told HT.I shall try to solve it within 24 hours, power minister Sovandeb Chatterjee told HT on Saturday after learning about the problem.According to officials in West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company, there are about 2 lakh consumers in Jhargram area, out of whom more than 1.5 lakh have not paid their bills for several years. The dues have run up to almost Rs 100 crore, the board said.Officers of the power utility said residents of Amlashole have not paid up even after they were told to pay the due in 24 instalments.Their bills from November 2008 till July 2014 were waived after intervention by Banerjee."
5a149e2c9855b76bf13e62a3,Surface ozone is damaging wheat and rice crops across the country: Study,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surface-ozone-is-damaging-wheat-and-rice-crops-across-the-country-study/story-ATrw25PIoFHlYeQsqG7YDJ.html,2017-10-31,"Surface ozone, a plant-damaging pollutant could be destroying up to 15% wheat crop and up to 6% rice yield every year across India, a first-of-its kind study based on ground observations of ozone, has revealed.A multi-institute study comprising 14 scientists and led by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, under the Department of Space, has estimated that every year, surface ozone is likely to wipe out 4.014.2 million tonnes (MT) of the total 95 MT of wheat produced in India, and 0.36.7 MT of the total 105 MT rice grown.Surface ozone  also called a secondary pollutant  is generated through chemical reactions between primary pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight. The sources of these primary pollutants are power plants, vehicles, industries, and bio-mass burning.With a projected rise in man-made pollution including surface ozone, researchers said the findings are important since a decrease in crop yield in India, which is the second populous country, will have a serious impact on its food security and economic growth.Wheat and rice are important crops for India since they form a staple diet, said professor Shyam Lal, principal investigator, PRL. Photosynthesis takes place during the day. When ozone molecules, which are generated in the presence of sunlight, get into the plant cells, the plant gets affected and can get damaged.Previous studies have calculated the annual loss of wheat crop in the range of 5% to 30%, and between 2.1% and 16 % for rice yields. However, these high estimates were based on either limited observations  restricted to some states only  or regional and global chemistry transport models.Ozone is a very new phenomenon in India now, and ozone levels are rising. The findings are important, as we now know from different sources of the impact of surface ozone on vegetation and crops, in addition to health. This means that pollution is ultimately reaching food security, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, who was not involved in the study. Ozone reduction strategies have to become an important policy focus now.The present study, drawn from data on surface ozone recorded at 17 locations across India, has found that general pattern of ozone variability shows higher ozone in AprilMay, lower in August and again increasing in October November.This is because high pollution levels and strong sunlight especially between March and May results in high levels of surface ozone damaging crops. Low surface ozone levels recorded during winter months when pollution levels are high but sunlight is low will either not damage crops or the loss is less.Though there is a permissible human exposure level for surface ozone set by the Central Pollution Control Board, there are no safe levels prescribed for plants.For the study, researchers used two internationally adopted methods to assess the exposure of crops to surface ozone  average ozone levels for seven hours during the day for three-month cropping period and second, accumulated ozone levels that exceed 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) over the same period.[S2] In the present study, exposure to wheat in the north and west-central regions of India crossed the average surface ozone 40 ppbv threshold between January and March. The North Indian region includes Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, while west-central regions comprise Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Average ozone levels during the wheat crop duration of three months were highest in the west/central region at about 47 ppbv followed by north India at about 41 ppbv. The corresponding accumulated ozone levels recorded in the west was 16,300 ppbv*hr and it was about 7,200 ppbv*hr in the north. However, a major part of the wheat crop is grown in north India only.The damage to rice though lower was also pronounced in northern and western-central parts of the country. The seasonal average ozone levels in the north and west-central were 33 ppbv and 27 ppbv  and the corresponding accumulated ozone levels in both these regions were 4730 ppbv*hr and 3400 ppbv*hr.Researchers said as compared to wheat, crop loss for rice is less because surface ozone levels are lower as the main harvesting period is soon after the summer monsoon. Also average surface ozone levels are lower in the eastern and southern regions of India where large quantity of rice is grown.India has two cropping seasons  Kharif and Rabi. Sowing for rice, a kharif crop, takes place between June and July, and its harvested from September to October. Wheat is a rabi crop that is sown between November and December, and harvested from February to April.North India logged the highest annual loss of about 9 MT of wheat. For rice, the maximum loss of about 2.6 MT every year was recorded from the countrys eastern region of Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Assam, and Jharkhand.With pollution levels set to rise further including levels of surface ozone, international studies have predicted higher losses for wheat and rice for India by 2030.Ozone is a very reactive gas, and while it is very harmful for health it also has a huge impact on vegetation. Ozone will increase if emissions of gases from combustion of sources such as vehicles and industries increase. If you have to control ozone, then need to control emissions from nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, said Roychowdhury.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that wheat, 73% of which is cultivated in north India alone, should be sown as early as possible starting November so that it is grown in the period when ozone is relatively lower.Wheat and rice cultivars, which have resistance to ozone damage, need to be developed. We would like to suggest policy makers to work out plans to reduce air pollution, particularly in the northern India. This will take care not only of the losses of the crops but also health of the public, read the study.."

So was the distribution of sweet rice (pongal) and free food.No untoward incidents were reported thanks to the Madras high court Madurai bench order turning down the organisers' request to allow hired vehicles to the memorial. Police had been on their toes apprehending trouble if the court allowed hired vehicles.Thousands of people from across the state as well as from other states including Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal arrived on about 2,000 vehicles and government buses arranged by the Tamil Nadu state transport corporation to the Thevar memorial. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami , deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and ministerial colleagues, opposition leader M K Stalin , leaders of other political parties and communal outfits paid their respects. As is the custom, all leaders garlanded the Thevar statue at Goripalayam in Madurai before proceeding to Pasumpon.A majority of the visitors came along with family members to pray before the Thevar. R Surya Moorthy (45), who belongs to the Mudukulatur community and works in the state electricity department, was accompanied by his three children who had their heads tonsured to fulfil their vow. ""We are strong believers of Thevar. He is like a god to us. I have been attending the Thevar guru puja since my childhood,"" he said.The three-day celebrations which started on Friday last has been by and large peaceful except for tearing of banners put up by the ruling AIADMK, allegedly by supporters of sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran. There was also a tussle between police personnel on one side and supporters of Dhinakaran and Moovendar Munnetra Kazhagam's Sridhar Vandaiyar on the other."

During the auspicious month of Kartika, the soaring vegetable prices has hit the common man hard. During Kartika, most people avoid non-vegetarian food owing to religious beliefs.According to reports, the cheapest vegetable available in the market is ivy gourd (kunduri), which is priced at Rs 26 per kg. Brinjal and ladies finger cost Rs 50 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. While beans come at a price of Rs 70 per kg, tomato is priced at Rs 60 per kg. Potato, the most popular vegetable, is being sold at Rs 16 per kg, thereby eating into the budget of the common man.The prices of vegetables are so high that I am contemplating to sell the rice, which I get at Rs 1 per kg, for my daily needs, said Prafulla Malik, a BPL villager of Gopabandhupur in the district. For him, selling the BPL rice is the only option as his daily earning is not enough to buy vegetable for his six-member family. Similar is the plight of several below poverty line families who are feeling the pinch of high vegetable price.For middle class families, non-vegetarian food has become a cheaper option. But we cannot afford to have non-vegetarian food daily, said Kathia Jena of Rajpur.The worst-hit are vegetarian hotels of the district. Dipu Nayak, owner of a vegetarian hotel, said, For the last few days, I am incurring a loss of Rs 500 on a daily basis. Now, I feel compelled to include non-vegetarian food in the menu to retain my customers.According to local traders, the vegetable market here depends on neighbouring States such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Due to hike in prices of vegetables there, the market here has been affected, they said.The demand for vegetables has increased in the wake of marriage season and this is another reason for the price hike, said Valu Khanaa, a vegetable vendor. Sources in the Regulated Market Committee said vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh are sold in Bhadrak town daily. The sales double during marriage season.Sources said vegetable farming is being hardly given any importance in the district with over 95 per cent of vegetables being imported from other States. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bhadrak, Tankadhar Behera said due to lack of storage and irrigation facilities, farmers show little interest in vegetable farming."

But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?An exaggeration in the press has lit a fire under khichdi, which is being promoted by the government as a Brand India food (whatever that means) that is valued all over the country. This weekend, a celebrity chef will promote the brand by cooking up 800 kg of khichdi in a single pan at India Gate, in an attempt for a Guinness Book record. His weighty creation will be distributed to diplomats, to sit uneasily on their kitchen counters alongside the tagliatelle and the sashimi or whatever, according to nationality. In British diplomatic kitchens, it could also go eye to eye with its estranged relation, kedgeree, a colonial breakfast dish chiefly featuring smoked haddock, often eaten cold, thereby transgressing three khichdi taboos.But when was the last time you went in search of a nice khichdi? It is the Brand India food only by government diktat. Had the choice been left to the masses, biryani (mutton, chicken or veg with lurid pink sauce, according to taste) would have won hands down. Like khichdi, biryani has a nationwide footprint. The clincher is that one clearly recalls when one last went looking for a biryani, and firmly resolves to do it again. As soon as possible.But then, even commentators with deep experience of biryani have spoken up for khichdi. In the 14th century, Ibn Batuta wrote of a kishri made of rice and moong dal. The Mughals were not averse to it, either, and Abul Fazl recorded seven variations on the theme. The dish is politically salad bowl-like, in the sense that every region has its own variant, from the khichuri of West Bengal to the pongal of Tamil Nadu.

But thats exactly what the humble khichdi has done these past few days.A day after union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal christened khichdi as the Brand India Food on November 1, it began topping Twitter trends and became a much-searched word on the Internet, according to Google Trends. Heated debates started on the elevated status summarily thrust on the dish as well as the point of doing so.But as this khichdi was cooking, The Sunday Standard was left wondering whether an over-ambitious attempt had been made to define India, a land of over 1.3 billion people with widely varying taste buds, by a single dish.Harsimrats announcement set off a flurry of heated debates, unending speculation and conflicting opinions over the culinary identity of India and the unilateral attempt to define its food by one dish. Regardless, khichdi basked in new-found glory as the Prime Minister inaugurated World Food India on November 3, a three-day event aimed at attracting $10 billion in investment.Alongside, naysayers had a field day lambasting the minister for her announcement while supporters acknowledged the importance of making the dish a brand ambassador. In the last few days, khichdi has possibly been spoken of more than it has been eaten.While I enjoy khichdi, to make it a Brand India dish is an overestimation. It is a certainly a comfort food, but not Indias favourite comfort food. Such generalizations are inaccurate and take away from our pluralistic essence, said Gaurav Pathan, a rice mill worker whose factory is on the outskirts of Delhi, near Sonipat.Social media, meanwhile, went on overdrive. Khichdi to be national dish. Why? Is the nation ill? said one. Do I have to stand up when I eat khichdi now that it is a national dish? was another. Why khichdi? I would want aloo methi to finally get its due, said yet another.But between wit and humour lies a deeper narrative of how fundamentally undemocratic such decisions are. Raju Mohapatra, a diamond sorter in Karol Bagh, said, I dont understand how one person in power suddenly gets up and starts deciding things on behalf of the country. Was there a poll, a study done to conclude that khichdi is the most-liked comfort food?Piyush Jain, chef at Molecule restaurant, said that if khichdi was popular, so were biryani, pulao, chicken curry and dal tadka. So, to say that khichdi is the only dish that can represent Indias food tradition is incorrect, he said.Two days after elevating the khichdi from a sick mans food to a national delicacy, Harsimrat said her intention was to replace the curry with khichdi as the quintessential Indian dish.But isnt replacing one dish by another fatuous? In a few years, khichdi will become the new curry. Will we once again think of something new? asked Santosh Kumar, a sales representative with an electronics company.He is exasperated at the remark that khichdi is a neutraliser. I lived in Telangana for 13 years where I was working at a light manufacturing company. There, I was introduced to the regions famous kheema khichdi. Its a rich rice dish made with basmati rice, lentils, meat and chicken stock. Are these ingredients affordable to the poor?It is important to understand that the dish doesnt remain in its humble form in every region, and therefore, cannot be the staple. Besides, has everyone forgotten that dal, a main component of khichdi, is often out of the reach of the poor? asked Kumar.Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who has been curating Food Street, an experience zone within World Food India 2017, begged to differ. Khichdi has been celebrated and relished for years in India. From khichuri in West Bengal to Ven Pongal in Kerala, khichdi has united India in geographical expanse with its flavour and recipes through dynasties.It is definitely one of the most loved dishes in India and the world record only aims at making it popular on an international level. Therefore, its declaration as the Brand India food is fair, he said.Indias distinctness has always been its diversity. Flavours from the North, South, East and West have all contributed to create its globally loved cuisine. So, was it inappropriate to grant a single dish such exalted status?"

The stories claimed the notes could be tracked even if they were buried 120 metres below the earth. Zee News in Hindi and a Kannada channel zealously put out imaginary stories. One of the anchors was bouncing up and down in delight like the pontiff of the Pejawar math. The woman presenter who seconds him went to the extent of proclaiming the note featured a picture of the Mars mission to indicate how satellites would keep an eye on the currency.The stories spread like wildfire. Last week, when I boarded a train to Hubballi, all my fellow passengers were talking about the chip. Taken aback at their naivete, I said, Its all a lie. Theres no such chip in the note. Two middle-aged men, sceptical about me, said the news had appeared on TV. Not everything that appears on TV is true, I said. They countered me: they had heard such notes were already in circulation in the US. Who told you? There are no such notes anywhere in the world, I said. What is the use of demonetisation then? one of them asked. Give it some thought, I said. A young man on a top berth butted in: You know what use it is? Big industrialists have borrowed money and are not paying back their loans. The banks have no money. That's why they are out to make people deposit their money. And people are taking their old notes to the banks, afraid they will turn out worthless otherwise.You mean this wont solve the black money problem? one of the men said. It will take care of fake currency for a while. But its extent isnt big. Within months, they will start making counterfeits of the new notes. The corrupt keep their wealth in jewellery and property, not cash. Only a small amount gets demonetised. In any case, we will never get, as Modi had promised, Rs 15 lakh in each of our bank accounts, I said.Oh, we thought Modi was on to something big. Looks like he has just put his hands into our pockets, a man said, sighing.The State Bank of India has just written off loans it had advanced to 63 companies. Know how much they owed? A whopping Rs 7,016 crore. This includes the Rs 1,201 crore owed by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. It isnt difficult to guess on whose side Modi is: the affluent who borrowed for their fancies and whose loans he has waived or the millions of hard-working people standing in long bank queues to deposit money they have earned.Modi has not been able to bring black money stashed away abroad. He hasnt even been able to name the secret account holders. His election promise of Rs 15 lakh in each citizens account remains a pipe dream. Even if we put up with such scams, how can we look on as he snatches away the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class?An elderly man waiting to take out money for his daily expenses has died. And how did a BJP vice-president respond to it? Big deal. People die even in ration shop queues.When it dawned on Modi that a majority was frustrated with his insane actions, he didnt say, Please bear with me. I will fix the problem in a few days. Instead, he said, Im doing all this for the nation. People who have ruled us for 70 years are conspiring against me. No one in his party told him, But sir, when did these people, struggling to withdraw their own money, ever rule in these 70 years? How can they conspire against you?The middle class and people in the media, who had hailed demonetisation as Modis masterstroke, now see the machinations behind it. They are aware the new note holds no magic. It cant banish black money, and Modis eccentricities are causing them misery.Modi continues to say we must put up with all this in the interest of the nation, but the problem wont go away anytime soon. Common people will have to scrape and scrounge for cash at least for four months. Business has been affected badly. With no customers, fisherfolk and traders in West Bengal are in the doldrums. In Punjab, farmers have no cash to buy seeds. If they dont sow now, the prices of rice and wheat will go up soon. No money in hand, nothing to eat either is the fate of millions. All this thanks to Modi.The BJP is feeling the heat of the peoples anger. Party president Amit Shah has instructed MPs to put up flex boards praising Modis surgical strike against black money. They usually follow his instructions to the letter, but this time they arent paying him any heed. Except for an MP in Gujarat, no one has put up laudatory flex hoardings.Even people in Gujarat have turned against Modi. Assembly elections are coming up. Expecting praise, party workers holding pamphlets went towards citizens standing in a bank queue. They received blows instead!Allies such as the Akali Dal in Punjab and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are also turning their back on the BJP. Quite a few BJP leaders are openly criticising Modis actions in the presence of the media, though they are unwilling to speak on record. Even Modi is coming to know of the attrition he has generated. That is why he comes across as so fidgety on his tours.About 25 people have died across the country because of demonetisation. In Uttar Pradesh, a couple with old notes was turned away from a hospital and their daughter died as a consequence. A woman in Gujarat with old notes couldnt feed her two children; she hanged herself.In Kanpur, a young man had been trying for months to sell his property. On November 8, he finally received Rs 70 lakh in advance. When he heard of demonetisation the next morning, he suffered a heart attack and died. A woman in Telangana, who had sold her land for her husbands medical treatment and her daughters wedding, was told the cash was worthless. She committed suicide. In Udupi, a man standing in a long queue, waiting for his bank to open, died of a heart attack.Not one of these was a thug. Not one of them was an Adani, Ambani, Tata or Birla. They were honest middle-class people, farmers, homemakers, all earning their livelihood from honest toil. They ended up as victims of Modis grandiose war against black money. He is responsible for their deaths.In fact, Modi has launched no surgical strike against black money. What he has done is push helpless people to death. What better can we expect from Modis Tughlaq dispensation?[Excerpted from The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, edited by Chandan Gowda, and published by DC Books and Navayana, Delhi.Chandan Gowda says, The book brings together select political and cultural writings of the courageous activist-journalist.

Photo: HTKolkata: Rosogolla, the syrup-soaked spongy ball that has served as a gastronomic identity marker for the Bengali community for almost 150 years, just got recognition for its uniqueness.The Union ministry of commerce and industry on Tuesday recognised Banglar Rosogolla, the iconic sweet, as deserving of protection under geographical indication (GI), ignoring competing claims about its origin from neighbouring Odisha.Earlier this year, two exotic varieties of rice produced in small quantitiesTulaipanji and Govindabhogalso received similar protection under GI as unique products of West Bengal, but this went largely unnoticed. But the success with the ubiquitous rosogolla, at least 20 million pieces of which are produced every day, was sweet news, said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. It triggered celebrations in Kolkata.The recognition does not necessarily end the debate on the origins of the coveted sweet. Whereas a confectioner from Kolkata, Nabin Chandra Das, is known to be the inventor of rosogolla, people of Odisha have claimed that a variant of the sweet was offered to the deity at Puris Jagannath temple from much earlier.The GI recognition was widely seen as a victory over Odishas claim, but what the intellectual property authorities have recognised is the uniqueness of Banglar Rosogolla for its melt-in-the-mouth smoothness, spongy texture and the lightness of the sugar syrup in which it is dipped.Smooth and delicate feel in the mouth are the basic characteristics of Banglar Rosogolla, the state had said in its petition seeking GI protection. Hardness of Banglar Rosogolla is experimentally proven to be much lower than samples collected from other states, and the sugar concentration of the syrup is maintained at 30-40%, making it lighter than variants from other states.Though the states application for GI protection of Banglar Rosogolla was based on various physical and chemical parameters of the sweet, which are claimed to be consistent, sweetmeat makers actually go by their instinct, said Sumit Sundar Ghosh, director, Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar Pvt. Ltd, a fabled confectioner established in 1907.I am not sure the uniqueness can be maintained if people stopped to rely on their intuition and started to measure the ingredients or if production were to be mechanised, he added. At the same time, his firm was one of the early birds to start its own dairy farm to maintain product consistency. The quality of milk is paramount, determined by the fodder and the process of collection, he said.Back in 1994, the sweet maker from north Kolkata started to invest in its dairy farm. It now sprawls 100 acres, and produces 2,000-2,500 litres of milk a day, said Nitai Chandra Ghosh, Sumit Sundar Ghoshs father and a fifth generation confectioner. The farm has its own refrigerated trucks to carry the milk to Kolkata from Durgapur, 180 km away.Our rosogollas are made entirely out of the milk that we produce, he said. We still buy small quantities of milk but only to produce other sweets, which, for instance, need milk with higher fat content.Curding of milk to derive cottage cheese, or chhanathe main ingredient of rosogollastarted in eastern India under the influence of the Europeans, said Mani Shankar Mukherji, an author and historian. In 1868, confectioner Das invented the rosogolla in its current form capping several years of experiment after being thrown out of his ancestral business of sugar refining, said a scion of the family, Dhiman Das, also a director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd.Nabin Chandra Das built his business on the strength of the rosogolla, whose popularity spread beyond the neighbourhood of his store in north Kolkata from the 1870s. K.C. Das helped spread the sweet outside Kolkata by creating a long-life variant sold in cans from 1930. Now there are 16 K.C. Das stores in Bengaluru, compared with only five in Kolkata, said Dhiman Das."
5aeb65649855b73f522c9528,Of silks and sweets: Is GI tag worth the fight?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/of-silks-sweets-is-gi-tag-worth-the-fight/articleshow/61760526.cms,2017-11-23,"Rasgulla originated in Odisha, says researcher The state government on Wednesday started examining a 150-page report submitted by a researcher providing documentary evidences showing that rasgulla originated in Odisha.Should civilisations, now fragmented by boundaries on linguistic lines, fight over trivialities like rasogolla to cement their monopoly over such heritage? While the intelligentsia stood mute witness when people of West Bengal and Odisha made a mountain of a sweet last week, there were sane voices dubbing it a useless fight.""It is 'Banglar rasogolla', and not rasogolla, which has been GI-tagged in favour of a West Bengal government agency. Odisha, which never filed its objections before the Geographical Indications (GI) registry in the first place, can apply for its own unique Odishara rasogolla,"" said advocate and IPR attorney P Sanjai Gandhi, who wrote to the Odisha chief minister about the option.So, why so much fuss about GI and is it worth the fight? India is full of unique agricultural, handicraft, handloom and food items  both natural and manufactured  which are worthy of being given a special status. This would enable people making or growing the products to exploit them commercially. The very objective of GI tagging is to identify unique characteristics of a product, trace its territorial significance and give it a statutory protection, so that no bogus goods flood the market and tarnish the reputation of centuries.Tamil Nadu is home to 22 GI-tagged products which includes Kancheepuram silk, said Sanjai Gandhi, who applied and got the recognition for the handloom product. Pointing out that GI tag is not for 'silk' per se, he said arni silk and Salem white silk too got their own GI tagging. Rasogolla, therefore, could take the 'silk route' to avoid confrontation and peaceful co-existence.Of course, the issue of GI-tagging basmati rice is now mired in a massive litigation before the GI Registry and courts because a few districts of Madhya Pradesh were not considered. It could mean a big loss to Madhya Pradesh, unless it is either clubbed with other Basmati-growing areas of central India, or it manages to have its own GI-tagged Basmati brand.Real threats to the nation's artistic, cultural and culinary legacy may come from other nations. A brewing conflict between India and Bangladesh over GI tag for 'khadi' is a fine example. While Chennai-based Intellectual Property Rights Attorneys Association (IPRAA) has sought GI status for khadi, on behalf of all 29 states in India, Bangladesh has also submitted a similar application.IPRAA has now written to Bangladesh to withdraw its application because khadi is a quintessential handloom legacy of India. ""Instead of quibbling among ourselves, we must be alert to stave off threats from across the border,"" said Sanjai Gandhi, president of IPRAA, adding that the Indian government has done little to prevent exploitation and false claim over 'khadar' in foreign countries. Even Basmati is being branded by private parties and marketed in many countries, but India has not yet filed formal revocation applications in those countries to prevent their misuse.Ideally, India should be sitting on hundreds of GI tags for its products by now. But the total GI-tagged products in the country are only about 200. While Karnataka leads the bunch with 34 GI products, it is followed by Maharashtra (26) and Odisha (23). The fourth slot is jointly held by Tamil Nadu and Kerala, with 22 GI products each. There will be a dramatic increase in Tamil Nadu's tally in coming months, as it has filed applications for 29 different products. They are pending before the GI registry, and products that are likely to get GI-tagged by middle of next year include Manamadurai ghatam (mud pot-drum), Tuticorin macarons, Kovilpatti groundnut mittai and rice garland of Thanjavur.GI is a crown of thorn, too. Once an association or society earns it, judiciously exploiting it even while guarding it against misuse is tough. Darjeeling tea and its authorised users are examples. Users of the brand are alert against misuse and they have filed revocation petitions in several countries to safeguard the uniqueness of the tea. It has had a telling effect on the fortunes of tea-growers of Darjeeling, as they alone are reaping the benefits of their product.That is the idea. GI regime is designed to help genuine makers of products go laughing all the way to the bank, without compromising on the quality of the product. GI holds out no empty threat to violators. In case of GI infringement or false claim, there is a fine of Rs50,000 to Rs2 lakh, and jail term from six months to three years."

It is 10am, and the third and fourth floors that house the offices of the Patent Information Centre (PIC) of the West Bengal State Science & Technology Council, are ringing with celebrations. Only minutes ago, application number 533 at the Geographical Indications Registry of the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks, Chennai, has had a significant status update. It has moved from ""Examination"" to ""Registered"". Put simply, West Bengal's rasogolla has got itself the geographical indication (GI) tag.There is a queue of media professionals outside scientist and patent expert Mahuya Hom Chowdhury's office. She and her team have laboured for the past two years for the tag.What does she make of all talk of Bengal trumping Odisha? The bespectacled scientist's voice is a bit hoarse from all the talking, but she is patient, only too willing to explain the implications of the recent development. She says, ""A GI tag is nothing to fight over. It's a mark of assurance of authenticity and original source of a product. The ultimate goal is to tap the market potential for these products."" And though she doesn't support the Bengal versus Odisha rant, she believes media coverage helped raise awareness about geographical indication. ""The next step is to use the tag for quality enhancement of a product and market it properly to improve income of weavers, artisans or sweet-makers.""It's not just the rasogolla. From mangoes to sweetmeats, rice to saris and handicraft items, more than a dozen products from Bengal have been granted a GI tag since Hom Choudhury assumed charge of the PIC. The government employee refuses to be photographed, alone or with her team - permissions have to be in place. She stresses, however, that the Trinamul government supported the team all the way in this patent endeavour. Several NGOs have also worked closely to bring about the GI revolution in the state.""When I joined the patent office in 1999, GI and patent culture was yet to develop across the country,"" says Hom Choudhury. To learn more about the art of patent drafting and GI filing, she decided to be a patent attorney. ""I learnt the intricacies (of patenting). I also understood the importance of protecting our traditional heritage as well as recognising the intellectual property of our grassroots innovators. Bengal has a huge repository of heritage products that need to be protected,"" she adds.It so happened that Odisha didn't apply for a GI for the rasogolla. But when it comes to the overall GI score, the two states are on equal footing with a score of 15 registered GIs each.According to Hom Choudhury, filing an application for a GI or patent is an art. ""You need to know both the scientific and legal aspects of a product. Also, one needs to collect a whole lot of data from the producers,"" adds Paromita Sen, a junior scientist who works at the PIC.Dhiman Das is director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd. His great-great-grandfather is said to have invented the rasogolla in 1868. He says, ""Applying for GI is not an easy job. You need to furnish a whole lot of historical documents, make a detailed presentation. We produced the document, which was efficiently presented by Dr Hom Choudhury and her team.""Adds Jagannath Ghosh, the Calcutta-based secretary of Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, the association of sweetmakers of Bengal, ""We provided several sets of samples from different sweet shops for chemical analysis following the advice of scientists at PIC. All of it was meticulously collated and presented by them.""A GI application needs to be filed to the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks. A consultative group on the product for which a GI tag has been sought meets to discuss the merits of it. If the panel is satisfied with the information, the application is advertised in the Geographical Indications Journal. This is an opportunity for all - individuals, organisations, states - to counter it. And the permitted time period is four months. After that, the product automatically gets a GI tag. A certificate from the GI Registry follows.The application in case of Banglar Rasogolla was filed in September 2015.There was no culture of patenting in India for a long while. Although Bengal had a rich legacy of intellectual property, scientists didn't want to profit from their research. That is why Jagadis Chandra Bose never filed a patent for the radio he invented. But Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi developed, demonstrated and marketed the wireless telegraph and got worldwide recognition.In the mid-1990s, India became a member of the World Trade Organization and the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights came into effect. Scientists slowly woke up to the importance of patenting their inventions. Also, with the introduction of new trade practices, the protection of trade names and trademarks used for food products of a particular geography came into practice. Sparkling wine of a particular area in France was recognised with a GI tag, after a prolonged and bitter legal battle between France and the US. There was a similar scuffle over Basmati between India, US and Pakistan.Hom Chowdhury was aware of these debates and discussions when she began her career in the patent office. At the time she had just completed her PhD in Food Technology from Jadavpur University. ""She'd been an extremely bright student here,"" says Professor Utpal Roy Choudhuri from the department of Food Technology and Biochemical Engineering. ""Her thesis was on extruded fish protein or utilisation of fish waste,"" he adds. Hom Chowdhury also went on to patent her invention, extruded snacks from waste food material. If that sounds complicated, she is not willing to elaborate further. ""I have plans to market the invention sometime in future. This will help create wealth out of food wastes,"" is all that she says.Hom Choudhury's basics in Food Technology helped her hone her skills as a patent specialist in the field. Before the rasogolla victory, she got the GI for Joynagarer Moa - prepared from date palm jaggery and puffed rice - Mihidana and Sitabhog from Burdwan. Two more sweetmeats - Sarpuria and Sarbhaja from Krishnagar - are expected to get the tag soon.Saikat Datta, general manager, District Industries Centre, Burdwan, worked with Hom Choudhury's team for patent applications for Mihidana and Sitabhog. ""We encouraged the manufacturers in Burdwan to form an association and follow a standardised process of manufacturing. Then we helped them apply for the GI tag,"" he says. They'd even gone to the GI registry office in Chennai to understand the procedure of application.But the first GI tags associated with her team have to do with three mango varieties - Laxmanbhog, Himsagar and Fazli. This was followed by tags for traditional textiles, especially saris - Santipur, Baluchari and Dhaniakhali.In the field of agriculture, the PIC team is now focussing on varieties of indigenous rice that are becoming extinct as more and more farmers are gravitating towards high-yielding seeds. The first GI tags on agricultural products in the state were gained for two rice varieties - Gobindobhog and Tulaipanji. Prof. Mrityunjay Ghosh of the department of Agronomy, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani, says, ""We organised the scientific and historical documents and PIC scientists offered their legal expertise. They co-ordinated with the GI Registry office at Chennai.""Handicrafts is another area of focus for Hom Choudhury and her team. GI applications for five items - including Chhau dance masks from Purulia, madurs (grass mats) and patachitras (scroll paintings) from East Midnapore - have been submitted. ""The PIC team researched the legacy of these traditional crafts. We gave them information on the current status and details of craft hubs and practitioners,"" says Niloy Basu, the general manager of Banglanatok.com, a social enterprise that promotes indigenous craft and culture.Says Hom Choudhury, ""So far, so good. GI tag is just the beginning of a process to tap the immense potential of our treasures and improve quality. Now we need to go ahead to the next step in a more structured way to make things suitable for the international market."""

The state was paying Re 1 per kg. In spite of the Centre paying 91 per cent subsidy, the state government did not even mention its contribution, he said.Similarly, Supriyo said wheat was procured by FCI at Rs 24 per kg, of which the Centre was paying Rs 21.45 per kg and consumers were paying Rs 2 per kg.

But last month, Chapal Bhaduri or Chapalrani, the last female imitator of Bengal, checked into an old-age home in north Kolkata. With neither a permanent address nor any family member to take care of him, the septuagenarian thespian moved into Ramkrishna Old Age Home on Hari Ghosh Street on November 15.According to Prabir Paul, manager of the home, Bhaduri's day starts at 6am. ""He gets his bed tea at 6.30am and has breakfast by 8.30am. Earlier, he would have an egg-and-toast breakfast, but now he prefers roti-sabzi. For lunch, we serve rice, sabzi and fish, and later, a variety of snacks - from chowmein to cakes. Though he eats rotis at dinner, we served him overcooked rice for five days when he had a tooth problem,"" said Paul.Though Bhaduri likes to spend his time alone in his fourth-floor room, he is friendly with all the boarders. ""Every time he bumps into someone, he makes it a point to smile. We have 24 residents and they are all aware of the fact that he is a recipient of the Banga Bhushan award,"" added Paul. Bhaduri doesn't watch television and didn't ask for any, but all his basic requirements are taken care of by the home, owned by Kashinath Roy, against a monthly payment of Rs 9,000. ""Though we take a security deposit of Rs 5-10 lakh, we took Rs 2 lakh from Bhaduri,"" said Paul, adding that the thespian is often visited by his nieces. When Bhaduri goes out to meet his relatives, they call to enquire if he had reached the home safely.Bhaduri reportedly began his journey by playing a female character in 'Ali Baba' and followed it up with several performances in 'Raja Debidas', 'Chand Bibi', 'Sultana Razia' and 'Mahiyashi Kaikeyi'. It was only in 2006 that his first full-length role as a male character came about with the semi-autobiographical 'Ramanimohan'.But Bhaduri continues to play the 'leading lady' on stage. He got under the skin of Sachima in 'Noder Nimai' for Binapani Samiti , a group he has been working with for the past 17 years. The performance was held at Ramakrishna Math, Kankurgachi, on December 9.In fact, it was one of his stage associates Rakesh Ghosh who first disclosed Bhaduri's new address on social media. ""He used to live in Belgachhia in his sister Ketaki Dutta 's apartment. But it was not his house and after a change in arrangements, he decided to move out.""Though many of his associates hinted at a family feud, Bhaduri said, ""I am my own guardian and I will not speak about my life."""

Once you allow construction on a section of the wetlands, it will open the floodgates to further encroachment.Much of EKW has been lost already. If the government implements the proposal, we will oppose it legally, Datta added.The 125sqkm EKW acts as a natural sewage treatment plant for Kolkata. It provides fish, rice and vegetables at the citys doorstep. If EKW disappears, the city will have to spend a fortune on sewage treatment and stormwater evacuation facilities. Cost of living will also soar.Bonani Kakkar, founder president of the NGO, Public, said, The proposal is ill-conceived and malicious. While a wetland management plan has been devised to protect the eco-system, this is designed to destroy it. We cannot allow this attempt to subvert the law.Kakkars public interest litigation led to the 1992 landmark judgment protecting the wetlands and its subsequent recognition as a Ramsar site a decade later.Green activists also countered environment minister and mayor Sovan Chatterjees claim that he was unaware of the proposal. They said it fits neatly into his scheme of things.Immediately after becoming the mayor for the second term, Chatterjee spoke about the need to regularise buildings that had been illegally constructed in EKW. Later, after taking over as East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority (EKWMA) chairman following an amendment, he pushed through a proposal to set up an entertainment park and a flyover on the wetlands. The latest proposal in the draft tender for a management plan will remove the hurdles in its way.A member of the EKWMA steering committee also opposed the plan.Ecologist Dhrubajyoti Ghosh said, The entire area has been notified as wetlands. An attempt is being made to exclude Dhapa and adjoining moujas from EKW. This will spell doom for the wetlands.This is not the first time that a management plan is being attempted. In 1999, the Calcutta Environment Management & Strategy Action Plan (CEMSAP) commissioned by the state environment department and UKs DfID was prepared by Centre for Environment & Development (Endev). It mooted the idea of core and buffer areas. No activities were to be allowed in the core areas and activities that would not harm the wetlands were to be permitted.Endev director Ashish Ghosh, who had led the Indian Ramsar team to the UN conference in Japan in 1995, said The plan was prepared keeping in mind the historical judgment of Justice UC Banerjee. Any attempt to subvert it will be contempt of court."

Nearly 100 people from our village came here looking for work. We are all illiterate and could not find jobs in our home States.How did they land up here in Madurai? We can cook Chinese items that seem to be in great demand in the hotels in Madurai. There are agents who brought us here. In fact, in every village, there are agents who offer us work outside our home base. They promise to get us jobs that will get us Rs 15,000 a month. Of course, the salary would vary, depending on the work. The agent will receive the salary and deduct 50 per cent as his commission. The arrangement may vary from agent to agent. Basically, there is no connection between the hotel employer and us, said Nithesh.About the working conditions, Nitesh said, From morning till the hotel is closed, we need to remain standing. Every day, I go to home with severe leg pain. I get a maximum of Rs 10,000 as monthly salary. I send Rs 8000 to my parents every month. I use the remaining amount for my expenses in the temple city.Accommodation is usually provided by the employer, continued Nithesh. Those working in the same hotel usually stay in one house together. We are given one months leave every year and we go to our native place. Those who work as cleaners and servers get very poor salaries, around Rs 3,000 a month. We dont get other benefits like Provident Fund, bonus and insurance. Though we have problems of language, discrimination, and poor working conditions, we take the job since it is helping our families get three meals a day.Lakshmi (18), a spinning mill worker in Madurai district, said, I come from a small village in Bihar. I am the first of five daughters. My father was an agriculture daily wage labourer. I dont have mother. About a year back, my father met with an accident and could not continue working. I took over earning for the family. I could not find any decent job in our village as I am uneducated. Nearly 80 girls in the 15 to 23 age group came here to work.I came with them. For the past eight months, I have been working here. The company has given us accommodation within the premises. They provide ration rice and some grocery, but they are not of good quality. There is no specific working time. We have to report to work whenever the supervisor calls us. Every month, we get Rs 3,000 as salary. We send Rs 2,000 home. We do not know the exact salary that we get and whether and how much the agents take.Sharma (35), a construction worker, had a similar tale to share. About 1000 workers from Uttar Pradesh came here with our families. We used to stay in a hut near the construction site. There were just no basic facilities. We do all sorts of work. If the employer paid the local labourer Rs 500 a day, we would get only Rs 400. Out of this around Rs 150 would go as commission to the agent, he narrated.Speaking to Express, K L Kumar, President, Madurai District Hotels Association, said, The agents supply labourers from the other states. They are in charge of everything. Nearly 10,000 migrant workers are employed in various positions in Madurai district hotels. We ask for their identity proof and share their details with the local police.We do not pay any commission to the agent. We hand over the salaries to the agents. Workers give a share to them. Depending on the nature of the work we pay the workers.But there are some other issues. Some mischief making, taking small amounts of cash from the cash counter and so on. If it happens, we approach the agent who arranges for a replacement. The agent takes care even when a worker goes on leave and we need a temporary replacement, explained Kumar."

5a53850b9855b770e038032c,A mix of local flavours and tradition: How an Indian Christmas is celebrated,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-indian-christmas/story-K0tV83DZD1FRzvcMM8XPbP.html,2017-12-25,"Come December, and there is a mood of celebration in the air. Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

She told me there was scope for the business to really take off, and I took her word for it, and moved here, said Cho, whose restaurant, MyungGa located in South Point mall, has been serving authentic South Korean food for the last six years.Apart from delicacies, like rice cakes and dried seaweed rolls, Cho has adapted her menu to serve spicy food that may add to the appeal for Indians who arrive at her restaurant to give the food a try. The latter, she says, constitute 20% of the clientele for the outlet. The journey, however, has been far from easy, with hurdles ranging from administrative issues to continuous changing laws, the owner said.The rules and regulations governing the setting up of a restaurant themselves are so complicated and tedious, that even getting the license for my outlet took a lot of patience, Cho said.The dietary prohibitions also keep changing, which means we continuously have to adapt our menu. The beef ban, for example, limited our options a lot.Korean family Jin Ho Park and In A Lee with their sons, Joo Won and Joo Hwan in Gurgaon. (Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)We moved here seven years ago. I opened this store to pass my time. We mainly have a Korean clientele, but a lot of Indians come here.Chos restaurant, however, isnt the only option for residents of the city looking for authentic food from the Asia Pacific region. In the same building where MyungGa stands, authentic Japanese food is offered at Manami, a restaurant headed by a Japan resident Tomiyama Ryji, who has two other branches in the National Capital Region (NCR) itself, in Manesar and in New Delhi.The close proximity of the outlets serves as a metaphor as many residents of these two neighbours in the Pacific sea have, miles away from home, found themselves at each others doorsteps once again.According to the data available at the Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) in Gurgaon, there are more than 8,000 Japanese people, and 3,000 South Koreans currently living in the city. The two communities have become so prominent that they now have magazines in their languages, to help new arrivals settle in and make older residents aware of the latest developments and options in terms of luxuries, cuisine, and entertainment.Most South Korean and Japanese people, reside in the gated condominiums on the Golf Course Road, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, and the new sectors. One of the main reasons for their presence in the city is the fact that Gurgaon district houses several multinational companies native to the two countries such as Hyundai, Samsung, Honda, Mitsubishi, LG, Toyota, and Suzuki.Korean family Jin Ho Park and In A Lee with their sons, Joo Won and Joo Hwan in Gurgaon. (Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)Ryoichi Yamamoto, a native of Japan, is among the many people who have moved to Gurgaon as a result of this setup. The director of Keyence Corporation, Yamamoto has been residing in Aralias, a gated condominium in DLF5, along with his wife, Nuntika Saengkaew, for the last three years. Prior to this, the family had been in Chennai for two years.We had never been to India before we moved here and were slightly apprehensive about certain things, especially safety. However, we have found it is a relatively easy place to live in, and people are by and large friendly, said Saengkaew, whose social circle in Gurgaon is a reflection of the extent to which the expat population has integrated with the locals.I have many Indian friends here, who have introduced me to the local culture and cuisine. I have learned how to make biryani.I have many Indian friends here, who have introduced me to the local culture and cuisine. I have learned how to make biryani from one of my friends, and have attained an interest in Indian art and literature, she said. Over the last five years, the couple has spent a lot of their weekends exploring the country, travelling to places like Amritsar, Kolkata, Chennai, Mumbai, and Jaipur. While in the city, Saengkaews husband, meanwhile, has also been training students in Kendo, a modern Japanese martial art form, going to a school in Vasant Kunj for the purpose, along with other Japanese residents. In another gated condominium in DLF5, namely Magnolias, resides, In a Lee, who hails from South Korea and first moved to the city in 2014, with her husband, Jin-Ho Park, who works at a private company. The couple also has two sons, a 16-year-old Joo-Won and 12-year-old Joo-Hwan Park.Prior to their arrival, the family said they had to spent a fortnight eating primarily curries for their meals, in the hope of accustomizing themselves to the cuisine of the country. Settling in, however, they say, was much easier than they expected.While Jin-Ho said that Indians are easy to work with as a result of their hard work and non-egoistical natures, his wife boasts of a social circle that includes many local residents.I have a lot of friends here. I have been exposed to a lot of aspects of life here, which I may not have known otherwise. I go for dance classes and yoga classes with them, and have even learned how to make chapattis, said Lee, adding that she is also fascinated by big Indian gatherings. Her older son, said, I love the beat of Punjabi music and have also learned Bhangra.Japanese national Ryoichi Yamamoto along with his wife Nuntika Saengkaew (above) have been residing in Gurgaon for the last three years. (Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)Several malls in Gurgaon, apart from cafes and restaurants offering cuisine from the two countries, have stores meant to cater specifically to the needs of the communities, with shelf after shelf lined up with authentic Korean and Japanese items, including everything from food to cosmetics.The Seela Food Mart in South Point Mall offers Korean products like Kimchi and Soybean paste, while it also including some local items on their shelves. What started as a hobby for the owner, Yoon Jungae, a resident of Belaire, in DLF 5, has been in this business for three years now.We moved here seven years ago. I opened this store to pass my time. We mainly have a Korean clientele, but a lot of Indians come here to purchase items such as tofu, sticky rice, and pork, said Jungae.The weather was a big factor for us. The temperature keeps fluctuating and goes from one extreme to another. That took some time to get used to.Life in Gurgaon, however, both South Koreans and Japanese said, does not go without problems.From air pollution to the weather issues, they say, take a while to get accustomed to. We were expecting problems such as safety, but pollution has proven to be a real issue in our day to day lives here. We have had to install air purifiers in every room to ensure our health remains unaffected, to some extent, said In a Lee.Myeong Hee Cho, meanwhile, said, The weather was a big factor for us. The temperature keeps fluctuating and goes from one extreme to another. That took some time to get used to.Jung Min Woos little South Korean bakery, which now has two branches on the Golf Course Road itself, became the reason for her husband and her prolonged stay in India, even after her children completed their education and moved on.Set up in 2010, the bakery now boasts of a clientele of which 70% is Indian.A visit to its South Point mall branch on any given day, however, is a quick way to also get an idea of the true strength of the community of expats hailing from the Asia Pacific in the city."
5a53a4e99855b770e0381bbf,Arsenic poisoning is spreading. We need drastic steps to tackle it,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/arsenic-poisoning-is-spreading-we-need-drastic-steps-to-tackle-it/story-j9UyOujE9izHfaTWvVy9fP.html,2017-12-27,"In a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the Union ministry of water resources said 239 million people across 153 districts in 21 states drink water that contains high levels of arsenic.Thats around a fifth of the countrys population, and by any standards, thats an appalling statistic.The actual number could be higher. India pegs arsenic concentrations above 50 parts per billion as harmful; in the US, it is 10 parts per billion. Arsenic is one of the 10 chemicals classified as a public health concern by the World Health Organization; it slowly poisons the body, potentially causing skin lesions, damage to the peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal ailments, diabetes, renal (kidney) failure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At least half the people who were known to be at risk of arsenic contamination live in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh and India (across the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh).Groundwater contamination, Indias hidden crisisThe number of habitations affected by arsenic in India has increased from 3,728 in 2012-13 to 7,535 in 2015-16. This is because of the overuse of groundwater for irrigation and drinking. Arsenic previously occurred in a harmless insoluble conjugate with iron called arsenopyrite. Overuse has split this compound, contaminating groundwater with a soluble ionic form of arsenic. Over-exploitation of groundwater started in India in the 1970s when millions of tube wells were installed in the Ganga delta to prevent diarrhoea from surface water sources such as tanks, ponds and open wells. Today, India has over 30 million groundwater extraction points.Groundwater is also used for irrigation. This means arsenic poisoning affects not just the people of the area but also those who consume the produce of the affected region. In food, rice has the highest sensitivity to arsenic followed by vegetables. In most arsenic-affected states rice is the staple.Despite the crisis, groundwater contamination , either by arsenic or other pollutants such as fluorides, does not get the attention it deserves, especially when compared to surface water contamination because the latter is visible. Moreover, there is no law yet to check groundwater withdrawal.This severe environmental-health crisis has to be contained quickly before it can expand. Along with periodic testing of water in affected areas and individualised testing of each hand pump or tubewell (marking it as safe/unsafe), it is important to encourage people to opt for low-cost, local solutions such as rainwater harvesting that can ensure clean drinking water. States such as Bihar have set up filtration units but the maintenance of filters has always been a problem.This needs to be addressed. Additionally, governments have to curb the use of groundwater and keep a strict control on agricultural and industrial effluents that pollute aquifers that recharge groundwater."
5aeb22ff9855b7179ad7199a,The violence that killed Mohammad Afrazul resounds across India,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/the-violence-that-killed-afrazul-resounds-across-india-rjasthan-human-trafficking-5004683/,2017-12-30,"However, the very act of physical violence  slashing with axe, beating and burning a human being alive stems out of impunity. However, the very act of physical violence  slashing with axe, beating and burning a human being alive stems out of impunity.Written by Sanjay MacwanIndia woke up to the shocking video clip of Shambhu Lal hacking labourer Mohammad Afrazul to death in Rajasthan some weeks ago. The cries of Afrazul pleading for mercy and his wife & daughters wailing for justice in television interviews will continue to haunt us. At the time of writing this article the intent for the pre-meditated murder is yet unknown. However, the very act of physical violence  slashing with axe, beating and burning a human being alive stems out of impunity.Every day I see this impunity being perpetrated on the poor in my efforts to combat human trafficking in India. I have seen and heard of thousands of victims enduring similar kinds of violence to that faced by Afrazul. I have felt the same chill running down my spine as I watched the act of violence by Shambu Lal. It is not much different from the human traffickers who unleash violence against the trafficked.Ive looked into the forlorn eyes of children who were forced to have sex with men thrice their age. One in two survivors of sex-trafficking victims have endured beatings with physical and sharp objects. In a bid to instil fear, several children have been forced to witness the murder of others, to ensure that few try to escape.Along with police we have found children being hidden behind walls and ceilings. In most rescues, children who are hidden in chambers do not even squeal for help  they are gripped by the fear of violence.I have met two men whose hands were chopped with an axe similar to that used by Shambu Lal. Both these men had refused to be bonded labourers in brick kilns. Thousands continue to be bonded in brick kilns across India where they are forced to make bricks. Pregnant women and children are not spared. Any form of resistance unleashes a tirade of violent tactics by their owners. Surviving on single meals, these enslaved labourers work round the clock in extremely unhygienic conditions.Shambu Lal typifies the every-day trafficker, the beneficiary of violence. The key intent to perpetrate violence for traffickers is money. Last year, sex-traffickers gained upto a 1000% profit while their capital investment was minimal. Traffickers are serious about investing in the tactics of violence. The violent methods transcend beyond physical brutality; traffickers use psychological and socio-economic norms to maintain oppression. There is a growth for slave masters not for the slaves.Toward the end of his video, Shambu Lal walks towards an unassuming Afrazul and attacks him mercilessly. This predatory instinct of violence captures the way the world of human trafficking works. The poor are preyed upon. By virtue of their poverty, they are not only vulnerable to hunger and disease, but also to violence. Recent statistics suggest that 400 million people are employed in India and 45 million remain unemployed. Thousands of these people are vulnerable to be trapped into the never-ending cycle of bonded labour and the hellish worlds of sex-trafficking.These probabilities are scary; the impact of trafficking is denting the Indian GDP and HDI.In 2016, India had the fourth highest proportion of modern day slavery estimated at 18.3 million. This includes victims of bonded labour and Commercial Sexual Exploitation (CBI). An estimated 3 million women and girls are sold for sex annually in our country. In addition there are nearly 4 million child labourers. It is shocking to note that such enslavement generates an estimate of 360 billion USD or Rs 21 lakh crores annually which is equivalent to one fifth of the countrys GDP of the year 2015.Victims of human trafficking contribute to the economic engine of the nation. We may see them, but we fail to recognise them. Wrapped in their enslavement, they seem to be all around us. They include those who build our roads, bridges and airports to those who suffer in their bodies to provides entertainment in brothels, bars and lodges. We have helped rescue those who pack food; put aromas in the agarbatties, polish rice that we eat, lay internet cables, put cement and mortar on the metro constructions and much more.Some states & districts have, indeed, enforced laws. Further, effective deterrence has led to decreased levels of violence among perpetrators. The probability of a male customer seeking a minor for sex in Kamathipura (Mumbai) or Sonagachi (Kolkata) has decreased. Previously, traffickers openly flouted young children for sex. Proactive police investigations and subsequent convictions have changed the dynamics of sex-trade in these cities. Traffickers now fear the law. Yet, there is more to be done.We have forgotten the poor who continue to stay outside of growth periphery. They remain outsiders of the development model. Their opportunities to participate are scuttled. How do we achieve sustained growth if the poor are held back by violence? Let us root out the no-entry and reserved entry board at the door of development.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5aeb39cc9855b73f522c7fe8,Meals that passed the taste test...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meals-that-passed-the-taste-test/article22329709.ece,2017-12-30,"This is my favourite time of the year. Not just because of the weather, and the festivity, and all the hope that comes with the New Year. I like these last days of the year also because it gives me an opportunity to go back and relive some of my happy food moments.Food-wise, 2017 was a happy year, indeed. Just a few days ago, I had Ghalibs tender tikkas, and kicked myself for not having gone there for long years. Ghalib Kabab Corner (Ph no: 9810786479) is situated opposite the Markazi mosque in Nizamuddin. The buffalo meat tikkas and seekh kababs are so deliciously juicy that the taste stays with you long after you have polished off a whole plate. In these days of high prices, when an egg costs more than a bun-omelette did a few years ago, the rates are incredibly reasonable, too. A plate of 16 tikkas is for Rs. 50, as is a plate of four, big-sized seekh kebabs.When it comes to fine dining, my happiest meal was at Guppy, a restaurant in the Lodhi Colony main market (Ph no: 011-24690005) which serves Japanese food. I went with some friends, who asked for its signature pork belly and tenderloin cube steaks  and both dishes were superb. The slow braised pork was soft, thick with fat, glazed with soy honey and redolent with the strong flavour of mustard. The pan-seared tenderloin cubes came coated in a mildly sweet sesame seed-flavoured sauce that gave it a delightful punch.Another memorable Asian meal was at a tiny restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Ph nos: 9650260408 and 9599450879). I loved the pancakes prepared with rice powder and beaten egg, served with lettuce leaves and smeared with a light fish sauce. I enjoyed the fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat and the fragrant yet light entres of sticky rice and braised pork and yellow chicken curry.During a visit to Kolkata this autumn, I went to an old favourite  called How Hua  which had reopened after remaining shut for many years. The place was known for its chimney soups, and its still the hot favourite in the reopened restaurant, on Prince Anwar Shah Road (Ph no: 0-7595999413). The soup came in a big vessel  large enough for a small family  and the broth was full of pieces of chicken, prawn, fish, vegetables, crab, tofu and vermicelli, as well and meat and fish balls. What I missed was their French pork chop. But I shall leave that for another day.One place that I hope to see a lot of in the coming year is a little caf called The Tea Lounge in Bikaner House in Pandara Road. The Tea Lounge serves an English high tea and an Indian high tea.The former comes with your choice of tea or coffee, three kinds of sandwiches (chicken, mint and cheese), walnut tart, lemon tart, mushroom khari, almond cookies and ginger biscuits, while the latter comprises kachoris and samosas.Discerning palateRun by Old World Hospitality, it offers savouries such as keema samosas, chicken patties and cheese and chilli patties. The keema samosa I ate was spilling over with the keema it had been stuffed with. On the sandwich menu are chicken sandwiches, ham and cheese roll, coleslaw roll, cheese and mint sandwiches.For fish loversIf you enjoy your fish, then you should not miss Sana-di-ge (Ph nos: 011-40507777 and 7042794546) in the Malcha Marg market. Beautifully done up, the restaurant offers various kinds of coastal cuisines  and I had a superb tawa fried seer fish, chicken ghee roast, where chicken chunks marinated with freshly ground spices and garlic had been roasted in ghee. I enjoyed the mamsa pepper fry, boneless lamb cooked with oodles of pepper and curry leaves, and ended the meal with a lovely and creamy sweet dish called eleneer payasum  sweetened coconut cream with the pulp of tender coconut.Another little place that gave me a lot of joy this year was Anmol, known far and wide for its butter chicken. This is not the regular butter chicken that you get in restaurants, but a juicy tandoori chicken in hot, melted butter. The chicken is grilled on a coal fire and then tossed with chillies, dried mango powder, chaat masala and chutney. Butter is melted till it is golden yellow, and then poured over the chicken.It was, as you can see, a good year. And now heres to 2018. Let there be good food, and no ones stomach ever empty."

Skipping dinner and choosing to stick to just snacks is also a no-no. Avoid rotis and rice and limit your alcohol consumption to less than 100ml for a healthy start to the new year, they say.According to Debashish Saha , consultant, AMRI Hospital , green salad, non-oily snacks and non-greasy meat are perfect for having a blast on December 31 without weighing your system down. The tendency is to consume oily snacks like kebabs, fish fingers and cheese balls along with alcohol. It kills your appetite, making you skip dinner. That results in indigestion and hangover. Rather, one should pick salad or fruits if they are available. In case they are not, limit your alcohol consumption and make sure to have your dinner sans carbohydrates, said Saha.It could be a challenge to restrict alcohol consumption at a New Years party, so make sure you have the right kind of stuff to limit the negative effects, says microbiologist Irfaan Akhtar. It is important to know your limits. While its important not to consume alcohol on an empty stomach, dont stuff yourself with food either. Dry snacks and non-spicy dishes should be chosen. Diabetics and cardiac patients should avoid whisky and opt for red wine instead. It is important to go slow on starters since one often ends up having too much protein in a short span of time. This could affect the kidneys, said Akhtar.However, more than the food or drink, it is often hand hygiene that leaves party-hoppers sick the next morning, points out Arindam Biswas, consultant, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.Biswas added that some myths about preventing hangovers needed to be busted. Cheese or lime water doesnt help. In fact, it could lead to severe indigestion the next morning. Rather, take peanuts, lettuce, cabbage leaves, tomatoes and cucumber. Make sure to have plenty of water the next morning and you should be ready to swing into action, he says."
