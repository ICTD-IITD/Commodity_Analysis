Chicken, beef, mutton, lamb, pork  you name it and we gorge on it. We love meat, says 78-year-old Pamela Rebeiro, as she escorts us down the narrow, cool corridor of her Collin Street house. Pamela, who is an Anglo-Indian, is a fantastic cook, quite known within the community. Even our aloo chops are meat croquettes coated with potato. Aloo just got a bit of lip-service! she laughs.Pamela is among the last few of a vanishing tribe of middle-aged or older women who know the secrets of Anglo-Indian cuisine  one of the most prominent pillars of Kolkatas diverse culinary heritage. In and around Ripon Street, Elliott Road and other Anglo-Indian bastions in central Kolkata, women like Pamela bent over bubbling pots and pans and red-hot ovens as they dished out delicacies like juicy jalfrezi, tangy pepper water, rich ball curry, yellow rice, pantras and more. Lunch after Sunday service was an elaborate affair as the lanes would fill up with the rich aromas as families congregated around the table over food, conversation and maybe some music later in the afternoon. Much of that magic is gone, with flickers of that life and lifestyle surviving in corners like Bow Barracks.There was a time when I used to cook for many, many people. We used to host parties almost every day. My husband, Rubin Rebeiro, was a musician, who used to play at Princes in Grand Hotel. He used to have hundreds of visitors. Ours was a buzzing house. Today, I live alone as my son works in Hyderabad and I dont feel like cooking for myself. However, hes got married and my daughter-in-law will be staying with me; so things may change, says Pamela.People who grew up in and around central Kolkata have a deep connection with the community and its food. There was a mansion in front of my Beniapukur house in which lived four or five Anglo-Indian families. One of them was Mr Jardine, recalls actor-musician-director Anjan Dutt , whos had a strong association with the community since childhood. He had a very beautiful daughter, Alison, and I liked her a lot. I was very young then. They used to make some amazing kofta curry and yellow rice. The smell used to drift to our house and I used to gorge on the food. I dont know if it was because of my tender age, or my strong admiration for Alison, but the mind-blowing flavour of that food is etched in my mind. I have never tasted any other plate of ball curry-yellow rice tastier than that. Now, they are all gone, the director adds.There are not many families left, to start with, says Reethu Sarawgi, a septuagenarian retired teacher of La Martiniere for Girls, Kolkata. The Anglo-Indian community felt isolated after Independence. Almost all my friends left by the early 60s for the UK, Canada and Australia , she adds. Reethu feels her food habits have been influenced by her friends or her hostel life in school. If you went to a school that is under the Church of North India, you would develop a love for Anglo food. I remember the delicious sausage curry and country captain  dry beef curry  made by a dear friend of mine, Yvonne Pinto, who passed away recently. I will never forget that taste, rues Reethu, who is a Malayali by birth but grew up with Anglo-Indian friends, and still savours Anglo food almost every day.But it is not just the exodus, there are other factors to it too, says Anjan. The wine-and-dine culture of Park Street died a sad death due to the heavy entertainment tax. Once my friend, musician Nondon Bagchi, and I held an informal survey and counted around 600 entertainers on Park Street  musicians, cabaret dancers, singers and so on. The whole lot of those people left, and with them, their culture also left, the director adds.However, Anglo-Indian cuisine has never really been part of restaurant business in Kolkata. There are places that serve one or two items like jalfrezi and roast, but eateries dedicated to the cuisine have been a rarity. Traditionally, the authentic food is cooked in almost every Anglo household even today. A family lunch will mean a week-long preparation involving shopping for meat, marinating it with right ingredients, buying dill and other herbs and then finally preparing it, which could go on for a couple of days.While we definitely love other cuisines, we eat Anglo-Indian food almost every day at our house. I had yellow rice and ball curry today, and yesterday mashi (the cook, a lady from Nadia) made pantras. My daughters are equally happy if they have pasta for dinner but our generation is a bit more traditional and we love our food, says Barry OBrien, quizmaster and president-in-chief of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association . We Anglo-Indians take our food very seriously. Families swear by their cook, who used to be called boy, khansama or bowchi (derived from bawarchi). In my childhood, we used to have a fantastic cook, Appana Rao, who was from the Andhra-Odisha border. I remember, we never used to take packed lunch to our school, St Xaviers, as it would get cold. Appana used to cook and the fresh hot lunch in tiffin carriers would be brought to school, recalls Barry.Also, Anglo-Indians have a special inclination for leftover food. Cooking a little extra is our kitchen culture, mainly for two reasons  to cater to sudden, wanted or unwanted, guests, and to relish the dish a day later, says Barry. By far my favourite breakfast over the years has been quarter-boiled eggs, (not half-boiled, not hard-boiled!) mashed with aloo chops from dinner the night before, he adds.A family lunch can mean a week-long preparation and daylong cooking. Our families are closely knit. We still try and meet on every occasion for a large meal. Typical Anglo families still carry on this tradition, says Christine Beaucasin, who works at the Oral School for Deaf Children. Our parties are still incomplete without jalfrezi, vindaloo, pantras, roasts and so on, she adds.But are there shops dedicated to Anglo-Indian groceries? Not really. We use a lot of onions, ginger, garlic, tomato. You can buy them from anywhere, really. For meat and the sausages, we go to New Market or Entally bazar, says Christina Samuel. We usually have an elaborate three course meal  soup, side dishes and desserts. Each day of the Christmas holiday season has been extremely busy for us. We were either invited to someones place for lunch or dinner or some friends or family visited us, says Christina. While the tradition of cooking runs in family, tedious items like ball curry and butt curry are going out of fashion, she says.Is the younger generation a tad reluctant to carry forward the cuisine of the community? While a section of the older generation thinks so, many of the youngsters dont agree. Our food is a family affair. It passes from one generation to the next. I love to cook. I make fantastic steaks. Anglo men are usually good cooks as they love to eat, quips Joshua Samuel, Christinas 32-year-old son.Brandon Claudius, son of hockey player Olympian Leslie Claudius agrees. I dont get time every day due to my erratic work hours but I am also a foodie. Korma, bhuni vindaloo  I love to eat and I love to cook for my family, he says. His wife, Jilian, too, cooks Anglo food almost every day at home. There are many Anglo-Indian snacks including kul kul and rose cookies that we used to make at home before Christmas. Now, we buy them from the market as those are very elaborate, she adds.However, for those who are reluctant to cook, you have home delivery. Ive never enjoyed cooking and Ive never cooked. Ive always sourced my food from reliable home deliveries. And more often than not, I get Anglo food, says Reethu.Veronica Pacheco, a retired service woman, delivers lunch and dinner to around 15 families every day. They are all retired people. I have a dabbawala who delivers the lunch boxes to them. The menu is simple  rice, dal, sabzi and one non-veg item of fish, beef or pork, she tells us. Apart from the retired households, Veronica also delivers to the clubs that serve Anglo-Indian food on special occasions. Usually at Bingo parties, I prepare food for around 150 people. I served everywhere  Dalhousie Institute, Calcutta Rangers Club, Armenian Club and all. I prepare thorough Anglo-Indian food  aloo chops, shami beef tikias, pantras, cutlets, pork roast, tongue roast. My father, Vivian George Thompson was a very good cook and he taught me. When I lost my husband in 2012, I started feeling a bit lonely and so I chose to engage myself like this, says Veronica, who stays alone as her son works in Melbourne.If you havent tasted Anglo-Indian sausages, you are missing out on a slice of life Kolkata has to offer. These hard-core pork sausages are far from the skinny machine-made Frankfurters you get at shopping mall freezers. Anglo-Indian sausages are stuffed with onion, ginger, aromatic herbs and sets of secret spice mixes apart from mince. We make our own masala. From the garam masalas to haldi and coriander  we grind them to make it perfect, says Bablu Khatik who runs Chamans Pork Shop at Park Circus market with his brother Rahul and uncle Sunil. Cooking the sausages also involves a unique process. You dont need to grill or fry them; as they need boiling for at least 40 minutes. Here is a small tip for you. Take water just adequate to boil the sausages. Bring it to boil along with the meat (with pierced skin) and cook it till the water is absorbed. The meat will be cooked by the fat it releases. From balanced heat to right spices and sweetness of onions and cinnamon, the tastes explode in your mouth with a bang. The only problem is these sausages are not widely sold. Besides Park Circus market, you can find them at Entally market, Taltala market and New Market.Yellow rice-ball (or kofta curry): Rich meatball curry with flavoured rice cooked in coconut milk with a pinch of turmericPork vindaloo: Goan and Anglo-Indians fight over this spicy dish. We hijacked vindaloo from Goan cuisine and now we make it better, quipsBarry OBrienJalfrezi with white rice and pepper water: This meat preparation is on the dry side. Pepper water has no pepper in it but the gravy is made of tamarind paste and other masalas. You have to have white rice to enjoy the platterPantras: Deep-fried, meat-stuffed pancakesAloo chops: Croquettes made of minced-meat, coated with potatoHaddiguddi ballychow: Ballychow is a prawn paste that is used as an ingredient. Pork bones and a little bit of meat is cooked with ballychow and a lot of tomatoes"

For many decades, Punjabs contribution to Indias production of wheat and rice has been substantial. Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people, Amarinder said.Amarinder said of the states almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. Its our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs, the CM said.With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing high-quantity rice and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into Mohali and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.He said: Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the states youth. I want to see it grow as a major technological hub in north, he said. The city is being equipped with all the necessary facilities. Amarinder said that in the next five years, his government would keep the development of Mohali a continued process towards technological growth."

Originally from Kolkata , he moved to Mumbai in 2009 after completing his Class XII there.Shantanu first began his acting as Swayam Shekhawat on his debut show, Dil Dosti Dance. He was also a part of Desi Hoppers dance crew that went on to World of Dance Championship 2015. Read on, as he walks down the memory lane, reminiscing on college, revisiting his classrooms and going back to the place (the terrace!) that made him who he isI was very shy before I came to Mumbai and when I moved here, everything was new to me. I took my own sweet time to settle in to college and get in too the groove. This is where my actual college life started  it helped me open upThe canteen here has amazing Chinese food and we would gorge on the Triple Schezwan Rice  complete paisa vasool meal. My other favourite was the Chilly Cheese Roll from the famous sandwich stall opposite our college. Post classes, we would often hangout at Marine Drive  it is a beautiful spot and just next to our collegeDuring my college days, I was too shy to have a girlfriend. However, there is one particular incident that stays with me till date. We were performing at a fest when a girl standing close to the stage screamed out, Shantanu, I love you Please marry me! Since there werent too many people near the stage, I could see her clearly and felt extremely awkward. Post the performance, she walked up to me and told me that she loved my performance. While she was quite excited, I was embarrassed and couldnt say muchStudies have always been my priority; in my final year, I scored 77 per cent. I was a diligent student; in fact, I never bunked any lectures in my first year. Eventually, as I started participating in intercollegiate festivals  Kshitij (Mithibai College), Malhar (St Xaviers), Mood Indigo (IIT-Bombay) and Kaleidoscope (Sophias College for Women ), among others  my attendance went down. But since I was representing the college, I would get my attendance, anywayThis terrace is where my journey started  the auditions, the way my dancing improved, making friends  it all happened here. I was always in college, but never in the classroom. A major part of who I am today, I owe it to this space"
5b2d7a5f9855b723c6f466b8,Kolkata: Blaze piles debt burden on traders,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/blaze-piles-debt-burden-on-traders/articleshow/62625518.cms,2018-01-24,"KOLKATA: A day after a devastating fire ravaged Gorabazar municipality market , 71-year-old fish trader Kanai Naskar was back doing what he has been doing all life: sell fish. On Tuesday, he set up shop amidst charred debris, twisted iron bars, crumpled galvanaised sheets and rotting vegetables, delivering fish for a marriage order he had accepted in advance.For others, it will take at least a fortnight to be back in business. That is the deadline set by municipality authorities to clear the debris. The traders may have to resume business under the open sky. But what they desperately need is a space that is clear so that they can begin selling, said Harinder Singh, chairman of the Dum Dum Municipality, after a meeting with the representatives of the market.Singh said CM Mamata Banerjee had expressed her keenness to rebuild the market at the earliest. But he recognised that would take at least a year, too long for the traders to wait. Most of them are counting their losses in the tragedy that also claimed two lives.Like Naskar, many others had orders from customers till Sunday and had stocked raw material accordingly. But the fire turned everything into ashes and has left them in ruin. We had Rs 1.5 lakh in the cashbox. The lender had to be paid on Monday. We dont have the cash to pay the debt now. This is what we are left with now, said Soma Roychowdhury, pointing at piles of black coal dusts. She used to have a puffed and flattened rice shop that was razed in the blaze.State PWD minister Firhad Hakim and fire minister Sovan Chatterjee visited the market on Tuesday and assured help of engineers and fire safety officials to rebuild the structure in a safer way.While the municipal body is looking for ways to mobilise funds for the reconstruction, traders are wary. Last time, it had cost them around Rs 30 lakh. Costs have doubled since then. Hopefully the state government will grant money this time, said Biswajit Das, leader of the RSP supported union that runs the market committee."

The mini-Chinatown, off the Central Avenue, reflects the heritage of Chinese immigrants in the city, which was home to nearly 20,000 of them in the early 19th century. The number has dwindled to 2,000 now, and some among them whip up the breakfast.The aroma of soup noodles, warm dumplings and fish ball soup from the stalls fill the air inside the lanes as the bazaar springs to life around 6.30 a.m. Men and women sit on stools and cook food as a stream of visitors come there to relish this unique street food. One of the popular dishes is the steamed bao , a soft Chinese bun with a variety of fillings. Another is the fish ball soup. De-boned fish is ground into a paste and mixed with corn starch and salt. The mixture is made into balls that are deep-fried and served with piping hot stock. The menu includes lope yang , which are rounds of savouries stuffed with radish; momos or dumplings with beef, pork, chicken, seafood or vegetable filling; and sweet snacks such as chintoy , which is a sticky rice dumpling topped with white sesame seeds.Suchitra Chakraborty, 67, retired Professor of Bengali literature, recalls the Sundays 50 years ago when she would visit the breakfast market with her classmates of Presidency College. Even now we go there on Sunday mornings to get a taste of our favourite breakfast dishes. The place exudes an old world charm and reminds us of our college days. My favourite is the fish ball soup and the prawn pappad, she says.The food is lapped up quickly, and the bazaar winds up by 9 a.m. It offers a peep into the life of Chinese immigrants. From students and young professionals to middle-aged men and women and Chinese settlers, the market attracts an eclectic mix. Its exact origin is unclear. Most stall owners say it has been around since the time of their great-grandfathers  it means about a century."

The countrys biggest producer of rice has been requested by several states  hit by a production shortage  to provide them with this staple, making this the first time ever that Bengal will provide rice at the states request.At least one of these states is BJP-ruled Jharkhand, while two other states are Left-ruled Kerala and AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu. Sources said one more BJP-ruled north Indian state is also in the queue.Bengal produces over 2.5 crore tonnes of paddy, which translates to 1.6 crore tonnes of rice. This is the countrys highest, said state finance secretary H K Dwivedi. He confirmed that that the three states had formally requested Bengal with an offer to buy its surplus rice. On an average, 23 lakh to 30 lakh tonnes of rice are procured by the government per fiscal. This fiscal, so far, 52 lakh tonnes of rice have been procured, which in itself is a great achievement, he added.TOI had reported on January 28 that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had written to Bengal about supplying rice to some states.Pradeep Mazumdar, the agriculture adviser to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, told TOI that this was the first time that the states had asked Bengal to supply rice. Dwivedi and Mazumdar were attending the State Credit Seminar 2018-19, organised by Nabard. This is a good beginning, said Mazumder. In the last two years, too, we were keen on supplying rice to other states so that we could keep prices at a level. But the Centre and FCI were not very keen on it, he added.According to Mazumdar, other states are now buying rice from Bengal and this vindicates Banerjees agricultural policy. He pointed out that the Centre and rice-deficit states mainly procure rice from Punjab, Haryana and Telangana. There was some unorganized rice export to Bangladesh and other countries after rice came under Open General Licence (OGL) in 2012. Now, there are no export restrictions, he added.Mazumdar said Bengal has requested RBI and Nabard to fix the agri credit target at Rs 70,000 crore for the next fiscal. We want Rs 1,00,000 credit per farmer. Considering 70 lakh registered farmers, it should be Rs 70,000 crore, he added. The credit projection for agriculture in 2018-19 is Rs 63,196 crore, whereas it was Rs 53,000 crore in 2017-18. However, so far, only Rs 34,000 crore could be achieved.Dwivedi also pointed out that though the macro-economic scenario in agriculture in the country as a whole was dismal, Bengal stood out. He said the states warehousing capacity had gone up from 62,000 tonnes to 6.2 lakh tonnes. More than 3.5 lakh tonnes of warehousing capacity will be added this year, he added."

The final plan envisages having a total of a hundred such stalls across the state.We have chosen five places  the Ruby crossing, Gariahat, DLF in New Town, Shyambazar and Salt Lake  in the city, where people will get their lunch at Rs 21 only. This will start from March. There will be a hundred stalls across the state from May, a senior state food department official said.We will start with a set menu but have plans to give people more options at a later stage. The meals will be available at a specific time to start with but, at a later stage, we have plans to make this an all-day affair. We have tied up with the fisheries department and the agricultural marketing dep-artment for this, the official added.States like Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi and Rajasthan already have such schemes. Tamil Nadu was first to launch Amma Canteens in 2013, which provided wholesome meals at subsidised rates. Uttarakhand then started Indira Amma Canteens that served a variety of local food at Rs 20 a plate. This was followed by NTR Anna canteens in Andhra Pradesh, Ahaar centres in Odisha, Aam Aadmi Canteens in Delhi and Annapuran Rasoi in Rajasthan."

An initiative of the state fisheries department, battery-operated cars bearing these affordable meals will be placed at popular points across various districts, initially near the office of district magistrates. Officials expect government employees and general public who throng these areas to benefit from the cheap meal scheme.Christened Ekushe Annapurna, this dream project of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will be effective from May 1 in all districts. The scheme will be marketed by the West Bengal State Fishermens Cooperative Limited, which is popularly known as Benfish. The scheme was initially launched as an experiment in Kolkata from February 2017.The scheme was a grand success in Kolkata, where 20 of our battery-operated cars serve the people. Now it is time for us to spread it throughout the state. We will begin by placing the cars with meals near district magistrate offices. Gradually, the same will be extended to major crossings and government buildings, state Fisheries Minister Chandranath Sinha told The Indian Express.According to Sinha, placing the cars near DM offices will cater to not only thousands of visitors, but also hundreds of government employees. Every day, thousands visit these offices and not all of them have the financial capability to get full fish meal at a reasonable price. So keeping that in mind, we have decided to start this scheme at different state government offices in the districts, said Sinha.The minister further said, The scheme will be run on a no-profit and no-loss basis. Above all, there is 100 per cent guarantee of hygiene be it cooking or packaging. The meal at Rs 21 will come in a packet covered with a plastic jacket to prevent contamination.This project is designed to fulfil the dream of our chief minister to offer proper and nutritious food to everyone in the state. Our aim is to provide affordable fish meals in a hygienic manner, Sinha said. The Tamil Nadu government had in 2013 launched a similar scheme called Amma Unavagam (amma canteens), under which select outlets across the state served a piece of idli for Re 1, a plate of sambar rice for Rs 5 and a plate of curd rice for Rs 3.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

We have plugged the leakage of subsidised wheat, rice and coarse grains to the tune of Rs 17,500 crore annually. Though there is no direct savings because new beneficiaries also get added, now we are providing the foodgrains to the real beneficiaries, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told TOI.According to government data, about 23.19 crore ration cards have been issued to people under the National Food Security Act ( NFSA ). While all the ration cards have been digitised, the progress of linking ration cards to Aadhaar numbers is about 82%. More bogus ration cards will be out of the system once we have 100% Aadhaar seeding, Paswan said.Data compiled by the food ministry show that nearly 50% of the deleted ration cards across the country came from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal . A large number of bogus ration cards were also deleted in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.NFSA is the worlds largest welfare scheme, which targets ensuring food security to more than 80 crore eligible beneficiaries."

How is being finance minister in the SAD-BJP coalition different from being one in the Congress government The difference between the Akali finance minister and the Congress finance minister is that the style of functioning of Capt Amarinder Singh is very different from Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Capt Singh likes to delegate his work, he trusts you completely and expects results. In Mr Badals case, he never delegated and he didnt expect results. He would take finance departments meetings personally and not invite the finance minister. In the present dispensation, I am expected to tie up everything, sew up everything and give a final presentation either to the CM or the cabinet. In that sense, its quite different.I think the last 10 years had been very reckless in so far as populism is concerned, in terms of good governance or administration. A lot of money was recklessly thrown on projects not in the larger interest of Punjab. For example, for the last 10 years they kept telling us that they had foodstock to cover all the losses. But one day before the counting of votes on March 10, 2017, the Punjab government signed an agreement with the Centre accepting all the losses and converting that account into a term loan. In one stroke of pen, we were saddled with $4.5 billion or Rs 31,000 crore. Similarly, electricity boards losses of about Rs 17,000 crore were converted to UDAY bonds. So about Rs 51,000 crore was loaded in within a few weeks.In the last financial year of the SAD government, they made memorials worth Rs 2,000 crore. But for the first time, there was a strike in the Panjab University for 20 days. Students were beaten up. PU was just asking for Rs 20 crore of additional government support. We have not paid the Sainik School at Kapurthala, which for continuous 17 years got the Presidents medal for sending most cadets to the NDA. The annual grant to the school was Rs 1 crore, which is peanuts. Baba Farid Health Sciences University vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur wanted Rs 50 crore to make it a world class university.Once they have been built, what do you do? Either you complete them or leave them. They are all half-constructed. So well have to complete them. But, why were these decisions taken?All revenue of Mandi Board accounts to the tune of about Rs 5,000 crore, PIDB about Rs 2,000 crore a year have been escrowed with the banks for five years. Before they left, they made sure that they emptied out everything and no sources of revenue were left for the next government. Its, as they call it in military, a scorched earth policy where the retreating forces destroy everything. But in this process, the Congress government has learnt a lesson, that howsoever reckless you are, you will be reduced to 15 seats, if you are not careful, if good governance is not there, and if corruption is there. The basic concern is rozi-roti and, what in Urdu they say, izzat ki roti.We were acutely aware of what was happening in Punjab. Whatever the Congress government has promised is basically with the view to kick-start the economy. Now in this cross-subsidisation of giving free power to farmers, the whole subsidy burden was loaded on to the industry of Punjab. They were getting power at Rs 7.60 a unit. If I can take you 50 years back: Why did Punjab progress? Punjab progressed because it had the Bhakra Dam. Because Punjab had access to cheap power, Punjab industrialised and developed.Industry was leaving Punjab in droves because of the power situation. So how do we retain them? We have to create a level-playing field. So when you talk about populism, I would respectfully disagree with you. It was not populism. It involves a subsidy of about Rs 1,500 crore. But I see benefits or multiplier effects if we can retain our industry. Because you dont just retain industry, you also retain jobs and taxes. So, this was a must.No, this is not the only way. There are two other things that need to be done. Farmers have to be weaned away from agriculture. If agriculture forms 20% of Punjabs GDP and 75% people are engaged in agriculture, that means 75% people are trying to earn Rs 20. They are not going to be rich or well-off. The idea is to give skill sets and job opportunities to farmers children so that they can get away and start doing other jobs. Second step is to give better crop prices and promote alternative crops. It has to be multi-pronged approach and debt has to be taken care of. Unless you do all three simultaneously, you will not have the desired effect.We have to remodel our economy from a foodgrainproducing economy into a more industrialised or a service-oriented one. That model has to be put in place in the next four years. If we dont do that, I foresee our resources will be severely affected in the post-GST situation when compensation stops after four years.The Green Revolution must move eastwards. Punjab should be relieved of this duty of growing foodgrains for the country. We have done this duty for 60 years, but in this process we have poisoned our soil, depleted our aquifers and water sources. Let Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, which form the natural food bowl of India, do that duty.We are saying instead of rice, we will be very interested in growing maize. As long as we get the MSP or a little bit of hand-holding, Punjab could become Denmark of India. Why should there not be MSP on milk, fruits, or vegetables? If you study the food policy of India, it is rooted in the 1960s and Green Revolution was the main thrust at the time.If you look at an average Indian, he is malnourished. So now, the Union government should change the food policy to nutrition policy. An average man should have the access to fruit, milk and vegetables, and Punjab could step in as the producer of milk, fruits and vegetables. And, this is how we can remodel and maize could be one of the options.Of course, maize would give as much income or cash as rice would. There would be no problem of stubble burning as well. It will take care of all that.I think that is the political line. The Punjab government is basically trying to assess the electricity requirement. At present, any transmission losses or any inefficiencies of the electricity board are actually all being billed to free power. This is only a pilot project. We are trying to tell farmers that every tubewell costs us, say Rs 48,000 per year. We have 1.4 million pumps. So we are saying, you take this Rs 48,000 which we anyway have to give. In case, you can save power of say Rs 18,000 out of Rs 48,000 that we pay you, then Rs 18,000 is yours. There is another angle to it. We want to save water as well. If farmers accept it, we are going to go further and if not, let it remain a pilot project.We had flagged this issue with the Union finance and agriculture ministers. Maybe the CM will again meet Union minister (Ram Vilas) Paswan and we again will say, Either you take over the entire procurement operation, or reimburse us our actuals  whichever is convenient for you. Pre-GST, we have been charging some cess from the FCI, but it has been subsumed now.Food procurement exercise is inherently a lossmaking exercise to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore per year for Punjab. The Punjab government has to pay Rs 3,200 crore every year to the Centre for next 20 years. Over that, Rs 1,800 crore is the annual loss for procurement of grains. Why should we suffer a burden of Rs 5,000 crore every year? Why should we be burdened with this huge amount when we are undertaking the procurement exercise for the Centre, we are poisoning our soil and exhausting our ground water?I think we are actually selling water not the foodgrains. Every kilogram of rice takes 5,000 litres of water and every kilogram of wheat takes 3,000 litres. To get a cash credit limit, we have to first deposit that loss with the Central government before they give us the limit. We had paid Rs 1,100 crore before the wheat season.I quite agree with this. We have not been able to increase our revenue share and industry in our economy. We are dependent on the Centre. That is why I said, we need to remodel our economy.There are two huge areas I see for Punjab. One is our excise policy. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have opted for corporation model. We are not trying to go for retail mode, but trying to have wholesale part of it so that we can track every bottle that comes to the state either from our own distilleries or from outside. There is a technology to help curb sale of illegal or nontaxed liquor. My own feeling is that distillers, wholesalers and retailers are the same people. This is the area where Punjab should increase revenue by 25% every year. This year, my target is to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and next year it could go up to Rs 2,000 crore.Second area where our revenue can be increased is mining. My feeling is if we can identify additional mines and if we can install technology to check illegal mining, this is an industry worth Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. We are now generating around Rs 150-200 crore from mining compared to around Rs 45 lakh during the Akali regime. Although we had auctioned around Rs 400 crores of sand mines, some people backed out and there was some controversy.Punjab should also be looking at non-tax revenue as it has the lowest non-tax revenue collection in India. The rates have not been revised for 20-30 years. We would ask all departments to review their non-tax revenue.We have flagged this issue with the RBI and even the Union finance minister that there has been some unethical lending to the farmers by commercial banks. This must be checked because in order to achieve their targets they indulge in such things where they know that this money can never be recovered. It is beyond our purview to bring these banks to kneel. We have made a big hue and cry. The reason why we started farm debt waiver first with cooperative banks was that we did not have data from commercial banks.We have already rolled out some of the bigger promises. There were two types of promises. Ones which did not entail any financial liability like electricity subsidy to industry, or farm debt waiver. So we have already rolled out all these. For smartphones we are in talks with many companies. There are some procedural and tax issues with those firms because it is a service and soon those would be resolved. I dont think smartphones will not be handed out as promised.Sometimes tokenism is also important. Mahatama Gandhi was not short of kurtas. He was a barrister from London. But he never wore kurtas because he realized that 70% of people in India at that time never wore a shirt. I think leaders should be role models. Even tokenism of doing away with red beacons on vehicles was a decision in the same direction.It is not only about PDS. They have not allowed use of ethanol made of foodgrains. They have banned it for rice and maize.At this moment, if I look at the total under the MSP regime what the farmers are being paid is about Rs 55,000 crore and the subsidy bill of power, which is the biggest subsidy, is around Rs 6,000 crore. It would add up to around 15% of the total compensation which is being paid to farmers. At this moment I feel that farmers are not able to take that 15%. That would be a huge blow.We will have to carry on with it till such time when we can have farms up and running. It is not possible at the moment. Basically, you have to prioritise, what needs to be done. In Punjab, human resource needs to be upgraded in a massive way.Manpreet Badal is not a first-time finance minister, he was the finance minister in the Akali government as well. Despite that he has not been able to generate resources and has been taking the shelter of empty coffers left by the SAD-BJP government. If he cannot implement the promises made in the election manifesto and cannot improve the financial condition of the state, it is better for him to give up the post. It is for the first time that the salaries of employees are being delayed. How will there be development in the state? At the same time, he has been making unrealistic promises of making Punjab revenue surplus in next four years.The Punjab finance minister has always been begging for financial support from the Union government when the state government has not even been able to distribute funds released by the Centre for various welfare schemes. One of the best examples is the post-matric scholarship for the Scheduled Caste students where around Rs 115 crore sent by the Centre has not been released by the state. Finance department sher-oshayari se nahi chalta. Jab Raja hi mast ho jayega to wazir se kya umeed ki ja sakti hai? Salaries are not being paid on time to employees, pensions are not being distributed for months, and farm debt waiver has not been properly implemented. What to talk about distribution of smartphones to youth as promised in the election manifesto?It seems to be a totally confused government. The Congress govt totally miscalculated Rs 15,000 crore revenue in its first budget. The finance dept doesnt seem to be in the loop of the decisions being taken by other departments. I had asked them during the last budget session where they would generate Rs 10,000 crore revenue from when they do not have any concrete roadmap. The state cannot borrow more than 3% of the GSDP. The Congress government has not been able to even implement announcements made in the last years budget. They have not even cleared the DA and arrears to employees till date and salaries are being delayed every month."

He points to his field, which had once won him the badge of a successful farmer from the Bihar government. He had grown a record 492 quintals of rice in one acre, in 1977.But for this man, who resettled at Biranchi tola number 3 colony -- one among 46 other East Pakistani Hindu refugee colonies in west Champaram -- life is not the same. A flooded Manihari river left piles of sand on his farm and destroyed his fields and his pride. Havildar, who made his way here in 1956, is a broken man after losing four acres of land which are either filled with sand or have been eroded by the river. Nobody from the government has come here. I am virtually landless, he says.Havildar is not alone. Shyamal Prasad Saha (70) and nonagenarian Rabindra Nath Poddar too lost huge chunks of land to sand, making them virtually landless. Saha, one of the educated Bengali refugees grew rice, wheat and sugarcane in the four acres of land he got from the government as part of the rehabilitation policy. He has now shifted base to one of the refugee colonies situated in Bettiah town.Poddar, who earned name and fame for his treatment of snake bites, lives with his extended family. Nearly 55 families out of 113 families rehabilitated in Biranchi no 3 in 1956, have lost nearly 121 acres of agricultural and 69 decimals of housing land. They now live on the edge of poverty.Land for settlementMany Bengali speaking Hindus were forced to leave East Pakistan and take shelter in India.The Centre arranged for their rehabilitation in West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar, Assam and Tripura.In Bihar, these Bengali speaking refugees were first set up in a camp near Paschim Hazari area. They were then relocated to the 46 refugee colonies spread across West Champaran. Bihar has 115 refugee colonies. West Champaran has the maximum, followed by 38 in Purnia and 13 in East Champaran.Each of the displaced families were given two types of land -- five acres for farming and 18 decimal to build a house, or four acres and 18 decimal land. They were given voting rights only two years back in 2015.Not all refugees were lucky. Nearly 24 families  14 of whom are from Myanmar and living at Paschim Hazari camp set up in 1956  are still to get any land. It is not the issue of citizenship. They all have voting rights, said Dr (Capt) Dilip Kumar Sinha, former vice-president of Bihar Minority Commission and president of Bihar-Bengali Samiti. He did not address the issue of non-allocation of land.We never visited our relatives who stayed back. But nobody cares for our plight, said Girija Lal Sahu, a refugee, who came to Hazari camp in 1974. Sahu makes do plying a rickshaw. Other refugees left out in land settlement either work in fields as daily wagers or are into petty business.While some still do fight for land, at Majaharia, another refugee colony, situated near the Udaipur ox-bow lake, encroachment of their land by locals resulted in a bloody fight in 1997.Caste RecognitionIn a state where caste plays a major role, these Bengali speaking people are also vying for a caste identity.Raja Kumar Das, a student of class 10 at Swatantra Senani Kedarnath Motani High School, has been trying to get a caste certificate to apply for his board examinations for the last eight months.The Bihar School Examination Board has announced the schedule, but Das is still struggling to get the caste certificate that is mandatory.It has been proved that more than 65% of them belong to Scheduled Castes (SC) but they are shown in the list of backward castes and extremely backward caste list in Bihar. This is making it difficult for them to get caste certificates. This deprives them of different welfare projects of government, said Madan Banik, vice president (zone 4), central committee, Bihar Bengali Association.A study conducted by Asian Development Research Institutes Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance (CEPPF) reveals that 36.2% people fail to find their caste in the state list, whereas 66% have been placed in extremely backward class. The survey reveals that 97.1% people claimed themselves to be SC, of which 49% and 38% are in East and West Champaran districts respectively.The same people find place in SC list in neighbouring West Bengal. Does change of place change the caste also? wondered Banik.This has happened despite the state general administration department issuing instructions (letter no 20810, dated 16.6.2009) to district authorities to issue caste certificate.The associations Bettiah chapter president, Radhakant Debnath, had written a letter in October 2017 to the district magistrate to consider the state directive, but has not had a response.Socio-Economic ConditionsThe CEPPF study reveals that only 16.2% Bengali speaking refugees have passed matric or taken to higher education; 11.2% refugees can read in their mother tongue Bengali with difficulty, while just 23.6% can write in Bengali.The economic condition of these refugees has not changed either with only 3.3% of their population in government services.While 43.7% are wage labourers, 28.7% are self-employed, mostly in agriculture. More than half their population, 56.6% have shown their income below Rs 3000 per month. Over 30% of the population does not have ration cards and only 15.2% have concrete shelter.The demand for the formation of a Refugee Development Authority is long pending. In 2011, Bihar government announced the constitution of Tharu Development Authority for the development of Tharus living near the borders with Nepal and gave them the status of scheduled tribes. The Bengali Association has also demanded that they be included. The government has, however, been found lacking."

Several districts which were earlier neglected by businesspersons are seeing an inflow of investment due to assurance on the power front. It has also markedly changed the lifestyle of residents, with thousands of people purchasing air-conditioners.A recent study by discoms showed a rise in domestic and industrial power consumption as several industrialists are setting up small and medium units in rural areas. This is particularly visible in most backward districts such as Adilabad, Asifabad, Mahabubabad, Mahbubnagar and Kothagudem, where the land prices are cheap. Availability of cheap labour is an added attraction that is pulling in fresh investments.Sources in the industries department said that they are overwhelmed with the response from industrialists for setting up new units in most backward districts. We received more than 4,000 new enquiries for fresh investments in rural Telangana , which is unprecedented, said sources.Self-employment units also coming up in the villages with the availability of power. Youth who have some technical skill and a diploma are looking to open their own ventures in the villages. Rice mills, granite polishing, pumps and motors repair, floor mills, welding units and service centres are coming up with the introduction of 24-hour power supply, said a senior official of energy department.Across the country, only Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana supply 24-hour power to rural areas. Rural households in nine out of 28 states  Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Mizoram, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh  receive less than 18 hours of power a day.Till recently, urban areas, particularly cities such as Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad and Khammam were attracting new industries due to availability of power and other infrastructure. But as the expenditure of setting up business increased in the urban areas, industrialists have started looking at backward districts."

Unconditional love, an ability to accept uncertainties, and the strength to forget  and forgive, maybe  all that life never made easy.Seventy-three-year-old Minakshi Chattopadhyay has all of that, and much, much more. As the wife of poet Shakti Chattopadhyay, whom she had met in 1965 and married two years later and lived with him till his death in 1995, she has seen and borne it all  the madness and indiscipline of a genius poet, but also the warmth and easy companionship of a husband who she misses every day, even now.When they met in the heady mid-Sixties, Minakshi and Shakti were part of a group for whom evenings meant songs and adda. He was the one to introduce me to so many obscure places in Kolkata, she recalls. I never knew Victoria Memorial had such a good museum inside. He took me to the cemetery of Achi Saheb in Budge Budge. He also gave me a statue of Jesus during our trip to Kumartuli, she reminisces, about their courtship.She was as surprised as everyone else when Shakti announced to the entire world that he would marry her on August 15, 1967. He hadnt talked to me about it. When I confronted him in front of the Gwalior monument at Babughat, he just said it seemed fine, since it was a holiday. When I asked him, What if I dont agree?, pat came the reply: Ganga-e thele phele debo! (Ill push you to the Ganges).Back then, Shakti didnt have a permanent job. They had a ten-and-a-half-year age difference, and his unkempt appearance wouldnt make him a handsome groom. But the bohemian Shakti won, and the couple registered their marriage on August 15.One day, soon after marriage, Shakti stepped out of home, telling Minakshi he was going to buy cigarettes. On the way, he met a friend who was driving to Bhutan. The next thing Minakshi knew, Shakti had hitched a ride to Bhutan. I would initially worry, she says. But his mother was quite relaxed. Indiscipline, I soon realised, was in his blood.Shakti, she says, once announced that he and his friend Samir Sengupta would open a bookshop. Minakshi had quit teaching at South Point school at that time. The plan sounded fine, but for one glitch: Shakti had neither the money nor the space to run a bookshop. He would get Rs 20 for a poem, but he believed he would be able to convince the owner of a studio near Purna cinema to vacate his premises and make room for the bookshop, she says.The idea was highly implausible. Why would a man suddenly give up his studio at the request of someone he didnt even know? But Shakti believed otherwise. One day, he actually went to convince the studio owner. Minakshi stood at a distance, watching Shakti and Samir argue their case. Obviously, the studio owner didnt relent. But that day Minakshi understood that marrying a dreamer would mean more such incidents.It didnt take long for Shaktis outward flamboyance, clubbed with the inner calm of his enduringly mysterious monologues, to turn him into an icon. But that didnt curb his restlessness. Once, a kabuliwalah landed up at their home, since Shakti wanted to start a pistachio and nuts business! On another day, along with author Subhas Mukhopadhyay, he went angling. He promised to come home with fish that I should cook for lunch. While waiting for him, I cooked rice and egg curry. In the afternoon, he returned empty-handed and asked me what was for lunch. When I reminded him of his promise of getting fish, I was told that they had luckily escaped arrest because they had landed up fishing in a prohibited zone, she says.Yet, Minakshi never accuses Shakti of being irresponsible. Even when he left home unannounced, there would be slips tucked around mentioning how much milk he had fed our daughter before leaving. He would stay up at night to apply cold compress if our children ran high temperature or clean up if they puked, she recalls.But dealing with his alcohol habit wasnt easy. It added to Minakshis woes of running a financially unstable household. She would burst out in anger, but her tirade would always be met with silence. He never uttered a word when I shouted, she says. When she left home in anger because of his sudden disappearances, Shakti would write her letters claiming he had left unannounced in search of a job. Minakshi didnt buy those alibis, but she agreed to live with the man who was an iconoclast.Loving and living with a bohemian isnt easy. But Minakshi insists its not an impossibility, when there is trust and dependence. And what is her advice to a girl whos in love with a bohemian? Be friends, but dont get married, she signs off."

We have started the case based on a complaint by a nationalized bank. The searches on Friday have led to recovery of incriminating documents, said a CBI spokesperson .CBIs FIR alleged that the directors had entered into a conspiracy with the empanelled lawyer, the chief manager and deputy manager-level officials. In 2009 and 2014, they availed a cash credit limit of Rs 4.45 crore for a rice mill. After a few months, the company stopped paying interest and the principal amount. The loan turned into an NPA and increased to Rs 4.12 crore.During searches, CBI stumbled upon a similar mode of operation used by the directors while taking loans in the names of another company they had floated. The directors, all residents of Burdwan, had taken a loan of Rs 29.23 crore from the bank to set up a food processing unit. The company eventually acquired a rice mill and funds were diverted. Some time after the acquisition, the company started reporting shortage of working capital. The directors applied for restructuri-ng the loan limi-ts but that didnt help. As the company started defaulting on payments, the bank reported the case to CBI.While probing the case, CBI officials found that a director of the company had gifted the food processing unit to his son while the property was mortgaged to the bank. His son re-mortgaged the same property to a second company and took loans. Eventually he applied for a loan of Rs 4.12 core for the second company.The loan was given to him while ignoring the past records and the new loan turned into an NPA in a similar way."
5b2e59c69855b72640115a1d,Spicing up sweet chocolate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/664106/spicing-up-sweet-chocolate.html,2018-03-11,"The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Limited (Campco), which is well known for bailing arecanut and cocoa farmers out of distress during the price fall many years ago, is embarking on an extensive diversification-cum-expansion drive.The multi-state cooperative society between Karnataka and Kerala is all set to shake up the cashewnut and coconut markets, as part of its expansion programme.Campco was started in 1973 by its founder president Varanasi Subraya Bhat, when there was a sudden marketing crisis in arecanut.Foray into chocolatesCampco set up a chocolate factory for creating market for cocoa, when farmers were in distress in the early 1980s, with help from the Karnataka government and the Centre. The then President of India Giani Zail Singh inaugurated the facility on September 1, 1986.In fact, Campco's chocolate factory at Puttur is South India's only such facility, and the country's second in the cooperative sector. The other chocolate factory belonging to Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited) is in Gujarat.Right from 10 products (chocolate varieties) in 1986, to 23 varieties (including one drinking chocolate) today, Campco has come a long way. In fact, until 1997, all the chocolates available under the Nestle brand were supplied by Campco. Though Nestle opened its firm in 1997 in Goa, Campco continues to supply chocolates (approximately 5,000 tonnes per annum) to the MNC even to this day, says Campco Managing Director MSuresh Bhandary.New flavoursThough the products of Campco were highly affordable with a unique taste, they were not available at malls and high-end stores until two months ago. However, the recent launch of six varieties of premium chocolate (without vegetable fat) are available in many parts of India, including Karnataka, Kerala, Hyderabad, Ghaziabad, Jaipur, Punjab and Kolkata.The newly launched premium chocolates are:Moments - dark chocolate with ginger; Dietier - sugar-free dark chocolate; Milk Marvel - soft and silky milk chocolate; Milk n Milk - with chocolate with rice crispies; Fun Tan - dark chocolate with hint of mint; and Fun Tan - dark chocolate which is slightly bitter.Though each bar costs Rs 100, the gift box (with six pieces) is available for Rs 500, which are available at airports as well as malls, among other places.Besides retail sales, Campco also supplies bulk chocolates to industries, weighing up to 1 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg slabs. ""The industrial supply accounts for about 6,000 tonnes per annum,"" says Bhandary, adding that even Amul buys chocolate butter from Campco.A lesser known fact about Campco is that it supplies chocolates to the Indian Navy at the latter's Mumbai, as well as Visakhapatnam bases. ""They have purchased 23 tonnes of chocolate in the last four months,"" he says.Plans are also on the anvil to market Campco chocolates to the Armed Forces (including the Air Force and Army) and the Indian Railways, and the same is under process, says Bhandary.Currently, the capacity utilisation of the factory is more than 70%. The Campco chocolate factory at Puttur, about 60 kms from Mangaluru in Dakshina Kannada district, has the capacity to produce 23,000 tonnes per annum.Campco's share in retail chocolate market is 7% and it plans to increase the same to 12-15% in the next three years. Mondelez (earlier Cadbury) holds a majority 70% share, followed by Nestle with an estimated 15-16% share, according to Bhandary.Campco stands in the second position as far as industrial chocolates are concerned, with a production of 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes per annum.Out of 20,000 tonnes of cocoa requirement in India, up to 13,000 tonnes is procured from farmers, while the remaining 7,000 tonnes is imported from Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana, among other countries. Out of 13,000 tonnes, about 3,600 tonnes is handled by Campco, while the remaining quantity by other handlers, Bhandary informs.He says that Campco is carrying out extensive R&D to develop more varieties of chocolate with natural ingredients.Capacity expansionEarlier this year, Campco commissioned a new amenity building at its chocolate factory in Puttur that conforms to the international food safety standards and zoning of processing area as per FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) standards, Campco President S R Satishchandra says.Built at a cost of Rs 13 crore, the building is spread over 42,000 sq feet.It has also laid the foundation stone for a master godown for arecanut, pepper and rubber at Kavu in Puttur taluk of the district. To be built at a cost of Rs 19 crore, the godown will have a built-up area of 1 lakh sq feet, and will be completed in 24 months, Satishchandra adds.It is worth mentioning here that 40% of Campco's 1,07,000 members cultivate cocoa along with arecanut in Karnataka as well as Kerala. At the same time, scientists from the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) fromVittal as well as Kasargod educate the growers on cultivation and pruning, besides providing technical guidance.The cooperative had purchased 53,720 metric tonnes of arecanut valued at Rs 1,308 crore, including 23,946 metric tonnes of red variety, valued at Rs 624 crore, and 29,774 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 684 crore, and sold 53,806 MT, valued at Rs 1,362 crore, including 24,890 MTof red variety, valued at Rs 656 crore, and 28,915 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 705 crore.Foray into new areasHitherto, Campco, with a record turnover of Rs 1,600 crore in the financial year 2017, and with a net profit of Rs 26.22 crore, was procuring directly from farmers and selling arecanut, cocoa, pepper and rubber in the states of Karnataka and Kerala.This year the cooperative is all set to enter the FMCG segment by foraying into marketing of coconut oil and cashew nuts that have good demand in the market.""Campco, during its last general body meeting, had proposed amendments to its bylaw, to market cashew, coconut products and FMCG segment, and it would be soon approved from the Central registrar,"" Bhandary says, and added that once it gets approval from the authorities concerned, it would foray into marketing of coconut oil and cashew products.""Plans are on the anvil to develop the brand, and a processing unit may be started within 12 to 15 months,""he hopes.As far as pepper is concerned, half kg packs of pepper under 'Kaala Sona' brand are already produced at Campco's Baikampady unit since the last six months.DH News Service"
5b144e729855b7624637ee44,‘I follow my heart’s calling’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/i-follow-my-hearts-calling/article23231805.ece,2018-03-14,"Playing at the 71st Shriram Shankarlal Music Festival, Debashish Bhattacharya had the audience spellbound. Watching his fingers move deftly over the strings, listeners were enthralled with melody of the chaturangui slide guitar, an instrument he invented. Attributing the magic to his gurus and parents, he modestly remarks, It is all their blessings.We meet for a quick bite before Debashishs concert amidst the green environs of Triveni Terrace Caf. With a quick glance at the menu, he asks for aloo tikki and tea. Nothing like chai to make conversation, riyaz and performance enjoyable, he remarks.A geography graduate from the Calcutta University, Debashish chose an unusual instrument  slide guitar  to master and play Hindustani classical music. The genesis lies in the Hawaiian guitar my father presented me in 1966 when I was three. Plucking it, I was enamoured by its shape and sound, falling in love instantly, he says, sipping tea. The guitar is still with him. You cant ditch your first love, can you, he jests.Coming from a family steeped in musical tradition, Debashish must have been tempted to play other instruments. Yes, I have been attracted to several instruments. I like the melodious sound of sitar and sarod, veenas lower base sound, santoors staccato harmonic natural sound and sarangis pathos-filled soundscape. This enchantment made him learn sitar and sarod from Haradhan Roy Chowdhury and Gokul Nag, a well known sitar player. From them, I picked the technique of plucking with two fingers and manipulation of fingers to produce varied sounds.The vocal training under his mother, Manjushree Bhattacharya of Gwalior gharana and Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya trained in Patiala, helped Debashish hone his skills. He credits his parents for more. They laid the foundation of my life and music. My mother would sing even while cooking and my father would always be with the tanpura during his spare time. All this created a musical ambience at home. Being strict teachers, they wouldnt tolerate half-hearted attempts. On missing a note during practice, my mother hit me with the cooking spud. My father would encourage whenever there was a setback but ensured that awards never got to my head. He would make me rehearse a taan several hours till I got it perfect.Impressing the guruAll this was not in vain as it prepared him for a gruelling 10-year stay with Brij Bhushan Kabra, a slide-guitar pioneer. To be Kabrajis shishya was super tough. During those 10 years I gave no public performance. He did not allow me to write or record during the training sessions, ensuring that everything taught was committed to memory. Further, with him being busy, I could practice with him only from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Never satisfied, he would constantly goad me to do better.With praise and accolade coming rarely, Debashish tried harder and harder. All this made me adept at playing, mentally and emotionally strong. Since, his commendation was rare, I distinctly remember such occasions which were few and far. Once after practising throughout the night, he asked me to play raga Lalit early in the morning. Listening to it intently, he started crying. Waking up my Guru Ma, he asked her to fetch his purse. He fished out Rs. 100 and gave me saying Tune mera dil khush kar diya . That gift is absolutely invaluable.The gurus confidence in him was such that once in a packed auditorium, he asked Debashish to play. Unprepared, I was stumped. But when guru commands, you have to bleed for him. So I played raga Bhimplasi followed by Shree. He didnt say anything to me but told his friends how happy he was.Debashish feels varied arts came naturally to him because he never strained but enjoyed what he did. Believing in variety being essence of life, he was game to try everything which pleased him. Academics apart, he played cricket, badminton and football in school and college, learnt different instruments, watched movies and painted too. Never wanting to be slotted in a mould, I follow my hearts calling. So I painted for three days continuously till I finished the artwork; read voraciously missing my meals; watched four movies in a row; and practised guitar from dusk to dawn.Pointing at the tikki, he adds, The same holds true for my choice of food too. Never stuck on a particular cuisine, I like to taste local food and relish varied dishes  from pongal, idli and medu vada to dal bhatti churma, chingri malai curry and bhapa ilish. Unlike many, he is not averse to street food. How can anyone resist gol gappe, egg chicken roll, fish and chicken tikkas and jhal muri. I never miss eating on the roadside, bread toast with eggs and chai, he reveals with a twinkle in his eyes.So is he excessively fond of varied Indian cuisine? I wouldnt say that. As a musician, I like to listen to Hindustani and Carnatic music as well as Western music. Debashish has collaborated with John McLaughlin, Martin Simpson, Jerry Douglas and Jeff Sipe and several others. Likewise, I am fond of foreign cuisine too. I am partial to French sole with white sauce, Italian pasta with shrimps, cilantro and pesto, Spanish tapas, Mexican burrito and horchata and Chinese sea bass.Quick learningThe hot tikis are laid out on the table. The aroma is alluring. Tasting a slice with a touch of freshly made pudina chutney, Debashish nods his appreciation. The aroma is great and so is the blending of spices. It is neither hot nor bland but perfect in taste. Realising his liking for food, one wondered if he learnt cooking too. My first brush with cooking was in New York when being hungry and unable to find something I like, I called up my mother. Those days ISD charges were Rs. 90 per minute and in three minutes I noted the recipe for fish and egg curry. Rushing down to the 24x7 grocery shop I bought cod fish, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, eggs, onion, potato, aubergine, and mustard oil. I made rice and egg curry and my friend on return was intrigued by the aroma. We enjoyed each and every bit of that meal. So did this passion continue? Yes, I kept learning from my mother and later my wife. For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music. I keep experimenting with food and can make delicious sea bass, a mix of dal and vegetables and sauteed fish and vegetables.Debashishs desire to innovate is not limited to food alone. He is credited with invention of three instruments. Called the Trinity of Guitars these are 24-string Chaturangui, 14-string Gandharvi and four-string Anandi. I was haunted by sounds of sarod, sitar, santoor, veena and vocal rendition of greats like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Vishnu Digambar Paluskar among others. Trying to replicate them on my 16-string slide guitar was not satisfactory. So, I created these three instruments with special wood and string, sound board and by adjusting the height of the bridge and nut.With a life-long commitment to popularise slide-guitar, Debashish has gone beyond inventing. He has established the Universal School of Music in Kolkata, set up a recording company and guitar workshop for research in slide guitars. I have done this with a vision to ensure continuity of slide-guitar.The School teaches a 16-part syllabus designed by him for five years. When I started learning, there was no reference point for me in the sense there were no slide-guitar recordings or performances to guide me. This syllabus helps in overcoming this obstacle, while the recording company and workshop provides avenues for those who want to do pioneering work in the field. His efforts are not limited to training youngsters in Hindustani music alone. I want my students to evolve and develop their own styles in Hindustani, Carnatic, Jazz, Blues and other genres. Being blessed with fine training and upbringing, I want to pass on the legacy.For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music"

Currently, the company retails specific menu seasoning mix Hapima, which is available in fried rice mix-original, hot and spicy and masala.Declining to reveal figures, he said, the consumption of Hapima in India witnessed a 200 per cent increase last year.As part of diversifying the company's products apart from Aji-no-moto, he said, the company was also retailing Blendy-3-in-1 Masala Chai and Coffee for the Indian market.""Blendy can be consumed as an instant coffee by adding a cup of hot water,"" he said.The pre-mix powdered beverages market in India is estimated at 4,100 tonne and is growing at a rate of six per cent, every year, he said.Aji-no-moto currently has about 44,000 outlets in Tamil Nadu and plans to offer Blendy in 22,000 outlets by next year.He said Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has certified Aji-no-moto while US Food and Drug Administration has given MSG as ""generally recognised as safe"".Currently, MSG was widely used in China, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, African markets, he said."

Workers from Jharkhand and Odisha play a hockey match at the Gundumalai tea estate. (Below) Rahil Lomga, a Hindi teacher at a lower primary school in the same tea estate.Thulasi KakkatOn a pleasant Sunday afternoon in the upper reaches of Munnar, on a playfield hidden in the rolling slopes of the Gundumalai tea estate, a game of hockey is in progress. Just beyond the sidelines, standing beside an old cricket pitch roller, six-year-old Lalita Barayudh, still in her school uniform, takes an imaginary slap shot with a crooked twig. She follows the unfolding game with keen interest.The series of weekend hockey matches between plantation workers from Jharkhand and Odisha are played on an improvised pitch marked out with quicklime, often with a goat as a wager. The main organiser is Lalitas father, Lipi Barayudh, a tribal Munda youth from Jharkhands Khunti district. Lipi is the man responsible for bringing nearly 400 labourers from his native State to work in the tea gardens of the Kanan Devan Hills Plantations (KDHP) in Munnar. He is a playmaker in hockey as well, playing on the centre-midfield position.The idyllic scene of a hockey match unfolding in the cool environs of the hills repeats itself every weekend. It also points to the changing profile of workers in Keralas plantation sector, where the receding Tamil labour population is being rapidly replaced by workers from the tribal districts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, besides Muslims from Assam.Train to prosperityKDHP alone has engaged thousands of them, mostly as whole family units, to work as plantation and tea factory workers. For the record, the Gundumalai estate has on its rolls 1,368 workers, including a few migrant workers from eastern India. But the 713-strong temporary workforce is entirely from the migrant community.Its their Persian Gulf, laughs Jeevan Raj, manager of the Gundumalai estate. Deprivation back home, coupled with a dire shortage of blue-collar workers in Kerala, is driving the trend. Unlike the typical labour migration involving young, male footloose labour, Keralas plantation sector  primarily tea, coffee and cardamom estates spread over Idukki, Thrissur and Palakkad districts  has witnessed the relocation of entire families, mostly from the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Muslim communities looking for socio-economic security and mobility. Workers from Jharkhand typically hop on to the Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express and alight at Tiruppur for the onward journey to Munnar in Idukki.The migrant workers at these plantations enjoy a quality of life not available to their counterparts in most other parts of India. Lipi, with a middle school education, was working at a coffee plantation at Yercaud in Tamil Nadu when two of his co-workers left for the greener pastures of Munnar. He followed suit in 2014. His mother is now a permanent worker at KDHP, entitled to 14 days of paid leave and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), besides health care benefits, gratuity, and incentives.Lipis wife, a temporary worker, enjoys the same benefits minus paid leave and LTA. With a robust network in his home town, Lipi started bringing more families to the plantation and acts as a vital link between these workers and the company. You may get higher wages in big cities, but they will still fall far short of your housing, health care, and livelihood requirements. And if an accident at the workplace leaves you incapacitated, you are left to fend for yourself, says Lipi, who takes pride in being able to send Lalita, in Class 2, to a CBSE school. Her schooling costs him about Rs. 40,000 annually.Apart from decent employment, Kerala also holds other charms for Lipi. The hills of Munnar are cool and breezy, with friendly people, he says. In the town, nobody stops you from going to a temple, mosque or church. Our caste doesnt stand in our way.From tea-picker to Hindi teacherThe Lomga couple has more or less the same story to tell. Also from the Munda tribe, Amos Lomga, a matriculate from West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, used to drive a pickup van in Palamau. After seven years, he had nothing to show in the form of savings. Amos and his wife Rahil, a Hindi graduate from Khunti, followed in a relatives footsteps to Kerala. They both found a job and a home in the plantation.Amos and Rahil were both tea pickers when in October, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) engaged the latter to teach Hindi at a lower primary school in the estate. There are about 45 children, and over half are Hindi-speaking. Earlier, just three children of migrant workers from the lower division used to come to school. Now there are seven, and even Tamil children have started communicating in Hindi, says Rahil, as her husband demonstrates his fluency in Tamil. Within the community, they speak Mundari or Sadri (also called Nagpuri). But the multicultural environment has given confidence to their only son, Olive Bikas. The mamas and mamis made us comfortable right from the beginning, says Rahil. They own farmland back home, where rice and pulses are cultivated by Amoss brothers. He says the job has made him fit and a game of hockey transports the community to Jharkhand, where hockey is very popular. We dont want to buy a bike now as the priority is to save up for the boys studies, says Amos.Sunita Devi and her husband, from the OBC Kumhar community, came to work in Munnar last June at the suggestion of her brother-in-law. She has learnt tea leaf picking and the art of manuring the tea plants. Her only grouse is that leafy vegetables are at a premium in these parts.Migrants from the east constitute 80% of the workforce in the Kadukumudi division of the estate. In other divisions, their percentage is at level with that of the locals. Estates are divided area-wise into divisions for administrative purposes. There are Thenmalai, Benmore, Lower, Upper, Kadukumudi and many other divisions constituting the Gundumalai estate.Indira Gandhi, supervisor of the lower division for two years, says shes quite happy with the 50 hardworking migrants who report to her. I communicate with them in Tamil, which they pick up fast. They come to me for anything they need, be it a requirement in the lines [their living quarters in the plantation, typically comprising three to five dwelling units] or for permission to go to the dispensary.Estate doctor Naveen Kumar recalls that initially it was difficult to get the migrants to the dispensary. Even pregnancies would be kept secret till the last term, but things are different now. We have placed emphasis on hygiene, and on ante- and post-natal care to arrest malnutrition. We beat the language barrier by running a visual campaign on the importance of birth control. We have also intervened to curb instances of alcohol abuse and domestic violence, he says.Medical screening at a tertiary care hospital in Devikulam is a mandatory part of the recruitment process for migrant workers, and the State health department has been making frequent visits to the estate to prevent communicable diseases, says Raj. The KDHP covers the expenses for the first two pregnancies up to Rs. 60,000 each, and this has helped underscore the need for birth control.Seamless integrationPremchand and Bamini were tilling the fields in Khunti until three years ago, when they decided to work in Munnar. They have just had a baby and a new bike, bought on cash payment. He believes in one bike per delivery policy, jokes Manimekhalai, a resource person of the SSA in the region. As is the case with many Tamils in the region, Manimekhalais parents still work in the plantations, something the next generation is keen to avoid.Both the sons of Subramaniam, the estate watcher, have sought careers outside of the sector. They do not want to do hard labour as we have done, he says. A native of Tenkasi, Subramaniam hopes to build a house on the three cents of land he owns there, once he and his wife retire from their plantation jobs. Until then, we can stay in the lines. He is happy to be in the company of these workers from Jharkhand and Odisha. Without them, we wouldnt get a break as there would be no one to share the workload. This is also echoed by the caretaker at the crche in the lower division, Arul Jyothi, whose two sons work outside the plantation as lecturer and engineer.Such seamless integration with the local community is perhaps why the migrant workers have been so welcome. The first batch of migrants from these parts, starting with Pithai Munda, who arrived over five years ago and has a child studying in the nearby CBSE school, landed almost empty-handed. The locals provided them warm clothes, took them to the clinic, and helped them settle down until the company took over, issuing them the items needed for daily life. Earlier, they would ask an older kid in the community to look after the infants. But with the governments help, we were able to push almost all the children to school and infants to the crches, where they can have a balanced diet. In fact, the salary of SSA teachers like Rahil is too little compared to what is earned by a worker in the plantation, but the position is empowering. It has helped the community become more aware of the need to educate their children. When the school is on a holiday, Rahil works in the field, says Raj.The real challenge for the government is to address the growing aspirations of the migrant labour community from the Hindi belt. They would need Hindi medium schools and colleges for their wards, Raj adds.Workers like Premchand had slogged in the construction sector in Mumbai before arriving in Munnar. Now Premchand gets to save at least Rs. 10,000 a month in preparation for his childs schooling five years down the line. Over the years, social networking and matrimonial alliances have carried word about these job opportunities from Jharkhand to neighbouring Odisha as well. Subhash Gudia and Maxwell Topno from Sundargarh work in the estate factory and live with four others in a bachelors pad in the line. We encourage families or single men in groups of four or five, says Raj.Muslim families do not get employed in the plantations in Assam, according to Abdul Salam and Mansur Ali, from Udalguri district. In Munnar for a few years, they have also brought in their in-laws and extended family to work in the tea gardens. Its a five-day journey for us and we take the Guwahati-Trivandrum Express. Our women do not get employment even in West Bengal, says Ali. His brother used to work in the plantation before returning to Assam, where he now owns two autorickshaws. The Assamese workers prolonged absence from the plantations has been a thorny issue, says Raj. While some return home for a month or two for no particular reason, some are forced to stay back due to verification requirements of the National Register of Citizens.A win-win phenomenonA recent survey by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) documented the presence of a large number of migrant workers from the tribal districts of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Assam and Bihar in Nedumkandam, Peerumedu, Devikulam and Udumbanchola in Idukki, Mannarkkad and Nelliyampathy in Palakkad, and Malakkappara in Thrissur. Although migrants from distant States are not skilled enough to work in plantations, shortage of labour has been forcing plantation managements to hire them. Plantations tend to hire families as they are less likely to move quickly compared to single men. Because of this, theres a significant number of migrant children in the plantation areas, the study, published in a volume titled Gods Own Workforce , noted.The Economic Survey of the Kerala State Planning Board, published in January, points out that the decadal growth rate of Keralas population, going by the 2011 Census, was 4.9%, the lowest among States, with Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts registering negative population growth rates. Given the situation, the influx of migrant labour from the east presents a win-win for all these States as well as Kerala, says Benoy Peter, executive director of CMID.The tribal districts of these States are marred by inequitable human development and disparities in the sharing of livelihood opportunities. This has forced these people to look towards Kerala, a frontrunner in social development. The Tamil youth who used to fill the labour vacuum have become upwardly mobile. This has paved the way for mobilisation of a captive workforce that could carry out hard labour as demanded by the sector. For the undereducated, less informed youth in the source States, it is a survival strategy. Relatively high wage rates, sustainable job opportunities, a peaceful social environment and less discriminatory treatment, besides access to free health care, education, housing, and socio-economic mobility, are all factors that pull them to Keralas plantations. It is just a matter of time before they become its mainstay, says Peter. In the meantime, their remittances are sure to have a positive impact on the social development of their native States as well. Strong social networks, direct rail connectivity, ease of sending money home, and better communication facilities are all factors catalysing the long-distance migration, he says.But there are challenges too. First and foremost, not every plantation is keen on the social development of the community, and labour exploitation is by no means unknown. Kerala, with its ageing population and changing demography, should gear up for a large-scale social intervention of the kind that it had marshalled in the 1970s and 1980s, because the future of its human development will depend on the pace with which the migrant population catches up with the States present level. It is therefore imperative to have migrant-inclusive development plans, says Peter.R. Pramod, chief inspector of plantations, Kerala, argues that all the workers in the sector, irrespective of their place of origin, are paid wages as fixed by the Plantation Labour Committee. But there is no guarantee that wages and allowances are uniform across the sector, as only those plantations with an area of at least five hectares and employing a minimum of 15 workers are registered with the Chief Inspector of Plantations.Data available with us shows that there are 58,000 workers in 634 estates in Kerala, not counting those working in the more than one lakh minor plantations, Pramod says. There is no separate data on the quantum of migrant labour force in the minor plantation sector. These workers are covered under the relatively new Small Plantation Workers Welfare Fund Board, which is only subscribed by 16,000 workers.Implementation of the States Awas insurance scheme for migrant workers, which guarantees medical care of up to Rs. 15,000 and insurance worth Rs. 2 lakh in case of death by accident, has made slow progress. Only about 2.5 lakh workers out of an estimated population of 30 to 40 lakh have been brought under its ambit so far.As the CMID study concludes, Kerala needs to realise that it needs the migrant labourers more than they need it. Ultimately, the mainstreaming of migrant workers holds the key to successful integration.Their remittances are sure to have a positive impact on the social development of their native States as well.Benoy PeterExecutive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive DevelopmentYou may get higher wages in big cities, but they will still fall far short of your housing, health care, and livelihood requirements.Lipi BarayudhA temporary worker from Jharkhand"

A narrative of north versus south, them versus us, Centre versus states with splices of rationality riveted with rhetoric has come to occupy centre stage.Context crafts the contours of dissent, discord and discourse. The immediate provocation is the change in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, set up to design devolution of funds to states. Population is and has been a determinant of allocation. Hitherto, Finance Commissions used the 1971 data. The 15th FC will use 2011 data. States with lower population assert that they will be shortchanged.On Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan used Facebook and Twitter, no less, to state: Presently, Kerala receives only a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee of tax it contributes to the Union, Tamil Nadus benefit is a mere 40 and Karnataka gets only 47 paisa. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh receives `1.79 for every rupee they contribute. The new move will further aggravate this disparity.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, tagging the CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Puducherry, tweeted: This will further affect the interests of the south: we need to resist. DMK leader M K Stalin charged the Centre with unilateralism and wrote to 10 CMs, including those of the south, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, already in a face-off with the Centre, called out, There is nothing called Centres or States money. It is the taxpayers money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre, but they are diverting the money to the development of the north.Assertions aside, the actuality is that states with smaller populations and lower rates of growth in population could be affected. It is also true that use of data from 1971, when India had 54 crore people, in 2018, when the population is 131 crore, is irrational. Besides, population is only one of the factorsothers, including progress in moving towards a replacement rate of population growth, will deliver compensatory dividends.Political narratives are rarely linear. The southern states have delivered better outcomes and the anger is about the incentive structures and the lack of disincentives. The articulation and the underlying angst is less about who is getting more and more about how states that do less get more.In 1960, the government of India identified the 100 most backward districts. Over 80 of them were from the Hindi heartlandBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Four decades later, a study on the 100 worst districts by this author found that laggards continued to lag. After much was said and done, little had changed. In 2001, a study by N J Kurian found that not a single district from Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh figured among the top 100 districts of India.It is true that the Constitution obliges governments to deliver a minimum level of public goods and services. Ergo population matters. But so does governance. Poor governance is best illustrated by the level of vacancies in the fields of education, health care and security. The largest numbers of teacher vacancies are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The largest number of vacant posts for police personnel is in Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar, the hospital bed to population ratio is one bed per 8,681 persons. Bihar has 40,043 registered allopathic doctors for over 10 crore persons, Uttar Pradesh has 65,343 for over 20 crore people.Governance requires interventions, and some of the most transformative interventions have been in the south. It is, therefore, shocking to find Control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures among the terms of reference of the 15th FC. Fact is what is populist today most often than not becomes policy sooner or later.When M G Ramachandran introduced midday meals in Tamil Nadu in 1982, it was considered populist. It became policy in 1995. The 1983 two-rupee rice scheme of N T Rama Rao led to the National Food Security Act. The 1960s EGS was born south of the Vindhyas in Maharashtra, and became MGNREGS. Amma canteens are now sprouting in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as are fair price medicine shops.The schism is not necessarily geographicit is about performers and non-performe0rs. On October 29, 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the 14th Finance Commission and urged a paradigm shift in the approach. He argued that the Centre share 50 per cent of the divisible pool and that fiscal discipline, revenue collection and contribution to national growth be factored in for allocation. The argument is just as valid in 2018.Article 1 of the Constitution states, India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. This is us. That said, there is no mistaking the discontent bordering on alienation born out of a real and perceived sense of discrimination coloured by social, cultural, religious, political and economic interests. Perception is a high-octane volatile cocktail of facts, fancies, finger-pointing and frailties. Embedded therein are questions that demand dialogue, debate and a dtente of thoughts. To argue that much of it is political is to state the obvious. There is no politics without economics. shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

Nothing survived the inferno that was triggered by a suspected leak in a cooking gas cylinder. But the community-driven effort from neighbouring localities give hope of a better future to the affected men, women and children, most of whom are migrant daily wage earners from Bihar and West Bengal.We never thought we would get so much support. It will take a long time for us to rebuild our lives, but people came to help us within hours, said Vishnu, a native of West Champaran who ran a small tailoring shop in Kanawani near his tenement. Within two hours on Tuesday, Vishnu, had lost his home and the means to rebuild it.After the tragedy struck Kanawani, dozens of residents from the towering high-rises in Indirapuram, the Ghaziabad police, and the municipal corporation came forward to help.SK Jain, a retired officer from IEL, Kanpur, arrived from the Pinnacle Tower nearby with a group of 10 residents and set up a food stall by a burnt tree. We prepared food for nearly 1,000 people and will give them more help in coming time. We are collecting materials and money from residents in our high-rise, Jain said.Members of the federation of association of apartment owners also distributed food packets, water and clothes.From our federation fund, we are trying to get at least 100 durries (floor spreads) from Chandni Chowk. These can be used by families to sleep on as theyre sleeping on the floor, which is basically mud, Alok Kumar, president of the federation, said, adding that they are also collecting items of daily need and getting more aid, in cash and in kind, from residents.The rising heat is also making it difficult for the destitute families who are completely exposed to the elements, and thus more vulnerable to diseases.We used to pay 1,500 to 2,500 as rent for our tenements here. Now, the land owner is refusing to set up shelters again, said Saraswati, who is from Betia in Bihar.Mamta Devi, who rescued her daughters despite being pregnant, pitched four sticks around the space where her house once was and spread a half-burnt saree to create shelter from the sun.Most of the families are trying to cover them from heat this way. I lost my house and also my grocery shop. Luckily my family was saved. If the incident had happened during night, there would have been many casualties, said Subrata Saha, a resident and native of Farukkhabad.Dr Renu Verma, a medical practitioner and social activist from Noida, is among the few who are providing medical aid. Dr Verma, who arrived with a group of volunteers, said, We have come here to assess the needs of the people. We will be sending a team of doctors for medical checkups and to provide medicines. The families have pregnant women. The victims will also need psychological therapy.An ambulance from the nearby Shanti Gopal Hospital was also stationed at the spot as doctors distributed medicines.Some people who suffered minor burn injuries are being treated. Those who have other complications will be treated for free at the hospital. We are trying to arrange for 100 tarpaulin sheets which will give families relief from the scorching heat, said Arun Agarwal, owner of the hospital.Local residents of Kanawani village, too, have come forward to help the affected in their hour of need.Class 10 students Sumit and Rohit skipped school on Tuesday to distribute cooked food and water packets.We have organised a bhandara (community kitchen) and are distributing potatoes, pooris and rice to the affected families. Villagers have pooled in money and we will continue to give them food for a few more days, said Bijender Singh, a resident of Kanawani.Bijenders sister Anita Verma also arrived from Niti Khand with her family and children to help.I specially brought my teenage children to understand what is hardship and that children from well-off families should know their responsibility towards the poor and teach them the spirit of charity, she said.Pradeep Kumar, who lead a group of volunteers from Sewa Bhati, an NGO, cleaned the area. Garbage needs to be cleared. The administration should also come out and help in rehabilitation of the affected people, he said.While the Ghaziabad police pitched in with nearly 200 food packets on Tuesday, municipal commissioner CP Singh sent three teams to clean the area, and address the hygienic issues that may crop up. Kanawani does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation.Stating that the district administration will do everything to help these families, district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari said, As an immediate option, they can be shifted to nearby shelter homes. We will discuss options through which shelter can be provided to the affected families. The administration will continue to help them on humanitarian basis, Maheshwari said."

Anands initiatives have increased efficiency while saving on cost. And as his stint draws to a close, Mr. Anand, in a free-wheeling interview with Syed Mohammed, talks about good governance, the age of consumer activism and what the government should do to be more consumer-friendly. Excerpts:How has IT helped to plug leaks in the department?Information Technology has helped reduce the scope of corruption to a great extent. For a long time, officers had been colluding with rice millers and Fair Price Shops owners. For example, there was delay in farmers getting paid for paddy and it even went up to 30 days to 60 days. The Minimum Support Price of around Rs. 1,400 was not given fully. And when the cheques came, they had to add weight (bribe officials) to get them. In consultation with the Centre for Good Governance, IT initiatives are firmly in place and payments are upfront. Even in remotest areas, payments are getting credited in the farmers bank accounts. Rs. 11 lakh crore was paid so far, 80% of which was within three days.How have you tackled the transporter-dealer-miller nexus?There are 1,400 trucks transporting rice. We installed 1,750 CCTVs in 171 godowns, GPS systems in trucks and geo-fenced routes. Previously, about 20% of rice was not taken by the cardholders. So the equivalent was not unloaded from trucks and sold off later at ports and in other States. The command control centre here and in districts keeps a watch on every vantage point 24x7.The gunny bags re-use seems to be an issue. What is your take on it?Instead of the 38% depreciation charges with each use and their eventual auction, the Centre is saying that there will be charges of Rs. 6.30 per use. Last rabi season, analysis revealed that the problems persisted for years and it continued this season too. Procured paddy was not being taken away. Then we found out that gunny bags from Kolkata had not arrived. There was immense cost and effort. Now, by engaging road transport, we have reduced the effort as the truck brings bags to the PPC (paddy procurement centres) directly. Per bale (500 bags) cost has been reduced from Rs. 1,600 to Rs. 1,050.What are the efforts towards a kerosene-free State?Approximately 65% of the ration card holders have got LPG connections in the State. For the next financial year, the Centres Ujwala scheme will have an allocation of 10 lakh connections for us. We have taken this seriously.Consumer fora functioning is slow and some posts are still vacant. What should be done to bridge this gap?It is best to have a separate Consumer Affairs Department. We made the suggestion in one of the meetings with the Centre and it is recorded in the minutes of the meeting. There has been a sea change in consumer affairs and activism over the years."

So if you feel like exploring how the occasion is celebrated in gods own country, head to the Vishu food festival at GD Blocks Kurry n Kebab.Onam and Vishu are the most important festivals of the state, says Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab. And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis. Lets see what happens this time, smiles Menon."

Its his love for adventure that gave him the courage to fight all odds to complete the treacherous journey, says Das.It turned out to be a life-changing moment for Das, when Indrani Chakraborty, a television producer from Naktala, hailed his rickshaw in 2014. During the short journey, she learnt that Das was planning to leave for Ladakh soon. He fished out old pictures of him visiting Puri and some places in north India on his rickshaw and showed it to her. At that moment, Indrani decided to shoot his journey to Ladakh and turn it into a film.I didnt have the money to follow Satyen Das on his entire journey to Ladakh, so taught him to shoot on a handycam. It was tough when the handycam stopped working after he crossed Benaras and someone from my team had to rush to where he was and get it repaired. Two of my associates and I met him on the final leg of his trip in Ladakh, says Indrani.Das credits Indrani for helping him in completing the journey and doesnt forget to thank some of his regular passengers and members of Naktala Agrani Sangha , a club in his neighbourhood.I drove my wife and daughter to Puri and north India and was inspired to take my rickshaw to Khardung La mountain pass, the worlds highest motorable road, 39 km Leh. I got help from Indranidi, a few of my passengers and members of Naktala Agrani Sangha. There were many challenges; every day, someone or the other would ask me to return to Kolkata. You can go till Srinagar, not beyond, they told me. But I didnt budge, recalls Das.For Das, food was as big an issue as the lack of oxygen and the inclement weather. I carried basic ingredients like rice and potatoes. I would either have aloo chokha-bhaat or instant noodles; it was more of a fight for survival, he says.But the toughest part of his journey came when he reached Zoji La pass. The roads were rough and there was no way that I could carry my belongings on the rickshaw and cover the 8-km stretch. I would offload everything on the road drive the rickshaw for a few metres and return to carry the things on my shoulder. It took an entire day to cross that stretch, but I didnt stop. I wanted to create a record of sorts by reaching Khardung La.Das, who shot his journey on a handycam, was joined by a three-member camera team in Ladakh. From thereon, there was no looking back. I returned to Ladakh again in 2017, this time with the message of fighting global warming. I sprinkled 5,000 date seeds along the way.His rickshaw has been put on display at the university campus set up by Sonam Wangchuk in Ladakh. Indrani, who helmed the documentary film, said even though the journey took two-and-a-half years to complete, it took her three years to finish this 64-minute film. She approached Films Division, which has taken the project under its wing."

Considered the biggest open-air eatery in the world where devotees jostle for Mahaprasad every day, the place, however, appeared lifeless on the day.The stalls that sell Mahaprasad and dry prasad were found covered with polythene sheets, while some priests could be seen persuading devotees for dakhina citing that donations on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya can bring them good fortune.Baisi Pahacha, the 22 steps which connect the Lions Gate of the temple to the main premises, was however crowded for sometime as devotees struggled to get khichidi that was being served by a group of servitors.For the last three days, Mahaprasad has not been prepared after a rift between Suar Mahasuar Nijog and the temple administration over unsold Abadha after delay in rituals of the Trinity - Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra on April 16.The body of cooks, which has the sole right of preparing Mahaprasad in the 12th century shrine, demanded a `50 lakh compensation as the unsold Abadha had to be buried as per the tradition.This is perhaps for the first time that devotees were denied Abadha on Akshaya Tritiya which is believed to be one of the most auspicious days in the Hindu calendar. The day also marks beginning of agriculture season and construction of chariots for Rath Yatra.I visit Jagannath temple at least once a month but never experienced such a situation. Whenever I visit the temple, I take plenty of Mahaprasad packed for my family members back home. For the first time, I am returning empty-handed. No one is above the Lord and the law. Whoever is responsible must be dealt with iron hands, said Bhubanananda Sahu, a resident of Patia in Bhubaneswar.Devotees from as far as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, who had come to witness the rituals, were left disheartened too.This is my first visit to Puri and I feel unlucky to have missed out on Abadha. I will stay back for one more day, said Sambhunath Jha, a devotee from Rajasthan. Earlier in 2015 and 2011, a cease work agitation by the cooks had deprived Mahaprasad to devotees. Around 600 cooks prepare Mahaprasad for about 10,000 pilgrims everyday and on special occasions, the number touches one lakh. Nearly 20 quintals of rice and 10 quintals of dal besides other vegetables are used to cook the Mahaprasad daily."

Four persons in the vehicle, two of them on the loading deck, were injured when they were thrown off. The spilled oil turned the road slippery, forcing traffic to be suspended for more than three hours.The incident happened around 10pm when the truck was heading towards a Kidderpore market from the Burrabazar area.In order to check vehicles from over speeding  especially at night when there are fewer policemen on the road  Kolkata Police places guardrails with wheels next to each other, but not parallel. Vehicles have to slow down and turn cautiously to pass through the gap without hitting the structures.This particular truck, however, was speeding and while attempting to turn through the small gap between the guardrails  about 10m  the driver lost control and the truck fell on its left, said an officer of Maidan police station.Police took the four injured persons  Swapan Chandra Bag , 40, Debasish Pattanaik, 42, Biswanath Betal , 42, and driver Sarman Ram , 50  to SSKM Hospital with injuries on the head, limbs and face.But none was critically hurt and were discharged on Friday, an officer said.When the truck fell, tins carrying mustard oil leaked and spilled over on the road. The oil mixed with diesel and engine oil trickling from the vehicle and turned the area into a mess and many rescuers slipped while trying to help the victims.The area had become so slippery, that it was impossible for vehicles to ply on the road. A crane was brought in, but even that could not operate because of the road surface was too oily, said the officer.The cops then suspended traffic on that portion of the road. They sprayed water on the road and then sprinkled sand on the road surface to reduce the grease. Finally, after over three hours, cops managed to pull up the truck and tow it away. Normal traffic movement along the road started only after the surface was declared fit for vehicular movement."

Not true, if Chef Manish Mehrotra is anywhere around. Give him some crispy golgappa puffs, some flavoured water, and he will turn them into haute cuisine.Yet, whats great about the chef is that he doesnt play around with the original taste or flavours. He gives you a dish as it is  but presents it in such a way that it opens your eyes. And your mouth, of course!I had a very nice evening at Indian Accent, now at The Lodhi, trying out some of the chefs special creations. The occasion was a promotion of New South Wales, so quite a few of the ingredients came from Australia. And the food was served with the wine from the region, which is giving a tough competition to established wines from other parts of the world.To get back to the phuchkas, as the golgappa is known in Bengal, the chef serves it atop tiny glasses filled with different kinds of flavoured water  tempered with mint, tamarind, pineapple, pomegranate and yoghurt. There is a masala couscous chickpea mix in the phuchka. You fill it with the flavoured water and pop it into the mouth. Tastes like phuchka that you may have eaten in Kolkata  but looks like an artists installation.The dinner, attended by New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian, sought to highlight the use of Australian-grown ingredients in Indian cuisine. Some of the ingredients included Australian lamb and seafood. And there were dishes such as slow cooked lamb with fenugreek, rice-crusted Australian John Dory and baked Australian barramundi.Chef Mehrotras expertise also lies in presenting food  so each dish was delightful to look at, too. The wonderfully sweet-tart-and-salty nimbu pani sorbet, for instance, came in a small pressure-cooker. The Australian lamb cornet was a succulent dish of pulled lamb in a crispy cornet. The spices were just right, and I liked the way the crunchy cornet (baked with refined flour and butter) complemented the juicy pieces of lamb.I enjoyed the baked barramundi, too. The fish came with small boondis flavoured with mint and Amritsari masala butter. The Australian John Dory was excellent, crispy from the outside and moist within.The two regions did a nice tango with the rice  crusted fish dish which was served with a bean foogath and coconut curry. Likewise, the slow cooked lamb with fenugreek came with a small potato chilla, which added both texture and taste  and a surprise twist  to the lamb dish.The dessert  Aamras summer berries and bitter chocolate  was superb. Beautiful to look at, moulded in bright yellow, with bits of red, green, brown and white, it was a delicious dessert with just the right sweet and tart mix and medley of flavours.It was a pleasant evening, with a bit of the old and the new. The old favourites were there, as were some new surprises. The chef says the new dishes would be a part of the menu if there is a regular supply of the ingredients from Australia.As I often say, keep the borders open."

(Representational Image) The price of petrol, pegged at Rs 82.48 a litre in Mumbai on Tuesday, has seen an increase for the past two months. (Representational Image)IN THE wake of rising diesel cost, goods transport associations have complained that it has increased the operation cost of ferrying goods. Representatives of associations said they might have to increase the cost of items supplied if they start incurring losses in transactions.On Tuesday, diesel prices in Mumbai were pegged at Rs 70.20 a litre. In the past two months, the price has increased by Rs 10 per litre, compared to the base fare of Rs 60, which transport associations said is affecting their businesses. Prices of supplies, however, have not been revised in a big way in the past two months, they said.Diesel constitutes almost 50 per cent of our direct cost and any hike in diesel prices will increase our costing. Since we are already working on meagre margins, we will be put to heavy losses if we do not pass the hike on to our customers. This will definitely impact the aam aadmi as costs of all items, including milk, fruits, vegetables, rice and wheat will go up, resulting in higher inflation, Ashok Goyal, a committee member of the Bombay Goods Transport Association and MD of BLR Logistiks company, that owns over 400 trucks.In Mumbai, the price of diesel is more than what it costs in other cities. The fuel costs Rs 67.05 per litre in Bengaluru, in New Delhi, it costs Rs 65.75, in Bhopal, the price is Rs 69.38 a litre. In Kolkata, it costs Rs 68.63 per litre.The government should reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel, thereby earning a lower revenue but at least easing some burden on the consumers. There should be revision of diesel and petrol prices, quarterly. The government must also look to bring petroleum products under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) ambit, Malkit Singh, the chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress, said.The price of petrol, pegged at Rs 82.48 a litre in Mumbai on Tuesday, has seen an increase for the past two months.Petrol associations agrees that the fuel must be brought under the GSTs ambit. Bringing petrol under GST will regulate the costs, putting a cap on its maximum prices. As commuters are increasingly affected by fuel costs, delay in its regulation will generate negative responses towards the government, Venkat Rao, the president of Mumbai Petrol Dealers Association, said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here. Will Ramesh Kumar break the sequenced and humble Reddy again is the question that is being hotly debated in the constituency."

The convoy on Thursday morning took break at Fetri near Gorewada in order to protect the elephants from scorching sun, drawing curious onlookers to the spot.The trucks carrying elephants had stopped at Gorewada for feeding, bathing and health check-up. We are taking them for rhino monitoring and patrolling. They will also be helpful for tackling man-animal conflict. We have 13 elephants at Dudhwa camps, said Mahavir Koujalagi, deputy director, Dudhwa, who is leading the group.To restore number of elephants in the camps, Karnataka has come to our rescue by gifting these elephants. The job becomes tougher in Terai region during rainy season when forest is dense, says Koujalagi.He along with one ACF, three foresters, one RFO and three vets, besides 60 others including transporters, drivers, mahouts, caretakers, and labourers are taking care of the tuskers during transit.Apart from trucks carrying the elephants, there are three cars and a jeep for vets and motor pump to draw water. There are water tanks of 200 litres in the truck from which they can drink water. Two trucks carry feed like water melons, sugarcane, green grass, coconuts, and jaggery etc.WWF-Indias senior project manager Ajinkya Bhatkar was present at the spot and coordinated teams visit with the help of Gorewada officials. As per request by UP PCCF (wildlife) SK Upadhyay, our field formations have been coordinating with the convoy throughout the tour. We got water tankers at Fetri and water melons to avoid dehydration to animals, said Bhatkar.The convoy started on April 29 from Karnataka with four elephants from Shimoga and seven from Mysore. It took four days to reach Nagpur passing through Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. It will take another week to reach Dudhwa, says Koujalagi.As there is no shade in Gorewada, we took shelter under trees near Fetri. It is a tough exercise. We bagged the contract to shift the animals. So far, we have shifted 50 odd elephants to places in MP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, said Mohammed Rafi, the transporter.Our biggest problem is not feeding elephants or transporting them but food for around 30 men from Karnataka, who want rice and in Maharashtra and MP, roti-sabji is the staple diet, adds Rafi. Breakfast for all costs around Rs8,000, lunch and dinner even more.This is a classic example of interstate coordination. We have failed to shift elephants from Gadchiroli to Pench to create a permanent rescue unit but UP is transporting elephants all the way from Karnataka by spending lakhs of rupees, said local wildlife lovers."

But on Friday, most MMiCs and mayor Sovan Chatterjee opted for a strict vegetarian fare. The civic bosses could not seem to trust even reputable restaurants, which usually supplied delicacies to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters, owing to the scare about the quality of meat being sold after the carcass scam came to the fore.As food packets from a popular restaurant were served during Fridays MiC meeting, mayor Chatterjee took a peek into a veg sandwich but set it aside, suspecting some chicken pieces in it. Following in his footsteps, a couple of MMiCs, too, decided not to touch the sandwich. But veteran MMiC Ram Pyare Ram took a bite after carefully studying the sandwich and its content. A few other followed suit. But most othersMMiCs and senior officialschose the safe option of having veg-fried rice and chilli paneer. MMiC Atin Ghosh, who had just finished a raid on eateries at Alipore and Kidderpore, did not even touch the food packet. He had lassi instead. A KMC official conceded such a scare among the civic officials was unprecedented.During the inspection on eateries at Alipore and Kidderpore, Ghosh and his team collected 15 meat samples and destroyed large quantities for being either stale or the presence of spurious food colour in them. Food inspectors also collected samples from a restaurant inside Alipore zoo.But questions are being raised on the manner the Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporations have been conducting their drives against contaminated meat and destroying chicken and fish from restaurants on suspicion of being stale. The seized meats were sent to the Belgachia dumping ground. Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty claimed that the civic body had no space to keep those samples and so, had to destroy the entire amounts.Chakraborty also pointed out that they would install CCTV cameras at the dumping ground and tighten security there."

The idea was to discuss a plan that one of them had, to bounce it off among the other three. Fortunately, they were very excited at the idea... and thus started their project to feed Kolkata.It started as one ATM to ladle out free food to the hungry. In a period of just nine months, its gone up to three ATMS. And, if things go according to plan, therell be two more before Puja this year.Together, the three Food ATMs, as the project is being lovingly called, feed at least 2,000 people each day. The first one came up on the EM Bypass at Uttarpanchanna Gram, the second opposite Ladies Park on CIT Road, and the third one inside Ramleela Maidan off Moulali. The fourth is supposed to come up at Bhowanipore, near Chakraberia, and then a fifth near the 8B bus stand at Jadavpur.Restaurateur Asif Ahmed and his three entrepreneur friends Prakash Nahata, Rahul Agarwal and Nirmal Bajaj decided to start their endeavour as a sort of experiment by connecting with clubs that organise Puja. With the first letters of their names they formed Pran, a group to fight for a hunger-free Kolkata. Almost every club cooks and feeds bhog on all four days of Puja. We requested them to cook some extra bhog, so that we could distribute it among pavement-dwellers, Ahmed says. We were able to convince 15 clubs, and they gave us immense quantities of food, which we were able to distribute among hungry pavement-dwellers. The gratitude and satisfaction we saw on those poor faces was the incentive that sowed the seeds of the Food ATM project.Ahmed first turned his attention towards the food that his restaurant was left with at the end of each day. At his Uttar Panchannagram outlet, he got his workers to cool, pack and refrigerate the food, so that it could be distributed. His friends got a real estate company to donate a specially designed refrigerator, kept outside his restaurant, packed with food. Twice a day, the food was distributed to the needy. We started on August 15, 2017 to emphasize the freedom factor. What is the value of freedom unless we are able to give freedom from hunger to everyone in the city? Ahmed says.Bengali New Years Day was celebrated on April 15 a little differently at the Ramleela Maidan. Members of the Entally Yuvak Brinda joined hands with Pran to start the citys third food ATM. A special room was built beside the park, where the refrigerator is kept stocked with food, water and cold drinks, to be distributed among the homeless twice each day. At least 10 restaurants in the vicinity have been sending their packed excess food to the food ATM. We just had to visit the restaurant owners and tell them about our intent, and they readily agreed. If the city restaurants stop wasting their leftover food and refrigerate it, we will be able to eradicate hunger completely, says Jami Siddique, the clubs secretary.Most restaurants have to throw away the food even after feeding their staff, as they do not have extra refrigeration facilities and also because they cannot serve it to customers the next day. They just needed an organised, hygienic and efficient collection and distribution system, which is why the idea of the food-ATM seemed so appealing to the donors. Once in a while, restaurants also give away cold drink bottles, which we gratefully accept, says Sujoy Banerjee, a member of the clubs Food ATM organising committee. Members are now going a step further and approaching households in the area, telling them not to waste food but to pack it up neatly and call a helpline number that the club has set up, so that it can be collected from their doorsteps. Even one small container of rice and a little dal or dry sabzi, which is what we are able to collect from most households, is enough lunch for a hungry mouth, Siddique says.You have to be present at Ramleela Maidan around 1pm or 9pm any given day to see how the distribution is done and to see how happily the recipients  especially the kids  are, leaving with the food packets. Khub bhalo khabar... we even get pieces of chicken, fish or eggs at times, says Monua Patra, a 70-year-old woman who comes with her grandchildren for the food every day. We share the food amongst us. God bless these good men, she says.Perhaps the most popular of all the food ATMs is the one opposite Ladies Park on CIT Road. At this ATM, we are not only getting food from restaurants, but also get excess food and cakes from birthday parties, wedding halls and party organisers, says Surjya Kanta Haldar, the points person for this ATM.This ATM is also getting a lot of donations from schoolchildren of Don Bosco Park Circus and Mahadevi Birla Girls HS School, who keep chocolate, juices and cakes on their birthdays. These happen quite often nowadays and we are able to happily distribute the goodies among the needy kids, Haldar says.Both in Bhowanipore and Jadavpur, Pran is in the last stages of discussion about starting the ATMs. The refrigerators come free from the real estate group in accordance with the agreement with Pran. The real challenge is that the club members need to network with local restaurants and in the neighbourhood to get a steady chain of donors, Ahmed adds.At each partner restaurant, efforts are on to educate patrons about the initiative so that after they have eaten what they need, they can ask waiters to pack up the leftovers. Needless to say, the idea has clicked."

As the director of Indore Zoo , Dr Uttam Yadav , maintains, The animals need special treatment to battle the rising temperature. They are already away from their natural habitat where they use their instincts and natural topography to keep themselves cool. Indore is more of a concrete jungle, so it becomes imperative to create a cool environment for the animals during summer. Even birds, that are most susceptible to rising temperatures, are getting vitamin supplements to keep their energy levels high. In their natural process of life, birds migrate to colder places to maintain their body temperatures. But special care and artificial cooling becomes important for birds in captivity, shares ornithologist Mohammad Khaliq.In order to retain the body fluid levels, the zookeepers are making sure they feed the animals with various fruits. The diet during summers is full of juicy fruits like watermelons, cucumbers and mangoes. For birds we add essential vitamins to their regular feed in order to meet their nutritional requirements, explains Nihar Parulekar , zoo curator and educational officer. He adds that fruits and vegetables that have more water and vitamin content keep the digestive tract of the animals cool. The big cats too have been getting controlled portions of meat to keep them healthy through the summer. Some zoos in other parts of the country have been introducing curd rice for some animals to help with their digestion. When enquired about the same, Nihar informs, While curd has some real benefits to humans during this season, it is not a natural occurring food for the wild animals. Though the animals have been reared in captivity, it is not advisable to change their food habits.To maintain an optimum body temperature of the animals, cage keepers work tirelessly right from 8 am to 5 pm giving the bigger animals regular showers and putting out coolers and sprinklers for others. In the morning, cooling baths are given to the tigers (Lucky, Adam and Jamuna) and the elephants (Moti and Laxmi). The bears (Krishna, Prabha, Gajni and Chotu) like to splash around in their shelters where water barrels are kept, shares a cage keeper. Besides the regular baths, khus screens have been set up around all shelters which are regularly sprinkled with water throughout the day to keep the areas cool. Khus screens are natural coolers and also give out a pleasant dewy fragrance that reminds one of everything green. The bigger animals are provided with coolers in addition to all this, owing to their body size and fat percentage, shares Parulekar. Chimps and deer, on the other hand, get a green cover to imitate their natural habitat. The zoo authorities add more plants by March to their shelters for this.Besides regulating the diet and creating a cool environment, the zoo authorities also take adequate precautions in order to avoid any instances of heatstroke. Since these animals are residing in the heart of city, we make sure to take precautionary measures during peak summer. We add Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) in a prescribed quantity to their water bowls, to keep them sufficiently hydrated. Similarly, cage keepers give a report every three hours on the status of the animals. Reptiles are very vulnerable during the season and they are closely monitored. If any animal shows signs of suffering a heatstroke, it is immediately shifted to the zoo hospital and kept in an air-conditioned area for recuperation under supervision of certified vets, informs Yadav. Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal has spread out hessian cloth rugs in shelters and sprinkles have been installed for animals.- At Kolkatas Alipore Zoo, animals are being given a special diet of summer fruits, bananas, sugarcane leaves and curd rice to beat the heat.- Special water coolers and pools have been put in place for the animals to cool off at Vishakhapatnam Zoo.- Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad has set up special foggers, rain guns and exhaust fans in their nocturnal section to keep owls, mongoose and bats hydrated."

The play being performed at a theatre in Kolkata.A play written by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, highlighting her governments development initiatives and taking a dig at opposition parties, is now a key part of the Trinamool Congresss campaign in villages in the run-up to the panchayat polls. Around a hundred folk theatre and street theatre groups are performing hundreds of shows in rural Bengal at public meetings and street corners as the polling day draws close.The entire initiative is being overseen by Bratya Basu, theatre personality and the state IT Minister, according to people involved in the project. Avi Chakraborty, who directed the play, titled Jayatu (victorious), said, Bratya Basu gave us the script a week ago. We did rehearsals and then a show, which was videographed. Around a hundred street theatre and folk theatre groups have been chosen (to perform it in different parts of the state). Wehave sent them the CD, which is a kind of guideline for enacting it.Chakraborty said theatre reaches out to people in a more stirring manner than political speeches. A live street theatre or a drama on stage is more appealing to the people, he maintained.Chakraborty, part of Ashoknagar Nattyamukh, a theatre group, said, The play has been kept at 15 minutes and is part of campaign for the panchayat polls. Basu could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Having eight rural characters, Jayatus central theme revolves around development initiatives undertaken by the Banerjee government since 2011. It has songs and poems, narrated by the characters, highlighting initiatives such as Kanyashree (Bengal governments programme for the girl child), Jubashree (programme for the youth), Rupashree (initiative for marriage of young women).Among other government initiatives, it also takes up distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg, free bicycles to schoolchildren, establishment of new colleges and universities in the state.The dialogue speaks about initiatives for minority development such as scholarships for students, stipends for imams, among others.The play takes a dig at the Opposition, mainly Lal Party  or the CPI(M)  and calls the BJP (the party is also called Bharat Jalao Party and Manush Jalao Party in the play) a divisive force. Theatre groups are adapting tunes for the song in the play according to local folk song flavours and traditions.One of the characters highlights the purported danger emerging from a party that wants to divide people on religious lines, indicating the BJP. This is the same party which withdrew all currency, and created trouble for all of us one of the characters says, indicating the demonetisation drive of November 2016. The play speaks about armed rallies during Ram Navami and divisive forces trying to find their feet in Bengal.One character in the play, named Chetri, purportedly representing the Darjeeling Hills, highlights how Banerjee solved the months-long problem in the Hills by travelling there on several occasions to bring peace. Sidhartha Kishore Roy Bhandari, head of the theatre group Kisholoy Natya Sanastha, which has been roped in to cover West Midnapore district, said, We have performed at 25 places in the last three days. We have adopted the tune of Jhumur dance (traditional dance of Purulia) for the main song. We are holding shows at street corners and large public meetings were ministers and party leaders address the people, and also (organising) independent shows.Recalling a show they did in Debra, in Kharagpur subdivision of the district, at 11 on Tuesday night, Bhandari said, The response from the people is tremendous. Representatives in the theatre groups said they hold shows from 8 am to 11 am and then 5 pm to 11 pm in an effort to avoid the afternoon heat. Each group is paid Rs 1,500 per show, and according to people participating in the campaign there is much demand for such plays in the states rural areas.So many requests from villagers and local party leaders are pouring in to perform in their areas. We are trying our best to get some time out and visit most place, Bhandari said. The best about theatre is that we the response from the crowd is immediateit is good.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

The Kolkata Gate comes to our rescue too.We have about 100 civic volunteers in New Town and send them water, glucose and ORS round the clock. We also ask them to take turns and not stand in the sun for more than 20 minutes at a go.Ive also seen numerous pedestrians get heat strokes. Just the other day, we rushed one such man to Ohio Hospital.I travel by bike and tie a wet handkerchief around my face. Still I get blisters on my skin and wrists due to the heat.

5b13b1659855b76246379901,Carbon Stock Loss in Mangrove Forests: India Ranks 8th,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/carbon-stock-loss-in-mangrove-forests-india-ranks-8th/story-EdtMDyKDKg1ZoofOiuMUSO.html,2018-05-13,"Mangrove forest destruction caused as much as 122 million tonnes of carbon to be released to the atmosphere globally between 2000 and 2015. As a result of 3,957 hectares of mangroves being deforested between 2000 and 2015, India ranked eighth worldwide for the amount of carbon stock loss.However, since India has been effective in its efforts to curtail mangrove deforestation, it is also among the top 20 for the amount of soil carbon storage in mangrove forests globally.Carbon stock refers to the amount of carbon stored in the forest ecosystem. It helps mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases, which lead to global warming and climate change. Soil carbon  the amount of carbon stored in soil  is the basis of fertility.A study by USA-based think tank Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), used satellite (30-meter resolution) remote sensing data to estimate soil carbon emissions.Our analysis revealed that soil carbon stored in mangrove forests across the world holds more than 6.4 billion tonnes of carbon globally, which is about 4.5 times the amount of carbon emitted by the US economy in one year, said Jon Sanderman, lead author of the study and associate scientist at WHRC.According to the India State of Forest Report 2017 compiled by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), mangrove cover in India was calculated at 4,92,100 hectares, which 0.15% of the countrys geographical area. FSI estimated soil carbon stock for mangrove forests in India to be 3,979 million tonnes. Overall, carbon stock from all forests in India is 7,082 million tonnes.Loss of soil carbon depends on how the land is used. Sanderman said, Deforestation due to wood harvesting or conversion to rice will results in much lower losses of the soil carbon than conversion to shrimp aquaculture or draining, filling for urban development.In India, the study found that soil carbon storage in mangrove forests varied dramatically depending upon location.The Sundarbans in West Bengal have very low soil carbon stocks primarily due to the fact that there is high sediment input from the Ganges River system. A similar system is observed along the west coast of India. Whereas, mangroves down the coast in Tamil Nadu, such as the Pichavaram mangroves, contain almost four times as much carbon in a given hectare of forest due to low sediment deposition, said Sanderman."

(Clockwise from top) Phool Kumari Das, whose husband Anil Das died of arsenic-related cancer, holds their family photos in Madhusudankati village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal; Students of class one in Madhusudankati's primary school; Monotosh Biswas, a 65-year-old farmer, has been suffering from arsenicosis for over two decades.K.R. DEEPAKOn a Thursday morning at the government primary school in Madhusudankati, a village in West Bengals North 24 Parganas district, a gaggle of five-year-olds chatter animatedly in a classroom. A teacher walks in. They stand up and chant Good morning, teacher in a high-pitched sing-song. There is momentary quiet, and the rustle of textbooks being opened, but the giggling and chattering return soon. Its a school scene that is as ordinary as it gets, but behind its normalcy lies a disturbing fact: the bodies of these children contain alarming levels of arsenic  a poisonous metalloid that sickens and kills with chronic exposure. Unlike the adults in Madhusudankati though, the children dont show any symptoms yet.Madhusudankati is a lush green agricultural village about 14 km from the border with Bangladesh and deep inside Indias arsenic territory. About 15 years ago, scientists discovered that the shallow groundwater here had high levels of the mineral: up to 1,000 micrograms (mcg) per litre in places. The World Health Organisations (WHO) prescribed safe level is 10 mcg per litre. When such water is consumed for years, either directly or through the food chain, the mineral damages organs like the skin, kidneys and lungs.The most visible symptom in early years is a classic blotchy pattern on the skin, a condition called raindrop pigmentation. If people showing such pigmentation dont switch to safer water, they develop hyperkeratosis  dark crusts on their palms and soles, which can get infected and make it painful to work. Eventually, the skin can turn cancerous. Simultaneously, arsenic can destroy the kidneys and liver tissue, cause conjunctivitis and affect the lungs, just as heavy smoking does. There are few organs that arsenic spares.Mass poisoningToday, an estimated 10 million people in nine districts in West Bengal drink arsenic-laden groundwater. It is the worst worldwide case of mass poisoning alongside Bangladesh, which has 40 million people at risk. When West Bengals problem first attracted international attention in 1995, a researcher from the University of Colorado compared its scale with the Chernobyl disaster. Today, we know it is worse. But despite the grave warnings from international bodies like the WHO, the West Bengal government has moved excruciatingly slowly to tackle the crisis. A critical shortcoming in its efforts was the delay in realising that mitigation is a sociological challenge, not just a technological one. This is why, even though multiple technologies to filter arsenic from groundwater are there, awareness of arsenics ill-effects remains low. So, people continue drinking toxic water, even when alternatives exist.Madhusudankati is an example of this. In 2013, a farmers cooperative society, the Madhusudankati Samabay Krishi Unnayan Samity (MSKUS), installed a water treatment plant in the village with help from the Sulabh International Social Service Organisation. Today, the plant supplies treated water from a local pond to 500 families and the primary school. However, studies show that despite the availability of MSKUS water, several people continue drinking contaminated groundwater.In August 2017, a team led by Tarit Roychowdhury, an Associate Professor at the School of Environmental Studies (SOES) in Kolkatas Jadavpur University, collected urine, nail and hair samples from the children in Madhusudankatis primary school. By then, the school had stopped using water from its contaminated tube well for drinking and cooking midday meals, switching to MSKUS water instead. Several village families had done the same.Yet, Roychowdhurys team found between 20 and 200 mcg per litre of arsenic in the childrens urine, a sign that they were still consuming the poison. This means the children are still drinking polluted water at their homes or somewhere else, says Roychowdhury.Outwardly, the children seem symptom-free. Arsenic is a silent killer; it takes years for keratosis to show in adults and even longer in children. But there is extensive evidence that children are not immune to internal damage  their lungs, kidneys and other organs are slowly being ravaged. Studies also show that arsenic-exposed children have lower IQ compared to control groups. If they continue drinking this water, they will definitely develop keratosis, says Roychowdhury.Years of neglectIn 1983, a doctor called Kshitij Chandra Saha from the West Bengal Health Services began examining a cluster of patients with skin lesions in the formerly undivided 24 Parganas district. Saha diagnosed them with arsenicosis, the first record of the illness in the Indian subcontinent. In the following years, Saha and epidemiologist Dipankar Chakraborti, the founder of SOES, surveyed more villages. It dawned upon them that they were uncovering a massive epidemic. By 1988, six arsenic-affected districts had been identified along the eastern border of West Bengal. The source of the toxin seemed to be the thousands of shallow tube wells that dotted the region. But there was confusion about why the arsenic was there  some suggested that the metal strainers in the tube wells were leaching the mineral, some thought pesticides were the culprit, and some others thought arsenic-treated electric poles were at fault.The researchers sounded the alarm. They warned the government that people would grow sicker unless they switched immediately to safe water. But the governments first reaction was denial, Chakraborti noted in a paper published in the journal Talanta in 2002. It was a theme that continued for years. The government did appoint committees in 1983, 88, 92 and 93 to examine the problem, but the findings didnt trigger substantial action. Presciently, a member of the 93 committee even resigned, saying schoolchildren were continuing to drink contaminated water because the government wasnt digging alternative tube wells. Over a decade later, researchers are still reporting the consumption of contaminated water by schoolchildren in districts like Malda.After denial in the initial years came some questionable decisions by the government. Even though the State had tested 1,32,267 tube wells for contamination by 2007, the polluted wells werent marked. Instead, the government dug alternative tube wells in some spots and installed filters in some others. Several experts, and the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), advocated that unsafe tube wells immediately be painted red, so that people would avoid them. But there was strong resistance to the idea from the government, says Kumar Jyoti Nath, the chairman of West Bengals Arsenic Task Force, an advisory body. We told them again and again that the scientific truth must be shared with the public. But they said it would create panic, Nath says.UNICEF consultants, SOES, and Nath were also of the opinion that public outreach ought to be the foundation of the governments mitigation strategy. This would mean not just painting wells, but also holding door-to-door campaigns, conducting street plays and distributing flyers about the danger of using contaminated tube wells. Unless this happened, patients would not go to government-run arsenic clinics or switch to safe tube wells. But this did not happen on a large enough scale.Such outreach campaigns would have needed dedicated communication experts, which the government did not have. The West Bengal Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), which is at the helm of the States mitigation efforts today, is manned by engineers. There was no one to advise them on the communication strategy; on how to ensure peoples participation, says Nath. So, the department has always been hardware-oriented. The software has been neglected.Impact on hardwareThis neglect impacted the hardware too. Over the years, countless arsenic-filtration technologies were developed by institutions like the SOES and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute. Some, like SOESs filter, were for household use. This device had two components. This first was a tablet made of an iron salt, an oxidising agent and activated charcoal which reacted with arsenic in water to turn it into a filtrable floc. The second component, a fly-ash filter, would filter out the floc, which would then have to be disposed of safely. But even though the SOES filter and others like it worked flawlessly in the lab, they failed frequently in the field. Several people couldnt figure out how to use them. During an evaluation, Roychowdhurys team found that villagers would use multiple tablets in the filter instead of one, or expose the tablets to sunlight, or let the filter run dry. Such problems plagued community filters too, which were designed for several households. Toxic arsenic sludge was sometimes disposed of unsafely, sent back into the environment, instead of being treated as per protocol. Meanwhile, materials used in the filter, such as bleaching powder, werent stored properly, causing them to lose efficacy. At some point, you realise that the investments in hardware are not yielding returns, because you have not invested in awareness, says Nath.In 2016, a study in North 24 Parganas district, jointly conducted by UNICEF and PHED, found that merely marking tube wells as safe or unsafe and conducting awareness campaigns brought about large behavioural changes. Even if we dont provide alternative safe water sources, just marking tube wells can go a long way in mitigation, says Shyamnarayan Dave, who was a UNICEF consultant to the West Bengal government till 2015. But the State government realised this truth rather late. Almost after a decade of advocacy for awareness campaigns, it officially began painting tube wells two years ago.A geological curseEven as the government struggles to implement technological solutions to arsenic contamination, there is good news on another front. Scientists today broadly agree on the source of arsenic in the Ganga delta, a consensus that didnt exist earlier. John McArthur, a geochemist at the University College of London, explains the science in simple terms. The process is thought to have begun between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago, when small Himalayan rock particles, coated with iron oxide, entered the Ganga river delta. Along the way, these particles absorbed the tiny amounts of arsenic in the river water, like a sponge soaking liquid. These particles were then deposited in layers of sediment, over thousands of years, in what is now West Bengal and Bangladesh.Here, the rocks stayed in a more or less stable state until another actor entered the scene: decaying organic matter, or peat, says McArthur. The Ganga delta was also home to swampy wetlands some 5,000 years ago. The organic matter from these wetlands is now decaying slowly, alongside the arsenic. When the bacteria responsible for this decay come in contact with the iron oxide in the arsenic-bearing rocks, they use the oxygen from the iron oxide for their own metabolism, setting both arsenic and iron free. This is why the groundwater in West Bengal and Bangladesh are rich in both minerals.The free arsenic, buried under the soil, did not pose a human threat until three decades ago. Till then, most Bengali and Bangladeshi homes depended on lakes and rivers for their domestic needs. But some time in the 70s, families switched en masse to tube wells, because the surface water was growing increasingly contaminated, spreading diseases like cholera. In this region, you can get groundwater at depth of a few meters. So, everyone began digging tube wells in their own backyards, says Roychowdhury. This unleashed the underground arsenic.There is uncertainty today on how the geological mechanism of arsenic release impacts policy. Researchers agree that shallow tube wells, less than 150 meters deep, are the worst affected, because they contain arsenic-rich sediments from the Holocene era, when the arsenic arrived in the delta. Conversely, deep aquifers, more than 150 meters underground, are unaffected because they tap into the older Pleistocene sediments. According to McArthur, such deep tube wells can potentially be used for a long time without fear of contamination, as they have been in Bangladesh. The smart money is on the deep aquifer remaining viable for many decades, if not forever, he says.But Roychowdhury argues that even deep aquifers can become tainted with the overuse of groundwater. Such overuse is disturbing the clay separating the deep and shallow aquifers, allowing the arsenic to enter previously pristine waters, he says. His research seems to bear this out. In a study in North 24 Parganas, deep tube wells which were uncontaminated initially saw arsenic levels rise in about five years. If this phenomenon is typical across West Bengal, the governments initial strategy of digging deeper tube wells to replace shallow ones may not even be a good stopgap. Until we stop using groundwater, and focus on watershed management, this problem will remain, he says.Piped dreamThe endgame for the West Bengal government is to replace all groundwater for domestic use with water from the river Hooghly, using pipelines. But there are technical and financial challenges in laying such long pipelines. A senior official from the PHED, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the total cost of providing river water to all villages was an estimated Rs. 100,000 crore, money the government currently doesnt have.This is why the States short-term strategy is to provide Hooghly water to about half the arsenic-affected villages. The other half are to be served by community arsenic-treatment plants. The first part of this strategy has been easy to execute, because West Bengal has years of experience in sanitising surface water. Even though this water is heavily contaminated with bacteria, technologies to remove these bacteria have been tried and tested. For bacteriological quality improvement, we have experience for over 150 years, says Nath. The first water treatment plant in Kolkatta was 175 years old. The problem lies with arsenic-removal technologies, which are still emerging.About 170 such community arsenic treatment plants are to be installed across the State before the end of 2018. This deadline could be tough to meet, given that only 60 plants have been commissioned so far. Moreover, many of the commissioned plants are still operating at low efficiency because of maintenance issues.A socially isolating illnessUntil West Bengal is able to get safe water for all the 10 million at risk, its villages will remain dotted with tragedy. In Madhusudankati, a few km from the primary school lives a farmer, Monotosh Biswas. About 25 years ago, he began showing symptoms of toxicity. Today, his torso, palms and feet are dotted with lesions. A few years back, he developed Bowens Carcinoma, a skin cancer, on his hip. He went to Kolkata to get the lesion removed, spending Rs. 12,000 on medicines. While Bowens Carcinoma is treatable, others in the village have died of more lethal cancers.Between shallow breaths, a sign of arsenic-induced bronchitis, Biswas says his illness has also affected his farm work. The impact of arsenicosis on ones livelihood and the social stigma attached to it extracts a high cost from sufferers, says Kunal Kanti Majumdar, a doctor at Kolkatas KPC Medical College, who has worked in arsenic-affected areas for about two decades now. Wherever I went, I found depression, social isolation and suicidal thoughts. It is not just a health problem, but also a social problem, he says.As researchers fret about tackling the crisis, the schoolchildren in Madhusudankati are untroubled. It will be lunchtime soon. Roychowdhurys team collects food samples from the kitchen, which will be tested. Even though the school water is now safe, the rice and vegetables being used could have been grown in soil containing arsenic. Understanding the impact of this on the children is the teams next goal. So far, we have only tested water and biological samples. Now, we have to test the food, says Roychowdhury. Maybe it will have arsenic. Maybe it wont. Let us see."

Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

Subham Dutta Dibakar Mondal at the hut where he has been hiding since the nomination process began on April 3, along with nine other BJP supporters; (below) the TMC celebrations after the results on May 17. Subham DuttaDIBAKAR Mondal jumps over a 3-ft boundary wall at the back and disappears, within seconds of a car stopping outside a 10X12 ft mud hut in Mainan village in Magrahat 1, South 24 Parganas district, on 9 am, May 17. He returns 15 minutes and several phone calls later. A slender man of 30, dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers, nursing a gun wound in his leg, Dibakar smiles nervously, saying he had mistaken the occupants of the car for people who had been threatening him. I thought they had come, he says, entering the mud hut with cracked patches and a kuchcha roof, and turning on a television set.The old TV, kept on a stool, was arranged by Dibakar recently to track developments since the violence-ridden panchayat poll process began in West Bengal. Dibakar is a candidate of the BJP, which is contesting all the three panchayat samitis in Lakshmikantpur, located 60 km from Kolkata. He was shot in the right leg when he refused to withdraw his nomination, and has been hiding out here since then along with nine others, all BJP supporters. With fields of grains and pulses spread all across and the lush-green growth around them, Mainan appears a picture of serenity. But tension is running high, and like Dibakar, other BJP candidates of this village have taken shelter in mud houses like the one he is occupying. In all, Magrahat 1 block had 11 BJP contestants in the panchayat polls.South 24 Parganas district has 4,884 gram panchayat seats, of which elections were held on 3,058 seats, the remaining having been won uncontested by the TMC. Between April 3, when the nomination process began, and May 14, there were several instances of violence, leaving more than 10 injured. Dibakar was shot on April 5, when he was leading a group of BJP workers to file nominations. Says BJP district president Abhijeet Das, Dibakar was being threatened to withdraw his nomination. When he refused to do so, a group of TMC goons attacked him and he was shot from point blank range.Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384.Denying this, TMC local leader Subhasish Chakraborty says, Losers always have some excuse or the other. The BJP as a party has no base in South 24 Parganas. As far as Dibakars bullet injury is concerned, it was a fallout of a group fight. They are unnecessarily blaming the TMC. People of Bengal are happy with us and hence they voted (for us). Counting is on today at the Usthi Block Development Office, about 7 km from the hut he is in. But Dibakar says he doesnt dare venture out to check.Bijoy Bayen, 36, who is staying along with Dibakar, says he has picked up cooking since the job of feeding the party mates fell upon him. I had no idea about cooking, but now that we are living like refugees, I have learnt, says Bayen, who adds that he too has been threatened as he is a close aide of Dibakars. Dibakar, meanwhile, keeps switching between news channels, and making phone calls.Around 8 am, TV channels start reporting that some panchayat poll results have come. Quickly, Dibakar turns the set off, and starts reading a Bengali newspaper from among the several lying around.Dibakar explains that he is not too keen to know the results. No one was allowed to vote here after 9 am (on polling day). It was all rigged, counting is just a formality.Shankar Mondal, 29, who has been listening to the conversation, says its too scary to contest on a ticket other than the TMCs in West Bengal. I have been hiding for several days for my survival. I keep moving from one house to another, he says, just before stepping out to relieve himself after tying a handkerchief around his face.Before he has his breakfast around 10 am  usually roti-sabzi  Dibakar offers prayers at the idols of lords Laxmi and Narayan he has placed in a corner. He picks up a party pamphlet lying on the floor, puts some prasad of nakul dana (sweet makhana) on it, and says some mantras. However, this daily puja routine, lasting him around 5 minutes, is disrupted when Dibakar gets a call on his mobile.He answers the phone but keeps silent until he is sure its his family on the other side. They told him once again to stay safe, he says later. Hanging up the phone, Dibakar serves himself breakfast in an aluminum plate. Eating the food, he talks about how great a cook his wife is. Not a day goes by without me eating fish and rice at home, but here we will have chingri maach (prawn) and rice after so many days for lunch today, he says.However, its not safe yet to return home, Dibakar adds. My days start with a call to my family to find out if they are fine and end with sleepless nights.Breakfast done, he again decides to sit in front of the TV to get an update on the panchayat polls. The results of the Lakshmikantpur panchayat samitis come in around 2 pm. All the three seats go to the TMC. Dibakar shows no reaction, saying, None of the opposition parties could station their polling agents in booths on election date. No one was allowed in the vicinity. People didnt come to vote because there was continuous bombing in the area. The TMC took all the seats through rigging.Around noon, Dibakars friend Kali comes with his two-year-old son. As the friends play with him, for a while, tension seems to leave the hut. Meanwhile, the TV is on, updating the count. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 913 zilla parishad seats, elections were held on 579; 354 go to the TMC and only 15 to the BJP.As the day draws to a close, a stoic Dibakar says, I was threatened, received a bullet injury, but none of the top party leaders visited me. Now that everything is done counting too has been completed we are still running from one place to another to save our lives. Local goons of the ruling party are watching us. We are scared because they can easily outnumber us and attack. However, Dibakar asserts, he wont cow down. I have been in active politics since 2016 and will not leave until the Lok Sabha elections of 2019.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Though he was confident of walking on his own, the physiotherapists assisted him as they did not want to take any chances.He then asked to listen to some music and the nurses didnt disappoint him. One of the medical staffers whipped out her cellphone and played the Bengali song Ora hridoyer rong janena (they do not know the colour of the heart) by Lagnajita Chakraborty. Singh could not agree more as the young nurse attending to the heart recipient translated the meaning.After the heart transplant surgery on Monday, the 39-year-old is on the way to recovery at a fast pace.He listened to music and is in good shape and mood. He, however, continues to be under close monitoring as he is still vulnerable to infections, said Dr Saikat Bandyopadhyay, senior consultant, cardiac anaesthesiologist and intensivist at Fortis Aanadapur.Singhs diet has also been switched to solid food and he had rice and dal for lunch.Though visitors were still restricted, he was allowed to meet his brother.Since his constant companions are the nurses and the doctors, the medical team does not mind making special efforts to lighten up his day.We have to initiate his physical mobility. So we made him walk on Friday and his steps were confident. He is recovering well, said Dr K M Mandana, director, cardiothoraic and vascular surgery.The Kolkata medical team, including Mandana, Bandyopadhyay and Dr Tapas Ray Chaudhury , have taken charge of Singh after the transplant surgery  led by Dr KR Balakrishnan and Dr Suresh Rao of Fortis Malar  last Monday."
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Around 8 pm, Trilochon reportedly called up brother Shibnath to say some people were forcibly dragging him to a jungle nearby.At Dava village, Dulals 29-year-old wife Monika sits in a state of shock holding their three children, Aditya (11), Pooja (9) and Adarsh (7). Like Trilochon, Dulal had drifted to the BJP after participating in the March Ram Navmi rallies, and turned up dead a day after he went missing. He was found hanging from a high-tension wire, about a kilometre his home, on June 2.A team of five doctors did the postmortem at Purulia Sadar hospital. It is clearly written due to asphyxia, due to hanging, antemortem and suicidal in nature, said SP Magharia.Dulals family members and villagers say he could not have killed himself, pointing to the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Said Monika, Would a person leave his motorbike a kilometre away, with the keys in it, and walk all the way to hang himself? Police are lying Why would he commit suicide? He had no problems at home, no financial crisis.She also claimed threats from the TMC. Just a day before he was abducted and killed, local TMC workers had threatened him.According to the family members, on June 1, the day Dulal went missing, he had participated in the BJPs state-wide Thana Gherao programme to protest against Trilochons killing. In the evening, he left with food for his father, who was at the family shop of paddy rice cutter machine about a kilometre away. The family, that is relatively well-off, also owns a ration shop.He was very active in politics and that is why he was targeted. Police took away seven TMC men from the village for interrogation, but no one has been arrested, said Dinabandhu Kumar, a nephew of Dulal.Denying TMC involvement in the deaths, general secretary Partha Chatterjee said on Sunday, The postmortem report (of Dulal) has made it clear it is a case of suicide. The BJP is trying to create trouble by alleging murder.BJP state secretary Sayantan Basu said, We want the two cases to be handed over to the CBI or we will move court.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b2046d59855b70ae8cad01c,Poachers play deadly ivory game in Kerala,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poachers-play-deadly-ivory-game-in-kerala/article24125837.ece,2018-06-10,"On March 29, 2018, another undercover operation led to the seizure of ivory figurines from wildlife traffickers operating in Paruthipally range in Thiruvananthapuram. An investigator said their shine indicated that the statuettes of Hindu gods had been carved recently from fresh tusks.It seemed that after a lull of two years, once again, there was a growing market for magic cures while ivory artefacts also witnessed renewed demand. Since January 2017, forest officers say they have seized more than 50 kg of ivory from traffickers in Kerala. Yet, the provenance of much of the impounded ivory remained unknown. Investigations often hit a dead-end because forest officers, dreading departmental action, were loath to admit wild elephant killings in their jurisdiction.To dodge departmental enquiries, some incorrectly certified that the tusks were from elephants that had died due to natural causes. In 2017, at least three carcasses of wild elephants were discovered by chance in Chithalathu, Nagaranpara and Pariyaram in Wayanad, Kottayam and Thrissur districts respectively.The post-mortem examinations on the decomposed bodies were inconclusive. They were found disintegrated and in at least one case burned, possibly in a forest fire or by wildlife traffickers themselves.Officials say that elephants are vulnerable to poaching in at least 20 forest localities in the State, especially during monsoon. The areas also include forests contiguous to Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.A review conducted by Chief Conservator, Dr. B. S Corrie after the killing of at least a score of wild elephants in Malayattoor, Vazhachal and Munnar forest divisions in 2014-15 helped the forest department map the poorly protected sites.The slaughter of at least 18 tuskers for their ivory in the deep forests had come to light when one of the gang members, a forest watcher who moonlighted as a guide for the poachers, had a change of heart and disclosed the killings.Operation ShikkarK. D. Kunjumons confession on May 21, 2015, to officers in Athirapally forest range had prompted Operation Shikkar, that resulted in the seizure of 464 kg of ivory and the arrest of 73 persons. The probe that unfolded across the country revealed how poachers shot elephants dead on order, hacked their tusks with camp axes and delivered the ivory to Thiruvananthapuram-based middle-men.Thiruvananthapuram is the hub of ivory trade in South India because of its vast pool of traditional artisans who are adept at carving wood, animal bone and also ivory. Traffickers offer them higher wages than what they get for working on wood or camel bone.Operation Shikkar relied heavily on the personal journal of an ivory trafficker targeted a secret warehouse in New Delhi, which had operated under cover of a handicrafts shop.It showed how the poachers led by Aikkaramattom Vasu alias Varattupara Veerappan  a sobriquet the hunter earned for his skilled shooting with locally made muzzle loaders  remained off the forest departments radar for years and ranged freely in dense forests, killing tuskers. It also led to the seizure of 28 guns hidden in forest locations.In the thick of woodsVasus method was to camp in the forest for days with few aides. They survived mostly on dried rice balls to avoid lighting fires. Vasu enlisted the help of tribals and corrupt forest watchers to shoot tuskers. He was then found dead, hanging in a remote pineapple farm in Sindhudurgh district in Maharashtra in 2015, and thereafter ivory seizures dwindled with his collaborators on the run.However, now officials fear that front-persons of Thiruvananthapuram-based ivory traders have recommenced their operations.Officials say the accused have now shifted their operations to Kolkata. Now, a woman from Thiruvananthapuram, who goes by the moniker Calcutta Thankachi heads the illegal operations.She has hired artisans from Thiruvananthapuram to carve ivory and accommodated them in West Bengal. Investigators say that she along with her Mumbai-based associate, who goes by the name Pi Mundi are responsible for the resurgence of the ivory trade.Officers say they have partly responded to the threat by identifying and naming big herds and counting them in their home range with particular emphasis on photographing and documenting tuskers.They also have suggested equipping forest watchers with GPS to track their movements, and placing camera traps and other remote sensors to deter poachers."

However, if the low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal intensifies into a depression, it can push the monsoon current towards Bihar. However, no change has been witnessed in the low-pressure area since Sunday, which means it is stagnant, said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, department of environmental science, Central University of South Bihar and secretary of Indian Meteorological Society, Bihar.Meanwhile, the IMDs Patna office has predicted widespread pre-monsoon rainfall in several districts of state on Tuesday and Wednesday and scattered rainfall from Thursday onwards.Weathermen have attributed the prevailing weather conditions to an east-west trough that runs from Punjab to the centre of a low-pressure area over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.The late arrival of monsoon adversely affects rice crops. Although with scientific advancements, enough awareness has been created on how to save the rice seeds from damage. IMD, weather and agricultural scientists from Bihar have also planned to conduct an awareness programme by the end of June to create awareness about sustainable ways of farming when the onset of monsoon is late. It includes information on certain rice seeds that sustain and grow in less amount of water, Sarthi said."

(Express photo by Partha Paul) Satyen completed his Ladakh journey in 3 months. (Express photo by Partha Paul)Written by Poojaa MukherjeeIn May, Kolkata-based documentary filmmaker Indrani Chakrabartis 64-minute film Ladakh Chale Rickshawala won the Best Exploration/Adventure film at the 65th National Awards in New Delhi. The film documented the journey of a rickshawala, 46-year-old Satyen Das, from Kolkata to Ladakh.I have had many job offers since the award, and even before that as people in this area (Naktala) know about my adventures, Das, who is fluent in Bengali, Hindi and English, told The Indian Express. I have been offered money to open a stall of my own. Shop owners have offered to hire me. But I like my life. I own my own rickshaw and ply it the way I want. I dont have a boss, I am not accountable to anyone and I can go travelling whenever I want.At 9 am every day Das arrives at the Gitanjali Metro station at Naktala and leaves for home 12 hours later. A shack near Naktala is home to Dass family  his wife Meenu works as a maid and 14-year-old daughter Sukanya studies in a government school. It is also home to Dass vast reputation  a neat folder will all the certificates from various government departments he has ever received and a collection of around 100 stamped police permits from all over India.I want to become a mountaineer, Sukanya said to the approving gaze of her father. She will climb Everest one day, said Das. The family climbs a mountain every day with Das earning around Rs 300 each day and Meenus monthly Rs 5,000. For the award-winning film, Das got Rs 15,000 as remuneration. His travels had been taking him across the country.In 1995, after years of work and saving money, he travelled through much of India in 403 days  from Kolkata to Puri in Orissa and then from there going down south then back up through Rajasthan to Jammu on a cycle. It set the tone of Dass annual adventures.In 2007, he took Meenu and Sukanya, who was just over a year old then, to Puri (Odisha) on his rickshaw. We carried a sack of potatoes and rice and would cook on the journey and eat. We had only Rs 1000 in cash and used it to fix tyre punctures and repairs which needed to be done, said Das. We caught sleep at railway stations, schools and even in peoples homes when they allowed us shelter. Some of them would give us food and money too when they heard our story. People are very kind.The next year he peddled to Rohtang Pass (altitude 3,978 m) and found his way to the Limca Book of Records. It was sheer luck that brought Indrani Chakrabarti and Das together. I had taken a ride on his rickshaw and struck a conversation, she said. When he told me his story I knew then it had to be shown to a wider audience.The Ladakh trip saw him come close to a snow leopard, suffer a drop in oxygen and navigate through uneven terrain. On the way, he planted close to 5,000 date seeds. They dont need much nurturing and will grow in adverse circumstances. Its like human willpower, he said.I stayed at Sonam Wanchuk School in Ladakh, he said. Sonam sir kept my rickshaw there to inspire people who would come. He also gave me advice regarding my rickshaws gear. He is an incredible man. He arranged for a flight ticket to Delhi despite me wanting to take a bus from Ladakh. He even gave me Rs 5,000 for returning to Kolkata.Back home, the local community felicitated him and even refurbished his rickshaw with a special brake.The members of the Naktala Agrani Sangha (the local club) helped me in all possible ways by raising funds. They upgraded my humble rickshaw with suitable break and gear too. Ive received both love and recognition, Im grateful for that, he said.Das has taken to learning and educating people on global warming. He scours newspapers, social media and follows National Geographic keenly. We live in a beautiful world but are bent on destroying it, he said.Meanwhile, he has already planned his next trip  to Umlingla Top in Ladakh which stands at 18,406 ft, the highest motorable Road in India. And this time he plans to take 20,000 date seeds with him.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Speaking at a meeting in Purulia -- once the heart of the state's Maoist zone -- the BJP chief launched an all-out attack on the two-time Chief Minister's government. Bengal, he pointed out, was given a sweet deal by the NDA government in terms of financial packages, still parts of the state does not have clean drinking water or electricity.""BJP distributes rice at Rs 2 a kg. Do the people in Purulia get it? Mamata is busy stitching a grand coalition. We are not opposed to it, but handle West Bengal first,"" the BJP chief said.Purulia is also the state where two BJP workers died over the last month in suspicious circumstances. Trilochan Mahato, 18, was found hanging from a tree, with a note pinned to his shirt. ""This is for doing BJP politics from age 18. Been trying to kill you since the vote. Failed. Today you are dead."" On Saturday, the police made the first arrest in the cases.""More than 65 BJP workers were killed in the violence in Bengal and more than 1,341 workers were injured,"" Mr Shah said, adding that only the ""thugs"" of the TMC are thriving in the state. In the evening, he met the families of the men.Mr Shah, whose party has two parliamentary seats in Bengal, has set an ambitious target for his local leaders. He wants at least 22 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state - and there is no question of any understanding with Ms Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, which happens to be a pet allegation by the state leaders of the opposition Congress and the Left Front.State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh is confident. ""Amit Shah has set us a minimum 22 as the target. We will get many more,"" he told reporters. The state BJP's confidence is likely to stem from the recent panchayat poll elections. The party has outstripped the Left Front to become the main opposition in the state.The gap in BJP-TMC vote share is huge, but the BJP numbers are rising with every election.In the evening, senior Trinamool leader Partha Chatterjee said Amit Shah should pay more attention to his party's government at the Centre and states where assembly polls are due, instead of ""looking at"" West Bengal.""There is a saying that empty vessels make the greatest sound. Amit Shah's speech in Purulia is a reflection of it,"" Mr Chatterjee said."

Mamata had done many things for the Hindus, including developing Gangasagar, building skywalk at Dakshineswar temple and renovating Tarakeswar temple,"" he said.Mr Bandopadhyay claimed that although the highest number of farmer deaths were reported in Maharashtra during the past six months, PM Modi chose to hold a rally for welfare of peasants in Bengal where not a single farmer had died.Accusing the BJP of creating a rift between the Hindus and the Muslims, he said, ""We will not let that happen"".""The Rambhakts of Modi's BJP trigger riots but the Rambhakts of Bengal work for building communal amity,"" he claimed.He claimed that the turnout at PM Modi's public rally comprised people from four states - Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha -- but not a single farmer was present at the rally.Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said, ""The people of India need Mamata Banerjee. She has no lust for power. But she has to take up the responsibility. The people of the country need a leader who works for everybody.""He said PM Modi had raised a slogan of bringing ""Achhe din"" but bad days befell the people.Mr Hakim, who is also the Trinamool Congress' general secretary, said, ""We have syndicate for development but not formed syndicate to organise riots like what happened in Gujarat.""He claimed that the Trinamool Congress would win all the 42 seats in the state and the BJP would not be able to win a single seat.State Education Minister and Trinamool Congress Secretary General Partha Chatterjee alleged that PM Modi was shedding crocodile tears for the farmers.""Modi had suddenly turned up in Midnapore to profess his new-found love for farmers. I ask where was he when the farmers' agitation in Nandigram and Singur were taking place,"" he questioned.Mr Chatterjee said Ms Banerjee had a history of standing by the people and she did not become a mass leader in one day.He said those who failed to provide mid-day meal rice were now claiming to side with the farmers.Mr Chatterjee alleged that the BJP was trying to win polls by bringing out rath-yatras and allowing display of swords in processions, thereby, creating fear among people but, said that, they would not succeed."

""I had paid them Rs 2000 as kali puja chanda last year but they demanded Rs 40,000 this time. I pleaded them repeatedly that I couldn't pay it and urged them to take Rs 3000. But they didn't pay any heed to my request and threatened me before leaving my shop. On Friday morning, I rushed to my shop to find its shutter sealed with m-seal plaster that fixed the keyhole,"" Kundu said.Another shop owner, a rice trader Santosh Das said, ""In last year, I was asked to pay Rs 1000 but I managed to pay them Rs 500. But this time they asked me to pay Rs 5000 as puja chanda. When I refused to pay it, they tried to force me to pay. As I turned down their unjustified demand, they sealed my shop with fixing the keyhole on the shutter.""Samir Guha, who runs a fast-food centre at Natun Bazar, alleged that he was threatened with harm as he refused to pay Rs 10000 as puja chanda. ""The door of my shop was also sealed. Though we could reopen the shop with the help of police, but we are afraid of further attack."" Guha said.Police arrested three accused identified as Vivekananda Dey, Tapu Biswas and Manik Das.Sources, however, said, all the accused allegedly owing allegiance to ruling Trinamool Congress are associated with RNWS and Trinamool councillor Gopa Pandey, a CIC(health) member in South Dum Dum municipality is also named in the puja committee banner.Gopa Devi, however, said, ""The law will take its own course. If somebody is found guilty of forcing someone to collect puja chanda in the name of puja committee, we asked police to take stern action against them.""Ananda Roy, DCP, Zone II, Barrackpore commissionerate, however, said, ""After checking CCTV footages we have already identified three accused and arrested them for making nuisance in the area ."""

A closer examination revealed that the sugar they had bought from the neighbourhood grocer to prepare the sweets was in fact teeming with plastic grains. On Tuesday, prof Ashok R Patil, a neighbour of the aggrieved family, complained to the food safety commissioner and health commissioner about the suspected plastic grains found in the sugar.The head of the family, SV Karki, had bought 5kg of sugar from Krishna Provision Store on Sunday. My wife made besan ladoos and some other sweets for my daughter who was set to leave for the US. We used up all the sugar. While tasting the ladoos, we realised it was impossible to bite into them. When we dissolved them in water, we could see transparent crystals settling down. I complained to the shopkeeper, said Karki.Prof Patil, chair professor of consumer law and practice, National Law School of India University, learnt about the matter and lodged the complaint  TOI has a copy  alleging that the sugar was adulterated with plastic grains.We informed the food safety officer to take action against the manufacturers and sellers involved. We have kept a sample of the sweet for lab test. The matter needs to be investigated further, said Patil. With the family having used all the sugar purchased from the store, theres no way to verify the extent of adulteration Maneesh Singh, proprietor of Krishna Provision Store, said he did not receive a complaint from any other customer. I buy a gunny bag of 50kg of sugar from the wholesale market, he said.However, Patil claimed the shopkeeper had admitted to some problem in the sugar when Karki questioned him.Dr Harshavardhan B, joint commissioner, Food Safety & Standard Authority of India (FSSAI), Karnataka, said he has received a complaint and his officers would inspect the store.If it is settling at the bottom of the vessel, it might not be plastic grains. They would float. We have received over 90 samples of rice and sugar in the past one month and in none of the cases was the presence of plastic grains proven. Testing samples for the presence of plastic grains costs Rs 6,000. The complainant has sent us an email. We will collect the sample and test it further, he said, adding that it could be a case of adulteration."

The proposal is part of the Green City-Clean City project that can make room for apartments with all modern facilities. ""The city will look better once the project in place with accommodation facilities for many,"" the CM added.Mamata has already asked the state urban development department to prepare a project blueprint. Residents here will get a bonus as hospitality and healthcare facilities have already applied for land in the area, which has a state-of-the-art convention centre Soujanya, along with an open air theatre Uttirna. A 2,000 seater auditorium Dhana Dhanya is coming up in the neighbourhood. The National Library and Alipore Horticulture Garden are two landmarks of the area.The proposal has come as a windfall for real estate developers. The unlocking of the idle asset will also fetch big revenue for the government as land price in this locality is over Rs 1 crore a cottah. The CM during inauguration of the Soujanya convention centre a fortnight ago had told the audience that she has start 4ed identifying idle assets in the city and will draw up a plan for the city's beautification.Nandu Belani, president of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), welcomed the development.""The idea to have a real estate project cashing in on an idle asset is a sound move,"" Belani said. However, he and other realtors were unwilling to comment on the proposal to shift Alipore Zoo as the area was a green zone and attempts to develop it would court unnecessary controversy.The CM announced the proposal soon after the first lot of 50 convicts from Alipore Central Correctional Home entered Baruipur Central Correctional Home on Wednesday. The convicts, some of whom have spent upto 35 years at Alipore jail , were brought to their new home at Baruipur.Among the 50 are Md. Nasib alais Naso who has been serving a life term for the last 35 years for the 1984 murder of DC port of Kolkata Police. Another lifer, Siddique Sardar of Bhangor, has so far served 16 years at Alipore for getting his wife murdered by a hired killer after he suspected her of having an extra-marital affair. Sardar wrote his M.A. exam from jail in 2010 and passed. Bird-lover Sankar Jaswara, also a lifer, has served 21 years at Alipore jail for murder. Seven months ago, Jaswara rescued an injured bird after a storm from within the Alipore jail yard. He was released on parole soon after and took the bird to a veterinary doctor for treatment.The CM inaugurated the new jail by pressing a button from her office at Nabanna. The convicts apart, Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, state jails minister Ujjal Biswas and director-general (jails) Arun Gupta were present at Baruipur. ""More convicts will be brought to the Baruipur jail from Alipore in phases,"" said Gupta. The inauguration was followed by a cultural function at which some convicts also performed.The inauguration marks the opening of the first phase of the Baruipur jail project. ""Work on the second phase will hopefullybe completed by March-end,"" added Gupta. While the first project's first phase was built at a cost of Rs 70 crores, the second phase is coming up with an allocation of Rs 98 crores.The new jail has a hygienic kitchen and toilets. The kitchen is equipped with modern machines like large cookers for rice and rotis. Explaining the facilities, a jail official said, ""The new jail will also have an upgraded security arrangement. For instance, the boundary wall of the jail is 25 feet high compared to Alipore jail's 20 feet boundary. Moreover, there is another 15 feet wall around this wall, acting as a second security ring with several watchtowers all around to prevent prisoners from escaping. There are many more CCTV cameras to keep an eye on prisoners."

The procurement definitely will exceed the target this year too,"" the official told .There will not be any impact on procurement, though crop in Punjab, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh has been affected by deficient rain during September-end, he said.Asked about private procurement, the official said a pilot was to be taken up in Jharkhand but the companies have not shown interest and not placed any bids so far.""Wheat is easier to procure. In case of rice, they have to buy paddy and get it milled and stored. Many issues have to be kept in mind...,"" the official added.As per the latest data, rice procurement in Punjab reached 10.86 million tonnes, Haryana at 3.88 million tonnes, Telangana at 9,96,779 tonnes, Chhattishgarh at 3,02,319 tonnes and Uttrakhand at 1,71,098 tonnes so far this marketing year.Tamil Nadu has procured 1,10,771 tonnes of rice, while in case of Kerala it stood at 49,813 tonnes and Maharashtra at 17,880 tonnes in the said period, the data showed.Procurement is yet to begin in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The official said that Punjab and Haryana have completed 60 per cent of the their rice procurement. The buying is underway in other states like Chattishgarh.The paddy is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). State-run FCI and state agencies undertake procurement operation.For the current year, the government has fixed paddy MSP of 'common' grade variety at Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of 'A' grade variety at Rs 1,770 per quintal.The government has pegged rice output to be 99.21 million tonnes in the kharif season of the 2018-19 crop year (July-June), as against the actual output of 97.50 million tonnes in the same season last year.

So if someone says people are dying of starvation, it is untrue. I will not accept it,"" she said at a public meeting here.A section of media recently reported that seven people of Sabar community in Jangalmahal area of Jhargram district died due to starvation.Sabar community is an ethnic tribe, mainly residing in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The chief minister also claimed to have received information about people selling off their quota of food grains.""Every person gets 8 kg rice and 3 kg wheat per month. However, I have come to know that people who don't require the grains sell part of their quota in the open market,"" she said.Last week, during her Assembly address, Banerjee had said that the deaths in the former Maoist stronghold resulted from ""age-related ailments"" or ""excessive liquor consumption"".Maintaining that the West Bengal government gave subsidies and sops to people on all occasions, she asserted that no other state could match up to the welfare programmes run by her government.""The former CPI(M)-led Left Front regime had saddled us with debts.The NDA government, too, takes away huge amount of money for servicing debts.However, we haven't let all that factors affect our schemes.""From birth to death, the TMC government doles out benefits on all occasions, including marriage and child birth. No state in country in on par with the West Bengal government when it comes to sops disbursal,"" the chief minister said.Alleging that the BJP was trying to ""divide people on religious lines"", the TMC supremo sought to know the role played the saffron party during Maoist violence in Jangalmahal.""Hundreds of people died every year from Maoist violence and police action during the period of unrest in Jangalmahal. Where were they (BJP) when people were actually starving to death?"" she said.Maoist violence was largely contained in the rural areas of West Bengal after the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power in 2011.""I had visited all Maoist-affected places, including Lalgarh and Goaltore, where no one dared to tread foot at that time,"" she recounted.Without taking names, Banerjee also alleged that ""Maoists were being brought to Bengal from neighbouring Jharkhand"" to create unrest in the state.She also took at a dig at the Chhattisgarh government for not being able to control the menace.Banerjee's jibe at the Raman Singh-led government came around an hour after eight Naxals and two police personnel were killed in an encounter between ultras and security men in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district.""In Chhattisgarh, the BJP has been in power for many years, but the Maoist violence is still rampant in the state,"" she added."

After day-long campaigning in politically recharged Chambal-Gwalior region including a roadshow in neighbouring Ashok Nagar,presidentwas visibly upbeat of retaining power in Madhya Pradesh despite three terms of incumbency. After staying the night in Gwalior, he was ready to leave for Telangana. Before leaving, he spoke toon burning issues, including Ayodhya, andreiterated the promise of a grand Ram temple. Excerpts:BJP won many seats after you took over as party chief. But yourparty seems to be strugglingto defeat the challenge of incumbency in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Is the prospect of a setback unsettling you?It is fact that rising expectations have increased the vulnerability of incumbents. A long spell in power did impact your performance in Gujarat polls. You have been in power in MP and Chhattisgarh for 15 years now, whereas in Rajasthan you are up against the pattern of politics where the ruling party has invariably lost polls for two decades. Your party is obviously facing a challenge.Do you think the outcome, whichever way it goes, will have an impact on next years Lok Sabha elections?In Chhattisgarh, Congresss promise of a farm loan waiver appears to have helped them. But BJP did not move to match the promise in MP. Was it too late for you to make a similar announcement? After all, you promised and implemented loan waivers in both UP and Maharashtra.Demand for temple construction in Ayodhya is gaining momentum. RSS and VHP want construction to start and now Shiv Sena is seeking to outpace you on that front. Even Congresss C P Joshi has claimed only they can construct the temple. What is the problem in bringing a legislation to clear the way for temple construction as has been demanded by RSS and VHP?How do you see Congresss promises of gaushala, promotion of cow urine products, and Ram van gaman path. Congress has in the past accused BJP of Hindu polarisation by using these themes. Do you think they will use soft Hindutva from now on?But at the same time, Congress leader Kamal Nath was seen in a video asking Muslim groups to ensure 90% turnout of the community?Leaders like Kamal NathBJP quickly pounced upon remarks by Joshi about the non-upper caste backgrounds of Prime Minister and Uma Bharati, and Raj Babbar who brought in PMs mother. It seems you have too many friends in Congress.You have on several occasions said that illegal immigrants like Rohingyas will be deported but home ministry is planning to give them work permits although they will be disenfranchised?There were reports about anger in upper castes over changes in SC/ST Act. Dont you think it will hurt the party in the three states?In Telangana, BJP is suddenly very aggressive against TRS although there was speculation of a friendly fight between the two parties as TRS supported you in Parliament. What is the party strategy in the state?Rahul Gandhi has used his campaign against the purchase of Rafale fighter jets to attack the PMs image of honesty?The opposition has alleged misuse of central agencies and Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal CMs have withdrawn CBIs general consent. Isnt it a threat to the federal structure of the country?How do you justify dissolution of the J&K assembly? The opposition is alleging that if BJP wont rule, it wont let others rule.That is your perception. I know it is shared by others but I dont agree. BJP will retain power in all three states and the outcome on December 11 will enhance PM Narendra Modis stature as a strong and popular leader who will return as PM in 2019 with bigger numbers.There are two terms in political science  anti-incumbency and pro-incumbency. Unfortunately, our media friends focus on just one of them, that is anti-incumbency. We are contesting assembly polls on the agenda of good governance and development. There is pro-incumbency in the three states as people recognise the good work of our governments and want them to continue. We have implemented 129 welfare schemes in these states through which BJP governments have developed a strong constituency and support base. Anti-incumbency is being talked now just as it was invoked to claim that we would lose Gujarat polls badly. But we formed a full majority government. It is time people talked about performers too.Each election has its own dynamic and logic. Local issues and personalities matter a lot in state elections. However, ours is a federal polity and elections are not completely divorced from each other. They even influence each other. These elections will certainly have an influence on voters across the country and of course on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Our federal structure is a factor in governance as well. For example, if you talk about Madhya Pradesh, the speed of growth and development in the first two terms of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government was not as fast as it was in the last five years as central assistance increased manifold after BJP formed government at the Centre. The result of 2014 elections created headwind for BJP in state polls as we scored victories in UP, Maharashtra, Haryana and many more. Therefore, I feel the elections in five states are important for us.There is already a loan waiver in MP. Congress government under Digvijay Singh used to give loan to farmers at 18% interest but Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been giving at 5%. Loan of over Rs 13,000 crore in MP has been distributed on 0% interest. Our government has done a lot for farmers. Huge quantities of wheat and rice being purchased at MSP and now soyabean has also been included in the price support scheme. What Chouhan and Raman Singh have delivered in the past 15 years, none has done that much. In UP and Maharashtra, the situation was different as farmers were distressed after years of misrule.Let me reiterate that our commitment to construct a grand temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya is non-negotiable. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court and lets wait until it is heard in January. However, it should be borne in mind that the case was pending in the SC for nine years and still Congress leader Kapil Sibal went on to demand that the hearing should be taken up after 2019 polls. Lawyers of Akhara, Ram Lalla all have insisted on hearing the case on priority but Congress wanted to postpone it. We are expecting a favourable judgment and let us wait. However, no one can doubt our intentions. Congress should also stop making false claims. About Shiv Sena, we are two different parties although we are in alliance. There is no rift among us on the issue.After 2014, people of the country rejected 21 out of 22 poll manifestos of the Congress. Their manifesto will be rejected again. As far as their embrace of Hindutva is concerned, they are welcome. We have been talking gaushala and all such issues since 1950. We wish all political parties talk about these issues, but not for political gain and only during election season.Not just Kamal Nath wooed a particular community, even C P Joshi (senior Congress leader in Rajasthan) was seen talking about PMs caste and that shows the partys mindset. Congress is desperately trying to reintroduce the politics of appeasement, which has been rejected. People of the country have already suffered a lot but they have seen the true colours of Congress leaders, who were divisive in the past and are again trying to divide society on caste, communal lines.are hell bent on communal politics and appeasement and I am sure they will face the consequences.We dont need Congress leaders cheap gimmicks to boost party morale and our campaign. However, the levels to which Congress leaders are stooping is certainly a matter of serious concern. BJP has pledged to eradicate influence of dynasty, caste and appeasement from the countrys politics. However, Congress is hell bent on reviving them and making them central to the countrys politics. As far as language used by Congress leaders against Modijis mother, it is most unfortunate and highly condemnable.I have insisted on deportation of illegal immigrants settled in the country and I am firm on my commitment. However, there is a process for detection, disenfranchisement and deportation which is time consuming. We also have to abide by international conventions and laws. But we are clear that illegal foreigners are a threat to national security and they must not be allowed to enter. As far as reported work permits from MHA is concerned, I dont think any such initiative has been taken so far.I dont deny outburst of emotions when issues related to caste come to the forefront. However, BJPs main poll plank is inclusive development of all castes and communities. There are schemes of the Centre helping people of all sections. After several days of campaigning, I can say with confidence that BJP is getting support of all castes for its development oriented agenda.There is no question of a friendly fight. We are contesting Telangana assembly polls with full force. In Parliament, TRS had only two options  either to support us or stand with the opposition. They supported us but that does not mean that we are together even in the state.Whether allegations carry conviction or not depend on the image and track record of the person they are levelled against. In case of Narendra Modi, I can say with full conviction that such false allegations will not work as people wont believe it. I challenge Rahul to substantiate the allegations. The Centre has given details of the deal in a sealed envelope in the Supreme Court but Rahul has not done so because his allegations are blatant lies. In MP, they were talking about Vyapam but dropped the matter after the involvement of their own leaders came to light. Congress has no issues against the Centre, therefore, its president is trying to distract attention from core issues like development.What they (Naidu, Mamata) have done is most unfortunate. On CBI, two senior most officers of the agency were up against each other with allegations and counter allegations leaving no option for the Centre but to intervene. Complying with CBI bylaws, the matter related to the director was handed over to the CVC. Where is the scope for allegations against the BJP government. Even in case of RBI, the discussion happened as per the RBI Act, which doesnt amount to interference in independent functioning of the central bank.The decision was the prerogative of the state governor, who rightly dissolved the assembly as horse trading was going on for three days. Even I learnt about the decision through media. The PDP letter for government formation was merely a desperate bid as the letter had no mention of support of the other parties. There was no letter of any group supporting the PDP to form government."

As help is pouring in from across the state for the people in the coastal districts, whose livelihoods have been affected by cyclone Gaja, an art teacher from the city is planning to provide relief materials to the affected by selling some of his paintings.P Nandakumar, an art teacher at the CS Academy School in Kovaipudur, has raised Rs 95,000 after selling six of his paintings. He plans to use it to buy rice, blankets and milk powder for the people of a village near Vedaranyam. While I wanted to help people affected by the cyclone, I had no means to do it. All I had was some paintings and Rs 15,000 I got after selling a painting. So, I decided to sell some more to raise funds. I asked my close friends and three of them bought a few more paintings, the 37-year-old man told TOI.One of his friends from Nagapatinam told Nandakumar that a few villages still hadnt got any relief material. We selected Karuppankulam situated between Nagapattinam and Vedaranyam, which has about 200 families. While we have already bought milk powder, mosquito repellents and biscuits, we arranged blankets from Chennimalai and rice from Kangeyam in subsidised rates. We will pick up the materials along the way to the village on Saturday evening, he said.Nandakumar, who has exhibited his works in group shows in New Delhi, Kolkata and Vijayawada, said he had earlier used money got from his paintings to help students in government schools. I have also started a trust to help government schools in need. But I never go ask for funds. I only use money from selling paintings.He plans to sell 50 more paintings to raise funds for his philanthropic work. His panting on organ donation, which was exhibited as part of the art and culture departments show held in August in the district, had earned him praise from the officials and public alike."

And some are former students of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, who have made it to the festival despite the scaled down nature of the event.One such enthusiast is Nadi Palshikar from Pune, who has been coming to the festival since 2005 when she was selected for a filmmaking contest held alongside that years film festival.Reaching outThe Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) alumnus is a medical doctor, who makes use of films to reach out to women from the less affluent sections.I did a film appreciation course from the National Film Archives in Pune in 1999. It was then I felt I could use films to sensitise women on issues that otherwise would take a planned project to implement, she says.Nadi later did a course in script writing with the FTII to get to know the making of films. But instead of writing a script, I ended up writing a novel, Sutar.Films have always fascinated her and the IFFK is a festival she holds dear for the common man link it has. Any day, she would choose to come to Kerala for the stock of good films shown here, for the people with whom she feels a camaraderie and for the brown rice and avial she enjoys.The IFFK has sure been scaled down but we did not come for the grand functions but for the films, she says.According to her, there are many among the FTII alumni who would choose the IFFK over the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) for the choice of films and as a festival where the red carpet remains subdued in comparison to the content.Rebuilding processAnother FTII alumnus and freelancer script writer Samvartha Sahil is here both for the love of films and also to be able to contribute to the rebuilding process after floods.I wanted to go for the IFFI but was caught up in a documentary work in Kolkata. When I thought of the IFFK, the high fee did deter me but then found it was for a good cause. I am happy to be able to contribute for flood relief as an IFFK delegate, he says.The FTII students are mostly encouraged to attend the IFFI in Goa due to the proximity of the place to Pune, but there are some who choose to come here for the quality of films shown.Rachitha Gorowala had come here in 2012 when she was still a student at the FTII.Now, a documentary filmmaker in Bhopal, she makes movies for the government and has recently finished one on Bhopal for the Films Division titled Begamon ka Bhopal .Political undertoneI also attended the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala (IDSFFK) but found the movies selected have a political undertone. This baffles me, as movies can also be about the poetry and drama that life offers, she says.She loves the festival for its treatment of cinema and for the city which according to her is as laidback as her hometown yet has people patient enough to wait and watch good movies."

5ce5967be8e3fc56af40d5eb,Revenge of the antique rice grain,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/people/revenge-of-the-antique-rice-grain/cid/1678937,2018-12-16,"As Chinmoy Das tells it, it all began in September 2007. Several districts of West Bengal were flooded. Walking through one such limpid countryside along the banks of the Kulik river in North Dinajpur, Das, a Geography teacher, was surprised to see some paddy crops still standing erect, undamaged.That left Das and his two friends  Sudipta Mukherjee, an officer with the fire services department in Calcutta, and Rupak Kumar Paul, a college teacher  intrigued. Das says, That is the first time we learnt about paddy that is flood-resistant. Thereafter, the three decided to follow up the revelation with some serious research. In due course, they came to know about paddy varieties that are drought-resistant and others that can grow in brackish water.They also learnt that these indigenous or folk varieties with names such as Kalli, Changa, Kochi, Malsera, Kakri, Bahurupi had ceded place to high-yielding hybrid rice, a hot market favourite. Five years later, Das and his friends launched the Forum for Indigenous Agricultural Movement or Fiam, a platform to rejuvenate lost varieties of rice.The first step was finding as many varieties of seeds as possible. One stop was the Agriculture Training Centre at Phulia; it had over 400 varieties of heirloom seeds. The other thing to do was identify individuals with collections.Abhra Chakraborty of Guskara in Burdwan is such a person. Chakraborty works in the state fisheries department but paddy is his passion. He has preserved nearly 440 varieties. He has also cultivated some and taken more land on lease recently to plant the rest.Abhra talks about how seed conservation is a tricky science and has to be done with some art. It needs a lot of knowledge and involvement. I divide my plot into several parts, keeping in mind the time of pollination of each variety. He explains that self pollination does happen but it is not desirable as it compromises the genetic purity of a particular variety.Das has also converted a portion of the 24 bighas of land owned by him for conservation. He has planted a variety of paddy seeds. The thrust of his initiative, Fiam, is to produce more rice of the available variety so that there is enough seed for mass production.He distributes these seeds among farmers, simultaneously educating them about the virtues of indigenous crop. We managed to cultivate 50 bighas of land in 2014; 200 farmers were involved, he says.Ten years on, Fiam has many more stakeholders. Says Das, It is a mixed group. There are those who have degrees in Computer Science, there are English Literature graduates. Many of them have chosen not to leave their native village for urban opportunities. Instead, they have taken up farming and the cause of folk rice.Fresh graduate Tanmay Das of Raiganj district is one of them. He tells The Telegraph, It is a misconception that hybrid varieties give better yield. There are high yielding folk varieties too. Also, hybrids require a lot of chemical fertilisers; this is bad for soil health. Salim Naskar is also a graduate farmer from South Dinajpur. He says, I have come to know about organic farming. I can easily integrate my knowledge about modern farming techniques with the legacy knowledge handed down to me by my forefathers.The vice-president of Fiam is Dr Sudeb Saha, a practicing doctor. It has been 30 years since hybrids took over the market. There is a resurgence of folk varieties no doubt, but it will be some time before they can even begin to catch up, he says."
5ce57b3ee8e3fc56af40c744,Despair in North Bengal’s tea gardens despite Mamata Banerjee’s welfare claims,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/19/despair-in-north-bengals-tea-gardens-despite-mamatas-welfare-claims-1913721.html,2018-12-19,"Alisha Rahaman Sarkar ByOnline DeskOn international tea day, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that her government had allocated more than Rs 1000 crore for the welfare of tea garden workers since coming to power in 2011. Though she didnt share the division, this amounts to roughly Rs 142 crores in welfare handouts per year.But the reality in the tea gardens of the state remains grim.The tea industry is the second largest employer in India. In its ranks are 3.5 lakh workers from North Bengal. Crippled by starvation, unemployment, low wages, inadequate medical facility and to top it off corruption, the lives of plantation workers here has turned into a brewing cup of misery.The picturesque tea gardens in the Dooars region of Bengal spread over Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts account for 330 registered big tea gardens where 186559 families reside.The tea business that witnessed a boom in the mid-1990s is now facing an existential crisis. As per Tea Board data, the number of tea plantations in north India, including in Bengal and the seven northeastern states, had scaled up from 3141 in 1994 to 36836 in 1999. In the Dooars alone, this number went up from 168 to 532 during this period.But the cost of running many of these major plantations shot up and an increasing number of them were shut down over the past decade. This led to many second-generation workers losing their jobs. Uneducated and in search of a living, many turned to breaking stones to make money.Out of the 32 defunct tea gardens across the Dooars, the condition of Nirpania tea garden in Alipurduar is reportedly the worst. Madhu, Bandapani, Dheklapara, Lankapara and Dimdima tea estates have also been shut down for years. With no immediate chance of re-opening, the workers are staring at a bleak future. Taking advantage of their destitution, local contractors, who operate within the closed tea estates, have started exploiting the workers by paying salaries as low as Rs 70 a day.In August this year, thousands of workers finally decided enough was enough and under the banner of Joint Forum of Trade Unions went on strike demanding a hike in their minimum wages.Currently, the prevailing daily wage is Rs 159, whereas the prescribed minimum wages for unskilled agricultural workers in West Bengal is fixed at Rs 244 while the MGNREGA wage is Rs 191 per day.Following a persistent protest, the state labour department on August 29 announced a hike in the minimum wage but the new amount is still unknown. Neighbouring Assam has already proposed a composite daily wage of Rs 351.33 and sought the opinion of tea planters so that it can be finalised.Seeking to get a similar deal in West Bengal, tea plantation workers under the banner of 'Joint Forum of Traders Union' have called for a nationwide strike on January 8 and 9 to voice their demands.Neither the Centre nor the state government is paying heeds to our demands. (The ruling) TMC alleges that the CPI(M) failed to do anything for us, but the present government is also not doing anything. The government is blatantly lying. We dont get ration under Centres flagship programme National rural health mission, which we used to get few months back, rued Mani Darnal, INTUC leader and general secretary of National Union of plantation workers.He says the beautiful landscapes of the hills have been guarding the secret of the state government well. Although Mamata Banerjee has been lauded for her Khadya Sathi (Food Partner) scheme (under which rice is sold at Rs 2 per kg), the starvation deaths in the hills highlight a different reality altogether.Between 2014 and 2015, over 150 starvation deaths were reported in the Dooars and despite the Tea Association refusing to comment on the subject, stray incidents of deaths often pop up from the Bengal hamlets.Ms Banerjee rubbished the reports of deaths and said, her government ensures supply of foodgrains to every single individual and there is not a single person in the state who does not get food. However, contrary to her claims, post demonetisation in 2016, workers in the tea gardens of Darjeeling have on many occasions been left to consume tea leaves in order to appease their hunger. Darjeeling, it must be underlined, alone has 38 registered tea gardens.Not only nutrition, but the tea workers are also deprived of basic amenities such as toilets and access to clean water. Under the Plantation Labour Act of 195, the workers are entitled to basic shelter. However, most of those working in gardens are homeless, shelterless or living on leased lands.Whatever development CM Banerjee has been talking about must have been on paper because, in reality, we dont see anything. Foreign export has tanked and the market rates have fallen drastically. Nobody wants to invest in this business. Only the two Tata and Godrej estates are making profit. There are no proper health or educational institutions, says Raju Nepali, social activist.A sliver of good news is the drop in child trafficking once rampant in the secluded parts of the Dooars. This has fallen since the introduction of state governments flagship programme Kanyashree, Raju added. Under the scheme, underprivileged school going girls are given a cycle to cut down their travel time."
5ce55958e8e3fc56af40b8a6,Is there turkey on your Christmas menu?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/is-there-turkey-on-your-christmas-menu/cid/1679629,2018-12-23,"Sanjit Mondal is mixing something in a plastic tub. Soyabean, bhutta (corn) rice flour, shutki machh or Bombay Duck (a kind of dried fish), seed meal, a mineral and vitamin powder, he rattles off the ingredients list. This is turkey feed and we are at Mondals turkey farm in Sodepur, 20 kilometres north of Calcutta.He continues, This I have to feed them four times a day. They grow very fast; attain maturity by six-and-a-half months and can lay eggs anytime after that.Mondal has been rearing turkey in his four-storey house the past three years. I find him after a spot of reverse investigation. The starting point, a shopping mall advertisement about pre-ordering Christmas meats.Indeed, it is Christmas season and our man is very busy. The turkey is a relatively new entrant to the seasons menu but one that is gaining in popularity. Mondal has just got an order for 100 birds from Siliguri. Some of the other places from where he gets regular orders are Coochbehar, Calcutta, Malda and North Dinajpur.People seem to think this meat is healthy, at least that is what Mondal has gathered. He says, The market in West Bengal is still premature. The demand is low and prices are high. And that perhaps explains the presence of the shy quails, the robust desi roosters, jet black Kadaknath roosters and plump ducks on his farm.The longish hall on the first floor is partitioned into several netted enclosures. One enclosure is chock-a-block with 50 turkeys  there are two more enclosures on the second floor, I am told. The gaggle of birds are most odd-looking. Pale pink head, somewhat like a bald pate, a long neck  part pink, the rest black  and body covered with jet black plumes with white trimmings.There is one of the flock that stands out though. A handsome bird that struts and swaggers from one corner of the enclosure to the other, occasionally stopping to preen. It is quite obvious that he is upset with the advent of inquisitive strangers into what is his private space. He rolls his eyes and the pink of his neck and chin appears flushed  from displeasure, most likely. Mondal cannot say if it is a gobbler (male) or a hen. It is difficult to tell them apart till the birds are about six months old. These birds are younger.The TelegraphMondal, who has been into livestock farming for many years now, bought his first batch of turkeys only three years ago. I got 55 birds at Rs 600 each from Midnapore. But after that I decided I would breed eggs on my own, rear birds and sell them myself. That way, it is more cost-effective. Today, he also manufactures and sells the breeding apparatus.He talks excitedly, quite knowledgeably  clearly no one has had a turkey conversation with him before. No, he cannot say what triggered the turkey farming trend. The bird is not native to India; there are two breeds available here  one from Holland and another from the US.But Mondal holds forth confidently on other specifics  how a turkey is not banquet-fit, in terms of size as well as taste, unless it is at least eight months old. That is when it weighs eight to 10 kilos. More facts: by the time a bird is two years old, it is full-grown and weighs about 20 kilos, the average lifespan of a turkey is 13 years, and so on and so forth.Mondal says a female bird lays about 100 eggs a year but makes an impatient mother-to-be; wont warm the eggs diligently, leading to a lot of wasted eggs.The birds are also apparently most quarrelsome, especially the male of the species. Says Mondal, During breeding season, when we put both the sexes in the same enclosure, the gobblers are forever pecking at each other. We have to be careful. It is not easy to prise them apart. I have lost a couple of birds this way.And has he ever cooked turkey meat himself? Mondals expression relaxes for the first time. Smiling and a tad shy, he says, Yes. Once during Vishwakarma Puja. We cooked it just like we cook chicken kasha (a dry dish). But later someone who lives in the US told me this is not the way to cook a turkey. And then very swiftly his expression changes and he says earnestly, But you know, it didnt taste bad this way either. It was quite good, in fact. In India, curry works."
5ce53b5ee8e3fc56af40ad9e,Mamata Banerjee: Centre making false claims on crop insurance,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-centre-making-false-claims-on-crop-insurance-5511152/,2018-12-26,"Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Wednesday accused the Centre of making false claims of providing crop insurance to farmers in West Bengal.AdvertisingAddressing a public meeting at Mandirbazar area of South 24 Parganas, Mamata said the state government has paid 80 per cent of the insurance payout.The Centre takes away our taxes and gives back a pittance. There is a crop insurance scheme for farmers. How much does the Centre pay? It pays Rs 20 out of Rs 100 and we give Rs 80. The state government gives 80 per cent of the cost. If we can give Rs 80, we can give the rest also. We do not need their pittance. We transferred the amount to the banks and now the Centre is taking credit for it and spreading lies, she said.Explained Measures positive, impact depends on implementation By promising measures such as increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for paddy and dealing with issues regarding middlemen, TMC is attempting to portray a farmer-friendly image ahead of election season. An agricultural expert opined that both moves are positive, especially the decision to rein in middlemen. However, the success of the measures depends on how well they are implemented after the time for poll rhetoric is over.Accusing the Centre of not being serious about addressing the farmers distress, the chief minister claimed her government has taken a lot of initiative for farmers, including raising the MSP for paddy.AdvertisingWe have waived off mutation fees and khajna tax on agricultural land. We have given financial compensation to farmers for natural disasters. We are procuring rice from farmers at Rs 1,750 per quintal (from Rs 1,550 per quintal last year). We are starting a new system  dhan din, cheque nin (give paddy, take cheque) and setting up more procurement centres in interior areas, she said.Reacting to Mamatas comments, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said, The state government has done nothing for the farmers here. They only claim they have done a lot for them.Mamata slammed the BJP for allegedly committing atrocities on members of the minority community and Dalits.Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress chief also announced government jobs to family members of three of her party workers who were recently killed in South 24 Parganas."
