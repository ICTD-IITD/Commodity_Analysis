When the countrys per capita income growth rate is 6.1 per cent, our states rate is 12.48 per cent From agriculture to industry to infrastructure, Bengal has made rapid progress. We have set up 70 new police stations, eight coastal police stations, 19 human rights courts, 45 women police stations and 88 fast-track courts, Mamata said, while addressing the Jangalmahal Utsav in West Midnapore district.Accusing the Left Front of plunging Bengal in a state of penury, she said, For 34 years, these people did nothing yet incurred so much debt and ruined three generations of the state, and now they are talking big. What we have done in mere four and half years, many cant match that even in 400 years.The Chief Minister also attacked the Centre for deducting over Rs 1 lakh crore towards servicing debts incurred by the previous Left Front regime. With an eye on upcoming Assembly polls this year, Mamata enumerated the various social security schemes and harped on the all-round development carried out by her government.From new super specialities hospitals to sick newborn care units (SNCUs), from critical care units to mother and child hubs, from fair price medical shops to diagnostics centres, we have made a lot of infrastructural development in the field of health, Mamata said.The CM further claimed that over seven crore people in the state have been brought under food security scheme. Already 7.7 crore people have been brought under the food security scheme. Rice and wheat are being given at Rs 2 per kg, she said.Mamata countered the oppositions campaigns against her by asking them to shut up. If you can fight, then fight. If you can develop, then do it. If you can accept the challenge then do it. But if you cant, then shut up and let us carry ahead with development, the CM said.The five-day Jangalmahal Utsav would focus on tribal music, folk songs from Bengal and also showcase the handicrafts from the south Bengal tribal region. Mamata also distributed prizes for the Jangalmahal Cup in sports like football, kabaddi and archery held in West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum districts.I love coming to Jangalmahal to see your smiling faces. Talents are in plenty in this region, she said, adding there were over 42,000 participants this year for the Jangalmahal Cup and similar sports events were held in the Sundarbans as well.Mamata, who inaugurated and laid the foundation stones for a bouquet of projects in West Midnapore district, asked all participants to register their names in the employment bank. She allocated funds for the construction of a stadium here and another at Kharagpur.Referring to the steps taken in the tribal areas, she said development of the Kendu leaf collectors and insurance schemes for them have been taken up. The region has immense tourist potentials like Mukutmanipur, Ayodhya Hills and Jhargram Rajbari, the CM said and stressed the need for further development of the entire area to attract tourists.She also expressed hope that the two-day Bengal Global Business Summit, beginning from January 8 in Kolkata, would help develop the region.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Attacks by elephants have been frequent in these areas causing serious injuries to villagers and damage to their homes and vegetation.According to officials of the forest department, the jumbos strayed into the state from Hazaribag after crossing the Subarnarekha river on Friday. On Monday night they entered villages like Putidi, Hensla, Dulmi and Durgu.""They broke the boundary wall of two primary schools and polished off rice that was stored there. Then they moved towards houses and damaged them,"" said Samir Bose who is the ranger there. A total of 28 houses were damaged.Seema Mahato was sleeping on her bed when she heard a loud thud. ""I took my eleven-month-old daughter and ran for my life because I recognised the sound. The elephants had attacked. Seconds after I ran out of my house, a big wall of my house collapsed,"" said Mahato."

A decision was taken to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell to state fair price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from the procurement chain.This has been done by adopting the Centres scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) of foodgrain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and Public Distribution System (PDS). But not all States had switched to it.A finance department report forwarded to the State Food and Civil Supplies Department last month had pointed out major lapses in Maharashtras paddy and rice procurement and warned that a rice scam like the one that occurred in Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was in the making if the millers and the FCI were kept part of the chain any longer. All three States have still kept FCI as part of the procurement chain.Senior officials of the State finance department told The Hindu that a report has been pending approval. The report points out procedural lapses in the existing process, in which paddy procured by the State is sent to a rice mill and the rice is stored in the FCI godowns and later supplied to the PDS shops.The miller was dependent on FCI for verification while he himself was supplying poor quality to pass the verification scrutiny. We had strongly recommended the procedural lapses be corrected earliest, said an official.The State cabinet approved the DPS on Tuesday allowing the State to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers to meet the need of PDS and fair price shops. The scheme will be implemented from March 1, and the responsibility of rolling out the scheme has been left to the State Adivasi Vikas Mahamandal and the State Marketing Federation, and monitoring will be done by district authorities.Under the DCP scheme, the States undertake the responsibility to procure foodgrain, store it scientifically and distribute it through Targeted Public Distribution System.Currently, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala are procuring rice under the decentralised procurement scheme. Due to the decentralised process there has been an increase in procurement of rice in these States, the data shows. The finance departments suggestion has been included in report of the food and civic supplies departments. We have considered those points, reads the note of the cabinet."

590593917be9e04154e002c8,"Assam’s minority report: As the state readies for polls, it would be dangerous to abuse the highly emotive ‘Bangladeshi’ card",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/assams-minority-report-as-the-state-readies-for-polls-it-would-be-dangerous-to-abuse-the-highly-emotive-bangladeshi-card/,2016-01-12,"For five hours, the body of the 15-year-old girl hung on the barbed wire fence, blood streaking her clothes in the January chill, her hair hanging down in a macabre flow. She was shot while climbing over from the Indian side in West Bengal to Bangladesh and was going for her own wedding. Her father had managed to get over unscathed but the child, whose name was Felanee did not make it. That was in 2011. That Felanee was Bangladeshi was uncontested but the killing of an unarmed child sparked a furious outcry against shootings of civilians by BSF on the international boundary.As a result of this incident, Indian border patrols were instructed not to fire live ammunition on suspected intruders (mind you, BSF failed to tackle the real infiltrators, those of armed groups who had skipped across for years, creating mayhem, until the Bangladesh government cracked down and handed over Ulfa, NDFB and Manipuri insurgent leaders to India). Nearly 1,000 persons had been killed in a 10 year period or one death every four days.Those who died included Bangladeshis and Indians, cattle rustlers, petty criminals as well as people who were shot while going about their daily business. Cattle smuggling is a major business along the border; so is human trafficking. Criminal gangs which flourish on either side of the border are unlikely to do so without official connivance.Illegal/informal migration from Bangladesh into India is substantial but there are other interlocking issues. I will focus on two here. One is the scale of the migration  most of the figures I have seen are simply assertions and analysis based on assumptions. The other is the impact that such perceptions are having not just in eastern India, especially in Assam and West Bengal, but also across the country, with antipathy growing against Muslims of Bangla origin.The latter is important especially as Assam is going to the polls in a few months. There appear to be few issues, barring the anti-incumbency factor against the Tarun Gogoi government. That is why one must be extremely careful that the highly emotive Bangladeshi card is not used as a weapon of rhetoric.As far as numbers are concerned, the truth is that decades after the Bangladeshi campaign began in the late 1970s, few have been detected and deported despite many promises. Not even the Centre has a clear idea of how many illegal migrants are in India, not just Assam. For years there has been a sense of fatigue on the issue in Assam.Thus, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi correctly chose statesmanship over local politics by settling the IndoBangladesh land boundary issue, a problem that had been unresolved for decades, he piquantly created a challenge for the Assam unit of his own party which had opposed the deal, claiming it would increase illegal migration.Such complexity is deepened by sweeping media reports which posit a future where Bangladeshi Muslims will be a majority in the state and ignore the fact that it has three major groups of Muslims: Assamese speaking Muslims whose ancestors go back to the 13th century, Muslims of Bangla origin, many of whose ancestors came over 100 years ago, and the post-1971 Bangladeshi Muslims. Indeed, this last point is also conveniently forgotten: those who moved from East Pakistan before 1971are not Bangladeshis.Also ignored is that there is a high fertility and birth rate among Muslims groups in western Assam where large families are the norm. This is a key factor in demographics  especially if one considers the fact that Assam has smaller border with Bangladesh than Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram or West Bengal!There is hostility to in-migration in Assam and the northeast. Most migrants  as the recent movement from Syria shows  seek safe havens. In addition to that, there is greater economic security as Bangladeshs economy has grown to a near middle economy, making risky out-migration less attractive.The combination of selective facts, selective memory and rhetoric can be a deadly combination as seen in 2012 after incidents in western Assam where both Bodos and Muslims were victims. Hate mongering triggered an exodus of lakhs of workers from the region, from places such as Bengaluru. Few locally there would make the distinction between a Bodo, a Naga, a Sikkimese or a Mizo. The northeast is lumped together.What happened in February 1983 should suffice as adequate warning about the vulnerability of this complex area: Over 36 years ago, Aasu launched a powerful anti-immigrant movement that brought successive state governments to their knees, stalled the economy, shut down educational institutions and markets and even blocked oil transportation; in February 1983, the central government forced an election in the state, in the teeth of opposition from Aasu and other anti-immigrant groups. In the ensuing violence, thousands were killed  no one still knows the final toll, but it is said to be well above 3,000  including Muslims of Bengali origin, members of tribal groups, Assamese and other ethnics.The worst massacre was at Nellie, which i covered as a young reporter, in which nearly 2,000 Muslim men, women and children were killed. The sight of hundreds of corpses, of infants, women, old men, huddled on dry rice fields are images which i can never forget. Those who died were certainly not Bangladeshis and had lived there for generations. Their survivors struggle futilely to get justice for the murdered and maimed."

This is a part of the three-day Damodar Mela, unique to the Santhals of Mayurbhanj district and held a day after Makar Sankranti.Over 20,000 people, including women from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, took a dip at the ghat. The tribals believe that the souls of dead persons rest in peace after their ashes are immersed in the holy confluence.Before offering 'pinda' to their forefathers, the tribals immerse the ashes and get their heads tonsured. The offerings placed on three Sal leaves include mud, toothpicks, rice and sweets.""This is a part of their annual ritual called 'Jiling Dahar' or long-term journey. The tribals chant 'Hirla Marangburu Hirla Marangburu' (We are under you) to appease their presiding deity,"" said a tribal researcher Sukadev Murmu.The Santhals also distribute articles belonging to the dead among their community people at the ghat on this day. ""We gave away my father's clothes, torchlight, umbrella, glasses and a folding bed that he used. It is our tradition and we have been following it since time immemorial,"" said Saiba Marandi.The ghat gained prominence during the rule of Pratap Chandra Bhanj Deo, the last king of the Bhanja dynasty in the erstwhile princely state of Mayurbhanj. Earlier, the Santhals used to trek all the way to Thakurbadi, a place near Gopiballavpur in West Bengal, to immerse the urns in the Subarnarekha river.""The tribe observe three rituals - Tel Nahaan, Naieta and Bhandan. Naieta is performed at Baruni Ghat,"" said secretary of Society for Research and Development of Tribal Culture Gurva Soren.The district administration had made elaborate arrangements for smooth conduct of the three-day event."
58f4fe1460de470aa339e3fa,Paddy politics: nose cut off to spite face,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160122/jsp/bengal/story_65242.jsp,2016-01-22,"Jan. 21: The Mamata Banerjee government's plan to buy 45 lakh tonnes of paddy directly from farmers to boost food security has hit a roadblock as ruling party activists have prevented farmers loyal to the Left from selling their produce. The procurement target was increased by over two fold compared to last year's target of 22 lakh tonnes as Mamata has plans to bring more people under the subsidised rice scheme when the National Food Security Act is introduced in the state on January 27. Two Nadia farmers, Sushil Ghosh and Samar Ghosh in Hanskhali block, have lodged complaints with the district authorities saying they were prevented from selling paddy on January 18 when they went to a government kisan mandi. Sources said several other farmers from other blocks in Naida also alleged that they were being prevented from selling paddy because they were CPM supporters. Under the food security act, 6.01 crore people would get subsidised rice from the Centre. The state would give cheap rice to another 1.7 crore people. Till now, a total of 3.2 crore people in Bengal used to get subsidised rice, but from January 27 the number of beneficiaries would increase to 7.7 crore. The state has to procure 45 lakh tonnes for all the beneficiaries. Senior government officials said the state needed more farmers to come up to sell their produce so that it could achieve the procurement target. ""To procure 45 lakh tonnes of paddy, you require at least 1.5 lakh farmers to sell 30 quintals of paddy each to the government.... There are lakhs of sympathisers of Left parties in rural areas. It is not possible to meet the target by bypassing those farmers,"" said a senior food department official. Jyotipriya Mallick, the food and supplies minister, said he was ""not aware of this particular case. But farmers cannot be divided based on political identity."" As the elections approach, the ruling party cannot afford to be selective in terms of reaching out to farmers. Before coming to power, Trinamul used to question the faulty BPL lists of the Left government, saying the Front was selective in giving benefits to the poor. ""It had left an impact in rural areas and was reflected in the results of 2011 polls when the Left parties lost their support base,"" said a senior state minister. ""The finance department has already sanctioned a sum of Rs 1,000 crore.... But politics at the ground level could put the entire exercise in trouble,"" said a minister. The momentum for procurement has been slow, said government sources. Reports of the food and supplies department till Wednesday showed that 12.9 lakh tonnes of paddy was bought, when the state needed to procure the maximum quantum of paddy between November and January. ""The kharif crop, harvested between October and November, produces 110 lakh tonnes of 155 lakh tonnes of total paddy grown in Bengal. If we cannot buy the maximum quantum by January, we may fall short of the target as small farmers sell off their paddy in the local market even at a cheaper rate as they have to repay loans,"" said a senior official. In Nadia's Hanskhali, farmer Sushil Ghosh said Trinamul Krishnaganj MLA Satyajit Biswas was to blame for the paddy sale block on Left-sympathiser farmers. Biswas denied the allegations, saying it was ""conspired by the CPM to malign me before the polls. I just told the officials not take rice which has dust."" He said he had told officials ""to prepare a list so that they (farmers who were turned away) could be given a fresh chance before procurement is finished."" From September last year, the government started procuring paddy across the state through the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation Limited at a rate of Rs 1,410 a quintal. If the farmer brings the paddy to a kisan mandi, he gets Rs 15 more for each quintal as the state wants to promote the rural markets for such direct sale. Sushil said when he went to the mandi with 18 quintals of paddy on January 18, some Trinamul activists did not let him enter the market. Sushil said he somehow managed to speak to the procurement officer, who told him his paddy could not be bought. Sushil, who is a CPM member in the Hanshkhali panchayat samiti, said he had taken paddy to the mandi after cleaning it. ""First of all, I was not allowed to enter. Second, none of my sacks was opened and examined. I am not a dishonest person to contaminate my rice with dust."""
594064d97be9e024e459871f,Mamata’s masterstroke ahead of polls: foodgrain at Rs 2/kg for 80% of Bengal population,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/mamatas-masterstroke-ahead-of-polls-foodgrain-at-rs-2kg-for-80-of-bengal-population/,2016-01-28,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata BanerjeeLAUNCHING A scheme that promises to provide rice and wheat at subsidised rate to over 7 crore people, almost 80 per cent of the states population, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday slammed the opposition party for being blind to the states development.From today, 7 crore people in Bengal will receive rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg. I am thankful to the farmers of Bengal for contributing to the stock of grains required for Khadya Sathi, Mamata said after launching the scheme from Red Road.As much as 15 lakh metric tonnes of rice have already been procured, which is more than our target of 10 lakh metric tonnes. The Krishak Mandis have been instrumental in the procurement process. Out of 176 Krishak Mandis, 120-130 are already up and running. We have been providing help to the people of Singur who lost their land, the CM asserted.The much publicised Khadya Sathi scheme, which aims to ensure that 70 lakh people in the state get subsidised food and cereals at half the market price while over 7 crore people would receive 5 kg of food grain every month at Rs 2 per kg, will prove vital in the upcoming elections, TMC leaders believe.The scheme, according to government officials, targets the poor and very poor, many of whom who arent covered under the National Food Security Act.The CM took took the opportunity to attack the CPM, which, she said, has been claiming about no development in the state. They cannot see. I will ask them to open their eyes. I think either they do not want to see the progress or they are sleeping, Mamata said.I talk less and work more. I keep myself busy with work.. Do not make me open my mouth..I will give a fitting reply at the right time, she added.She also accused the central government of reducing allotments for important social programmes like integrated child development services. The Centre can stop them but we cannot stop the benefits being extended to the people of our state. It is our responsibility towards the people, we cannot step back on that promise and commitment.Mamata was quick to point out that the seven crore people who would benefit from the scheme included those communities that the opposition claims have been found wanting  those living in the Jangalmahal region, malnourished tea garden workers and their families, people of Singur who lost their land to acquisition and other homeless in the state.They have been suffering for a long time We have announced a Rs 100 crore package for them. Family of a worker of a closed garden will get Rs 1,500 and rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg, she said. The farmers of Singur would continue to get a monthly allowance from the state government till the court takes a call on the return of their land, the CM said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
58f4d22e60de470aa339c360,Gift Pack,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160204/jsp/opinion/story_67296.jsp,2016-02-04,"Recently, the state education minister declared that shoes would be distributed free of cost among students studying at the primary level in government schools of West Bengal. Reportedly, the chief minister had been so ""touched"" on finding barefoot children in a primary school that she immediately advised the education department to provide them with shoes. Later, the education minister said that this scheme is being undertaken to attract more students to school. This is a touching gesture, no doubt, although one wonders why the chief minister had not noticed the lack before, or happened to notice it in this particular year of the assembly elections. Besides, it is not just primary students who often go without shoes. In the rural and semi-urban areas of the state, the sight of older children walking barefoot to school is fairly common. (If their feet are shod at all, it would usually be with torn slippers or with ""kito"", the cheap, locally-made sandals that are famous for giving blisters.) However, given the way malnutrition impedes the growth of children in poorer families - a reality brought to the fore by the recent National Family Health Survey, which shows that 34 per cent of children under five years are stunted in the rural areas of West Bengal - Mamata Banerjee could easily have mistaken some secondary-level students as primary-level children. A teacher who works at a government school in Gosaba said that she felt as if she was holding a bird when she had to pick up and carry a Class-VII student who had fainted in the classroom. That child had fainted out of hunger. Her breakfast had consisted of a cup of tea with a single biscuit while the previous night's dinner had been a bowl of muri. With the midday meal, slated at 2 pm, still a long way to go, the child had slumped in her seat in the middle of the first half before the lunch break. Incidentally, this child had no warm clothes on even in these wintry days. Perhaps Banerjee should visit some of these rural schools and announce a scheme to distribute free cardigans. It is not that the state government's plans of luring students to school by giving them anything from free textbooks to cycles or shoes is not working. The cycles, for example, are sure to increase attendance although many students are selling off their gift cycles because they are defective. As for the shoes, one doubts how long they will serve their purpose since, in all probability, they, too, will be of poor quality. Most of Banerjee's plans to improve the condition of students skim the surface while the real problems continue to roil in the depths. There is no point in cladding children's feet in shoes if they continue to remain half-clad above the feet, go hungry to school and cannot do well in studies because of impaired cognitive skills resulting from malnutrition. The anganwadi system, meant to provide pre-school education, nutrition and basic healthcare to children till the age of six, is run in a perfunctory manner in most of the rural areas of Bengal. At such a centre in the interiors of Howrah, I found the children showing little or no interest in the khichdi, which is their daily fare. There have been several complaints that the daal and the rice used in the khichdi are substandard. The cooks complain that they cannot make the meals tastier because the allotment amount for ingredients such as oil and spices is meagre and fixed. According to the latest NFHS, 53.7 per cent of the children under five years in Bengal are anaemic. If Banerjee really cares about the poorer children in her state, she can start by making the anganwadi system more efficient. The process of learning will get easier for children once their health gets better. Gifts of shoes or cycles may or may not give Banerjee success in the elections but it certainly cannot do the children any real good."

It is a relatively new oil and we want to create this new category for consumers, he said .Emamis rice bran oil is priced at Rs 90 per litre, which is Rs 2-3 higher than the average price of sunflower oils in the market.Our challenge lies in converting sunflower oil consumers, which is the biggest market segment here, to rice bran oil consumers. We plan sampling sessions across the state and hope to cover at least 20 per cent market share of the households in Karnataka by the end of this year, he said.The company has allocated a marketing budget of Rs 15 crore in Karnataka for this year. We believe that a market share of 20 per cent of the sunflower oil market here, by this year-end, will be good enough momentum for us, he added.Within six months of launch, Emami has been able to capture 50 per cent of the rice bran oil market in West Bengal, claims Agarwal. The success of Karnataka will determine further expansion for the company, he posits."

The meeting took place at the State Secretariat.The development comes after a number of issues cropped up regarding the implementation of the governments related initiative including delay in the issuing of digital ration cards and confusion among beneficiaries about the procedure.The issue of many deserving candidates being left out of the State and Central governments new list regarding food security has sparked protests in various parts of the State. The protests often turned violent as in some cases ration dealers were assaulted by the agitators.With the Opposition parties targeting the State Government over the issue, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked them not to politicise the matter. She alleged that ration dealers backed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were creating problems.During the day, State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused the Chief Minister of complicating the process of ensuring food security by trying project a Central scheme as her own.Meanwhile Paschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity, an organisation working for landless peasants, has pointed out that in implementing the National Food Security Act, the State Government was already spent Rs.1,930 crore.In a press statement issued during the day, the Samity said: It (State Government) has now plans to spend another Rs.2,300 crore to provide everyone under the NFSA with Rs.2 rice and for the two State schemes.Welcoming the decision, they urged the government to ensure adequate funds, infrastructure and smooth administrative functioning in this regard.Many deserving candidates have been allegedly left out of the list of beneficiaries"

(Express Photo)Pitching once again for an alliance with Congress in the coming Assembly elections in West Bengal, senior CPM leader and former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday said people want such a tie-up to oust the ruling Trinamool Congress.Everyone is talking about a tie-up. You need to understand why people are talking about the alliance. The priority at the moment is to get rid of the TMC from here and thus, individuals and political parties should come together for that, said Bhattacharjee while addressing a party rally in Barrackpore in North-24 Parganas district.There can be differences in political ideologies but that should take a backseat at the moment. There is a single-point agenda, which is to defeat TMC, he added.This is the second time that the former chief minister has openly spoken in favour of an alliance. The first time was in January in a rally in Singur.Senior CPM leader Gautam Deb, too, asserted that an alliance with the Congress was imminent. We will go to Delhi and a decision would be taken there. The Trinamool has to be taught a lesson, Deb said.Lashing out at the Mamata Banerjee-led government, Bhattacharjee said the TMC had driven out existing industries from the state and prevented new ones to come. Two software giants  Infosys and Wipro  had tried to set up their units here, providing employment to at least 10,000 persons. It didnt happen because of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. When she was the rail minister, she had announced big ambitious projects at Sankrail, Dankuni and Kanchrapara. Foundation stones for all those projects were laid but none of those took off, Bhattacharjee said.Alleging that the state has gone backwards in terms of industrialisation in the last four-and-a-half years, the former CM said, We wanted to bring in heavy industries such as steel, automobiles and petrochemicals, but Mamata says industries of puffed rice and fritters should be set up here. The state is going backwards.He said the TMC government has destroyed the health care, education system in Bengal. Where are the super-speciality hospitals that she claims that the present government has put up? No new colleges and universities have come up. All she is doing is painting the flyovers and structures put up by us, into blue and white, Bhattacharjee said.Alleging indifference of the state government towards the plight of closed tea garden workers in North Bengal, the Politburo member said, Currently, we are witnessing that tea gardens are being shut one after the other leading to starvation deaths almost every day. However, the Chief Minister is more interested in utsavs.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The opposition party had organised the procession to protest against alleged mismanagement in distribution of new digital food security cards and ration cards by the West Bengal government.The CPM claimed that the Trinamool Congress engineered the incident, a charge denied by the ruling party.The bombs were hurled in Raina block while the procession was passing by Shyamsundar College, SP Kunal Agarwal said. Ten people have been detained and a police picket has been posted in the area, he added.The deceased was identified as Swapan Mallik (50). The injured were taken to hospital and the condition of two of them was stated to be critical, the police said.Share This Article Related Article Blast at Trinamool office in Burdwan: Police claim no body found yet, BJP demands NIA probeBlast at Trinamool office in Burdwan: Police claim no body found yet, BJP demands NIA probe West Bengal Assembly elections: Before rule of law, lawlessnessWest Bengal Assembly elections: Before rule of law, lawlessness West Bengal election 2016: Day after polls, clashes continueWest Bengal election 2016: Day after polls, clashes continue On tied seat,Left-Cong tie a possibilityOn tied seat,Left-Cong tie a possibility Blood spills in Left citadelBlood spills in Left citadel Trinamool men die in Burdwan police firingCPM district secretariat member Uday Sarkar said the party led the procession and submitted a deputation to Raina I Block Development Officer on alleged anomalies in distribution of cards for implementation of the Food Security Act. CPM supporters were omitted from the list of beneficiaries, he claimed.After submitting the deputation, while the procession was returning, bombs were hurled from the roof of Shyamsundar College hostel by TMC workers, Sarkar alleged. The party has lodged an FIR, he added.Subhas Mondal, TMCs district youth wing president and observer for Raina, denied any role of the party in the incident. Claiming that CPM workers terrorised the area in the name of submitting the deputation to the BDO, he questioned why the procession went to the college for the purpose.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee launched the new food security-cum-subsidised rationing system on January 27, called Khadya Sathi. Under the scheme, 7 crore out of the total population of 9 core in the state would get rice at Rs 2 a kg and other subsidised food rations. The old ration cards are now being replaced with digital ones and this has caused some problems, said government officials. The CM described the hitches as teething trouble. She also blamed the present disruptions on CPM-backed dealers and agents in the rationing system.The CPM, on the other hand, has been demonstrating against the alleged dislocation in the ration supply chain of BPL and APL food supply in rural areas.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Is it a populist budget on the eve of the elections?It is true that the election is round the corner, but this budget is a continuation of the five presented by former finance minister K M Mani. The mantra of the UDF government has been development and care. There should be development, but with a human face There is a section of the population that needs special, urgent care. They cannot wait for the fruits of development to reach them.Which are these sections?We have prioritised. Those who are mentally retarded, those suffering from cerebral palsy, autism etc they need special attention. We have given huge priority to the health sector. The issue Kerala is facing today is not hunger but access to affordable health-care. Kerala has the best medical treatment but it is not affordable to all The plight of women deserted by their husbands is really sad. We have announced pension for them and free education for their children.What will be your USP for the elections?Kerala has lagged in development The last five years have seen an infrastructure growth like never before. Three major projects  Vizhinjam port, Kochi Metro and airport in Kannur  have taken off. We are building 100 bridges in 400 days. The decision to shut down bars has made a qualitative change in society, flow of liquor mafia money has come down. Suicides have come down, there is a decrease in crime It was my government that started promoting start-ups. It has drawn up a start-up policy We decided to offer 25 kg free rice a month to BPL families, which will benefit 90 lakh people.How confident are you about the polls?We have been winning elections despite all these allegations. When we came to power we only had a majority of two MLAs and many thought we would not complete six months, but we are completing five years. During these five years, I have ensured my government has not functioned like a government that does not have a huge majority For instance, before the bar scandal came up, there was speculation about K M Mani, that he may leave the UDF, but I was sure nothing would happen.But have the controversies affected the image of the party and the government?The people of Kerala know the truth. What are they (opposition) raking up? Biju Radhakrishnan (main accused in the solar scam), who was accused of murdering his wife, was walking free when the LDF was in power. When we came to power, we appointed a team and a special prosecutor. Radhakrishnan had only been charged with sections relating to atrocities on women, but we added the charge of murder and today he is behind bars, awarded a life sentence. It is natural that he would turn against the government and me. There was an allegation that the Left offered Rs 10 crore to that woman (Saritha Nair) but we never attacked the CPM with that because we know we should not trust the claims of a woman who is facing 33 cases But the CPM is doing that because they have nothing else to say.What about your personal image? After K Karunakaran, no other chief minister has faced such personal allegations.K Karunakaran has nothing to do with the spy case. This controversy will in effect only benefit me because the people understand who are levelling these allegations and what their motive is. Look at the bar case. Many had advised us not to shut down bars, we did not care. A section of them said they would bring down my government, but did not succeed. They went to court, but did not get a favourable verdict. A section of them have lost their mental balanceDo you regret taking that decision?I have no regrets and my government will not go back I would not have the strength to fight if there was even one per cent truth in these allegations. I have been crucified for doing a good thing. They are trying to directly implicate me as an accused in all these cases had they said we are not implicating the chief minister directly but he has a moral responsibility, I would have been in a fix.But dont you have a moral responsibility?They (opposition) are not saying that.I am asking.Let that be. They are saying I am responsible, which I cannot accept because I am innocent. And that gives me more strength, the strength of conscience to fight back.Why didnt you file a defamation case over Sarithas claims?Who should I file against? A person who has been sentenced to life imprisonment or a person who is facing 33 cases? My son will file a case. I have appointed a commission. Let the commission decide.Had you resigned when the allegation first came up, do you think the controversy would not have come to this stage and your family could have been spared?These are baseless allegations. I had appointed the commission on their demand. But the CPM did not join, they dont even have a chit of paper as evidence against me. When the commission called them, they merely reiterated the allegations they had levelled in the assembly. I dare them to prove three things  whether the exchequer has lost even a rupee, whether the government has given any benefit to them, and whether there was an laxity in fighting the casesBut the Opposition says Saritha benefited because of your meetings with her. She advertised her so-called proximity with you to collect funds.V S Achuthanandan and (former minister) A K Balan advertised them first. They (Team Solar) sponsored their programme, attended by Achuthanandan and Balan in 2010. Kairali (CPMs news channel) interviewed him as the MD of a big company. They (LDF government) did not pursue a single case against them They were arrested but the government intervened and said these are civil cases and protected them. They (the accused) used the names of Narendra Modi, P Chidambaram and Farooq Abdullah. They say they have given me Rs 1.90 crore but could not even get a letter from my office. They forged my letterhead and they have been sentenced for that forgery.Sreedharan Nair, the complainant in the case, said he gave her money after he and Saritha met with you.Lets examine that. He entered into an agreement and gave three cheques. He came to meet me after two of those had been encashed, only the third cheque was enchased after he met me. This is a big fraud. I appeared before the commission and completed my testimony in two hours. After that I said I was ready to sit there and face all cross questions. I sat there for 14 hours.. Radhakrishnans advocate asked me cross questions, but not even a single question was asked by that womans lawyer. She had raised serious allegations and that was the platform to ask questions, but they didnt.The Opposition talks about inconsistencies in your statements about your meeting with her.I never said I havent met her. My office is always full of people. She may have come to give a representation When Radhakrishnan came to complain about her, I couldnt place her. He reminded me that they had come to give a representation. The controversy began when it came to light that two or three people in my office used to talk to her over phone. I ordered an inquiry and those three people were asked to stay away He (Radhakrishnan) spoke to me about his family matters.These allegations against you and leaders close to you, have anything to do with internal Congress politics?Nothing. The Congress is united, the UDF is united. This is a trick of a demoralised CPM.Will you be the face of Congress in the elections?I cannot say. The Congress never decides chief ministers in advance. The party leadership will decide.But you will contest?I cannot say that. The party will decide. There is no fighting in the Congress on those matters like there is in the CPM.What is your view on a possible alliance with the CPM in West Bengal?We are not opposing anything, whatever the stand in Bengal, because we have complete confidence that we will retain power in Kerala. We dont fear that an alliance in Bengal would help the BJP or the CPM here Let the high command and the Bengal unit decide.How do you see the style of functioning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?I have difference of opinion with many of the decisions taken by Modi. The most important is scrapping the well-established, well-accepted Planning Commission without putting in place an alternative mechanism. It was a short-sighted and wrong decision. Besides, the BJP used to speak a lot about price rise. During UPA there was a huge surge in prices of crude oil in the international market. Prices have come down by a third, but the benefit has not been passed on to the people. We have passed on the benefit. We told the state road transport corporation to slash fares by a rupee. We will tell private bus operators to follow suit.Rahul Gandhi has said only the Congress can defeat the Congress. Will factionalism cost the party?I agree with him. If the Congress remains united and the UDF remain united, the people of Kerala will remain with us. We will return to power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But last year's dry spell was worse and the panchayat is still recuperating from its harsh effects. Farmers, who make up 25% of the population in the panchayat, had a tough time growing paddy because 80% of the cultivable land depends on rainwater.The crisis is severe in this part of the state and even government schemes have failed to bring respite. Several canals have been built, but most remain dry throughout the year. This year, the villagers of Dharambahal had to buy rice as the produce was not enough. The 20% irrigable area depends on lakes and dams, which are also affected in summer.Ghatsila block agriculture officer Patit Pavan Ghosh said though the government has installed tube-wells in the villages, ""groundwater level recedes by 5-7ft every year during summer and the villagers have to depend on the limited supply"".Ratan Murmu, mukhiya of Chunuri village, said, ""Recently, the SDO court has planned to dig deep boring wells, but they don't realize that this will lead to the drying up of other wells and escalate the crisis. The government formulates laws but does not realize the consequences of their implementation.""The villagers have been protesting against the state's plan to dig borewells, but without any result. When asked, Ghosh said, ""It all depends on the method of boring and if it is done properly, it will help the villagers.""In Paoro, another village in the panchayat, villagers have similar problems. S K Murmu, a local leader, said they have huge areas of land near the Burudih dam where they cultivate vegetables, ""but this year there hasn't been enough yield"".Ashok Naik, a farmer at Phuldungri, said they could not sell their vegetables to West Bengal as the produce was too low. While the state has not offered much help, the villagers recall the arrival of a team from the central government to gauge the drought situation.The Centre approved Rs 336.94 crore relief for Jharkhand last month, the villagers are still sceptical. Ratan Murmu said, ""The (relief) money always gets lost among middlemen and hardly reaches the poor. We can only wait and see if things are different this time.""But Ghosh sounded hopeful. ""We have been granted relief and several blocks in other districts have been short-listed for receiving the money. We are hoping that in a month or two, our farmers in Ghatsila will also receive the compensation,"" he added.Till then, the villagers' wait for both government and rain relief continues."

According to latest reports, the male elephant had entered the Nadia district.We tried to tranquillise the tusker. It had strayed into muddy rice fields. Though we arranged for vehicles to bring the animal to the main road, it died after the tranquilisation, a senior forest official told The Hindu .A herd of elephants had strayed into Bardhaman from adjoining Bankura district on Saturday night. The tusker accompanied by another elephant started moving through the paddy fields of Bardhaman, considered the rice bowl of West Bengal.A 19-year-old boy was the first to be attacked by the pachyderm. He sustained major injuries and was being treated at a government hospital. The elephant then attacked and killed two persons, identified as Annakali Roy (62) and Narayan Majhi (69), in Bhatar. From there, the jumbos moved to Manteshwar, killing two more persons, Prakash Goria (45) and Suraj Seth (38).At the Denur village, forest officials attempted to tranquillise the animal. Locals said that after several hours, with the help of chains, vehicles and huge belts, the elephant was driven away from the paddy fields. However, forest officials said the tusker had succumbed to the tranquiliser darts by then, adding that it was later buried in a forest in Kaksa.Another herd of elephants killed a farmer, Anil Bagdi (64), in the early hours of Monday in Kashpur area of the district, taking the total toll to five.Major concernMan-elephant conflict has emerged as a major concern in south Bengal where small patches of forests are surrounded by large farmlands. Elephants from the Dalma Forest range often migrate to south Bengal from Jharkhand and due to the fragmented nature of forests, the pachyderms often stray into human habitations.Over the past 10 years, at least 240 persons and more than 50 elephants have died in the forests of south Bengal."

""She behaves like a 'shehanshah'(emperor ) these days,"" he said, as he accused her of failing to bring about any change in the state.Modi while hitting hit out at the ruling TMC on the issue of corruption from ""Saradha (scam) to Narada (sting operation)"", alleged that its leaders are reportedly asking when will they get the ""next instalment"" of bribe.""I want to ask the people of Bengal did they vote in favour of corruption? Have the people formed the government for the sake of corruption? First Saradha then Narada (sting operation).

Communists and Congress are contesting in Kerala and Bengal. While they are fighting and baying for each other in Kerala, they are playing a game behind the curtains in Bengal. In Kerala they do wrestling and in Bengal, they do friendship. This is a challenge to the wisdom of Bengalis.""Are they not challenging the wisdom of Bengal and insulting that?

The Left and Congress did not carry out any movement against TMC. It is BJP which has lost workers and faced trouble as it is fighting TMC.""Modi said his government has proved that corruption can be controlled if there is a will.""The solution to every problem is development. The previous government in Delhi (centre) had its hands painted black in coal block scam. But after we came to power we did coal block auction with transparency. It brought a lot of money in Indian exchequer,"" he said.Modi also took a dig at claims made by Mamata Banerjee about providing rice at Rs 2 per kg to poor people.""We provide a subsidy of Rs 27 per kg for the poor.

In Uttar Pradesh, Ballia is most prone to arsenic contamination followed by Bahraich, Rae Bareli, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Meerut, Chandoli and many more.The technology is ready for field trials. Senior NBRI scientist Debasis Chakrabarty, who conducted the research recently, visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippine and discussed the possibilities of field trials. The institute in principal agreed to help in this regard.""The institute invited us to become familiar with ongoing research work at NBRI and has agreed in principle to conduct field trials subjected to clearance by governments of both countries,"" said Chakrabarty, head of the eight-member team, which carried out research published recently in an international journal 'Metallomics' published by 'Royal Society of Chemistry'.The scientists said the transgenic rice has 'arsenic methyl transferase', a gene isolated from a fungus that accumulates less arsenic and would be less toxic.He explained that arsenic present in groundwater percolates in soil during irrigation and contaminates rice with arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure through groundwater contamination affects more than 150 million people worldwide and over 500 million people in Ganga, Meghna and Brahmputra areas.Rice is the crop most susceptible to absorbing arsenic during cultivation. Cultivating rice varieties that accumulate less amount of arsenic can tackle the challenge of exposure to carcinogens (cancer causing elements) that affect population in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha."

Starvation doesnt need to be imagined in Bengal, its not a distant memory  the word still conjures up images of gaunt ribs, filthy rags and lethargic limbs with unnerving clarity.The reasons for TMCs confidence that their rice politics in the state will surmount all other criticism are rooted firmly in history. In the list of achievements that Mamata Banerjee reiterates at every election rally, is her extension of the National Food Security Act  increasing its reach from 3.5 crore people to 6.5 crore  that is, over 70 per cent of the states population  as her prime achievement.The Bengal famine of 1943 and consequent cases of what the government euphemestically refers to as hunger deaths or death due to chronic ailments neglected in the past have entrenched hunger as a vital issue during elections. The many representations of hunger by artists ranging from Chittaprosad, Somnath Hore, Ramkinkar formed the iconography for hunger in the post-colonial Bengal.In 1944, the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA) toured Bengal with their dramas documenting famine, hunger and the struggle to live  prime among them was Bijon Bhattacharyas play Nabanna (New Harvest). Images from filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen have combined to form the backbone of Bengals collective conscience. Even today the names of these artists, their stories and work are passed on from generation to generation, in some cases even substituting bedtime tales, embedding hunger into the very culture of Bengal.It comes as no surprise then that hunger has traditionally been the electoral issue that rises above all else. The Tebhaga movement initiated by the Communist Party in Bengal from 1946-1947, demanding the rights for landless peasants formed the foundation of the partys future dominance in the state. This was followed by the Food Movement of 1959, a turning point in the political history of the state when food insecurity threatened yet another famine in the state. Protests at Writers Building saw clashes with the police, leaving 80 dead. As young Jyoti Basu compared the incident to Jallianwalabagh in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, cornering the Congress government and cementing his own political status.After coming to power in 1977, the Left Front government amended the Land Reforms Act, making cultivation absentia an exclusionary clause for eviction of sharecroppers  they were to be provided rights and the place of crop share was shifted to sharecroppers homestead plots.Even in the days of its decline, West Bengal politics saw hunger taking centre stage. Subsidised rice was introduced by the Centre and the Left Front government in Bengal in 2009, covering 2.64 crore people living below the poverty line. It soon became the prime incentive offered in areas affected by Left-wing extremism to wean tribals away from Maoists.Mamata Banerjee is not unaware of this. At Silda, an hour away from Belpahari where many had died of hunger in 2004, Mamata Banerjee is introduced as the Anna Data  goddess of food  by her party members. She speaks in detail of the Belpahari famine in 2004, squarely blames the previous Left Front government and reiterates her governments promise of providing food to all. It is no accident that the new secretariat in the state is named Nabanna  after Bijon Bhattacharyas play on famine, nor was it was a mere knee-jerk-reaction when she delinked ration cards from the food distribution scheme.Concerns have been raised in all quarters over whether the available stocks would keep pace with meeting the demand. By March, 300 rice mills had shut down, citing falling prices, shrinking exports as the key reasons. But these are questions that the Mamata Banerjee government is content to leave for later.Right now, as conversations in tea shops and street corners are dominated by du takae chal (rice at Rs 2), some uncomfortable questions are already being asked  how long can this last, where will the money to pay for the rice come from and most importantly what happens if the rice runs out?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Their votes will go to the one local community leaders will suggest. We dont know which symbol stands for which party. Our village headman will advise us on whom to vote, admitted Jyotilal Hansda, a land tiller hailing from the Santhal community. He was speaking for his wife, Hela, and his son, Karmu, who will be voting for the first time this year. Jyotilal and his familys immediate concerns are four square meals. Their source of subsistence is a kind of gruel, made of steamed rice kept overnight in a bowl of water.The accompaniment is often one burnt tomato mashed in with chillies, both vegetables grown in the familys less than half an acre plot. As Jyotilal talked to Deccan Herald on a searing hot, summer afternoon, slurping in his share of the gruel from a plastic bowl, he said that things have always been like this for them.The village headmen instructed which symbol to cast their vote for and they pressed the button next to the suggested symbol, be it the twin flowers and a blade of grass, representing Trinamool Congress, the hammer-sickle-star of the Left or the Congresss upright palm. Jyotilal, however, finds the reigning government acceptable ever since Mamata started providing rice at Rs 2 a kg. Proper roads snaking through the village, an electricity connection, which keeps the two LED lamps, also a part of the governments largesse, and a deep tube-well that mostly provides clean water, have made him believe that this government is good. Now weve the things we need the most. The field provides us with basic vegetables and the nearby ration shop supplies us a monthly quota of 15 Kg rice at Rs 2, he said. Waving her arms around the singe-storey house, with two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, Hela pointed at the walls and talked of how the house with public funds have helped her family survive the extreme temperatures of Purulia, where on summer days the mercury often touches 47 degrees Celsius and in winters it dips down to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius.Even though the house has been built under Indira Awas Yojana, a Central government scheme, she and Jyotilal believe the present government is to be thanked.Baleshwar Majhi, a landless worker mostly dependent on 100 days work under MGNREGA, however, does not seem happy with Mamata.Although not sure who Mamata is, he does not believe she has done much for people like him. Theres hardly any work available. We wish the government arranged for more work, he said. Like most men from his community, he finds solace in drinking undistilled country liquor, made by fermenting day-old rice in water. Political developments mean nothing for him and he does not know of the changes around, he admitted.I have never even seen this man in my life, he said, pointing at a poster of Nepal Mahato, the sitting Congress MLA, who is fighting to retain his seat. When posed the question to him, he asked, Who should I vote for? The village headman, who did not want to be named, admitted that most voters in the area are like Jyotilal and Baleshwar. Affiliated to the Congress, he hopes the villagers will cast for the symbol of his choice and help his candidate regain the seat.DH News Service"

Express photo by Partha Paul. CM Mamata Banerjee with Taldangra assembly constituency TMC candidate Samir Chakraborty Actor turned politician MP Moon Moon Sen during election campaign at Taldangra, Bankura district, West Bengal on March 30, 2016. Express photo by Partha Paul.Launching another scathing attack on the Opposition, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday claimed that the Trinamool Congress would return to power again, and unlike 2011, she would no longer be polite after the Assembly election results are declared.Reiterating her claim that the CPM had unleashed a reign of terror against opposition during its 34-year rule in the state, Mamata alleged that even now they are continuing with such practice. Nine TMC workers have been killed in the state since elections were declared. Election will be over after a month. We will remain here after that. We will not spare any of them (Opposition parties). We had shown enough manners after we won the last Assembly elections. Not anymore, Mamata said while addressing a public meeting at Taldangra area in Bankura district.Referring to the recent sting operation carried out by the news portal Narada News, which purportedly showed several senior TMC leader accepting bribe from a fictitious company, the Trinamool chief said, The CPM leaders have built property worth thousands of crores and now they are calling the TMC thieves, a party which is comparatively younger. Once we are back (in power), we will ask for the accounts of their properties and they will have to answer us.Mamata also claimed that the TMC was no longer a young sapling which would need protection but a mighty tree which stood on its own strength.Taking a dig at the electoral understanding between the Congress and CPM, the CM said those parties which needed support to survive are creepers. CPM has proved that it has no principle after it joined hands with Congress. Both the shameless parties have come together, she said.Canvassing support for her party candidate Sameer Chakraborty in Taldangra, a seat which has been won by CPM for the last 39 years, the Trinamool chief said the Opposition party had not done anything for the people there.Talking about the lack of infrastructure and civic amenities here, Mamata said,The CPM had only converted this place into a breeding place for terror. In the last four years of the TMC government, I have worked for Bankura by setting up the Bankura University, provided four super-speciality hospitals, and started an ambitious water supply project worth Rs 1,100 crore that would benefit around 34 lakh people when completed in two phases.A Rs 1,200-crore water supply project has also been taken up in neighbouring Purulia district, she added.She also alleged that some of the officials of the coordination committees who supported the CPM had tried to sabotage the project under which the state government provided rice and wheat for Rs 2 a kg.Attacking the Centre, Mamata said the BJP government was a dalal (agent) for CPM and Congress. The BJP should rather watch out in Delhi where its government might not stay for another term, rather than trying to form a government in Bengal.Meanwhile, in another rally in Kharagpur, Mamata rooted for Trinamool Congress candidate Ramprasad Tiwari and said the pending development works in the constituency will be a priority work for the government if her party comes to power.I have known Gyan Singh Sohan Pal for long and have great respect for him. Still, I think much needs to be done for Kharagpurs development and Trinamool Congress will do that if it gets the opportunity, the CM said. Gyan Singh, fondly called chacha by his admirers, is the Congress-Left Front alliance candidate from IIT and Railway town Kharagpur, from where he has won consecutive times. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh is also contesting from the seat.CPM has been the arch rivals of Congress for over three decades and many Congress workers were murdered during the Left Front regime. Yet, their lust for power is such that they have now formed a poll alliance. People will defeat them and give them a befitting reply, she said."
58f50a077be9e018510a210e,There is a new flame in the forest,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/opinion/story_77293.jsp,2016-03-31,"The term, Jangalmahal, is a misnomer. On my way to Gopiballavpur from Jhargram, I spotted several bald patches in the sal forests on either side of the silken highway that snaked its way through the green canopy that is no longer dense. Bands of sunlight flooded the forest floor where trees had been felled. I was in West Midnapore to get a feel of the imminent elections. Voting would take place in six constituencies in Jangalmahal, including Gopiballavpur, Salboni and Nayagram, on April 4, the day assembly elections begin in West Bengal. Elections energize metropolitan journalists. They suddenly muster the energy to travel to remote areas in a bid to bring to public attention the gaps that exist between the State's claims of development and the bleak ground reality. Their reports, which examine the chasm between promise and delivery of Constitutional entitlements - food, shelter, education, employment - are a democracy's tool-kit to assess the performance of an elected dispensation. But I was travelling in Jangalmahal's pockets - Lodhasuli, Gopiballavpur, Nayagram, Salboni and Jamboni - with a different agenda. I wanted to understand the differences in the way development is perceived by the State and by Jangalmahal's adivasi citizens. My first stop was the Subarnarekha College in Gopiballavpur. The college, which takes its name from the river that lay dry and lifeless nearby, is spacious. But the infrastructure, especially some of the rooms meant for teachers, are small and shabby. Two teachers led me to a lecture room so that I could interact with the students. Many of them, I was told, live in distant villages and had to travel some distance to reach the college. The conversation, expectedly, started with an appraisal of the Trinamul Congress's performance in the constituency. (Chudamani Mahato of the TMC is the sitting MLA.) The students appeared to be satisfied with the condition of the roads, even though buses are not available in some parts after dusk, making commuting difficult, especially for the infirm and for patients. The girl students admitted that some of them had faced harassment - bureaucratic delays as well as insensitive remarks by officials - during their visits to panchayat offices to claim funds under the Kanyashree scheme. A super-speciality hospital has come up in Gopiballavpur (picture, below). But skilled doctors rarely take up postings here. (I visited the hospital the same evening, but could not find either the superintendent or a senior physician to corroborate the allegation.) Other places in West Midnapore have also witnessed frenetic construction activities after the near-annihilation of the Maoist movement. Metalled roads are no longer a dream. Lalgarh, over 60 kilometres away from Gopiballavpur, now has a polytechnic institute as well as a training centre for nurses. Nayagram and Salboni have received new colleges and stadiums and have also been promised modern healthcare. Yet, it was evident that the first glimpses of the State's version of the development process have not weakened the resolve of some segments of adivasi society to express their anxieties concerning the survival of their identity and of indigenous culture. Santhali had been included in the Eighth Schedule years ago (2003). The students voiced their anger with the government's neglect of local dialects and scripts. (The manifesto of the TMC is available in Alchiki though.) The State's attempts to revive vanishing performance arts traditions were also dismissed as elitist and cosmetic. A student who had participated in the Jangalmahal Utsav admitted that she had found the experience of performing on a concrete stage quite alienating. There were also complaints of interventions on the part of the organizers that had led to scripts and performances losing their authenticity during the extravaganza. Their experience of cultural alienation reopens an older debate concerning the reorganization of states. Purulia, which was carved out of adivasi-dominated Manbhum, was made a part of West Bengal. The students were critical of not just the apathy that is causing the slow death of languages but also the government's neglect of heritage structures. Interestingly, not all of these mansions are built by rulers from the adivasi community. In Jhargram, where I was based, I had been struck by the effort - a joint initiative between the state government and the resident royal family- to restore the rajbari. But Chilkigarh palace and the ancient temples on its premises - they can be reached after a brief trek through a forest that was alive with the calls of playful langurs - lie in a state of ruin (picture, below). My conversations with the respondents - students, villagers and activists - made it apparent that a fine line still separates the people from the State. For instance, the former held back from welfare projects that do not complement adivasi sensibilities. Some among them have also begun to differentiate between fundamental rights and political allowances. The cynicism of the students towards subsidized food grain, as opposed to their popularity in Amlasole, is a case in point. Equally telling was the propensity to perceive the manifestations of State welfare - especially the cultural festivals - as dubious initiatives to pollute and co-opt the remaining segments of a shrinking society that has resisted adulteration by modernity. The anxiety is emblematic of the state of siege - real and imagined - that pervades the community's consciousness. The willingness of Jangalmahal's tribal people to insulate - fortify is a better term - themselves from some kinds of State intervention probably stems from a heightened awareness of the pitfalls of identity politics. Adivasi identity was the plinth that supported the Lalgarh movement that had initially been led by the Peoples' Committee Against Police Atrocities. But its appropriation by the Maoists, and, later, its disintegration under political and military pressure has made the community wary of institutional efforts to revive indigenous culture. These tensions are inevitable, given the State's refusal to view development as a layered, but organically linked, idea that brings with it not just motorable roads, schools and hospitals but also helps nurture the fraying links between a community and its culture. From Gopiballavpur, I headed for Nayagram, near the border with Odisha. The landscape changed dramatically. The pucca road turned into a dirt track; agricultural fields gave way to shrub land; only the thinning forest remained unchanged. (The forest officials I met later attributed their inability to check felling to the lack of manpower and funds as well as the nexus between the political establishment and the timber mafia.) In Bihankuria village, I had expected the adivasi families to talk about such measures as the provision of 35 kilogrammes of rice at two rupees or the decision to raise the price of kendu leaves. Instead, the animated discussion turned towards the falling water table, the disappearance of local trees such as piyal, the proliferation of the eucalyptus, and sand mining that has ravaged the Subarnarekha. The ecological crisis in Jangalmahal has gone unrepresented in the political manifestos of all contending parties. Before I left the village, I was given mahua fruits that were being dried. I asked my host if this was a ritual associated with departure. He laughed and said that this was not a gift, but a relic. If I were to visit him again, he was not sure if I would find the mahua trees. I was expected to visit Jamboni and Binpur the following day. As I made my way back from Nayagram, I wondered whether the day's conversations were indicative of an emerging charter of development, one which was far more holistic than the model that has been imposed upon the people by the State. Health and education are priorities. So is employment. Data from the government suggest that over 30,000 people from Jangalmahal have found employment not in industry or agriculture but within the various tiers of the robust security apparatus that is still in place. (I was asked to produce my identity papers twice by the Central Reserve Police Force during my sojourn.) The devastation that has been wrought in Jangalmahal's environment and culture certainly registers in the people's engagement with the idea of development. Whether this consciousness is new remains unclear to me. It could be that the adivasi notion of progress is inherently inclusive. It could also be that education and improved connectivity with the city have brought about a sharpening of perception regarding their own needs. Or that the issues raised by the 'bon party' - the term used to describe Maoists - such as the community's rights over natural resources, linger in public memory. But I did get the impression that Jangalmahal has decided to renew its faith in the democratic apparatus, its limitations notwithstanding, in a bid to negotiate its demands with the State. The armed insurrection, and its crippling consequences, continue to haunt the people. The bon party's ideology and tactic stand discredited. The forest seemed to agree with my thoughts. On a road bathed in the falling light, I noticed the fire lines that had been lit by the forest department shimmering among the trees. Yet this was not the fire that had threatened to burn down the forest. This was a new kind of fire, a flickering flame, that had set the forest alight."

New roads in place of dirt roads snaked through the smallest of villages. Long-standing problem of rural electrification has been taken care of and drinking water crisis has been mitigated to some extent. Yet, the Trinamool leadership seems somewhat shaky over its chances.Since 2011, Mamata has put up a brave front, claiming to have taken care of development in impoverished districts like Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore.Welfare measures like rice at Rs 2 a kilo, laying foundation of colleges, super speciality hospitals, besides distributing largesse in the form of bicycles and educational grants to girl students have somewhat changed the face of rural Bengal. What could mar Mamatas chances is the complex arithmetic of tribal and Dalit aspirations. Constant campaign by the combined forces of the Left-Congress on one hand and BJP on the other, on the issue of graft could also leave a mark.Seemingly an urban issue, a controversial footage showing top Trinamool leaders receiving illegal cash payments, has reached villages.If the Left-Congress combine hammered the issue through poll graphiti, BJP went a step further, distributing DVDs of the footage to grassroots workers, who are screening these at street corners and markets. If that is not all, at Jungle Mahal, Mamatas strongest contender will be Jharkhand Party (Naren), an outfit with significant sphere of influence over the regions tribal populace. The outfit could cause serious damage on April 11, set aside for Jungle Mahal, owing to security concerns due to its Maoist-affected area tag.Being a region with several sensitive booths, the Election Commission has decided on aerial surveillance with two helicopters making rounds during polling hours. As per schedule, 49 Assembly constituencies across West Midnapore, Burdwan, Bankura and Puruliawill go to polls on these two days. Ground reports suggest what initially seemed like a cakewalk for Trinamool, might not be so with doubts having crept in over the last fortnight, both within the ruling party and the electorate. For now, Mamata will have to wait till results are out on May 19 and allay whatever apprehensions she might have over anti-incumbency and talks of graft overshadowing her plank of overall development."

Our earlier alliance with CPM was not an intimate one. It was a very weak alliance. This alliance with CPM is a much stronger one, says Mahato.Asked whether voters will feel betrayed by his change in position, he said, It is not as if they are unaware of the misdeeds of Trinamool leaders. There is television everywhere now, and they all have read about the corruption in the party, says Mahato.Even the rehabilitated Maoists will vote for us. They dont side with TMC. The government has done nothing for them, only given jobs to some leaders, but virtually nothing for the foot soldiers, he added.Mahatos election campaign focussed on debunking myths about Mamata Banerjees Rs 2-a-kilo rice scheme. People need to know that this is a central government scheme. She keeps shouting about it, but people are not stupid. The tribals here have connections with neighbouring villages in Jharkhand, where the government gives rice at Rs 1 a kilo, he said.If elected, Mahato said he would work on providing proper drinking water and a scientific way of irrigation for farmers in the area."

He had a fall two days back and the pain it inflicted is excruciating. To know whether it's a fracture, he needs to travel 32km to Bandwan or 39km to the Belpahari primary healthcentre. Wary of the journey, he chose to stay back in his Bokdoba home and bear the pain. But on Monday, he stepped out of his home, rode pillion and covered 7km on a bicycle to cast his vote at Minardihi.Thakuran, his wife Gurubari, son Sobharam and daughter-in-law were among 120 voters from 32 homes in their village who braved the heat and the distance to exercise their franchise. Till even a few years back, this was impossible.Thakuran's daughter, Jagori, as a teen had ran away from her home and transformed into a brutal Maoist commander in Jangalmahal. Jagori had taken up arms and mandated people not to vote. Her name cropped up after every major Maoist attack, including the Silda massacre, and she was accused in over 30 cases.In 2011 November, when she surrendered with her husband Rajaram Soren and their only child, Chandan, now 10, she gave up her arms. She also transferred her voter ID from Belpahari to her Durgapur home.""Jagori last came to meet us in April 2013. She stayed for a few hours and left,"" said Gurubari.

It adorns their non-descript home in Bokdoba now.Her daughter may have chose to repose faith in the Mamata Banerjee government, but Gurubari isn't willing to commit yet. ""I will vote for development, for a better life. Yes, we get rice at Rs 2/kg and police or rangers (read CRPF) don't question as anymore, but there is more to be done. We get an old-age pension of Rs 1000. Is this enough to lead a decent life?"" she shot back.Gurubari's nighbour Saraswati Baskey added, ""We have only one deep tube-well here. The water isn't fit for drinking. We have to source our water from a 40-ft deep well. There is a primary school here but the nearest high school is in Belpahari.

His success and sociable attitude earned him the AIUDF ticket from Gossaigaon, which falls in the Bodoland Territorial Council and has usually been represented by either a Bodo tribal or an adivasi, who are more in number.Mine is the only Telugu family in this constituency and my candidature speaks volumes of the assimilative nature of Assam, said Kasireddy, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Andhra University.Kasireddy too hopes to sail through on the strength of Muslim voters, who have gravitated towards the AIUDF after a series of communal riots since 2012. But he knows incumbent Majendra Narzary of Bodoland Peoples Front, a BJP ally, and Ashim Hasda of Congress are strong contenders."

A wall on East Behala constituency depicts the complexity Lahiri is talking about.IT WAS 2 pm and Subhasis Roy, 42, had not taken a break since the morning. The Trinamool Congress worker from Alimuddin Street, where the CPM headquarters is housed, doubles as the graffiti painter for the local party office. We have to finish this work before evening, said Roy, a former student of Government College of Art and Craft.The work was a piece of graffiti depicting what he called the unholy marriage of CPM and the Congress in West Bengal. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and CPM leader Surjya Kanta Mishra seem to be stuck in a tussle. The Congress leader asks the CPM leader to not run away, the CPM leader seems to be muttering a halfhearted word of assurance. The hand and the sickle too seem precariously poised against each other.The graffiti is one of many in a battle being waged on the walls of Bengal.In a state where ugly vinyl hoardings of candidates in filmstar-like poses had taken over most walls and public buildings, graffiti reflecting creativity and wit are making a comeback. Even in the 2011 assembly elections, the few graffiti on display ranged between the prosaic and the very prosaic. Hammer and sickle peered out cautiously between twin flowers, and somewhere on the side a name would be squeezed. There was little of wit or aesthetics.There has been a systematic decline of humour in public life in West Bengal. So, when I see graffiti that are acerbic and funny, I feel hopeful, said veteran cartoonist Chandi Lahiri. During the era of Bidhan Chandra Roy and Siddhartha Shankar Ray, we had the creative freedom to lampoon leaders of the ruling party. Most of my cartoons were used by opposition leaders for graffiti. But during Left rule, we were forced to exercise caution. This year, the satire seems better, more complex.A wall on East Behala constituency depicts the complexity Lahiri is talking about. A bus with route no 420 on it is depicted on a city road. Signage beside it says the bus goes to Narada and Saradha via Kalighat, where Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee lives. At a corner of the graffiti, bold letters say the Trinamool is so corrupt that no one will buy it even on OLX.This used to be the kind of graffiti that would adorn the walls of Bengal in the 1960s and 1970s. Lahiri gives the example of his favourite creation, a 1960 graffiti in Kolkata that showed a donkey refusing to eat rice offered by then state minister of food Prafulla Chandra Sen. The rice that we got in the market was of pitiful quality. It used to be full of kankar, or grit. We used to call that variety of rice kankarbati, he said.But during CPM rule, Lahiri had to think twice before designing any graffiti that then chief minister Jyoti Basu could deem offensive. Since I was a cartoonist with a leading Bengali newspaper, I was issued a press card. I used to visit the Assembly during sessions to observe the visage of leaders. However, after an anti-CPM graffiti of mine became particularly popular, the state refused to renew my press card, he said..Political graffiti are supposed to depict hard reality in a lighthearted manner, feels graphic novelist Sarnath Banerjee. Political graffiti is an example of true satire, he said. In Kolkata, we saw some really acerbic examples of them Historically, graffiti has always been a guerrilla art form. People from the fringes of society would express their dissent and mock mainstream society on walls.The themes of the graffiti of Trinamool and the opposition CPM and Congress also depict their campaigning tactics. While most CPM and Congress graffiti attack Mamata Banerjee on the Narada sting operation, the Sarada controversy and womens safety in the state, the Trinamools graffiti mock the alliance of CPM and Congress, once such bitter rivals in the state.In East Behala, a wall shows a harassed woman surrounded by names of places where rape cases were reported in the past few years  Park Street, Kamduni, Madhyamgram. One in Howrah depicts the Vivekananda flyover collapse.The slogan in Bengali reads, Trinamool has taken bribes, the flyover has come crashing down."
58f599bd7be9e01a357a3e7c,Rice and fall of great desi crop: India has lost 1.10 lakh traditional varieties,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Rice-and-fall-of-great-desi-crop-India-has-lost-110-lakh-traditional-varieties/articleshow/51861214.cms,2016-04-17,"Rice varieties that could grow during droughts or floods, tolerate saltwater, and carry distinct aromas or medicinal benefits - India has lost 1.10 lakh such traditional rice types. Some fifty years ago, these varieties abounded in the country, which is striving currently to ensure food security for all. Now, however, only 7,000odd local varieties remain and not all are grown.A traditional variety of rice is passed from generation to generation and family to family .""It took almost 12,000 years for these diverse varieties to be created,"" said Dr Debal Deb, a rice conservationist and a biologist.""We destroyed or lost them in just 30 years or so. This is the sad state of our heritage.""Deb has preserved 1,200 desi rice varieties, which were showcased in a unique two-day rice exhibition in Ahmedabad, organized by the Ahmedabad Heritage Venture Lab (AHVL). In all, 1,800 varieties were displayed at the exhibition.""Some varieties can grow without a single drop of water. Others can be grown in ponds that are 3 to 4 feet deep. A few grow even under 12 feet of water,"" Deb said. Rice varieties such as Jugal have two rice grains in one kernel, and Sateen has three.According to Deb, some traditional rice varieties have high levels of micronutrients. Despite billions of dollars of investment, companies have not been able to create genetically modified crop which can pack more micronu trients than the in digenous variants.The value of tradi tional varieties be comes even more important in the imate change, which wake of climate change, which results in shifting rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures.The availability of local varieties is crucial as modern agriculture relies only on limited varieties.Deb blames the green revolution and high yielding hybrid seeds for the extinction of traditional seeds. He also rued the fact that not a single government research institute has evinced interest in carrying out research on local rice varieties because they are not linked to gross domestic product or biotechnology .Since 1996, Deb has been engaged in conservation of hundreds of traditional rice varieties with his extensive germplasm-collection expeditions across 11 states of India.Deb has founded India's largest non-governmental rice gene bank called Vrihi (Sanskrit for rice) and has conserved 1,120 varieties in situ. He runs a research farm called Basudha in Odisha.Gujarat had over 250 varieties of milletA lthough Gujarat may not have many traditional rice varieties, over 250 indigenous varieties of millets were found in the state and most of them are lost now.O ut of the 1,200 varieties preserved and conserved by Deb, one traditional variety called `Garib Sal' has silver in it. This variety was found in one district of West Bengal. The rice was found to be have silver in it. This is the first time a plant was discovered where silver was absorbed from the land. However, this variety is not grown presently anywhere in the country. This type of rice may have been used for medicinal purposes. It is assumed that it was given to people gastric infections as silver kills germs. ""We came across this rice grain while looking for varieties having metals such as iron and zinc,"" Deb added."

As he puts the phone on hold, he quickly verifies the caller's location and voting rights in the state. The software in his computer then helps him narrow down the exact nature of the complaint: defacement of property, display of firearms, gift distribution, liquor and tobacco distribution, token distribution, et al.If it is about gift distribution, Mathu gives the complainant a few more options  is it distribution of cell phones, clothes and towels, gas cylinders, CFL bulbs, rice bags, or utensils? Once the complaint is registered in the control room located on the seventh floor of Fort St George Building in Chennai, the flying squad stationed nearest to the place of the alleged gift distribution gets an auto-generated text message. Mathu or any of his 39 colleagues in the control room of the state's chief electoral office can check the GPS-enabled map on the wall and verify whether the flying squad concerned is actually moving towards the location or not. ""Thanks to technology, our response time to a complaint has gone down from three hours earlier to three minutes in this election. We have about 700 flying squads in Tamil Nadu, but we have taken a call to increase it further. Also, we are deploying 400 income-tax officials to conduct raids, if necessary,"" says Rajesh Lakhoni, chief electoral officer of Tamil Nadu, adding that a deterrent environment is indispensable to contain the growing menace of cash and liquor used in elections. His office has further coordinated with telecom providers to look at mass mobile recharge among voters, and also held discussions with traders' associations to check token-in-lieu-of-cash, a practice often deployed by candidates to avoid large cash movement during elections.A flying squad, which comprises a team of enforcers from the police and income-tax department, is allowed to seize cash beyond Rs 50,000 carried by one person in a poll-bound state. In Tamil Nadu, where elections will be held only in the last phase, May 16, Rs 24.05 crore in cash was seized by flying squads till April 12, although some seized cash had been returned after it was proven that the money was not carried for poll-related reasons. The other poll-bound states are not lagging behind. For example, in Assam, where elections were over on April 11, Rs 12.33 crore was seized. In West Bengal where elections are on till May 5, Rs 11.96 crore in cash was seized whereas in Kerala, Rs 10.4 crore was seized till April 12.If the seizure during the 2014 parliamentary polls in these four states is considered, liquor and ganja are also a big menace, particularly in West Bengal and Assam. In West Bengal, 8.4 lakh litres of liquor and 1,396 kg of ganja were seized in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, whereas in Assam, the figure stood at 3.1 lakh litres of liquor and 566 kg of ganja, according to the data of the Election Commission of India. The data on liquor and ganja distributed in this round of polls is not readily available. Election commissioner Om Prakash Rawat concedes that those who are using black money in elections are ""creative people"" and one step ahead of the EC machinery chasing them. In a first, this time, the EC has spotted instances of ambulances being used for carrying cash.Rawat does not rule out the use of foreign money in Indian elections. ""Until we catch someone, we can't say money from foreign nations also flows in during elections. But I don't rule out the possibility altogether.... In West Bengal, we have caught a hawala transaction this time. Fake currency notes were also recovered by our flying squads both in Assam and West Bengal,"" he says.As this writer travelled in three of the four election-bound states  Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu  and interacted with political parties, candidates and voters  two things emerged very clearly. First, the use of cash and liquor is a common practice across states going to elections, and the state machinery is nowhere near the culprits. Second, distribution of cash in Tamil Nadu, in particular, is much more organised and open than in other states, something which forced the EC to deploy more forces in that state, including 400 additional I-T officials with a mandate to raid houses. Flying squads are not authorised to undertake raids in houses.The Chennai-based secretariat of Tamil Nadu's chief electoral officer, Lakhoni, has been receiving about 6,000 calls every day, out of which about 200 are pure complaints, the rest being queries and suggestions. If the statistics on cash and gift distribution are factored in, the process of bribing the voters in Tamil Nadu has begun early this time.Between March 4 and April 9, as many as 45 complaints in Tamil Nadu were on distribution of clothes, towels and dhotis, 61 were on liquor, 151 on money distribution, 6 on distribution of ornaments and 61 on ""other gifts"". Remember, on April 9, not all candidates were finalised; nomination process was yet to begin and elections were over a month away.The creativity of the culprits comes to the fore when the complainants tell EC officials about the modus operandi for the distribution of cash. As on April 9, Tamil Nadu saw three cases of cash distribution through milkmen, a practice generally deployed by candidates only in the last few days of the poll. Then, there were six cases where newspaper hawkers were roped in to distribute cash, and in two other cases, cash reached voters along with tobacco products. Former MP and DMK secretary TKS Elangovan says his party does not indulge in cash distribution to woo voters though there were complaints against the party that it recharged the mobile phones of voters in Madurai area during the last assembly polls. ""I deny any charge of the DMK distributing money. This election will be fought on issues, not money power. The voters this time won't favour the AIADMK even if it distributes money"", he says. ET Magazine could not elicit a response from the AIADMK.The voters do acknowledge that political parties resort to distributing cash and gifts to woo them. ""Yes, various methods are used to get votes. Many voters take the decision only at the last minute,"" says E Thangavelu, 53, who worked in a Royal Enfield bike factory in Ranipet in Tamil Nadu before joining his wife's flower shop in the temple town of Kanchipuram. He repeatedly says that he has never taken any ""bribe from political agents"" and will not do so this time either. Saravanan, 42, who sells saris in Kanchipuram, concedes that ""token system"" was prevalent in earlier elections. ""I have heard there are stringent rules this time. Many shopkeepers may not accept tokens this time,"" he says. The voters are usually given tokens for denominations like Rs 500, Rs 1,000 etc, with which they can buy anything from designated shops in the locality. The candidates, through their middlemen, later settle the debt with shopkeepers. For EC's enforcement agencies, the tokens have posed a bigger challenge than the movement of hard cash. After all, they are trained to seize cash, not tackle tokens."

In Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, voters generally speak up with enthusiasm on who they will vote for and why. Its a different story in a state where political violence has claimed thousands of lives over the last four decades. Hinterland common folk are uneasy about revealing their preference. A dozen variations of the expression, dekhte hobe (well have to see), is what one gets to hear.In a climate of fierce political partisanship, where one is often forced to choose sides, staying anonymous looks like a safer option for survival. Even so, journeying through the picture-postcard villages of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and the stunted expanse of Malda district in north Bengal, one gathers that the Mamata Banerjee government enjoys a fairly positive rating among the rural impoverished.Several marginalised farmers and daily wagers admit to benefiting from state welfare schemes. According to them, PDS functions better than ever. Rice is readily available for Rs 2 (shades of Raman Singhs Chhattisgarh government here) and atta for Rs 3.50 a kg.Like Bihars Nitish Kumar government in its previous avatar, the TMC government has distributed thousands of bicycles among needy school students. These bicycles, painted a political shade of blue, stand out. Miles of roads in rural areas have been laid with fresh tar.Many would love to lump Mamata alongside Lalu Prasad, a mass leader hardly associated with progress. But evidence shows she is closer to the development-driven Nitish. Its possible to argue that TMC lacks a long-term vision for the state. But in contrast to the small-town and mofussil middle-class who are less than satisfied with TMCs five-year performance, the underprivileged in north Bengals countryside have generally positive things to say about her tenure. This class also seems relatively indifferent to the scams (Saradha, Rose Valley) that have put Mamatas party on the backfoot in recent weeks.Throughout north Bengal, flags of the Left parties and Congress flutter on trees and poles like conjoined twins. The erstwhile bitter rivals are new comrades-in-arms. Political alliances, for all their compulsions and contradictions, can be electoral master strokes. Last year, for instance, when RJD supremo Lalu and JD(U)s Nitish rediscovered each other to combat BJP, Bihars caste calculus tilted decisively in favour of the two Mandalites and a piggybacking Congress.In Bengal, this is the question everybody wants a definitive answer to: Is the Left-Congress alliance working on the ground as it unofficially did during the Siliguri municipal elections last year? What one can say for sure is that the unlikely union has energised the duos cadres and party workers, hugely demoralised after the thrashing in the 2011 state polls and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The jot (alliance) and the fervent wish that it can synergise votes is the hook both parties have hung their hopes on.Any election is also about managing public perception. In that regard, the pact has reasonably succeeded. The allies are sharing stage, attending mohalla booth meetings, even occasionally shouting Inquilab Zindabad together. At least publicly, theres a show of unity.But will party workers of both Congress and Left Front, divided for years by ideology and memories of hate, be honest to that public show of bonding inside the polling booth? It appears that a fair percentage of vote transfer among party workers could happen on that account. And thats primarily because theres an increasing realisation that another electoral setback could be ruinous to their future.However, the same may not hold true for the ordinary party voter, who might walk his own line. Most pre-election opinion polls have given a majority to TMC, in greater or lesser degree. But the alliance, boosted by the surround sound of those who benefited during the 34 years of Left rule, has partially dented the self-confidence of TMC. Whether it is enough to alter the final outcome is another matter.Amidst this battle for the top slot, BJP has marked its physical presence far and deep. From the lush hamlets of Jalpaiguri to the water-parched villages of Malda district to the forest areas of Alipurduar, the saffron flag can be seen in most corners of north Bengal.In the 2014 Lok Sabha poll where BJP got 17.02% votes, pundits attributed the surge to the Modi wave. Thats partly true. Over the years, RSS as well as its political wing have set up base in dozens of villages. Shakhas are common.Broadly speaking, their support base includes sections of SCs (rajbonshis, namasudras), a small portion of STs, parts of the non-Bengali population and the anti-Left, anti-Congress middle class. The party stands a chance in Baisnabnagar and Kalchini assembly seats. Its vote-share should be far higher than the 4.06% it got in 2011 assembly polls. However, the 17% peak of LS 2014 could still be a bridge too far. BJP is a party in search of an articulate and widely-accepted local leader.PS: Another saffron votary is making his presence visibly felt. His visage can be seen outside every shop peddling his goods even in the border outposts of north Bengal. No other businessman comes close. Guess who? Baba Ramdev."

(Express Photo by Subham Dutta) The body of Sheikh Fazal Haque, a CPM polling agent who was killed Thursday night, reaches his village Friday. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Simmering tension in a West Bengal village split in two political halves erupted on Thursday night when a CPI(M) worker and a polling agent of the party were allegedly hacked to death by TMC supporters, hours after voting ended in the third phase of Assembly elections in the state.According to police and residents of Lodhna village in the Khandaghosh Assembly constituency of Bardhaman, polling agent Sheikh Fazal Haque (56) and Dukhi Ram Dal (56) were attacked with lathis and iron rods as they were returning home at about 8 pm on Thursday.The two were rushed to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital but died soon after, police said.While both parties blamed each other for the clash that led to the killings, police officers traced the violence to a political upheaval in 2011 when the TMC made deep inroads into what had been a Left stronghold since 1942.So much so, that Lodhna, on the banks of the Damodar river, has since split into two halves  Gainpara, comprising TMC sympathisers, and Metepara, which has stuck with the Left. Haque and Dal were from Metepara. Thursdays attack took place on a narrow bridge connecting Gainpara and Metepara, said police.After an explosion, it seems Haque tried to flee but got entangled in some netting on the edge of a field and was killed there. Dal was chased for a while and then hacked, said Sub-Inspector Mohammad Saifuddin, who was on duty in the area at the time of the incident.One live bomb and residue from several exploded bombs were later recovered from the site, said police.According to a senior police officer, tension escalated after CPI(M)s sitting MLA Nabin Chandra Bag moved to the TMC last November and announced that he would be contesting the Assembly elections.In 2011, the TMC had won 15 of the 25 Assembly seats from the district, with the Congress winning one and the Left Front taking eight. This time, with the Left-Congress alignment threatening to eat into the ruling partys tally, the TMC has been desperate to retain control. While 40-year-old Bag bagged the TMC ticket this time, 30-year-old Asima Roy was the CPI(M) candidate from Khandaghosh, a reserved constituency.A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo) A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo)Here, politics isnt something that ends with elections. The party high command has promised us that we will win in this election. So we are fighting for our party, doing what we can. This is a fight for survival. If TMC wins the elections, we will be killed, said Bijoy Dal, the 35-year-old son of Dukhi Ram Dal.Violence is a way of life here, said an officer at the Khandaghosh police station. This village is notorious for its production of hand-made guns, bombs and fake gold coins. Earlier, when the Left was in power, such villages in Khandaghosh were impossible to enter, he said, adding that three TMC workers were killed during clashes in the Khandaghosh area last June.Most of the villagers at Lodhna  part of West Bengals rice belt  are descendants of sharecroppers who were given land in the 1970s as part of land reforms pioneered by the Left. Being a CPI(M) worker in a village like this used to be a job in itself. It was something we could fall back on in case of emergencies. That changed with the TMC coming into power. So many people are now joining the TMC and voting for them, said Mohammad Rafique, a 65-year-old farmer.Family members of the two killed on Thursday and CPI(M) workers in the village alleged that Haque and Dal were returning home after polling when they were ambushed by over 100 TMC workers armed with knives, sticks, iron rods and bombs.But police said the deaths were caused by clashes between both parties. The CPI(M) workers tried to attack TMC workers but were ambushed instead. No arrests have been made. But we have detained four men and are questioning those who were present there. We will investigate the matter, said Deputy Superintendent of Police D Bhattacharya.But family members of the deceased alleged that police failed to heed repeated warnings of an impending attack by TMC supporters. I had warned police that there would be violence. They are cooking up this story of us attacking them. The simple fact is we dont have the kind of numbers anymore to pull off an attack. About a month ago, I was attacked and had my ribs fractured. The police did nothing, alleged Dal.TMC candidate Bag and the partys block president Alok Majhi denied allegations of their workers involvement in the violence.Describing the attack, SI Saifuddin said, It was very dark about a 100-odd men appeared with knives and bombs. Apart from me, there were five other personnel from the Central armed forces. We were hopelessly outnumbered. We tried to disperse them with a lathi-charge but couldnt.What has added to the resentment among CPI(M) supporters in the village is the discovery of a live bomb from the site almost 20 hours after the attack. The bomb, weighing about 250 gm, was spotted by a TV journalist, said police.Even after we informed police about the bomb, it took them about another half an hour to remove it, alleged Ayesha Begum, a local resident.Said SI Saifuddin, I checked the site myself and found nothing. It is possible the bomb may have been placed later by some mischievous elements.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Accusing them of inaction, Sonia warned against 'ahankari shaktiyan' (arrogant forces) lurking in Bengal.""We supported Trinamool Congress in 2011after they promised to work for the development of Bengal. However, after coming to power, Mamata dumped all her promises. Now, she is beating her drum on development. What kind of development has taken place in this state? Industries have wound up and unemployment is rampant. Youths are migrating to other states in search of jobs. There is corruption. A flyover came crashing down. People have loan burdens worth thousands of crores on their heads. There is a saying that one fish can foul the entire pond. In West Bengal, the atmosphere has been fouled in such a manner that even the hilsa has fled from its rivers. Now, the state has to import hilsa,"" Sonia said.At Canning in South 24-Parganas, where the majority of the population depends of fishing and agriculture, the Congress chief spoke on how fishermen have suffered under Mamata and Modi.""While Mamata has left the fishermen to their own plight, the BJP at the Centre is snatching their livelihood by allowing foreign trawlers to fish in Indian waters. When the Modi government has been unable to save the country's fish, how can it be expected to protect the borders? The Pathankot incident is an example. Bengal also led the country in rice production. Now, rice mills are closing down and the state has to import rice. Both Mamata and Modi assured jobs but nearly 3 crore people still apply for jobs under MGNREGA every day. This shows that there are no jobs. All that the Modi government has done is cut allocations for our policies for women and backward classes,"" Sonia added.According to her, the Modi government is a threat to democracy, secularism and the multi-cultural ethos of the country. She claimed that it was the Congress that set up institutions that made the country great over 60 years of its rule. These institutions are now at threat from organisations like the RSS, she alleged. ""Before the Trinamool came to power, they begged for votes. Now, they are threatening people to vote for them. Both Mamata and Modi are two faces of the same coin. They will destroy the state. Do not fall into their trap. We are fighting the elections with the Left this time for the development of West Bengal,"" Sonia said."

Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons.Tearing into the ruling Trinamool Congress government, BJP national president Amit Shah on Wednesday said the Mamata Banerjee-led dispensation was worse than the previous Left rule.Five years ago people of Bengal voted for a change because it was required to end the 34 years of misrule by the Left. But after five years we see that the TMC government had been worse than the Communist rule. Now they want another change, Shah said while addressing a public rally at Bhawanipur constituency from where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting.Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons. He said the Trinamool government could have cancelled the contract for building if, as they said, they were unhappy with the project.The flyover didnt fall down due to wind. It collapsed because of the syndicate. All materials  cement, iron, etc are supplied by Trinamool. The flyover is a symbol of corruption, he alleged.Syndicate is a racket for milking builders in the name of supplying inferior construction materials at a premium by people backed by political parties.Continuing his attack against the Mamata government, Shah said the TMC had changed the names of many central schemes and claimed they were being sponsored by the state government. Jan Dhan Yojana is being touted as a state government scheme as is the Rs 2-per-kg rice for the poor. The fact that the Centre pays a subsidy of Rs 27 a kg of rice is never spoken of, he charged.Further, he said, I dont know what else Mamata is but the whole country knows that she is a great painter whose work had been sold for over Rs 1 crore, likely bought by those involved in the Saradha scam .Slamming the Congress-CPM alliance in West Bengal, Shah said that while Rahul Gandhi and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee were sharing stage here, they were criticising each other in Kerala. It proves that these parties are not for any principles but only for their political interests, to retain their seats, he said.The CPM-Congress poll understanding is not a joth (alliance) but a ghot (nexus). We are waiting to see what these parties do in Rajya Sabha, Shah added.Urging people to vote for Netajis grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who is the BJP candidate from Bhawanipur constituency, Shah said, This is your opportunity to pay tribute to Netaji. Defeating the TMC in this seat can change the whole state as CMs loss at her home turf will send the required message across the state.If voted to power, Shah claimed that BJP would stop infiltration from neighbouring Bangladesh into West Bengal. Neither Trinamool nor CPM stopped infiltration of Bangladeshis to India as it is part of their agenda for creating votebank, he said.The BJP president said the party wants fencing along the porous Indo-Bangladesh border to stop infiltration. If the BJP forms its government here, not even one Bangladeshi can enter India (illegally). That is why we had a border agreement with Bangladesh. We want fencing in the border so that there is no infiltration, he said.Ahead of Shahs speech, BJP national secretary and co-convenor for Bengal Sidharth Nath Singh reiterated his trademark quote Bhaag Mamata Bhaag, and said he has vowed to ensure that Mamata is ousted in this Assembly election.Actor-turned-MP Paresh Rawal, who also shared the stage with Shah, said that similar to the previous UPA government which had let all the agencies loose against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, Mamata too has conspired against the Opposition here. They hate the Modi government so much that when they got nothing against him, they coined a word called intolerance and instigated student leaders in the conspiracy, he said.Former state BJP president and national secretary Rahul Sinha alleged that Mamata was not taking any action against her party leaders named in the Saradha and Narada sting cases because she would end up in jail.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express photo by-Subham Dutta) Asgar Ali in Dinhata. (Express photo by-Subham Dutta)Born in 1913, he is convinced that he is the oldest first-time voter in India. A resident of three countries, now a citizen of India, 103-year-old Asgar Ali has gathered that democracy is like a game where everyone cheats. They gave us election cards, but not ration cards. We can vote. But what do we eat?Thursday will have 9,776 residents of erstwhile enclaves voting for the first time in Cooch Behar. Asgar Ali believes it will also be his last time, and tempers his delight with cynicism.It took them 15 days to give us our election cards, he said. There are mistakes. Men have been listed as women and names have been spelled wrong. We got the voter cards. But where are our ration cards? Where is the kerosene we were promised?At each of her 200 rallies, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has highlighted the implementation of the Land Boundary Agreement under which Bangladesh and India exchanged 162 adversely held enclaves on August 1, 2015. A total 14,864 residents of 51 Bangladeshi enclaves became Indian citizens. At Madhya Moshaldanga, there is talk of redemption and eager discussions about politics. But after Mamatas rally Tuesday, anger too is setting in.She said she has been giving rice at Rs 2 per kg to all residents of enclaves. Thats a lie, said Jaynal Abedin, 24, Alis grandson. We havent even got 200 gm rice at that price, let alone a kilogram. Those in the camps who have come from Bangladesh and are being hosted by the Indian government, they are the ones getting free rice.Mamata conceded in her speech Tuesday that there are demands even in the enclaves and if re-elected she promised to deal with all demands. But its this growing discontent that the Opposition is eager to play on. The 9,776 new voters are spread across five constituencies, the highest number concentrated in Dinhata at 5,486. The Forward Blocs Akshay Thakur has accused the BJP-led central government and the Trinamool Congress of betraying the residents of enclaves while TMC candidate Udayan Guha, who switched from the Forward Bloc, credited Mamata with rescuing those who lived in these enclaves.Who cares what they say, Asgar Ali said. Let me explain something. I have seen a lot of things and I dont always remember all of it but I do remember one night, when I had to plough an entire field by myself because I had vowed I would do so. He mused: We were promised rice, kerosene, electricity and roads. If an election card can be made in a fortnight, why not the rest? Its like a game where everyone is lying and cheating. I am going to vote, it has always been my dream. But I dont think I will live to see the enclave change, he said.Change, however slow, is happening in the enclave. A milestone that once marked the territory as Bangladeshi is now obscured by the villages first pucca home. Students who would earlier forge documents to get into school now find themselves faced with the task of explaining the sudden need for a change in address form.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREI cant remember how many different addresses and ages I have given while filling out different forms. I will sit for my school final exams this year and will also vote for the first time. I will have to make sure that my address is the same on both applications, said Alamgir Hosain Mollah, 18.For seven decades, Madhya Moshaldanga has lived a unique existence, not quite a part of any country, its citizens denied all fundamental rights. As the enclave goes into its first election, it also comes across a reality that most in West Bengal are already familiar with  it is easier to get an election card than a ration card.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: May 4, 2016 2:52 am"
5904934d7be9e04154df8af7,The alcoholic mammaries of the welfare state,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/the-alcoholic-mammaries-of-the-welfare-state/,2016-05-08,"Upamanyu Chatterjee once wrote a book titled The Mammaries of the Welfare State. If he visited Tamil Nadu today, he would be tempted to write another called The Alcoholic Mammaries of Tamil Nadus Welfare State. Tamil Nadu gives away more freebies to voters than any other state. Its dark secret is that these freebies are financed mainly by massive revenues from liquor sales.All liquor shops are run by TASMAC, a government monopoly, to maximize revenue. TASMAC makes additional money by leasing space to private bars within liquor shops. Liquor revenue has risen from Rs 2,800 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 30,000 crore today. To finance an ever-growing list of freebies, the state government has aggressively expanded the number of liquor shops, making access easy. These now open early in the morning, leading to stories of drunkenness before noon.In one sense this approach has succeeded: liquor revenues have boomed. But in another sense the strategy has failed. It has created a big backlash from women complaining of abuse and wasted household money. The DMK has blamed chief minister Jayalalithaa for encouraging drunks, and promised to impose prohibition if elected. Jayalalithaa in turn has accused the DMK of relaxing prohibition when it was in power, and proposed phased prohibition herself.Neither party can explain how the freebies will continue if there is no liquor revenue. The history of India is replete with examples of prohibition being introduced to win the female vote at elections, followed by a fiscal crisis caused by lack of liquor revenue, followed by a return to liquor sales. History will surely repeat itself in Tamil Nadu.It is by no means the only state where prohibition has become a major election issue. West Bengal and Kerala, two other states currently holding state elections, also have parties promising prohibition. They too have no convincing explanation of how liquor revenue will be replaced. But none has as long a list of freebies as Tamil Nadu, whose task is therefore most daunting.Jayalalithaa has just released her party manifesto. Her list of freebies includes: free cellphones for rationcard holders; free laptops with internet connections for 10th and 12th class students; maternity assistance of Rs 18,000; maternity leave increased from six to nine months; one hundred free electricity units every two months; waiver of all farm loans (at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore); fisherfolk assistance to be hiked to Rs 5,000; women to get 50% subsidy to buy mopeds or scooters; an eight-gram gold coin for women getting married; a free Amma kit including sanitary napkins; and much more. Note that Jayalalithaa already provides 20 kilos of free rice per family, a free mixer-grinder and fan per family, subsidized Amma kitchens, and subsidized goats or cows for rural families.The state is reputed to be Indias best in delivering many government services, including education, health, MNREGA and the public distribution system. However, complaints of corruption are rising. Industrialists say this has been worsening for 15 years, eroding a oncestrong reputation for being a business-friendly state. One industrialist says that if you do not pay up, an army of inspectors will descend to harass you and threaten to close your establishment. An educationist complains that environment clearance is now required even for educational institutions, with the bribe for clearance fixed at so much per square foot of space.The sugar industry ran up enormous losses in recent years because state-advised cane prices were very high in relation to sugar prices. Modis rescue package for sugar mills in 2014 included raising the amount of alcohol to be blended with petrol from 5% to 10%, with the ethanol price rising from Rs 34.50 to Rs 48.50 per litre. But Jayalalithaa wants to maximize alcohol for liquor production. And so she has limited ethanol supply by sugar mills to oil companies to a trickle. The sugar mills are crying foul, in vain. She says she is industry-friendly, but is friendlier to the liquor industry than any other. Thats what produces the money for freebies.Elections in Tamil Nadu are rarely fought on policy issues. Both sides agree on a mixture of economic development and welfarism. Elections are contested mainly on the personal popularity of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, and on competition in freebies. Using liquor revenue to improve basic state services like education and health is defensible. Using it for freebies is a political race between parties to the fiscal bottom. It can only end in tears."

M Karunanidhi, 91. What makes the oldest candidates in fray in Kerala and Tamil Nadu the most sought-after by their parties? Shaju Philip & Arun Janardhanan find outAddressing an election rally in Assam last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dismissed the competition posed by Congress Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, saying he is so senior to me and, in a few years, he will be 90. Gogoi is 81.In two corresponding elections, there are two 90-plus contenders whom no one can dismiss in a hurry. If V S Achuthanandan is spearheading the CPM comeback campaign in Kerala, M Karunanidhi is doing the same for the DMK in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.This is Achuthanandans eighth Assembly election. He first contested 49 years ago, in 1967, from Ambalapuzha. In all this time, he has been chief minister just once, though few may be able to stop him should the CPM win on May 19.V S Achuthanandan (Photo courtesy: Mathrubhumi) and M Karunanidhi V S Achuthanandan (Photo courtesy: Mathrubhumi) and M KarunanidhiKarunanidhi is fighting his 13th Assembly election. He has not been defeated once in nearly 60 years of contesting polls, having begun from Kulitalai in 1957, and has been the CM five times. He has also been a member of the (now-abolished) Tamil Nadu Legislative Council once.Achuthanandan is now the only surviving leader among the founders of the CPM. Both VS and Karunanidhi are the oldest candidates in the fray in the two states.Heres something more to put that in perspective: in the year 1957, when Karunanidhi won his first polls, Feroze Gandhi won from the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat. 1967, when VS contested the first time, was the year the Congress fought its first general elections without Jawaharlal Nehru at the helm.V S Achuthanandan: Strict regimen, controlled diet, unsheathed ambitionWayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday. PTI Photo Wayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday. PTI PhotoAt 7.45 am, the government rest-house in Palakkad is deserted, except for a police constable lazing in a chair near a room on the ground floor. Minutes later, an elderly man emerges from the room, his mundu folded above the knees. Escorted by an assistant, he carefully climbs down a small ramp to a courtyard.Here, the crimson sun of Kerala politics, Velikkakath Sankaran Achuthanandan, stands facing the sun  eyes closed, lips pursed. After a few minutes, he turns around for his back to soak in the morning rays. About 10 minutes later, he returns to his room.Achuthanandan, popularly known as VS, will turn 93 in October. Before the Assembly elections of 2011, VS, who was then chief minister, had been denied a seat by the CPM on health grounds. After widespread discontent among party workers and the public, the CPM gave in. That election battle was reckoned to be the 87-year-olds last. Here we are, five years later, with VS a natural contender for the CMs post.Apart from being the Left Democratic Front candidate from Malampuzha constituency, the veteran is shouldering the LDF campaign across the state  proving once again his ability to reinforce his relevance. All this doesnt come easy. VS begins his day at 5 am. By 6 am, he is out for his regular morning walk, dressed in track pants and a white T-shirt. While at his official residence in Thiruvananthapuram, he usually goes to the university stadium for a half-an-hour walk, but now that he is in Palakkad district for campaigning, he makes do with the tarred road near the rest-house. As VS walks, two aides keep a careful watch, with one of them showing the way with a torch. VS walks for about 50 metres, taking slow, measured steps, then turns around and walks back. His assistant Kunhikannan says he walks this way for nearly 20 minutes, without exchanging a word with his aides.After the walk, VS rests in his room for a while. This is when he reads the newspapers. He wants all the local Malayalam and English dailies on his table when he returns from his walk, says Kunhikkannan, who has been with VS for four years. This is followed by a bath and a 20-minute-long yoga session. VS took to yoga 12 years ago and does his asanas without anyones help, says Kunhikkannan. It is after yoga that he soaks up the sun.Kolkata: CPI(M) leader V S Achuthanandan, CPI(M) General Secy Sitaram Yechury, Former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Left Front Chairman Biman Bose Former Secretary Prakash Karat, State Opposition Leader Surya Kanta Mishra and others in an open rally during their Kolkata Plenum in Kolkata on Sunday.

PTI Photo by Ashok BhaumikBreakfast comes next. His aides say VS flips through newspapers as he eats his usual steam-baked puttu or idiyappam or appam. VSs fitness at 92 is attributed in part to his diet regimen: No tea or coffee for him; he only drinks hot water or tender coconut water. He has also largely stuck to vegetarian food, though he occasionally eats fish curry. A couple of years ago, VS famously broke this regimen when he went to greet estranged comrade, K R Gouri, on her birthday. Gouri is said to have chided him, Since when have you turned vegetarian?, and forced him to eat fish curry.By 9 am, the veteran CPM leader is ready to receive visitors. Local leaders start trickling in, including A Prabhakaran, the LDF election committee convenor of Malampuzha constituency. Prabhakaran briefs him about the days schedule and tells him he will have to attend a few panchayat-level CPM conventions.I have been coordinating Achuthanandans election in Malampuzha since 2001. This time too he will win with a thumping majority, says Prabhakaran. In 2011, VS had won by 20,017 votes against Congress candidate Lathika Subhash.Half an hour later, VS is ready to leave for the first convention. Two assistants help him into a car, which sports the party flag on its bonnet. As he sinks into his seat, VS slips into the past: of those days without cars, with a lot of ground to be covered on foot. He started out as a strident labour union leader in Alappuzha who went on to become one of the most popular faces of the CPM in Kerala.I became a member of the Communist party in 1940, at the age of 17. I worked among fishermen, toddy-tappers and coconut climbers in Alappuzha. I later joined a coir factory, organised workers there and brought them closer to the Communist movement, he says.There were tough days. In the early 1940s, I would stay in a house at Cherukara in Alappuzha for party work. The house was located in a paddy field with streams. I would walk kilometres along narrow ridges to reach workers. There were no bridges across these streams, only wooden planks, he says. It was in the late 1950s, when he was district secretary of the united CPI in Alappuzha, that his office got its first car.The VS motorcade reaches Kodumbu, 6 km from Palakkad city. The town is decorated with flags and festoons. Hundreds of party workers have gathered at the community hall to hear him. The hall erupts as party workers push to catch a glimpse of the veteran and shout slogans hailing him. VS has to jostle through the crowd to reach the stage, helped by his security guards. As mobile phones go up one by one to record his speech, the 92-year-old greets the audience with folded hands and starts speaking. With his voice ringing through the hall in his famous, much-mimicked style halting and winding  the years fall away.We want to bring back the previous LDF government, which implemented several welfare initiatives, says Achuthanandan. You can realise my responsibility. I have to campaign across the state for LDF candidates, it is your duty to seek votes for Achuthanandan. Think of yourself as V S Achuthanandan when you go campaigning. Thank you, namaskaram.There is fresh sloganeering as VS makes his way back to his car. The next convention is at Mundur, half an hour away. At Mundur too, hundreds of party workers, including women, have been waiting for Achuthanandan. Kanne Karale Viyesse (loosely translated to Our eyes, our heart, oh VS), they shout as the CPM leader reaches.Prabhakaran addresses the crowd here, and makes no effort to hide the ambition of the VS camp should he win. People of Kerala are looking at VS with great expectation and enthusiasm. If an LDF government led by VS does not come to power, Kerala will collapse, he says.When its his turn to address the gathering, VS again tells the party workers to go to the voters as VS and garner votes for him. Its midday by the time the event at Mundur is over, and VS returns to the guest-house in Palakkad for lunch.A few spoons of rice and vegetables make his lunch, says son V A Arun Kumar. What he misses while he is out campaigning is the buttermilk made from goat milk that he has without fail while in Thiruvananthapuram. He has a goat at his official residence in the capital, says VSs additional private secretary K V Sudhakaran.After lunch, VS rests until 3 pm. He then meets visitors before leaving for a second round of campaigning in the evening.Human rights activist Joy Kaitharam has brought along a few guests, including Lakshmi Bhai, the widow of P Satheendra Kumar, an employee of Malabar Cements who died under mysterious circumstances in 2013. The moment Kaitharam introduces Lakshmi to VS, he says, Oh the Malabar cements case! He promises Lakshmi her demand for a job for her son would be met if the LDF government came to power.VS grasps things fast, Kaitharam smiles. If we give written material, he gets the points in one reading. A Suresh, the personal assistant for VS for 12 years, says the veterans popularity can be attributed to this quality and the causes he identifies himself with: social evils, corruption, land encroachment and sex mafia. He patiently hears out everyone who meets him. VS is quick to grasp an issue and understand its gravity.CPM central committee member Thomas Issac underlines what VS means for the party. People, particularly the poor, easily identify with him. There is a huge demand from the party and the public to include VS in as many campaigns as possible.Around 4 pm, VS leaves for two more meetings in his constituency, returning around 7.30 pm to the guest-house.Before turning in for the night, VS again goes for a walk, this time for 30 minutes. Even after a long journey or a busy schedule, he does not skip this routine. During the last Lok Sabha elections, he once stayed on the third floor of a hotel in Malappuram which did not have a lift. He would walk down the steps, come down for his evening walk and again take all those stairs on his way up, says Sudhakaran, his additional private secretary.Dinner is light  a few pieces of papaya and three or four kadali bananas. Most days, he is in bed by 9 pm. Son Arun Kumar says VS usually never discusses politics with family. Controversies do not upset him. His initial years of struggle have given him the strength to stay like a rock when political storms hit him.He is travelling with his father this time because of his age, Kumar adds. I am here just to monitor his food.So what keeps him going at 92? VS, who since last fortnight has also joined social media, smiles, I do my best to remain fit. I have a strict and disciplined life, just like my clean political life.The perpetual rebel* Born on October 20, 1923, in Punnapra village in Alappuzha district, V S Achuthanandan lost his parents early. When 12, he dropped out of school and started working at his elder brothers tailoring shop. He joined the Congress when he was 15, but became a CPI member two years later.* In 1964, he was one of the 32 leaders to walk out of the national council of the CPI to form the CPI(M). He is the only one of the 32 still alive.* VSs biggest strength has been his ability to reinvent himself at crucial moments. As Opposition leader from 2001 to 2006, he associated himself with issues such as womens empowerment, Dalit rights and land encroachment, which sent his popularity soaring.* Within the party though, he has been a perpetual rebel, locking horns with Pinarayi Vijayan over control of the state leadership. In 2007, VS and Vijayan were both suspended from the Politburo for some time.* In 2015, the CPM passed a resolution against VS for his alleged anti-party activities. But his fortunes have since brightened. With the BJP joining hands with Hindu Ezhava leader Vellappally Natesan, VS as an Ezhava is even more important now.M Karunanidhi: A family close by, some prayers next doorM Karunanidhi M KarunanidhiITS APRIL 23, three weeks to go for what is likely his final electoral battle, and M Karunanidhi is getting ready for his first poll rally. Inside the DMK chiefs two-storey house, made in the traditional Tamil style, distinctive only for the party flag atop, there is hectic activity.Personal secretary K Shanmuganathan has been busy in the visitors section since 8.30 am. Another aide walks up and down with a phone, looking on as senior party leaders arrive and four armed commandos of the National Security Guard take positions. A sniffer dog checks Karunanidhis customised Toyota Alphard standing in the lobby.A dozen security personnel conduct a routine drill, checking each vehicle parked on the street with metal detectors.In his trademark safari suit, Karunanidhis aide Shanmughanathan, who has been with the DMK chief since 1976, is turning away people seeking appointments. Others can be seen decorating the door leading to his inner house with garlands, but the freshly drawn kolam (rangoli) in front of No. 15, 4th Street, Gopalapuram, has already been smudged by the people walking in and out.As media cameras wait restlessly outside for Kalaignar, as Karunanidhi is fondly called by his followers, to emerge, news comes that the DMK chief is still having his favourite breakfast  dosa and chutney.Information about what the 92-year-old eats though is tough to come by. It requires a formal mail before a close aide reveals, Minimum four coffees a day is a must. By around 11 am, he will have chicken soup or vegetable soup, before a mini-lunch. He eats a little rice for lunch. Though there are some restrictions these days, gulab jamun and cutlets are his favourites.Around 9.30 am, eldest daughter Selvi is the first to step out, her hands full of flowers. Next to Karunanidhis house, in a narrow lane, is a temple. Rivals say the famously atheist leaders family conducts pujas there. His loyalists insist Karunanidhi stops for no one, not even god.Thats saying much for a leader confined to a wheelchair since 2009, and carrying the weight of his splintered party and family on his shoulders. Apart from the frugal meals, one way that keeps him going is daily yoga at 4 am, followed by the first coffee of the day. According to a close aide, he does all the possible sitting yoga postures he can for 20 minutes. The self-declared rationalist found the middle path when he embraced yoga in 2009.He started doing yoga after he was forced to give up his morning walk, which he would do mostly inside the sprawling compound of Anna Arivalayam, his party headquarters, says the aide.Karunanidhi finally leaves around 3 pm. He first stops at a CIT Nagar residence to pick up third wife Rajathi Ammal and daughter Kanimozhi before the convoy heads for a rally on the banks of Adyar, marking the start of a road trip that will cover half of the states districts and involve at least 35 rallies.Since he cant go to all the 234 constituencies, the party has planned for each rally to cover a dozen or more seats. Some of the rallies are stage events, at others, he would be delivering speeches sitting in his caravan. On the road though, he may not be able to indulge in the one leisure activity aides confess about him  watching old songs on TV, some of them from his films, others bound to be from bitter rival J Jayalalithaas.His campaign van is a customised Force Traveller with a sliding door and a high roof, that can easily accommodate Karunanidhis wheelchair. He has been using similar vans for several elections now. Those who have seen and heard the Karunanidhi of old say the speech delivery is no longer as effortless, but it remains spontaneous, with the leader not referring to any paper during his 20-odd-minute addresses.Instructing a youth who is part of the DMK social media team, Karunanidhis personal secretary Rajamanickam, who is well into his 70s, says the DMK chief knows just what to highlight from his speeches for YouTube and Facebook. Karunanidhi has had own Facebook and Twitter accounts since March 2014.On a Monday evening, as Karunanidhi arrives for a rally at his Thiruvarur constituency, near native village Thirukkuvalai, there are over 10,000 cheering people gathered. The sight is reassuring for a leader who many have been saying should retire.He starts his speech listing the names of Tamil Nadu Congress chief EVKS Elangovan sitting next to him, other alliance leaders and the DMKs district leaders individually, triggering an applause each time. Rajathi Ammal sits behind him, while former Union telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, who was named in the 2G scam, is to his left and never takes his eyes off the DMK supremo. The presence of both sends a message. In the war of supremacy within the Karunanidhi clan, it is Rajathi and Kanimozhi who are by the DMK chief in this campaign. Kanimozhi too carries 2G taint, and Dayanidhi is a surprise inclusion given his absence from public view for a long time.Ignoring this fact, the DMK chief focuses on the alleged corruption of the Jayalalithaa government, talking about money seizures from her partymens houses and demanding a CBI probe.If the presence of Kanimozhi is remarked upon, so is the curious absence of M K Stalin, while eldest son M K Alagiri is more or less silent now. Alagiri remains unpopular, and there is talk still among cadres and voters of him coming back if Karunanidhi returns to power. Others say how Stalin, who is running a virtual parallel campaign with professionals and a strong social media presence, should have been projected as the CM candidate by the DMK.Older leaders close to Karunanidhi say some of his own relatives have asked him to hand over the baton to Stalin. However, says a close aide, Karunanidhi doesnt want to be a father who made his son a CM. He follows Maos theory  I dont want to support anyone, let them grow on their own.READ: The Dravida Family TreeOthers point out that Karunanidhi still remains popular among colleagues, and for the reason that in a state with imperious leaders, surrounded by powerful coteries, he is open. If I call him now and ask for an appointment, he would ask me to come immediately. That is Karunanidhi, says Anbumani Ramadoss, leader of the PMK, and incidentally now a bitter rival.Before the Trichy rally, the DMK men thronging outside his room are all carrying photographs of party leader K N Nehru. Partymen point out that unlike the AIADMK, the DMK also allows its second-level leaders to bloom.Closest friend and advisor M Naganathan, former head of economics at the University of Madras and ex-vice chairman of the state planning commission, says his memories of Karunanidhi revolve around their morning walks together for almost 25 years, until he became wheel-chair bound.Naganathan also vouches that unlike Jayalalithaas actions against him  including sending police to arrest him at midnight in June 2001  Karunanidhi never expresses any kind of venom towards her. She is too junior to him, he has seen her since she entered the film industry as a child. When Kalaignars police went to arrest Jayalalithaa in 1996 (for alleged corruption), she kept them waiting for one-and-a-half hours. Karunanidhi asked the officers to arrest her only when she came out.Dismissing talk that Karunanidhi step down, an old-timer who meets the DMK chief off and on, says Stalin too bows before his father still. Unless there is a constitutional framework imposing an age limit for leaders, it would be foolish to judge a leader by his age. Is V S Achuthanandan at 92 incompetent? Was Jyoti Basu a failure at 96? R Venkataraman was in his late 80s when he became the president of India.Still, even the leader of a party formed with a rationalist agenda can do with some prayers now. Four hours before the Trichy rally is to begin, a brief prayer is held at the hotel Karunanidhi is staying in. Party leader A Raja, another 2G scam survivor, is among the dozen or so leaders gathered as a priest holds prayers for Karunanidhis health.Ask him about his contemporary Achuthanandan, and Karunanidhi is brief, I wish him all the best for his success.The scriptwriter* Muthuvel Karunanidhi was born on June 3, 1924, in Thirukkuvalai, a village near Thiruvarur. A school dropout, he was a screenwriter in the Tamil film industry before entering politics. The film circle in which he was active had political links with the Dravidian movement against Brahminism, and Karunanidhi was a founding member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).* Along with C N Annadurai, he organised local protests against powerful north Indian men imposing Hindi names in 1953.* He won his first election from Kulithalai in Trichy district in 1957, winning a seat in the Assembly of Madras Presidency.* After the DMK parted ways with Periyars Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), won the elections in 1967 and Annadurai became the CM, Karunanidhi became public works minister. After Annadurais death in early 1969, Karunanidhi succeeded him till 1971. He returned to the CMs office in the election in 1971.* The DMK faced a vertical split in 1972 after MGR decided to float AIADMK following a tussle with with Karunanidhi. In five years, MGR captured power from DMK and ruled the state till 1987.* He returned to power in 1989."

""For 1kg of rice, Rs 27 comes from the Delhi treasury, that's why you get it at subsidised rates of Re 1 and Rs 2. Dilli sarkar is concerned about you. But there aren't any photos of Modi or his name on the bags. My happiness is the smile on the faces of the poor people,"" he said, in a veiled comment on the stickers of Jayalalithaa pasted on flood relief materials.Modi is otherwise known to share a good rapport with Jayalalithaa. The confrontational tone comes towards the end of the election campaign, with just a week to go for voting. In 2014 too, Modi had steered clear of taking potshots at Jayalalithaa.On Sunday, Modi also addressed three well-attended election meetings in north, south and south-central Kerala, where he exhorted voters to see through the ""adjustment politics"" between LDF and UDF that ensured each front, in turn, ruled the state every five years and covertly protected the other's vested interests.""A new model of politics has come up in Kerala. It's an adjustment politics, politics of compromise, politics of corruption and politics of contract to save each other... It's a contract rule between UDF and LDF,"" Modi told an election meeting at Kasaragod.In the evening in Thiruvananthapuram, at a huge gathering in Central Stadium, Modi spoke of the special place Kerala has in his heart and asked voters to reciprocate.""It's not important who wins or forms the government in Kerala. What's important is the future of Kerala. It's in the name of development that we seek votes in favour of NDA candidates,"" Modi said, bemoaning the inertia inflicted on the state by its bi-polar politics.In speeches tailor-made to suit each region's main concerns, Modi's over-arching theme was how the BJP could make a difference in Kerala given a chance.In Kasaragod, he dwelt on the CPM's politics of violence, and warned that people involved in murder cases are trying to become CM  a veiled attack on Pinarayi Vijayan who was an accused in the Vadikkal Ramakrishnan murder case in Thalassery nearly 45 years ago. The PM also ridiculed new-found CPM-Congress bonhomie in West Bengal, saying that 'dosti' there and 'gusti' here only exposed the mutual opportunism."

Abul Kasem says he doesnt get enough rice to feed his family.WITH polling having concluded in West Bengal, erstwhile enclave dwellers in Cooch Behar have a far more pressing concern  ration cards. Though the administration has promised to issue the ration cards after the election results are declared on May 19, there is uncertainty among the 13,000 former enclave residents here, who were among those granted Indian citizenship after the country ratified the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh last year.The 13,000 people are residents of villages which were Bangladeshi enclaves before they became Indian territory following the agreement.The lack of ration cards makes the new Indians ineligible for the states welfare measures, particularly the du takae chal (rice at Rs 2 per kg) scheme. We have been issued election cards but no ration cards. This means no rice, no kerosene and no milk powder. Those in the camps get them, but we have to still toil on whatever little land we have, said Saddam Hussein (21), a resident of Madhya Moshaldanga, an erstwhile Bangladeshi enclave now in Indian territory. There are large tracts of highly fertile land here and hence rice (the staple in the region) is aplenty; the problem, however, is that most of it is owned by a small group of farmers. And those below the poverty line havent been issued ration cards.Those with ration cards  around 1,000 people lodged at the three camps in Dinhata, Mekliganj and Haldibari (all once residents of Indian enclaves in Bangladesh)  have another grouse: lack of sufficient food. At present, each family is provided with 30 kg of rice.Families with more than five members are given an additional five kg for every extra member. But this policy isnt working out. My family has 14 members. Its the largest in the enclave camps. But according to the present rationing system, I get 75 kg of rice. In Bangladesh, our family consumed almost double the amount, said Abul Kasem (62).While those at the camps have adapted by creating small kitchen gardens  cultivating pumpkins, gourds and beans  the district administration blamed the rice shortage on insufficient planning by the Centre and its inability to understand cultural differences. The average five-member family in urban areas of Bengal consumes about 20 to 30 kg of rice. But in rural areas, particularly Cooch Behar and the adjoining area of Rangpur in Bangladesh, rice is eaten four times a day. Almost everyone is employed in hard labour and rice is the fuel. Eating habits cant change in a day and the Centre has failed to take this into account, said a state official.Then theres unemployment. While some camp residents have been able to find jobs under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the model code of conduct has delayed payments. In addition, resentment from local residents at the new Indians allegedly getting preference has led to increased tension in the area. They dont want us here. That is to be expected. But we have no money. Whatever money we brought with us is close to finishing and its making us desperate. We were promised that our land in Bangladesh would be sold and we would get the money but we have not received a single penny of it. We havent been able to go back and oversee the sale either.Whenever we ask, we are told after the elections, said Jayprakash Roy at the Haldibari camp.After the migration, the new Indians had submitted a detailed list of their land  about 5 sq km in total  to the district administration. The Bangladesh government had in turn promised to buy the land at market prices and ensure that the money is transferred to those who had opted for Indian citizenship. But this is yet to materialise, the residents said.For enclave dwellers on the Indian side, the land issue has become even more pressing as they dont have pattas (land right documents). Many fear that their properties will be gobbled up by land sharks looking to profit from the government-planned development in the area. The Bangladesh government wants to build police stations, roads and hospitals. We havent been given proof that we own the land that has fed us for generations. Already surveyors are trying to take over, said Sunil Ray, a former resident of Mrigpur enclave, now in Bangladesh.The district administration here hopes that all issues will be resolved soon. District magistrate P Ulaganathan said that with polls over, the problems of the enclaves would be accorded top priority. But Trinamool Congress district president, Rabindranath Ghosh, maintained that much of the problems stemmed from bad planning and delays from the Centre. Take funds for instance. They released some of the money almost a year after they were scheduled to. This was all political because the BJP wanted to put us under pressure, he said.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE"
59048bf27be9e04154df85e8,"What Mamata has learnt from Nitish, Lalu",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/what-mamata-has-learnt-from-nitish-lalu/,2016-05-15,"The urban middle classes hate her, the rural masses love her. The middle classes hate to admit it, but in elections the rural masses matter more.Most of the bhadralok castigate her for ruining university autonomy, filling institutions with her loyalists, and selling not just university teaching posts (as the Left Front used to) but even student seats in the best colleges. They say she has brought her own thugs to every district, replacing those of the Left Front. Often, the old thugs have simply switched sides.She is alleged to have created a web of syndicates  monopoly suppliers of various services and construction materials  that skim money from procurement systems. She has financed a plethora of youth clubs, which intellectuals claim are just gangs loyal to Mamata.She is frankly contemptuous of intellectuals, and proudly says she represents the masses. In this, she resembles Lalu Yadav, who in Bihar spent 15 years empowering backward castes at the expense of the upper-caste elite, often by dubious, thuggish means.A very different image of Mamata comes from her supporters, including a minority of the bhadralok. They say she has promoted economic development, and done more for rural roads, rural electrification and water than the Left Front did in decades. In this respect, Mamata resembles Nitish Kumar, who also focused on economic development and was rewarded with three successive state victories. GDP growth seems to have accelerated a bit, but nowhere near as much as in Nitishs Bihar.In a poor country, all politicians have to show a populist streak, and Mamata is no exception. She has spent much effort promoting cheap health for the masses. She has offered bicycles to schoolgirls, and rice at Rs 2/kilo to ration card holders. Yet this is a very small list of freebies compared with those of politicians in other states like Tamil Nadu.Her main election platform is rural development, not freebies. She defends syndicates and youth clubs as ways of empowering rural people and sharing the benefits of development with a wide range of grassroots folk. She claims thuggery is much reduced compared with Left Front rule. The smell of corruption has hit some of her ministers, yet her personal image is of simplicity and honesty.She has had the guts to stand up to government trade unions that have ousted governments in other states. She pays them dearness allowance amounting to only 75% of basic salary, as against 125% given by the central government. Almost all other CMs have felt obliged to follow the central norm, so Mamata stands out. She has diverted money from civil service salaries to development, and that is both courageous and productive.The Left Fronts land reforms, starting 1977, won it great rural goodwill for decades, but that has now evaporated. The CPM replaced formal government rule largely by cadre rule, and all villages and districts became fiefdoms of CPM cadres. Electricity was perennially in short supply, hitting not just industrial development but rural electrification. Most farmers had to use diesel pump-sets for irrigation, which cost far more to operate than electric pump-sets.Mamata is lucky that, thanks to weak industrialization, the whole eastern grid now has an electricity surplus. Nitish Kumar took advantage of this to extend rural electricity to almost all villages in Bihar, and this spurred his election victory last year. Mamata has also greatly expanded rural electrification, and hopes for a similar electoral dividend.Several chief ministers who have won repeated re-election  Narendra Modi, Nitish, Naveen Patnaik, Shivraj Chouhan  have followed the model of a strong, high centralising CM empowering the bureaucracy to ignore MLAs and panchayat politicians and deliver results (including politically biased ones). Mamata has adopted a milder version of this model. Businessmen like this model, and are surprisingly upbeat on Mamata, even though she came to power  and retains mass rural support  by excoriating the Tatas and other large industries for acquiring land from farmers at cheap rates. West Bengal is doing far better in services and small manufacturing than big industry, and this needs less land.The states main crop is paddy. Once, the state was highly deficit in paddy, but the green revolution has created a surplus, lowering the market price below the minimum support price. Mamata has substantially expanded government procurement of paddy, just as Nitish did in Bihar, benefiting farmers. This could be an important vote winner.In sum, Mamata has learned lessons from Lalu Yadav on the importance of dignity for the masses, and from Nitish Kumar, the importance of rural development. I suspect that will give her a big election victory."

People  holding aluminum buckets and pots or anything that can store water  anxiously wait for their turn at the tubewell that would soon begin to draw water in the form of mud.If you are late, all you get is muddy water, said Sukumar Mahto, speaking about the only tubewell in this part of Purulia, which, the 29-year-old pointed out, is a dry area. This lone tubewell supports not just Kororia but neighbouring villages, too.We are used to harsh summers, but this year has been particularly bad. Children have acquired allergies and illnesses because there is no water. There are no vegetables either, only potatoes, and thats what we have been sustaining on, Mahto said.The ponds around the village began drying up two months ago. Most of them now sit mudcaked, a reminder that they used to be a water body a while ago. A few still have some water left but their levels have fallen drastically. It is these that men, women, children and cattle use for all things necessary  bathing, washing, cooking, and drinking.Similar to Birbhum, but unlike other districts in West Bengal, Purulia is largely a monocrop region, planting and harvesting paddy.Before this long stretch of rainless dry heat set in, Purulia had received a good spell of rainfall in August last year, prompting farmers to try their luck at a second crop  many planted vegetables. But these failed.Purulia, officially, is a semi-drought-hit region. But the situation right now is similar to drought. There is no source of water in the district. The surface water has dried up and the groundwater has reduced at an alarming rate. This started in November last year, so we began giving out crop insurance and extended the Rs 2-per kg rice scheme  meant for the lower income groups  to cover the entire district, District Magistrate Tanmoy Chakraborty said.He added that 1,000 tubewells have been installed where groundwater is still available. Dry wells have been added to low lying areas so they fill up when the groundwater rises.For extra measures, the administration has asked owners of factories and small industries to install taps outside their industrial structures to make drinking water available to the common people.But these industrial owners have their own story to tell.Prashant Jalan (27), who runs a brick kiln with his father, said no work has taken place for the last three months. There is no water to manufacture brick, he said. Work on developmental projects, government sources said, have similarly slowed down because of the scarcity of water.There is literally no water here any more. Factory owners have been asked to install taps outside their buildings so that people could come and drink water from these. We will be installing ours in a couple of days, Jalan said.These taps, however, will receive water only for two hours each in the morning and evening every day.Purulia is a region where the plateau meets the plains so it is a dry area in any case. The people here are accustomed to harsh climate. What we need is a good spell of rain and the monsoons to come, the DM said.The monsoon, unluckily for Purulia and several other parched regions in the country, will be delayed by a week, according to the Met Departments forecast. It will arrive in Kerala some time at the end of the first week in June. Until then, residents of Kororia village and those nearby will have to keep pace with the rising sun.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

After taking over as the chief minister in 2011, she had steered Trinamool Congress through victory in subsequent elections to panchayat, civic bodies and 2014 Lok Sabha.Among various development schemes undertaken by her as the chief minister were Kanyashree schemes for girls and Sabuj Sathi under which cycles were dsitributed among the students, besides Rs 2 kg rice for the 8 crore people in the state.However, multi-crore scams like Saradha and Narada had dented the image of her party as the opposition had made it a prime issue.Born to a middle class family and daughter of a freedom fighter and student of law and education, Banerjee in her initial years in public life was mentored by veteran Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee  now ironically a senior minister in her state cabinet.Banerjee, baptized into politics as a student leader in Chhatra Parishad  Congress student wing in the 1970s, shot into limelight by pulling off a stunning victory over CPI-M heavyweight and former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections in from Jadavpur constituency to become one of the youngest MPs.She soon became a rallying point for the anti-Left Front forces which saw in her an uncompromising, incorruptible and credible fighter in comparison to various senior leaders of state Congress of nineties. After parting ways, Banerjee had often dubbed Congress as the B team of CPI-M.Perfecting the art of the impossible, the maverick and emotional politician, first hogged the limelight by blocking Jayaprakash Narayan`s convoy by throwing herself on the ground when he came to Kolkata to organise the masses against Indira Gandhi before Emergency.Defeated in 1989, she was back in Lok Sabha in 1991 from Kolkata South and retained the seat in 1996, 1998,1999, 2004 and 2009. Banerjees first tryst with the corridors of power came in 1991 when she became became union minister of state for human resources development, youth affairs and sports and women and child development in the P V Narasimha Rao government.Later on after forming TMC, Banerjee aligned with the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government and became Railway Minister in 1999 and Union Minister for Coal and Mines in 2004. Banerjee resigned as Railway Minister and left NDA just ahead of the 2001 assembly polls in Bengal after the Tehelka scam and allied with Congress for the assembly elections but could not dethrone the Marxist party.In 2004 Lok Sabha election Banerjee was the only one from TMC to win. In 2006 asembly polls in Bengal her party managed to win just 30 seats in the 294-member assembly. But being a fighter, Banerjee refused to be cowed down and led the protest against farmland acquisitions in Singur and Nandigram which finally catapulted her to the seat of power in the state.A firebrand orator, she had coined a catchy slogan Ma, Mati o Manush (Mother, Land and People) before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and played on the anti-incumbency factor after more than three decades of Left rule and the creeping disillusionment among several sections, like Muslims, to decimate the Left in partnership with the Congress.Known for her humble lifestyle, the seven-time MP successfully sold a vision of development, cashing in on thedeep resentment among the middle classes and unemployed youths, promising jobs and development. Her nondescript residencea tiled single-storey house in a dingy lane close to the Kalighat templeand equally simple attire comprising cotton saris, jhola bags and cheap hawai chappals, endeared her to the masses.It has not been an easy journey though for Mamata who turned her call for `Parivartan` (change) into a reality with Congress, her ally then, throwing its full weight behind her.

Yet, the feat of Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu and Mamata in West Bengal, or for that matter the winning spree of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti in bypolls, is a pointer that regional parties can outbeat national parties.Jayalalithaas victory has created history in Tamil Naduby beating anti-incumbency trend for the first time in nearly 40 years.The late M G Ramachandrana held that record with DMK chief M Karunanidhi unable to dislodge him from power till he was alive.Both Jayalalithaa and Mamata are seen as successfully delivering on the ground on basic requirements through a slew of welfare measures or freebies, which the national parties loathe to provide due to resource crunch.Besides the famous Amma canteens, where food is available across the state at a cheap price, Jayalalithaas freebies have included 4 goats and a cow to each BPL family, mixer-grinders and fans, free uniforms, school, bags, notebooks, geometry boxes, for all children in government schools, and cycles and laptops for class 11 and 12 students.Six lakh women got four grams of gold and Rs 50,000 as marriage assistance.

They perhaps think in what a group of French historians in the second half of the 20th century called longue dure. For over three decades the voters of West Bengal loyally stood by the Left. Nothing seemed to make a dent in this show of loyalty. Then in one great upheaval in 2011 the people decided that the time had come to end the Left regime and to usher in change. Indeed, the removal of the Left became synonymous with Mamata Banerjee's rallying cry of paribartan or change. Having voted her to power, the people have decided to continue to support and trust her in spite of growing criticism of her regime from among the members of the intelligentsia. Change once made in 2011 is now shelved. No one quite knows when it will emerge again and what direction it will take. Perhaps the people of West Bengal think in terms of three decades as marking an epoch. Within this tendency to provide the political leadership with a sense and an opportunity of continuity, there is another trend that is worthy of note. The urban intelligentsia tends to lose faith in a political leader or a party far more quickly than those who live in rural Bengal and in district towns. Voices of criticism against the Left originated in Calcutta, which became Mamata Banerjee's first stronghold and then, only very gradually, did disillusionment spread to the villages. Similarly, critics of Mamata Banerjee's rule (like the present writer) are mostly urban dwellers. Their sentiments and arguments find no immediate echo among the common people, most of whom are in the rural world. The results rub home this point. One of the charges made against Mamata Banerjee's regime - this was highlighted by her critics and opponents - was the one of corruption. Various scams and ponzy schemes came to light; important party members were alleged to have taken bribes and so on. But these charges cut no ice with the voters. Some implications follow from this. First is that the voters do not believe these allegations. Second, the voters feel that even if these allegations are true or partially true, Mamata Banerjee is still worth voting for. This is a comment on Mamata Banerjee's personal standing among the people. And third, issues of corruption are not important enough to affect voting patterns. If the third implication above has any validity, then the yardstick of morality the people of Bengal live by stands in need of a radical review. A scandal like Bofors could bring down a prime minister but Saradha has no adverse impact on the popularity of Mamata Banerjee. A point to ponder. One plank on which Mamata Banerjee's popularity rests is the series of measures she announced as chief minister to benefit the common people. These included gifts of money to small clubs in various localities; the gift of bicycles for girls; monetary subventions for unmarried women over 18 who are studying; making available rice at a cheap price; subsidies to religious leaders and so on. Such measures are usually captured within the rubric of ""populism"". It is a term that carries with it pejorative overtones. Mamata Banerjee has made this her own brand of politics. These announcements immediately make her appear pro-people. The beneficiaries of these proposals are never concerned about what impact these have on the state's finances. The advantages of populism are obvious and Mamata Banerjee is certainly not the only political leader in India, past or present, to practise this kind of politics to garner votes. There is nothing unexpected in Mamata Banerjee's choice of populism since she actively projected herself prior to 2011 as being pro-peasant and anti-industry. In her second innings as chief minister one of the principal challenges before Mamata Banerjee will be to change the investment and the industrial climate of West Bengal. Whatever might be her rhetoric and her public posturing she knows that West Bengal is not seen as an attractive investment destination. On the other hand, having received an overwhelming endorsement from the people she might feel (and indeed will be justified in feeling thus) that there is no need to change anything, least of all her attitudes. Why bring paribartan to populism? There is one taint that Mamata Banerjee will have to remove as she settles into power the second time round. West Bengal's image and reputation have been tarnished by violence. The state is seen as a place where political cadre can do as they please and get away with it because of political patronage. There is continuity in this since this is exactly how the cadre of the CPI(M) behaved when their party called the shots. Mamata Banerjee should guarantee the safety of the people by allowing the rule of law to prevail irrespective of political and party interests. The vote is a vote for continuity in political leadership. But no political process, even a continuing one, can be totally bereft of change. In the vote for continuity is embedded the challenge - even the hope - that things will move towards the better. Mamata Banerjee has successfully made the Left disappear from the political map of West Bengal. But the big question that will continue to chase Mamata Banerjee's tenure as chief minister will centre around how successfully, if at all, she has caused a rupture with Left policies and the Left mindset. Her dependence on populism, her reliance on State control on education, her use of party cadre, her politicization of the police and the bureaucracy, her blurring of the dividing line between the party and the government - all these aspects of her rule have distinct Left lineages. They were all used by the Left Front and brought it dividends. On Mamata Banerjee, however ironical it sounds, has fallen the mantle of the Left. The border of her sari is often blue. It could very well be red."

Trinamool Congress supporters smear colour on a poster of their leader. Photo: PTIThe Trinamool Congress won a spectacular two-thirds majority in West Bengal thanks in large part to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees charisma, energy, never-say-die spirit, and ability to think on her feet. Even in these elections, when she realised that the Left-Congress combine might capitalise on both the series of scams that had hit her party and the widespread unpopularity of her party workers, she swiftly made a public apology.In early April, at a public meeting in Kulti near Asansol, riding on the adulation she enjoys among the people, she said she should be held responsible if any mistakes had been made, but voters should not withdraw their blessings and good wishes from the party.Interestingly, even on Thursday after her magnificent win, grim-faced even in victory, she said she would attend to any shortcomings in her party.Ms. Banerjee has always been far more popular than the cohorts of street warriors she leads, something everyone this writer spoke to emphasised last month, even as complaints floated about her partymen spreading terror in the districts.Without pretensionsIndeed, to understand this victory, one has to understand the nature of Ms. Banerjees appeal and her carefully crafted image built over the years. She is still a hero for her largely lower-middle class urban and rural constituents, who took on the mighty Left machine virtually single-handedly. While in Opposition, she fearlessly led michils (walkabouts) to the bastions of government power in Kolkata, stormed Singur, Nandigram and every other site of state oppression, unmindful of brutal baton-wielding cops. As Chief Minister, she outdid the Opposition in leading protest marches. Through it all she retained a simple lifestyle, and stuck to her entertaining colloquial Bengali speeches that keep the audience hanging on to every word.But beyond the legend, there were other factors in this election. One, the results make it clear that the Left-Congress understanding did not work as well as it should have. While the clearly more disciplined cadres of the Left parties shifted their votes to the Congress, making the latter the second largest party in the State Assembly ahead of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Congress workers appear to have shifted their votes to the Trinamool Congress, a legacy of years of antipathy to the Left.Two, if the battle had initially appeared to be a direct contest between the Trinamool Congress and the Left-Congress combine, at some stage the Bharatiya Janata Party upped its game. Once the BJP realised that the gains it had made in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in the State, when it got around 17 per cent of the vote, could shrink to the roughly four per cent it got in the 2011 Assembly elections, it became more aggressive. It eventually got about 10 per cent of the vote  just 2 per cent behind the Congress  and three seats.Three, a factor that cannot be discounted, according to Left leaders, is the silent polarisation in various pockets. In the past five years of Trinamool Congress rule, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh shakhas have grown at a rapid pace. And in January this year in Malda, riots broke out in Kaliachak after a rally led by Muslims protesting against Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwaris derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad turned violent. It was immediately seized upon by the BJP. In fact, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury credits the Trinamool Congress for the entry of the BJP in West Bengal.Simultaneously, Ms. Banerjees overtures to Muslims (the controversial stipend for imams , and her direct appeal to the community from political platforms) who constitute 28 per cent of the population have also helped create a Hindu vote. The converse of this is that it has helped the Trinamool Congress consolidate the minority vote.Four, if the Congress in the State is sitting smug, saying it hopes to build on the fact that it is the second largest party  even though by a wide margin  disappointment in the CPI(M) is acute because of the extent of defeat. Party leaders said they will analyse the data before pronouncing what went wrong, but one candidly confessed: The problem probably lies with us; we have not done enough for organisational renewal.Finally, the Kanyashree scheme  education stipends for girls, including a one-time payment of Rs.25,000 at the age of 18, provided the beneficiary continues to study  cycles for schoolchildren, the Rs.2/kg rice for the poor and a vast improvement in roads may have helped too, especially in the absence of an alternative that appealed to the people.Thanda thanda, cool coolOn Thursday morning, as it became clear that the Trinamool Congress was heading for a second consecutive triumph, party workers, their faces coloured green, danced through the streets of Kolkata to the beat of the dhak-dhol. Outside Ms. Banerjees home, exultant supporters shouted,  Thanda thanda, cool cool, ghore ghore Trinamool [Trinamool Congress in every home].But a little over 200 km away in Asansol, Trinamool workers in celebratory mode vandalised a CPI(M) office  an ominous start to the partys second term, especially as it comes days after Ms. Banerjee publicly threatening senior police officers who were just obeying the Election Commission and maintaining law and order.smita.g@thehindu.co.in"

The reason for believing TMC might not win big was a buzz during the election that the Left Front-Congress alliance had momentum on its side. This had something to do with urban middle class disenchantment with TMC.But anyone who had gone around Bengal during the elections would have seen that there was no real mood of anti-incumbency. By and large, rural voters seemed satisfied with the TMC governments investment in infrastructure. Roads and bridges had been built, more people had access to water and electricity and there was some improvement in the state-run health system.This, along with schemes like subsidised rice and free bicycles for students, had meant that rural Bengal was always going to back TMC. Muslim voters, who constitute 27% of West Bengals population, were appeased by stipends to imams and muezzins and scholarships to students. The election results have borne out the governments efforts. Except for districts like Malda and Murshidabad, where Congress has traditionally been strong, and Darjeeling where the Gorkha Janmukti Manch is dominant, TMC did uniformly well across the state.The moving force behind TMCs strong performance was chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself. She ran a whirlwind election campaign, holding some 200 rallies over the course of two months. Mamata turned the tables on the opposition alliance, which had made her the personal target of its campaign, by making the 2016 election a referendum on herself.It is, however, TMCs exceptional performance in urban areas, where discontent with the government seemed to have been strongest, that carried the party over the 200-seat mark. TMC won all 11 seats in Kolkata including the ones where candidates, who had figured in a video sting taking bribes, were contesting. One of the reasons for the TMCs sweep in Kolkata was the unknown opposition alliance candidates pitted against TMC heavyweights.On paper, the Left-Congress alliance had seemed formidable. It had roughly the same share of the vote as TMC in the 2014 national elections. The alliance also displayed surprisingly good chemistry by not only dividing electoral constituencies smoothly, but also campaigning vigorously on a joint platform. It, however, won a combined vote share of 39% and only 76 seats. The alliance was undone by several factors.First, the alliance did not have a face with statewide acceptability. Its CM candidate, Surjya Kanta Mishra, was not up to the task as was evident from his inability to win even from his own constituency. Second, unlike Bihar, where the combination of the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal worked well, there wasnt a smooth transfer of votes from Congress to the Left and vice versa.Third, the people of West Bengal have not forgiven the Left Front for the stagnation it inflicted on the state. This was reflected in the decline of the Left Fronts vote from 30% in 2014 to 26% now, even as Congress marginally increased its vote share. Finally, the alliance did not have a new narrative to offer to Bengal except for being opposed to TMC and Mamata.In 2011, there were huge expectations of poriborton or change that TMC had promised after 34 years of Left Front rule. While TMCs welfare policies delivered a resounding mandate and marginalised issues such as corruption, the party has failed on several counts. Political violence and intimidation, which are a legacy of the Left Fronts tenure, continue unabated in West Bengal. This is largely the effect of mass migration of the Lefts lumpen cadre to TMC.Whereas a heavy security presence ensured a relatively peaceful poll in 2016, earlier civic and panchayat elections in the state have been marked by violence. At the same time, lack of industry and employment opportunities have given rise to extortion rackets or syndicates run by TMC members.During Mamatas second term as CM, expectations might not be as high as in 2011. It is unlikely that she will be able to break free from the constraints of her partys organisation and support base. But given her mandate, the question is whether Mamata will crack down on some of the most corrupt and violent elements in her party. Or will she take it as an endorsement for business as usual?"
59284b807be9e0137c77c938,Mamata steamrolls all her opponents,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/547909/mamata-steamrolls-all-her-opponents.html,2016-05-22,"Mamata steamrolls all her opponentsAloke Banerjee, May 22, 2016, 0:07 ISTThe year-long blizzard of propaganda could not shrivel her prospects. Disturbing TV visuals of her ministers taking bribe, collapse of a Kolkata flyover killing over 20 people prior to the election had little impact on the results in West Bengal as Mamata Banerjee stormed back to power for a second consecutive term, leaving many political pundits baffled and fumbling for words to explain her unbelievably massive victory both in terms of seats and vote share.How can one explain Mamatas triumph? Is the mandate a yes in favour of her governments development activities or a no to a hastily conjured alliance of two ideologically opposed partners, the Left and the Congress? The story contains both.The no factorTrouble was brewing within the Left-Congress alliance since its inception. Many CPM leaders, from the Polit Bureau to the district committees, were ideologically opposed to the idea of joining hands with the Congress. It is no longer a secret now that many Left voters chose NOTA (None Of The Above) instead of an alliance candidate. Similarly, a large number of Congress supporters refused to vote for Left candidates, they voted for the Trinamool instead. In short, neither the arithmetic nor the chemistry worked for the alliance.The Left-Congress partnership emerged too late, barely two months before the polls, giving it too little time to bloom. Also, after repeated electoral debacles, first in the 2011 Assembly polls and then in the municipal and Lok Sabha elections, the powerful organisation of the Left, which won them so many elections in the past, collapsed completely. So, while Trinamool workers were busy campaigning in the villages, the Left leaders had little option but to use air-conditioned studios of news channels as their primary vehicles of campaign.The silent voters, whose votes finally determine the outcome of every election, did not trust the alliance. Many believed the Left-Congress bonhomie would not last long even if the alliance came to power. As a result, the government would fall, requiring another round of elections. These silent voters chose stability and voted for the Trinamool.The Muslim community influenced electoral outcome in at least 80 of the 294 seats by supporting the Trinamool. The Left could be credited for preventing communal riots, but they virtually did nothing for the Muslims during their 30-year rule. True, Mamata promised much and delivered little, but unlike the Left, she delivered something, felt the Muslims, particularly those in the rural areas.Finally, the Left-Congress leaders expectations on the possible swing in the BJPs vote share in their favour went horribly wrong. True to their calculations, the BJPs vote share came down from 17% to 10%, but the swing entirely favoured the Trinamool.The yes factorStrange though it may sound, but many of the accusations against Mamata in fact helped her. The Trinamool was accused of running a syndicate raj in West Bengal. True, the syndicates fleece realtors, supply low-grade building materials at prices much higher than the market rates, but syndicate members, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, have no other source of livelihood.There are at least 30,000 syndicate members in the Rajarhat-New Town area alone, and the Left-Congress alliances promise of action against syndicates if they came to power worried these young men and they worked body and soul to ensure a Trinamool victory. Syndicates exist in all urban areas in Bengal and all of them worked for the Trinamool. Similarly, the Oppositions charge that the government was wasting tax payers money to give donations to the local clubs alienated the club members, who doggedly worked to ensure Mamatas victory.On the other hand, in spite of the financial constraints and the resulting shoe-string budget, Mamatas government successfully implemented a slew of development projects, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. In spite of repeated incidents of violence against women, Mamata managed to win them over by distributing cycles to girl students. Owning a cycle in a village is like possessing a Maruti car in a city. Interestingly, the idea of distributing cycles was floated by a chief secretary during the last leg of the Left Front rule, but the proposal was bluntly shot down by the then finance minister Asim Dasgupta.Finally, distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg came as Mamatas masterstroke. Better road connectivity, availability of water and medicines increased the Trinamools vote share. Though corruption was clearly visible, local Trinamool leaders were pardoned by the rural voters. Issues like the Saradha chit fund scam, Narada sting operation, flyover collapse and campus violence eroded the Trinamools vote share, but the erosion was confined to urban seats and every Narada-tainted minister won, albeit with a lower margin.So, where does Mamata go from here? Insiders say Delhi is her next target. If the Third Front takes shape after the Uttar Pradesh elections, she hopes to play a major role at the Centre. Till then, she will concentrate on the next panchayat election in West Bengal to further consolidate her position.(The writer is a senior journalist based in Kolkata)"

Daal-chawal only ideology that matters,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/rule-of-right-daal-chawal-only-ideology-that-matters/,2016-05-22,"By now, enough has been said about how the state assembly elections have been a booster shot for BJP, how they have moved India closer to a Congress-mukt Bharat and how the results have been another kick in the guts for Rahul Gandhi. With over 35% of Indians now under the rule of BJP state governments (43% if we count BJP alliances) as compared to just 7% for Congress (15% if we count its Bihar alliance), Amit Shah is rightly exulting at the prospect of BJP domination from Parliament to panchayats. The BJPs replacement of Congress as the dominant national party makes the narrative of rightwing ascendance seductive.Yet, look deeper and the most important lesson coming out of these elections is not a triumph of ideology but its demise and the replacement of blind political loyalties of the past by a new neta-voter relationship that is increasingly transactional. Mamata Banerjee decimated the Left with even more seats than her poribartan year of 2011 and Jayalalithaa rewrote the script of Dravidian politics to become the first Tamil CM to get re-elected since MGR because both inherently understood this fundamental shift in political cultures.Politics in Kolkata and Chennai beats to different rhythms but the one thing that unites the game-changing triumphs of both regional satraps is their single-minded focus on a social welfare net for the rural poor, rural development and a plethora of populist freebies for different interest groups.Consider the Mamata model first. Just like Nitish Kumar in Bihar, she fixed roads (5,212.94km of roads in Bengal were improved and renovated during 2011-2015 as compared to 3,220.28km during 2007-2011), brought rural electrification (over 90% of below poverty line households electrified by January 2016, compared to just 18.18% in 2011) and increased social spending (tripled from around Rs 7,000 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 20,000 crore in 2014-15).Along with the Nitish-like Kanyashree scheme for greater enrolment of girls in schools and the distribution of bicycles to four million schoolchildren, Mamata also borrowed a leaf from Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, who earned the sobriquet of chawal waale baba with his Rs 1 and 2/kg rice schemes for the poor. These schemes have been central to Raman Singhs BJP government remaining in power in Chhattisgarh since 2003. In West Bengal, not only did Didi increase state support for foodgrain almost 12 times, from Rs 516.32 crore during 2010-11 to Rs 6,000 crore, she made rice available at Rs 2 per kilo, entitling almost 80 million Bengalis to subsidized rice.Mamatas focus on PDS and freebies, of course, paled next to what Amma of Poes Garden offered in Tamil Nadu, but West Bengal has a much lower starting base. Jayalalithaas plethora of promises such as subsidized mopeds and her low-cost canteens, medicines, buses, cement, housing, free goats and cows, etc built on a strong culture of social spending in Tamil politics that both AIADMK and DMK have embraced for decades.Her focus on delivery  combined with a superb, tactically fought election, where there was virtually nothing to separate the two parties ideologically  fetched her uniform gains in all Tamil Nadu regions. It also allowed her to break the revolving-door rule of Tamil politics where power has see-sawed between the two main parties for three decades. Jayalalithaa may have returned to power with a reduced majority, but make no mistake: this is a historic victory.The BJPs path-breaking triumph in Guwahati completes the ideological lesson from these elections. Unlike Congress, BJP learnt its lessons and course-corrected after losses in Bihar and Delhi where its local leaders felt sidelined and its message of development got sidetracked by divisive issues. In Assam, not only did it project a local chief ministerial face in Sarbananda Sonowal, it reaped the benefits of local clout through its ex-Congress import Himanta Biswa Sarma and smart alliances with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF). Although this was the first state election being fought after the JNU and beef controversies, the BJP remained focused on local issues during the campaign. The BJPs Assam model offers a good template as the party seeks to expand further from its north Indian heartland.The BJP is dominant nationally and Narendra Modi remains Indias most popular leader  but in a polity where both BJP and Congress put together have won less than half the seats and votes polled in all the 30 assembly elections held since 2012. As this paper has reported, the two got 42% of the votes polled in these contests, 58% went to other parties. Even in the latest contest, Congress won 115 seats, BJP 64, but others won 643. As many as 465 seats were won by parties not allied to either BJP or Congress.This is the most revealing statistic that defines Indian politics today. The Congress may be declining but regional parties continue to hold the bulk of India and more than Left or Right, voters care more about daal and chawal  and who provides it better."

(Source: PTI) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee enjoys watching aquarium fish at her Kalighat residence in Kolkata on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)SLAMMING THE Trinamool Congress for conducting the lavish swearing-in ceremony at the traffic-heavy Red Road, state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury on Tuesday said the party will boycott the programme and launch a protest movement when Mamata Banerjee takes oath as Chief Minister on Friday.We will not attend the swearing-in ceremony of Mamata Banerjee on Friday. There is no meaning in attending the programme when our partymen are attacked by Trinamool Congress workers in post-poll violence, Chowdhury said at a press conference ahead of a meeting with party MLAs and district presidents here.He questioned the need to spend crores of rupees for the swearing-in ceremony of the new government and said it was in sharp contrast to the severe financial crisis faced by the state. At a time when Bengal has been rated as the number one debt-ridden state in the country and is heading for financial bankruptcy, was there any necessity of a celebration of this magnitude at the cost of the state exchequer?, he asked.Referring to the preparations for the ceremony on Red Road, for which vehicular traffic has been closed on the stretch for at least five days, Chowdhury said, Red Road is the lifeline of the city without which the traffic movement is chocked. The celebration is the orchestration of the ruling partys victory and is a splash of power and grandeur.We are in the process of obtaining permission for a protest movement on May 27, the day when the new government would be sworn in. It will be at the Y Channel in Esplanade, the WBPCC president added.Chowdhury further attacked the state government over the alleged post-poll violence and said the Trinamool should ensure that it keeps the promises it made to the people, riding on which it came back to power. Maintaining law and order should be the top priority at the moment. No investment will come here if potential investors see that the condition here was not conducive enough for investment. Already availability of rice at Rs 2 per kg has been stopped at public distribution centres soon after elections, he said.On who could be the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly from Congress, which won on 44 of 294 assembly Chowdhury said a list of MLAs along with their detailed CVs has been sent to AICC which will take a decision soon. It is a legislative process and the name would be determined by the central leadership. I think it would be prudent to leave it up to them. I will give my suggestions only I am asked to, but I cant disclose it to the media now, he said.Asked if the Congress would be present at the Left Fronts two-day sit-in on May 25 and 26 at Esplanade in protest against post-poll attacks on its supporters, Chowdhury said, Obviously we will be there After all we are in an alliance.[with PTI inputs]For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

PTI Chandan Bose, the accused in Jawahar Bagh clash, being taken to jail in Mathura on Thursday. PTIRam Vriksh Yadav, the head of the cult outfit Swadhin Bharat Vidhik Satyagrah, had such sway over his followers that continued to live in camps in Jawahar Bagh in Mathura despite being served namak and roti (salt and chapati) and khichdi, alternately as lunch and dinner.The alleged mastermind of the violence on June 2 during police action to evict the squatters, Ram Vriksh had told his followers, who had illegally encroached the public park that police can never attack the camp as they cannot use arms against women and children. The followers who expressed desire to leave the camp for their native homes fearing action from the local administration, were motivated to stay back and told how they can attack the police if they ever raided Jawahar Bagh.These are some of the details that Ram Vrikshs close associate Chandan Bose, who was arrested along with his wife from Basti district Wednesday, revealed during the police interrogation.Bose and his wife were produced in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Thursday, which sent them to 14 days judicial custody. The couple had been on the run after the violence on June 2 saw 29 people, including two police officers and, reportedly, Ram Vriksh, dead.SSP Mathura, Babloo Kumar told The Indian Express that during preliminary interrogation Bose divulged crucial information about the functioning of the camp in the Jawahar Bagh. Bose, who is said to be the second-in-command in the cult outfit, told the police how the followers were assigned different duties in the camp based on the their educational and personal skills.Watch Video: Whats making newsA quack from Buxar, who was also a follower of Jai Gurudev, acted as the doctor in the camp while Bose was handling finances and ration. Those who were skilled in handling arms, used to give shooting training inside the camp while those who had studied management and law were dealing with their respective sections of fund management and legal issues, the SSP said quoting Bose.According to police, Bose told them that there were some 2,500 people living in the camp till June 2, the day when police moved in to evict the area. There used to be a head count of the members every night before they went to bed, Bose told the police.Ram Vriksh used to collect funds to run the camp from the inmates even as many of the rich followers of Jai Gurudev used to donate lakhs of rupees.Bose recalled that recently some from Deoria district donated Rs 10 lakh. But, such big donations came only once in a while. Ram Vriksh used to issue receipts against the donations too, the SSP said.Bose also told the police that those living in the camp were urged to go to their native villages during harvest season and bring back maximum donation of foodgrains. The villagers used to come back with trucks loaded with wheat, rice and sugarcane, the SSP said.The modus operadi of collecting funds was reportedly copied from the Jai Gurudev Trust in Mathura and Pithora.Bose accepted that people in the camp had laptops, mobiles and guns. He, however, could not reveal from where the arms were procured saying that he wasnt in charge of that section.The SSP said that based on Boses interrogation, they now have several leads, which will help them in carrying out the probe.Accused of inciting the violence on June 2, Bose told police that he was a native of West Bengal and had shifted to Ludhiana about 20 years ago. He ran a small garment business and claimed to have came in contact with Ram Vriksh during the latters visit to Ludhiana a few years ago, police said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Odisha was one of them  the BJP won just one out of 21 seats and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which had ruled the state since 2000, won the rest. The BJP was no greenhorn in Odisha, as it was in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, two other states that bucked the Modi wave. The BJP was part of the ruling coalition in the state between 2000 and 2009.What it pointed to was the BJD's, or more accurately, its leader Naveen Patnaik 's grip on the state. It did not matter that the BJD was not part of a national coalition, nor were the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu. Voters in these states backed the regional parties as if it were an assembly election, except that Odisha also had its state polls concurrently, which benefited the BJD in the general election.In its best ever performance, the BJD swept the assembly election too, bagging 117 out of 147 seats (the BJP won 10 and the Congress 16), giving Patnaik his fourth straight term as chief minister. Only two of his present counterparts have won four consecutive elections or more: Sikkim's Pawan Chamling and Tripura's Manik Sarkar. Patnaik's father Biju Patnaik was chief minister of Odisha twice.The BJD and the BJP first joined hands in 1998 and fought every parliamentary and state election together till 2009, when the BJD decided to part ways because the BJP did not agree to give the BJD more seats than in the old seat-sharing agreement. Some cite the Kandhamal riots of 2008, in which the killing of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader led to clashes between Hindus and Christians, as another reason for the BJD severing ties with the BJP; some 38 perished in those clashes that led to the conviction of a BJP MLA.Modi is aware of how far the BJP has to go to even dream of having a shot at power on its own in the state in 2019 and that is why he chose Odisha for one of the five rallies to mark his government's second anniversary.The rally in Balasore, 200 km north of the state capital Bhubaneswar, on June 2, was Modi's second in the state since February. It was also his fourth visit to Odisha since becoming prime minister in May 2014. At the rally he told an estimated 50,000 people that while Odisha is a mineral-rich state, its people continue to be poor, calling Patnaik's government ""soi hui sarkar"" (government in slumber). Modi said neither the Congress at the Centre earlier nor the BJD in the state has given an account of its performance like his government has. Patnaik responded by saying his government believes in work, not propaganda. He accused the Modi government of stopping some schemes for the state and reducing its contribution in others.Sudhir Patnaik, editor of Samadrusti, an Odia fortnightly, says Modi refrains from attacking Naveen, creating confusion in the minds of voters and the BJP cadre. ""People see the BJP and BJD together and that doesn't help the BJP. These days, Modi's rallies are not attracting the kind of crowds they used to."" He adds that the 69-year-old chief minister also rarely hits out at opposition leaders. ""Naveen Patnaik is an astute politician who uses silence to his advantage.""Can the BJP look to its rise in Assam for some lessons in Odisha? After all, the party was not a force to reckon with in Assam after the 2011 assembly polls, in which it won only five out of 126 seats. But it managed to regroup in the years leading up to the 2016 election, which it won through a coalition, helped in no small measure by anti-incumbency against former Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who had won three consecutive terms. The BJP is facing a similar scenario in Odisha, with three years to go for the next poll, so can it capitalise on it?Tathagata Satpathy, a BJD MP, does not think so. ""The BJP had (Sarbananda) Sonowal in Assam. Here they don't have a leader like him."" Sudhir Patnaik concurs: ""Neither the BJP nor the Congress has a leader who can stand up to Naveen Patnaik."" The Congress is the chief opposition party in the state, though the number of its MLAs and its vote share have been falling since 2004. The BJP's vote share, on the other hand, rose between 2009 and 2014.The BJP's Samir Mohanty says its leadership vacuum in the state has ended with Dharmendra Pradhan, Union minister of state (independent charge) for petroleum and natural gas, being accepted by the people to lead the party. ""He is ahead (of the other leaders)."" But Pradhan, observers believe, does not have a pan-state appeal. The other prominent leader, Jual Oram, who is the sole BJP MP from Odisha and is the Union tribal affairs minister, is not in a better position either, though tribals account for nearly a fourth of the state's population. Neither Pradhan nor Oram was available for comment.Differences within the party are also becoming more evident. Recently, Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray stayed away from a party event in the city, protesting against the delay in the upgrade of a local hospital, despite promises by the prime minister. This forced two Union ministers who had been scheduled to attend the event to cancel their plans. Arun Singh, a BJP general secretary who is in charge of Odisha, makes light of it, and says the issue concerned Ray's constituency, not the party.Making things worse for the BJP were the recent bypolls to three local body seats, including one in Cuttack: the party came third in all of them. The BJD, which had held them, lost two to the Congress. Satpathy says while the issues on which these were fought were local, the results are a signal to the party not to be overconfident. Prasad Harichandan, president of the Congress in Odisha, sees the results as a harbinger of better days, but this might be wishful thinking, as these are not Lok Sabha or assembly by-polls.Bhartruhari Mahtab, BJD MP from Cuttack, alleges an understanding between the Congress and BJP in the bypoll in the city, which led to the former's victory. ""The consolidation of anti-BJD votes is happening sporadically."" He said the BJD wants both the Congress and the BJP in the state. ""We want a triangular fight.""What the opposition will be banking on is anti-incumbency as Patnaik will have been chief minister for 19 years when the state goes to the polls in 2019. But Satpathy says there is no anti-incumbency in Odisha, thanks to welfare schemes, like 25 kg rice per month at Rs 1 per kg for the poor, and free bicycles to schoolchildren. These welfare schemes have, to an extent, blunted the impact of a Rs 4,600 crore chit fund scam, in which an MP and an MLA of the BJD were arrested. Also, the Trinamool's comprehensive victory in West Bengal, despite its members being linked to the Saradha scam, makes some wonder whether the chit fund scam will have any impact in the 2019 polls, which will coincide with the general election.A Rs 59,000 crore illegal iron and manganese ore scam, which was probed by a commission before the 2014 polls, did not affect the BJD at the hustings. ""We can't say which issues will become important at the time of the election,"" says BJP's Odisha president Basanta Panda. He rules out the possibility of the BJP going back to join forces with the BJD, at least not before the 2019 election. Singh says the BJP is organising programmes against the government frequently at the mandal and district levels. ""It takes time to fight the party you ran the government with. But we are confident of winning the 2019 election.""""Anti-incumbency will work only if there is an alternative. In 2014, the Congress was not an alternative to the BJD,"" says Harichandan. The Congress is hopeful about the 2019 polls. ""If the BJP could form the government (at the Centre) with a 31% vote share (in 2014), why should we lose hope?"" asks Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the Odisha assembly, Narasingha Mishra. The Congress had a vote share of 26% in the 2014 assembly election.If Modi's rallies are any indication, there is no doubt that capturing Odisha is a top priority for the BJP and with three years to go for the election, it has enough time to work toward its goal. But time is not the only factor; the BJP cannot afford to be rudderless in the state. Modi's frequent visits to the state notwithstanding, the party has to identify and rally behind a leader who can take on the might of Naveen Patnaik."
5923bc047be9e01fcef05835,Redressal policy for water dispute hazy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553627/redressal-policy-water-dispute-hazy.html,2016-06-21,"Redressal policy for water dispute hazyBy Bhaskar Parichha, Jun 22, 2016, DHNS 0:28 ISTExperts feel the need for an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in India.As recent as in March, the National thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had to shut down its 2100 MW capacity power plant in West Bengal because it hadnt enough water to be used as coolant for the equipment.The level in the Farakka feeder canal which supplies water to the thermal plant had shrunk to hopeless levels. That was also the reason why electricity supply to five states was disrupted and some 40,000 families had to remain without power for days together.Drinking water was in short supply in Farakka town. Plying of boats on river Ganga had to be suspended and around 13 barges carrying coal were stuck in the mid-river because of low levels of water. This demonstrates that the Ganges is drying up faster than estimated.According to different reports, in the last decade itself, water level in 91% of countrys water reservoirs has come down. The Central Water Commissions findings are even more frightening  only 29% of water is left behind against their carrying capacity. Whats more, ground water which is the major source 85%  of water in India is depleting endlessly.Across states in India, dependence on water tankers today is greater than before. Water-related scuffles nowadays are common place. Recently, in the villages of Latur district of Maharashtra, prohibitive orders had to be clamped. Water supply to swimming pools has been cut off in Maharashtra.According to NASA, the ground water level in India is diminishing by 0.3 metre annually. Paradoxically, when there is a severe shortage of water, farmers in desiccated areas are encouraged to produce water-guzzling sugar cane. Same is the case with wheat and rice which are water-intensive.On the other side of the spectrum, water disputes are constantly on the rise. In addition to the fact that there isnt enough water for irrigation because of the myopic policies of successive governments, water is causing bad blood among people. In Punjab, after the Sutlej link canal bill was passed in the assembly, fissures have surfaced between Haryana and Punjab over division of water. In Haryana, farmers owning agricultural fields are screaming for water.Of late, state after state seem to be relying on the principle of Harmon. State governments are fostering a gut feeling that they have full control over the water that flows down from the state line.In order to trim down water disputes between states, the Inter-State Water Dispute Act was enacted in 1956. But the water dispute tribunals have consistently failed to implement the accords reached between states.In as much as the tribunal doesnt have coercive powers and its judgments are not binding on the states, the pronoun-cements are flouted and states straightforwardly refuse to abide by the agreements reach-ed. Even the Centre is toothless, as it happened in the case of Ravi-Beas river water dispute.Institutional safeguardsIn reality, the water dispute redressal mechanism in India is a lot ambiguous, hazy and muddled. Those involved in the water row, time and again, has recourse to bullying. Resolution of water dispute is a hell of a job because of the sheer number of players  the Centre, the state governments, the water dispute tribunals, the civil society and so on. Even institutional safeguards meant for development and progress is becoming ineffective.Take for example, the Cauvery river water dispute. From 1968 to 1990, there were as many as 26 minister-level talks between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; but there has been no answer to the row. Because of increasing politicisation, the Cauvery river dispute tribunals proposals have become some sort of a wild goose chase.Experts feel the increasing need of an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in the country. This Central regulatory body must know how to undertake water upkeep seriously. In the same way, we need a mechanism to share our water in the best possible way keeping in mind the social equity, need and lots of common wisdom.Industries, farmers and the common citizenry should be the partners in any talk of water distribution and conservation. We also need a couple of new laws and make stronger the present ones to maintain the ecological balance of Indias rivers. A new law to maintain minimum levels of water too is considered necessary. Politicisation of water is the last thing to be wished.All that is looked for is an attitudinal change among stakeholders. A long time solution to Indias water problem is enormously significant and the sooner we find an answer to the vexing problem of depleting water sources and the corresponding feuds the better. Water is one commodity which can never be put to buy and sell. Commercialisation of water can happen only in the depths of despair."

The seven tea gardens are Birpara, Garganda, Lankapara, Tulsipara, Huntapara, Dhumchipara and Demdima.After the Centre announced that it was taking over seven of the 14 shut tea gardens belonging at Dooars in Alipurduar, the condition of the workers of these tea gardens has worsened. They are in a state of na ghar ka na ghat ka. The decision was taken ahead of the Assembly elections in Bengal.

The Duncans group, however, had moved Calcutta High Court against the decision.Prodded by the state government, Duncans was paying wages to the workers of its other tea gardens, Mamata said, indicating that the Centres move has left the entire process in a logjam. We will soon initiate talks with the Centre in this regard, she added.Meanwhile, Mamata said the state plans to take over six tea gardens  Red Bank, Surendra Nagar, Dharanipur, Dekhlapara, Bandapani, Madhu and Rahimabad  at Dooars.The six tea gardens have been shut for a long time.

591f0d177be9e025a5d4a160,"Mountain of debt owing to sops, Mamata's bugbear",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/559558/mountain-debt-owing-sops-mamatas.html,2016-07-22,"Mountain of debt owing to sops, Mamata's bugbearDrimi Chaudhuri, July 23, 2016, Kolkata, 23:30 ISTDatelineWhere Amma gives away laptops and scooters, Didi offers bicycles and shoes. Both examples of sops-driven populist politics, Didis (West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) pain seems to have just started, unlike that of Amma (Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa).And the pain can be traced back to the dismal financial condition of West Bengal, an issue Mamata, also Trinamool Congress chairperson and Didi to her supporters  and even some detractors  has never stopped harping on.Unlike Amma, Didi was never a matinee idol or known for an ostentatious lifestyle. Despite coming from opposite ends of the spectrum, both women followed a similar brand of politics. Unlike Jayalalithaa, however, Mamata never had the means to run her drive of populism. With Bengal facing a severe financial crunch, Mamata could be facing something Jayalalithaa is not likely to ever face: bankruptcy.Two months into her second term, which Mamata entered like an unstoppable force, her government seems to have met with an immovable object. Trinamool, the ruling party in Bengal that returned with an unbelievable mandate, is often blamed ofideological bankruptcy. For Mamata, the term could come with a new meaning since Bengal is among the most cash-starved states in India.Mamata has never minced words to state that the biggest challenge before her is not holding on to power but insolvency, notwithstanding the politics of largesse she has turned into her trademark since coming to power in 2011. In the last six years that she has been in office, Mamata has given away millions of cycles to hapless girl students, shoes to others who cannot afford a pair and lakhs of rupees to neighbourhood clubs so they can pursue sporting activities.Even as her politics of largesse continues unabated, the wrinkles on the forehead of state Finance Minister Amit Mitra seems to have set deeper. The matter on top of Mitras head has to be Bengals outstanding debt of Rs 3 lakh crore, a nightmare he had to combat while presenting the state budget in June. While Mitra admitted in the Assembly that the state was facing a debt trap, Mamata went a step further and described it as a death trap.Party insiders have admitted that the mountain of debt on Bengal could go some distance to change Trinamools political priorities. Political analysts have noted with some caution that Mamatas politics of largesse to the bottom of the pyramid, funnelling crores of rupees into social and civic infrastructure  free bicycles and shoes, rice at Rs 2 per kg, metalled roads through villages  might have reaped her rich political dividends but have left the exchequer further crippled. And despite the landslide majority, money remains her top concern.Mitra has often pointed out that during its first term in office, the Trinamool government raised plan expenditure from Rs 14,000 crore to Rs 53,000 crore. That, however, was not enough to keep the debt burden at bay, which is fast devouring the states resources. Going by cold statistics, in 2015-16, the Bengal government paid almost Rs 28,000 crore to its debtors, with the accumulated interest during the ongoing fiscal year likely to stand at upwards of Rs 32,000 crore.Mitra also admitted that even though the states debt stock increased by more than Rs 1 lakh crore till March 2016, around Rs 94,000 crore would go just to service existing debt. While Mamata and the Trinamool leadership are not oblivious to this scenario, with the panchayat elections scheduled for 2018, the ruling party cannot afford to deviate from its path of creating human capital, based on sops. Leaders are aware that this means spending more on social and civic infrastructure, funds for which are fast drying up.Overtakes LeftOfficials have often admitted in off-the-record conversations that even though Mamata counts the debt burden as the only legacy of the 34-year-long Left rule, her government has borrowed more money in the last six years than the Left did between 1977 and 2011. Bengals latest market borrowing came in February, when the state borrowed up a loan of Rs 2,500 crore. With this fresh loan, Bengals total open market borrowing reaches Rs 1,03,546 crore.Statistics from the RBI reveal that the quantum of open market borrowing, which attracts the highest interest rate, has far exceeded the figure during 34 years of Left rule, which between 1977 and 2011 was little over Rs 72,000 crore. In contrast, Mamatas government has borrowed Rs 1,01,046 crore in its first five years, between May 2011 and February 2016. The open secret is that her government has done little to lessen the burden during her first term, with debt repayment amount set to reach Rs 18,359 crore by 2017-2018.Analysts say that Mamata will have to find ways to keep Central funds flowing in from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom she considers her ideological rival, largely owing to her vote bank politics of keeping Muslims in good humour. It is common knowledge that nearly 80% of the states tax revenue was consumed by debt repayments in 2015-16, and even in this fiscal, the situation is no better.Although Trinamool has been able to convince voters about the governments development efforts, Mamata is aware how much the debt burden is bothering the administration and the ruling party.The Opposition parties have often alleged that high market borrowings are essentially used to service sops Mamata has been giving away. She, however, has always argued that borrowings are used to repay debt left behind by the earlier regime.What is waiting to be seen is whether she can generate enough resources to support her politics, along with necessary administrative expenditure, or if she crumbles under the mountain of debt and is forced to change her political path."
58f4faffa3d24b0b70c1bc31,Tearing the curtain of darkness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Tearing-the-curtain-of-darkness/article14518209.ece,2016-07-31,"he story goes, not apocryphal, that every time Mahasweta Devi visited Jharkhand, she would demand that Birsa Munda be unshackled. In Ranchi, on Birsa Munda Chowk, theres a statue of this fiery tribal leader who died in jail during British rule in 1900. The statue shows him wearing a turban and dhoti, his hands in chains. Officials would tell her that the British photographed him in chains and that perhaps became a reference point for all depictions of the tribal hero who died at 25. The chains also symbolised his struggle for freedom, they claimed.An old Ranchi hand recalls her saying:  Shaddhin deshe keno shekole bandha (why is he still in chains when India is free)? as she gathered for a meeting of bonded labourers in the 1980s. Last month, the Jharkhand government decided to free Birsa Munda of his shackles, 116 years after his death, and several years after the writer and activist voiced her demand. She may not be around to see a free Munda, but the downtrodden  tribals, dispossessed, marginalised, landless  and those who are fighting against injustice and are still in chains know that she is there in spirit.Mahasweta Devi had woven a historical fiction around the legend of Birsa Munda in her 1977 novel Aranyer Adhikar (Rights of the Forest), which chronicles the turbulent period of the late 19th century, and particularly the tribal armed uprising against the British led by Birsa Munda to rid the forests and hills of usurpers. She received the Sahitya Akademi award for it in 1979, though Mahasweta Devi, the political and social activist and conscience-keeper, wouldnt bother herself too much with the awards and accolades (Padma Shri, Padma Vibhushan, Jnanpith, Magsaysay) bagged by Mahasweta Devi, the writer.Yet her books sold well. Her stories of the subaltern will live forever as long as theres oppression in the world and the poorest of the poor need a voice. In todays atmosphere of growing intolerance, its imperative to read her work and remind ourselves of her lifelong fight for those who are sought to be silenced.Her compassionate crusade through art and activism to claim for tribal peoples a just and honourable place in India's national life got her the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1997. Accepting it, she had said: My India still lives behind a curtain of darkness. A curtain that separates mainstream society from the poor and the deprived.For justice and honourAs justice and honour still elude a large slice of tribal peoples across Wet Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and the north-eastern States, her narratives on their shackled lives are more relevant than ever.Hajar Churashir Maa (Mother of 1084), one of her most widely read books, was adapted for theatre and film. Even though it was written in the turbulent 1970s at the peak of the Naxalite movement, its message is perhaps even more powerful in the prevailing atmosphere of a million mutinies between state and people.The novel begins with the death of a son and his mother waking up to the terrible fact of him being reduced to a number. Its a chilling portrayal of a social movement that wasnt quite successful, put down by brutal force; and we suffer along with the mother, Sujata Chatterjee, who tries to understand a revolutionary movement that took her son Brati. Her journey is also one of self-discovery and her place in a feudal world.Writing and activism were in Mahasweta Devis genes. Her parents were writers, her uncle Ritwik Ghatak, her husband Bijon Bhattacharya, a radical Left playwright and a member of the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA). At 28, she toured parts of backward Rajasthan alone, to research for a biography on Rani of Jhansi, her first book. From the bonded labourers of Palamu to the denotified tribes of Bengal  Lodhas of Medinipur, Khedia Shobors of Purulia, Dhikaros of Birbhum  Mahasweta Devi spent three decades of her life listening to them to tell us about these lives, outside the margins of society.As Irom Sharmila decides to call off her fast in Manipur, with the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act yet to be repealed, we are drawn to another of Mahasweta Devis famous stories, Draupadi. In a powerful retelling of this Mahabharata character, we have Draupadi, or Dopdi, as a rebel who is cornered by the police in a bid to suppress forces she represents.Draupadi begins with a short exchange between two men in uniform. Whats this, a tribal called Dopdi? The list of names I bought has nothing like it! How can anyone have an unlisted name? The other man responds: Draupadi Mejhen. Born the year her mother threshed rice at Surja Sahus at Bakuli. Surja Sahus wife gave her the name.Since Mahasweta Devi rooted her stories and plots on events she saw or read about, her writing incorporates tribal languages and dialects, folk tales and oral histories. She elevated these stories with her imagination, using various genres and styles. Her prose is brutal and lyrical, her tone ironic, sarcastic.The power of DopdiNo miracle can save Dopdi, and she doesnt want it either. As Dopdi is pursued by her abusers, she stands up to them, laughing hysterically as she tears up her sari, exposing her nakedness in a chilling act of defiance akin to what we saw in Imphal in 2004 when women protested the killing of Thangjam Manorama.In another story, The Breast Giver, the protagonist Jashoda is paid to nurse a brood of children of her master and mistress. This helps her to support her poor disabled family. In yet another story, Pterodactyl, she explores why Adivasis are so misunderstood. For her, the Adivasis were civilised and cultured, and her own class hypocritical.Throughout her life and her writing, Mahasweta Devi tried to ensure that the plight of suffering spectators of a fast developing country didnt go unnoticed. She was drawn to people who led a subhuman existence, people with no access to education or health care or roads or income. Many of them may not be able to read her work yet, but its because of her that their stories are out there.She was not one to shy away from the difficult path. Despite her obvious Left links, during the Singur and Nandigram agitations in West Bengal, Mahasweta Devi, well in her 80s, launched a vehement protest against appropriation of land by the state. Her frail frame at a rally in Kolkata against police firing in Nandigram helped energise the Opposition and Mamata Banerjee to bring about  poribortan  in the State. But then again, when the newly elected Mamata Banerjee government refused permission to the Association for Protection of Domestic Rights to hold a rally in Kolkata against government action against Maoists in Lalgarh, she protested.For Mahasweta Devi, it was imperative to make an attempt to tear the curtain of darkness, see the reality that lies beyond and see our own true faces in the process. With her writing and activism, Mahasweta Devi holds up a mirror to society.But are we looking?Sudipta Datta is a Kolkata-based journalist.Mahasweta Devi, the activist and conscience-keeper, wouldnt bother herself too much with the accolades bagged by Mahasweta Devi, the writer."

We have demanded to hike it to `80 per quintal, he said.The millers who convened a meeting here to discuss issues concerning survival of rice milling industry demanded to frame policies properly and implement separate rice Out Turn Ratio (OTR) for each State as per their respective output instead of a uniform OTR of 68 per cent. Eastern India, especially Odisha and West Bengal, never produce rice above 63 per cent of the paddy supplied due to climatic condition. But millers in these two States are asked to provide 68 per cent rice, Saini said.General secretary Santosh Sonthalia said instead of storing entire procured paddy will millers, the State agencies should have their own storage arrangements from where the millers can lift paddy against 100 per cent security from time to time by rotating delivery. The millers warned to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in September if the Government fails to consider their demand. More than 400 millers from different parts of the State and office bearers of State associations from Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry attended."

Source: Subham Dutta At the rally ground in Agartala on Tuesday. Source: Subham DuttaON TUESDAY, when Mamata Banerjee sounded the clarion call for the 2018 Tripura elections, her rally was at once familiar and unfamiliar. While her speech was peppered with references to her governments achievements in West Bengal  what Trinamool Congress has deemed the Bengal model  the rally also marked her return as the firebrand Opposition leader.Mamata declared that for her party, the fact that the rally is being held in Agartala on the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, was not accidental. Usually, I go to Midnapore. But this time, I am here. It is because we are starting a new movement in Tripura today  independence from the communists. There is no space for them in India, she said.The underlying thread throughout her speech was not merely her relentless criticism of the Left Front government in Tripura, but its juxtaposition with her governments achievements in Bengal. While alleging that the Left in Tripura has failed to provide jobs, she invoked the pension schemes in Bengal and claimed her government has given jobs to thousands. Claiming that people of Tripura still needed to travel to Kolkata in order to treat major ailments, Mamata spoke about her government setting up multi-specialty hospitals in Bengal.When CPM was defeated in Bengal, it was found that it had left a huge debt which Trinamool was clearing now, she said. But we are distributing rice at Rs 2 per kg, giving stipends to girls and students, creating livelihood amenities for the poor and have constructed 41 super-speciality hospitals in the last five years. What has the CPM done here? There is no job, no work, no agricultural facilities, no university and no teacher. There is only loot, conspiracy, false assurance and no justice Mamata claimed.She added that while CPM was boasting that it had brought rail to Agartala, in reality, the project had been sanctioned when I was the union minister for Railways in 2010. She also raked up corruption charges against Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar.No party from Delhi will understand Tripura or Bengal. The problems here are different. All they understand is Dilli ka ladoo and Delhis politics The West Bengal government will be with Tripura and aid the state in its development. If we are elected, we will bring about industry, jobs, employment, education and medicine, she said while floating a Bengal model of development, which will be sensitive to the unique needs of Tripura.Introducing Mamata to the audience was dissident Congress leader Sudip Ray Burman, the son of former Tripura CM Samir Ranjan Burman, who prior to 1988 had campaigned alongside the Bengal CM.Mamata began with a reference to her days as a Youth Congress leader, campaigning against the Left regime in Tripura prior to the 1988 Assembly elections that Congress coming to power in the state. I am not a stranger to Tripura. I had campaigned here extensively when Santosh da (Santosh Mohan Dev) had asked me to come here. Today, those who had campaigned with me are sitting on the stage, she said.Earlier, the Congress had extended its friendship to the Left in Delhi that is how the Left formed a government here and I realised that I needed to leave Congress. Now, they have again done the same in Bengal and they have realised that they needed to join me, she added.Watch Video: Whats making newsMamatas rally was planned after Trinamool emerged as the majority Opposition party in Tripura, when six dissident Congress MLAs joined the party in June. This, Mamata, said was the beginning of creating a collective team to oppose the CPM in Tripura. Without such a team, there is no point, she said.She also criticised the BJP  which in the last five years has made inroads into Tripura  claiming that the party was only concerned with spreading hatred and communal strife.What do they do? They cant even pass the GST Bill without our help. During elections, they will suddenly start chanting Hare Rama, Hare Krishna to try and spread communalism. Since we have spoken out against them, about how they are undermining the federal structure, they try and intimidate us with their agencies. But we dont fear them. We have stared into the guns held by the communists in Bengal. The BJP cant stare us down, Mamata said.But in spite of Trinamools exuberance, the path to the 2018 elections would not be easy. While explaining the noticeably empty patches in the rally ground, Mamata alleged that the Left had prevented people from attending the event and cut power in villages to stop them from seeing her.Trinamool insiders, however, said the partys lack of an organisation in Tripura would pose the biggest challenge. There were already four Trinamool Congress factions in Tripura. Now, with Congress leaders joining, there is a fifth one. A lot will depend on Mukul Roy, who has been tasked with fixing the organisational structure in Tripura. If he cant do it, it will effectively help CPM, with Trinamool only cutting into BJPs votes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Suman Tamang Darjeeling, Aug. 12: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today demanded that since the state government had decided to bring the entire population in the Darjeeling hills under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the Mamata Banerjee administration declare the region a backward area and provide other benefits. The Morcha, however, said the state government would not do so and the hidden agenda of covering the entire hills under the AAY was to cut down on the foodgrains it had promised the people of the region before the Assembly elections. Under the AAY being implemented by the Centre through state governments, a financially backward family is entitled to 35kg of foodgrains at Rs 2 per kg a month. The Morcha had assigned members of the partys Study Forum to find out the real motives of the state government in implementing the AAY in the entire hills. D.K. Pradhan, convener of the Study Forum, today said: According to a notification issued by the directorate of district distribution, procurement & supply, food supplies department (memo no: 335(19) FMR/IIS-01/16) dated January 22, 2016, the hill population was included in Hill PDS category. As per the HPDS provisions, 11kg of foodgrains would be distributed per person per month in the entire hills. The provision in the notification reads: The existing population in the hill will now be allotted 6 kg of rice and 5 kg of fortified atta per heard per month @ Rs 2.00 per kg in both cases. According to Pradhan, the 11kg of foodgrains were to be drawn under the Centres National Food Security Act and the special scheme of the state government. The January 22 notification regarding hills reads: The entire population of the hill subdivision will be treated as NFSA plus state special package of for hill (NFSA-Hill) and allocation of 2 kg of rice and 3 kg of atta will be given from NFSA quota. The balance amount of 4 kg of rice and 2 kg of atta will be given as top up over and above the NFSA quota and the expenditure will be borne by the Govt. of West Bengal. Accounts shall be maintained accordingly. After the Assembly elections, Pradhan alleged, the state had decided to implement only the AAY under the National Food Security Act in the entire hills so that it didnt have to bear the additional expenditure of 4kg of rice and 2kg of atta.Under the AAY, a backward family is entitled to 15kg of rice and 20kg of fortified atta at Rs 2 per kg per month. This basically means that a family of four and above will now be getting less amount of foodgrains than what the state government promised. According to the special package announced before the Assembly elections, a hill family of five is entitled to 55kg of foodgrains. The hidden agenda of getting the hill population under the AAY is to ensure that the state government does not have to bear the additional cost of supplying 6kg of foodgrains per person a month, said Pradhan. The Morcha central committee member said it was fine for the Morcha if the state provided 35kg of foodgrains to a family under the AAY and the remaining 6kg per head per month. We also demand that since the hills have been brought under the AAY, which is for the financially backward families, the state declare the hills a backward area and give benefits for the backward region like exemption from income tax, subsides in transport, fuel, gas connections and electricity, said Pradhan."
58f652197be9e031f13b2731,Alpana decision taken at Kala Bhavan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Alpana-decision-taken-at-Kala-Bhavan/articleshow/53703523.cms,2016-08-15,"KOLKATA: It was at Kala Bhavan that the idea of including alpana as part of the fine arts syllabus germinated, through a series of workshops that Rabi Biswas was called in to conduct. Biswas, in fact, has been crusading to revive folk alpana, with foundations like Daricha and Intach playing a key role.To most of us, the word alpana means patterns drawn with rice paste on auspicious occasions. In today's age, when one has very little time to soak and grind rice to make the paste and then take time out to draw the patterns, stickers make for easy use. The result is that one of the most vibrant folk traditions of Bengal is gradually becoming extinct. However, two of the country's premier art schools have taken it upon themselves to make alpana a part of their teaching-learning process, to help start a revival of sorts.The one-year foundation course at Kala Bhavan - compulsory for all students taking up fine arts at the undergraduate level - has been revised to include alpana, both in the Santiniketan gharana that was perfected by Nandalal Bose's daughters Jamuna Devi and Gauri Bhanja, and also the genre inspired by folk traditions. ""All students of painting, sculpture, graphics, design and art history have to first go through the foundation course, get their grades and then be given a chance to choose their specializations,"" said principal Dilip Mitra. "" Alpana now features in the foundation course because we want every student to be aware of both the Santiniketan and the folk traditions. This will save it from extinction.""The most popular among these are the six different kinds of 'Lakshmi brotos', coupled with specific corresponding alpanas. There are brotos in the monsoon for sowing paddy seeds popular in Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia, where the paddy sheaf is the central alpana motif, brotos for the Nabanna festival, for a custom called Punyipukur, where the pond and the lotus are the central motifs, for Dasputul, where the alpana is inspired by the 'Ramayana', the Senjuti broto that characterizes evenings in the month of Agrahayana, with a 52-motif elaborate alpana, the Jampukur broto where the god of death is appeased through rituals and alpanas, and the Hyachra broto to ward off seasonal diseases like chicken pox.Though unrelated to the Visva-Bharati initiative, similar alpana workshops by Biswas were a routine affair at Rabindra Bharati University at its state academy of dance, drama, music and visual art. ""We are toying with the idea of expanding a portion of the painting syllabus to include folk traditions from Bengal, including alpana of the different districts,"" said head of the painting department at RBU, Nikhil Pal."
590474797be9e04154df721b,Trends in progress of sown area of khariff crops shows that it will be difficult to meet targets,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trends-in-progress-of-sown-area-of-khariff-crops-shows-that-it-will-be-difficult-to-meet-targets/,2016-08-18,"The numbers released by ministry of agriculture just before the advance of the southwest monsoons targeted a 7.1% increase in total food grain production in 2016-17. Both khariff and rabi grain output was expected to go up by the same extent to push up total food grain production to 270.1 million tons. This was indeed an ambitious target as it would require that the increase in food grain production be stepped up to the highest level in the last five years.However, the progress of the khariff sowing season has lent hopes that the grain production this year would match the ambitious targets laid out by the government. Numbers released for the period up to the middle of August shows that the sown area in the current khariff season has touched 954 lakh hectares which is 6.5% higher than the sown area in the corresponding period of the same previous year.However, the increase in the sown area has been uneven across the major states. Among the four states with the largest sown area, and which account for close to half the total sown area in the country, only Maharashtra had registered a sizable 15% increment in gross cropped area. One reason for this may be the increase in states rainfall, which went up close to a quarter during the current season.However, the total sown area in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the other major states with the maximum sown area, have remained largely stable. This is surprising because the increase in rainfall in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has been higher than in Maharashtra. Among other states with extensive cultivation Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have also registered a substantial increase in the gross sown area in the current season.But a crop wise investigation of the trends in the progress of the total sown area shows that increase has not been in proportion to the targets set in case of many crops. In fact only in the case of rice and pulses has been the increase in sown area been commensurate with the production targets set. So while the agriculture ministry targets has set that the khariff rice crop be increased by 2.7% and the pulse production be raised by 32.1% the sown area for these crops has increased by 7% and 33.2% so far which indicates that the targets can hopefully be achieved.But in case of other crops the increase in sown area has not been very significant. For instance in the case of coarse cereals and oil seeds the ministry has targeted 16.4% and 36.5% increase in khariff output. However, the trends in the progress of the sown area so far shows that sown area has so far only increased by 6% and 5.1% respectively. To achieve the targeted increase in output the productivity of these crops has to go up substantially in both cases.However, the worst case scenario is seen in the commercial crops like sugar cane and cotton. The targets set out by the ministry would expect sugarcane and cotton output to increase by 2.4% and 17.9% respectively. However, the trends in the sown area indicate that the crop under sugar cane has declined by 8% while that under cotton has fallen by 8.9%. That would make the achievement of the targets difficult if not impossible in the current season.So the overall assessment is that while the good monsoons has improved the prospects of achieving the target set for important crops like rice and pulses it does not seem to have very much improved the prospects of others like coarse cereals, oilseeds, sugar cane and cotton. The country has to roll out more innovative programs to improve productivity of important crops if it is the raise agriculture output to much higher levels."

The latest Kharif crop situation shows that rice sown area has been less than 2015 which happened to be a year of drought that gripped over 25 districts of Odisha. The crop-weather watch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation revealed that rice has been sown over 22.89 lakh hectare (ha) area by August 12 which is about 1.78 lakh ha less than the corresponding period of last year.The total rice sown area so far has been about 60 per cent of the overall coverage area. As against 38.39 lakh ha, kharif rice has been sown over 22.98 lakh ha this year. Last year, the rice sown area was about 24.76 lakh ha. Crop coverage of pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta as well as total coarse cereals has been more or less on par with last year's sown area. This time, the total sown area for all crops so far stands at 33.41 lakh ha as against 34.94 lakh ha during the corresponding period last year. Compared with the normal sown area for the year, which stands at 35.88 lakh ha, the shortfall has been 2.47 lakh ha. The crop report of the Agriculture Department, however, gives a different picture. It shows that total area under paddy coverage stands at 28.24 lakh ha, higher than last year's figure of 28.14 lakh ha.In fact, the overall crop coverage stands at 45.73 lakh ha compared to 45.28 lakh ha in 2015. While the crop coverage remains a reason for worry in the backdrop of the spate of farmer suicides, the rainfall scenario has been less than encouraging. As on Sunday, Odisha received 696 mm rain against the normal rainfall of 810 mm, registering a 14 per cent deficit. Between June and August 17, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) statistics showed that nine districts have registered deficit rainfall. However, the ground reality is far more worse as the last week has been pretty much dry for most of the districts. In the week ending August 12, 18 districts reported huge deficit rainfall which has affected farming activities.Nuapada recorded 75 per cent deficit while Balangir reported 71 per cent shortfall. Bargarh, Deogarh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Khurda, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Nayagarh, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur, Sundargarh and Puri also registered deficit rainfall during the week. Although the last week saw two weather systems forming off the Balasore coast, it rained mostly in the northern districts and West Bengal.A third system which formed north east of Myanmar on Saturday went close to Bangladesh and was heading into WB-Bihar region. It may not cause any rainfall. The weather office said another circulation is likely to form around August 25-26 and turn into a low pressure off south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast."

Prabhat Bezboruah, vice-chairman of Tea Research Association, said the industry ""is passing through yet another crisis due to a decline in both price and crop in the current year. This is coupled with increase in labour costs and practically all other input prices"". He said in the absence of restructuring, the tea industry was becoming unsustainable and the best option was to nationalise the set-up. Painting a grim scenario, Bezboruah said climate change had distorted the rainfall pattern in Assam with the entire year's quota being deposited in the first seven months while August onwards it becomes unseasonably dry. ""Temperature of 39 degrees Celsius, at which level the tea bush shuts down, is common nowadays. If the weather continues in this line, tea yields will show a dramatic decline,"" he added. He further said major blenders and packers were resorting to blend rationalisation, which means buying cheaper teas for the blend to bring its average cost down. ""Hence we see a scenario where low-priced teas, such as those from south India and Cachar, are up in price by Rs 10 to Rs 22 per kg whereas high quality Assam teas are down by Rs 30 to Rs 50. This trend does not augur well for the industry, as it sends a signal that quality does not pay,"" he said. Amitabh Barooah, who runs Kolakota tea estate near Sonari in Sivasagar district and is a member of the Assam Tea Planters' Association, said with the increase in wages of labourers, staff and sub-staff, there is simultaneous increase in bonus and leave wage, which increases cost of production. Besides, he said, tea estates now have to give ration, which was earlier subsidised by the government, increasing cost of production. ""Earlier, we used to pay about Rs 8 for a kg of rice and Rs 10-12 for a kg of flour but now we pay about Rs 20 and Rs 23 respectively when buying from the open market. This has increased costs tremendously."" Labourers buy this rice and flour for 50 paise each. In West Bengal, Bezboruah said, the government supplies foodgrain to each garden at Rs 3 per kilo and designates the manager to distribute the agreed quantum to workers. ""When the industry visited former chief minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi to cite this glaring inequality between Assam and Bengal, he dismissed it,"" Bezboruah said. The TRA vice-chairman said it was proving difficult to get sufficient workers at the current wage level. ""Unless wages increase is linked with productivity, the industry can hardly bear any further load, as each rupee increase in wages results in a 60 paise increase in cost of production in a typical garden. At the current productivity level of 2.2kg per manday, the industry is clearly unsustainable unless drastic restructuring is done,"" he added. North Eastern Tea Association adviser Bidyanand Barkakoty, affirming that the industry was in dire straits this year, said most buyers and packagers of tea had not maintained a stock this year and there was a possibility of prices rising in September as the overall shortfall in production in August could be 20-25 per cent. A supplier of green leaf said its prices had come down to Rs 17-18 compared to last year when it was Rs 19-20. ""In the absence of coordinated steps to revamp the industry from within, by the labour unions and the government, perhaps the best solution would be for the government to nationalise the entire industry. This will solve the problems that the industry constantly faces in Assam,"" Bezboruah said."

Unlike those produced in China or even in neighbouring West Bengal, rice from the State is found to possess no toxicity.Studies conducted at US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington by Dr SB Qadri and Dr BB Rath in collaboration with Dr BK Roul of the Institute of Materials Science (IMS), Bhubaneswar, have found the evidence in rice husks which are an efficient concentrator of soil minerals.Samples collected from rice fields of Maluda island near Chilika lake and Dhusuri in Bhadrak district were put to study over the last three years for rice husk chemistry. Roul said the study showed varying amounts of minority elements concentrated by the plant in the husk. The Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) technique used to identify elemental composition showed high and medium concentration of manganese and high concentrations of iron from rice husks of these two areas.These elemental concentrations are uniquely present in the husk but not in rice grain and are directly correlated with the soil chemistry, he said.The study found that there is a clear indication of effectiveness of the rice plant to concentrate the mineral content of soil in the husk which can be easily determined using the EDXRF analysis as an indicator of mineral deposits in different locations.Moreover, arsenic is known as a carcinogen readily collected in the rice plant from soil and water. Earlier studies have also suggested that brown rice and white rice contain arsenic of various concentrations from different parts of the world. However, samples of rice husks and kernels obtained from Odisha showed no arsenic content, Roul said, adding rice of Odisha should have been sold at higher price in the global market due to its non-toxicity.The study which establishes food value of rice without presence of toxic elements could be of tremendous help in identifying many varieties of mineral deposits in the soil by simply examining the husks collected from various rice fields of Odisha. Similarly, it would also provide instant information on the soil chemistry and soil mineral of the region.The study by the three scientists points at the fact that nature, during billion years of evolution, protects its grains. The plant produces a coating to prevent damage of grains from pests and the environment, and these protective shells are known as rice hulls or rice husks.Advanced processing of the husk can even produce high value industrial materials such as silicon carbide and silicon oxide and silicon nitride and silicates of zinc, zirconium and cadmium."

The system used to be most ineffective and corruption-ridden, with leakages of around 50 per cent at the national level, going up to 80 or 90 per cent in some States. Around 2007, Chhattisgarh took the lead in reforming the PDS  making it more inclusive, methodical and transparent. Within a few years, the system was overhauled. Today, most rural households in Chhattisgarh have a ration card, and are able to secure their entitlements (typically 7 kg of rice per person per month) on time every month.The Chhattisgarh modelLater on, it turned out that the Chhattisgarh model (so to speak) was replicable. Odisha was among the first States to emulate Chhattisgarhs experience, with similar results. Many other States also initiated Chhattisgarh-style PDS reforms: broad coverage, clear entitlements, de-privatisation of PDS shops, separation of transport agencies from distribution agencies, computerisation, fixed distribution schedules, tight monitoring, active grievance redressal, and more.In the last few years, I have been involved in several surveys of the PDS initiated by independent researchers with student volunteers. In 2011, we studied the PDS in nine States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. We found that the system was working reasonably well for below poverty line (BPL) households: on average, they were receiving 84 per cent of their foodgrain entitlements from the PDS. A similar picture emerged from a follow-up survey in 2013. However, high leakages continued in the above poverty line (APL) quota, which tended to be used by the Central government at that time as a dumping ground for excess food stocks.The National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted three years ago, was  and still is  a chance to complete the process of PDS reform and ensure a modicum of food security for everyone. Under the NFSA, the APL category is abolished and eligible households come under two well-defined categories: priority households, entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at nominal prices, and Antyodaya households (the poorest), entitled to 35 kg per household per month. The PDS is to cover at least 75 per cent of rural households at the national level, rising to 80-90 per cent in the poorest States.Impending setbackIn June this year, we went back to six of Indias poorest States (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal) for an update. We found that four out of six had a fairly good PDS, with most NFSA cardholders receiving the bulk of their entitlements every month and relatively low exclusion errors. The last two, Jharkhand and especially Bihar, still have a long way to go. Even there, however, the situation is much better than it was a few years ago. In Jharkhand, for instance, the transparency of the system has vastly improved, and the official NFSA website is among the best in the country. However, recent progress is in danger of being undone soon due to the Central governments counter-productive push for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. This involves installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at PDS shops, and verifying the identity of cardholders by matching their fingerprints against the Aadhaar database over the Internet.This system requires multiple fragile technologies to work at the same time: the PoS machine, the biometrics, the Internet connection, remote servers, and often other elements such as the local mobile network. Further, it requires at least some household members to have an Aadhaar number, correctly seeded in the PDS database.This is a wholly inappropriate technology for rural India, especially in the poorest States. Even in State capitals, network failures and other glitches routinely disable this sort of technology. In villages with poor connectivity, it is a recipe for chaos. Note that Internet dependence is inherent to Aadhaar since there is no question of downloading the biometrics.Recent developments in Rajasthan illustrate the dangers of forcing biometric authentication on the PDS. During the last few months, the Government of Rajasthan has tried hard to enforce the system. The use of PoS machines is compulsory and every PDS shop has one. Yet, according to official data compiled by Nikhil Dey, only 61 per cent of Rajasthans foodgrain allocation found its way through the PoS system in July 2016, with a similar figure (63 per cent) for August. The rest is either siphoned off or delivered using the old register system  which of the two is hard to say since utter confusion prevails about the permissibility of using registers as a fallback option.Further evidence comes from Ranchi district in Jharkhand where the PoS system is also mandatory. In July 2016, NFSA cardholders in Ranchi district received less than half of their foodgrain entitlements through that system, according to the model website mentioned earlier. The situation was much the same in August.As in Rajasthan, it is not clear whether those for whom the PoS system does not work in Ranchi are getting any grain through the old register system. Officially, that is not allowed, according to local PDS dealers and officials (indeed, some dealers have been suspended for using this fallback option). Even if it happens unofficially, this dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the PoS system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst. The reason is that only PDS dealers know whether and when the register system is permissible, and they have no incentive to share that information with the cardholders. Quite likely, the new system is reviving PDS corruption in Jharkhand, reversing a healthy trend towards lower leakages in recent years.A short visit to a PDS shop just outside Ranchi quickly brings out the multiple vulnerabilities of the new system. Within minutes we met many people who had been deprived of their food rations for months because they had no Aadhaar number; or because their Aadhaar number had not been correctly seeded; or because their biometrics did not work, or simply because the PoS machine returned various error messages.Even those for whom the system works face huge inconvenience. Often they have to make repeated trips to the PDS shop, or send different members in turn, until the machine cooperates. Sometimes schoolchildren are asked to skip classes and try their luck at the PDS shop. This unreliable system causes a colossal waste of time for everyone.By the way, all this is one year after I was told by the Food Departments upbeat consultants that the PoS system is functional throughout Ranchi district.The Aadhaar juggernautIn spite of ample warnings, the Central government continues to push for compulsory Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. Incidentally, this is a violation of Supreme Court orders. The court did allow the use of Aadhaar in the PDS, but not making it compulsory for PDS users. Nor can the government invoke the Aadhaar Act to justify this move: the relevant sections of the Act are yet to be notified.PoS machines seem to be expected to ensure a corruption-free PDS. This expectation, however, builds on a misunderstanding of PDS leakages. The main vulnerability today, at least in the States I am familiar with, is not identity fraud (e.g. bogus cards), but quantity fraud: PDS dealers often give people less than what they are entitled to, and pocket the rest. PoS machines are ineffective in preventing quantity fraud. They may help in reducing identity fraud, such as it is, but that does not justify depriving people of their food entitlements when the technology fails.As with many other applications of Aadhaar, this one is proceeding like a juggernaut, without paying serious attention to the collateral damage. Instead, the Central government peddles bogus figures of Aadhaar-enabled financial savings (often relayed by unsuspecting columnists or economists) to justify further imposition of the technology. It is only when concerned journalists, activists or researchers make enquiries from the victims that we learn about the adverse effects of Aadhaar on the PDS.The Central government and its advisers pride themselves on their commitment to evidence-based policy, but this is a case where evidence is being systematically ignored to press on with technological solutions based on blind faith (handsomely nurtured by commercial interests). The drive to impose biometric authentication on the PDS must stop immediately to avoid further damage. There are better ways of plugging last-mile leakages, including the use of simpler technologies not dependent on the Internet. Imposing a technology that does not work on people who depend on it for their survival is a grave injustice.Jean Drze is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University.The dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the Aadhaar-based Point of Sale system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst"

Express Photo by Partha Paul Milan Baidya (centre) is among a hundred officials and 700-odd daily wage labourers who are working to survey the land. Express Photo by Partha PaulIts around noon. The rain has finally stopped, and Milan Baidya gets ready to set out to work again. The 43-year-old technical staff member has been with the West Bengal Land and Land Revenue Department since he was very young. So the work isnt new. But this time, things are different. Its the time-frame, its frantic, Baidya sighs. Looking down at his feet, he adds, At least we now have gumboots.Standing at the edge of what was land earmarked for the Tata Singur project, it is easy to see why the boots matter. Spread across 997 acres, the land once epitomised the dream of a state. Now it is part-swamp, part impenetrable grassland, housing a crumbling factory that never saw any operations  a portrait of a dream deferred.On August 31, the Supreme Court quashed the acquisition of this land in 2006 by the Left Front regime in West Bengal for a Tata Motors plant. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, whose rise to power was partly propelled by the protests she led of farmers here who lost their land, wants the land surveyed by September 14, so that the process of returning plots to respective owners can begin soon. Mamata is planning a rally at Singur that day, to mark the apex court upholding her stand.Its easier said than done.Baidya lists the challenges he and at least a few hundred other officials, ranging from Additional District Magistrate Land Revenue P Maji to non-technical staff, face. In the past 10 years, the fields here have been untended. In most areas, there would be a lot of vegetation by now. This is very fertile land and it means this is now a forest. The place is also full of snakes. The gumboots are for them. We can brave the rain, but not the snakes.Carbolic acid had been poured into the grass to scare the snakes, he adds, but all it had done was chase them away from one end of the land to the other.The nearly thousand acres in contention at Singur had more than 2,000 owners at the time of acquisition. Baidya and others are tasked with returning this carrying a Revenue Department map, wooden stakes to mark out ownership, and the faithful gumboots. This, while taking into account that the ownership of land itself in southern Bengal is typically fractured, with individuals owning islands of land within larger tracts owned by others.Baidyas day starts at 6 am. The abandoned factory has been transformed into temporary barracks for the officials, with some mattresses, covers and thin pillows. Baidya doesnt mind the accommodation, only wishes it had been given a little airing.Lunch is generally rice and fish or egg, while breakfast and evening tiffin have bread and egg, supplemented with pale, sugary tea. Apart from the transformer that the government had set up before 2011 for the Tata factory, a temporary generator has been provided to ensure continuous supply of electricity. Water tankers have been brought in from the district headquarters at Hooghly.Elaborating on the task at hand, Baidya says, If the land was level, the work could have been done in a week. But now, first, the land must be cleared of vegetation. Then, it must be surveyed, and finally ownership recorded and marked. Right now even the first stage is an issue.Almost 3 ft of fly ash had been dumped on the site by Tata Motors to raise the land level. While this has damaged the top soil, making the future of cultivation bleak, it has also made it impossible to work with the heavy harvester machines that the state government dispatched to speed up work.Haradhan Majhi, a farmer and one of the daily-wage labourers employed to operate the harvesters, walks tentatively through the tall grass, towards Baidya. Majhi doesnt have gumboots. The harvester is stuck, he tells Baidya. Someone needs to come and dig around the wheels to get it moving again.One of the 700-odd daily wage labourers working here, Majhi is getting around Rs 200 per day apart from food for the job.Before Majhi starts walking back, Baidya takes off his own gumboots and offers them. While the government has announced that gumboots, gloves and caps would be provided to all workers, there still arent enough to go around. We need to share. This entire work is a long process of sharing, Baidya rationalises.Work goes on from 6 am to 6 pm. Vegetation is chopped, maps are pored over, land marks, buried deep under, are identified and finally, a stake with a piece of paper and number is stuck into the ground. The stake, itself, is unimpressive. But with their task akin to fitting together pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the sight is thrilling, says an official.After work, Baidya and the others exchange stories sitting at the factory. Talk turns to children, growing expenses, and politics. But, most conversations, Baidya says, are about two things  home and land.The 43-year-old understands both. His village Beraberi is not far, and he lives there with his wife and two children. He is the first in his farming family to have a government job.Nothing is more important for the people here than land, Baidya adds. I was a staunch supporter of the Left before Singur happened. But I couldnt rationalise the way land was snatched away. If I supported them for their land reforms, then today I support Mamata Banerjee for her Singur protest, which is why the work here is so important.At the same time, Baidya underlines the dilemma of parents like him. Giving the example of Majhi, he says, Majhi had land here. I also know he wants industry here. He wants his children to not work in the mud and to have proper jobs. Can you blame him?Baidya himself doesnt see a life in either government offices or fields for his two children  a 12-year-old boy who hates studying, and a 16-year-old girl who is at the top of her class. He hopes they will find work in Kolkata, in private offices, where there are increments and less politics.The other topic that looms in every conversation is Mamatas deadline. A podium being erected in the eastern corner of the land for the CMs rally is a constant reminder.If you dont finish the work, Mamata Banerjee will berate you publicly. Which is why everyone is working so hard, Baidya chuckles, before adding, As am I.But, unlike the others who say it is impossible to finish by September 14 or by even the Supreme Court stipulated time of 12 weeks, Baidya remains hopeful. Everyone knows land is the dream of all those whove lived here and are working here.Somewhere in the background, the harvester is still spluttering desperately in the mud. And the rain has started again.So what happens to a dream deferred? In the case of Singur, nature reclaims it violently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Though no human casualty is reported so far, the elephants have damaged standing paddy and maize crops in several acres.As part of their annual sojourn the elephant herd comprising 12 calves and 6 tuskers from Dalma sanctuary has entered Mayurbhanj forests through their usual corridor in search of food after creating havoc in bordering districts of West Bengal.Locals are scared as the marauding jumbos has been causing widespread damage to paddy and vegetable crops in more than 100 forest side villages in both Mayurbhanj and Balasore districts besides killing people for the past six years.We are spending sleepless nights after knowing that the herd is camping in the jungle close to our village. The residents are guarding their houses by burning timber logs in the night, said a local Guruba Singh.Forest officials have warned local residents not to chase the elephants which may turn violent if they are irritated by fire crackers. They have also been asked not to store any intoxicating substance like rice beer in their houses to keep the elephants away.Baripada DFO Sanjay Swain said 120 forest personnel have been engaged in the border areas to monitor the movement of the elephant herd. They have been asked to prevent the entry of the pachyderms into the human habitations.Since horse-shit keep the elephants away, the officials also have deployed two horses along the Morada border to stop the elephants from proceeding further. According to experts, the neigh, smell of stool and urine of male horses irritate elephants.Last year the pachyderms had failed to enter Dukura, Betnoti and Rasgobindpur reserve forests as six male horses, two each, were deployed in these areas.Meanwhile, a 24-hour control room has been opened at Baripada divisional forest office to monitor the movement of a herd of wild elephants and collect information from the people.The deployed forest staff will provide regular updates about the movement of the herd. We have taken every possible measure to prevent them from entering into human habitations, Swain added."
58f665fe7be9e031f13b3fe2,State lags behind national average in rice production,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/State-lags-behind-national-average-in-rice-production/articleshow/54619452.cms,2016-10-01,"BHUBANESWAR: Between 2012 and '15, Odisha won national awards for excellence in foodgrain productions. But when it comes to producing rice, it has fallen behind the national average despite the area under paddy cultivation being more than other states.Over the last decade the all-India average of rice production stands at more than 2,000 kg/hectare (kg/ha). In the same period Odisha has steadily increased its production from 1,554 kg/ha in 2005-06 to 2,361 in 2012-13. But over the past few years the number has started declining. In 2013-14 the yield was 1,821 kg/ha while in 2015-16 it had dipped to 1,491 kg/ha from 1,989 in 2014-15.Explaining the change, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said in a written reply in the assembly recently: ""Odisha faces natural calamities like drought, cyclone, flood and untimely rain almost every year. Despite all odds, there was a gradual growth in rice production every year due to a number of steps taken by the state government. Effort is on to match the national average.""The reason for the sharp decline in production in 2015-16 was attributed to drought-like situation in as many as 27 of the 30 districts, official figures revealed. Over 200 farmers allegedly committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden though the state government claimed that most of the deaths were due to other reasons.Asked about the low yield despite paddy being cultivated in two-thirds of the total cultivable land, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor of OUAT S N Pasupalak said: ""Factors like low mechanization, poor nutrient management, structure of land and low irrigation potential are responsible for low production of rice in the state.""Among all districts, Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, stands at the top in producing highest amount of rice constantly for past 10 years. Other districts like Boudh, Dhenkanal, Nabarangapur, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur and Sundargarh have been recording high production of rice for past two years.Despite drought in 2015-16, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak produced 2,571 kg/ha and 2,505 kg/ha, respectively, among the highest in the country.""For increase in productivity, Odisha has been promoting modern methods like system of rice intensification (SRI), practice of multiple crops, soil testing, supplying quality seeds and augmenting irrigation potential,"" said an officer in the agriculture department.A number of centrally-sponsored schemes like National Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India, National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana are being implemented in the state to increase the agriculture productivity.Odisha has been winning successive krishi karman awards among category-II states for record foodgrain production.According to sources in the directorate of economics and statistics, states like West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are ahead of Odisha in rice production.."
59042b687be9e02646bdca89,"After Singur ruling, the challenge before Mamata",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573895/after-singur-ruling-challenge-mamata.html,2016-10-03,"After Singur ruling, the challenge before MamataDrimi Chaudhuri, Kolkata, Oct 04, 2016, 23:57 ISTMamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal and Trinamool Congress chairperson, did the unlikely. She kept her promise and returned the land to the protesting farmers of Singur. Ironically, with that, Mamata celebrated the defeat of her own state government!On September 14, a fortnight after the Supreme Court found the acquisition process at Singur in 2006 done without due process of law, and ordered that the land be returned to farmers, Mamata  Didi to her followers and well-wishers  organised a meet at the hamlet in Hooghly district.Supposed to be an administrative event, it turned into a victory rally of her party. She declared that she kept her promises and handed out land deeds and compensation cheques to the farmers.Even though the defeat is to be counted on the columns of the erstwhile Left Front administration, in effect, Mamata was celebrating the defeat of the government she leads. And she could not be happier. What seemed impossible even a month ago is now a reality and she has been able to keep her most difficult promise. For her and for her party, life has come a full circle.This does not make Mamatas job any easier. Even though she managed to keep her word, when the land was acquired, she was in the Opposition. Later, the challenge was to stop Singur from happening and prevent the Left from acquiring the land. After this, the challenge was to wrest power.Now, the scenario has changed. She is the chief minister and cannot claim any unfriendliness with the industry. And with every passing day till January next, when Mamata has her annual Biswa Bangla business summit, things will get harder.With the annual ball in mind  where she invites and pampers captains of industry from India and abroad  her team has been working hard. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the states nodal agency, formed a committee six months ago and top officials have been travelling around the globe, seeking commitments of attendance. Mamata herself had recently been to Europe, meeting honchos from BMW and other companies to ensure the summit is well-attended.The challenge before her is to prove the summit is not just another gathering, but that there will be some serious commitments from the industry.It was keeping these aspects in mind that she announced from the stage at Singur on September 14 about the available land and invited Tata Motors, BMW or anybody else to set up an automobile factory. Insiders say she knows BMW is not likely to come calling, and that her invite was more for the sake of Tata.With her vote bank in mind, she kept at her policy of no forcible land acquisition and announced a number of sops, including state support to set up farming infrastructure once again, from one-time grants to easily available loans.At the same time, instead of ordering officials to demolish the factory shed at Singur, she put the process on hold, urging Tatas to take care of their belongings.This is in sharp contrast to her days of Singur movement, when she inspired supporters to break down the factory wall.Now, the administration has put up posters to prevent the same acts that became the hallmark of her movement back in 2006. Insiders also whisper of the back channels that she has opened up through state Finance Minister Amit Mitra, a former FICCI head.If getting industry is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, she also needs to deal with a number of undercurrents at Singur. At some of the villages in Singur, most residents are share-croppers and landless workers who formed the most militant faction of her agitation.Since they were the least to gain from the factory coming up, they were the most invested in the movement. Under the changed scenario, they dont yet know how long the states monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and Rs 2 per kg rice will continue. They also dont know what will happen after the dust settles since Mamata had nothing much on offer for them.Uncultivable landIn 2006, when the acquisition process started, the most eager section included absentee landlords, who formed nearly 70% of land-holders. Their eagerness stemmed from the fact that share-croppers and landless workers, till then backed by the Lefts farming organisation, Krishak Sabha, held an upper hand over the landlords.Added to this is the realisation that the land might not retain its earlier fertility. Of the total 997 acres acquired for the project, 300 acres have been used to build the shed, roads, drainage and other infrastructure inside the abandoned premises.Uncertainty has cropped up on whether these areas can ever be cultivable again. This has made a large section of land owners consider selling their holdings, now that they have got it back.Land prices plummeted once the Tatas left and even though there are willing sellers, prices remain uncertain. Then there is the local youth, who have seen the worst aspects of the movement and were witness to a changing economic scene. These youngsters coming from the middle class and agrarian families have lost it all to the political upheaval which hit their growing years at every step. And most of them want a factory to come up at Singur.The circle that came full over a decade has led Mamata into yet another circle. A decade ago, as a firebrand Opposition leader on the brink of ignominy, with hardly any political capital to show, things looked much different for her. The landscape, however, looks altered when she stares down from the chief ministers office.Mamata might get her name etched on pages of history but that will not help her get investment, while keeping her rural, agrarian vote bank pacified. In the end, a hard-earned victory could turn into a Greek tragedy, where the heros fate is sealed because of a weak heel."

While artisans are busy completing the welcome arches, decorators have decked up every corner of the city with impressive lighting arrangements, thereby adding sparkle to the festivity. Organisers have spent a huge amount of money on innovative light works using LED lights.The entire Badambadi stretch is replete with rice light strings and the decorations include three massive light gates in addition to the replica of ISKCON temple at Mayapur in West Bengal. Similar decorations can be seen at Dolomundai, Bajrakabati and Haripur where five light gates have come up apart from the roadside decorations. Apparently, each of the puja committees spends between `2 lakh and `5 lakh on illumination. With 48 big pujas being organised in the city, the total figure hovers above `70 lakh during the fourday autumn festival.Malgodown Puja Committee is decorating the entire stretch with rice lights and five tall light gates have been erected at the cost of `four lakh. At Khan Nagar, 10 light gates have come up on a stretch of four km. Ganesh Kumar Das, chief artisan from Cuttack who designed lighting arrangements in Khan Nagar, says he has used various mythological themes to design the gates. At Jobra, Chauliaganj, Sheikh Bazaar, Ranihaat and Mangalabaag, light decorations have come up in every nook and cranny.Similarly in Bhubaneswar, replicas of temples, Dhauli Shanti Stupa and many more heritage sites will give Durga Puja a festive glow. At Saheed Nagar, the Puja committee has erected five massive light gates themed on Sai Baba and Goddess Durga and the budget for light decorations here in `four lakh. At Jharpada and Old Station Bazaar, eight and four majestic light gates have come up. In Nayapalli and Rasulgarh, Puja committees have set up five gates each. While there are 156 small and big Durga Puja pandals in Cuttack, the number is 180 in Bhubaneswar.On the other hand, CESU authorities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar claimed that squads have been formed to check illegal use of power by Puja committees during the festival. Officer in charge of CESU (City Distribution Division, Cuttack) AK Bisoi said as LEDs are used for light decorations, not much power is being consumed by the organisers. Each Puja committees consume between 20 KW and 22 KW of power through light decorations every day, he said and added that use of bulbs and traditional lights increases the power consumption by five times. CESU Superintending Engineer, Bhubaneswar Circle-I Sukanta Kumar Swain said each Puja committee consumes an average of 20 KW power every day and the total consumption in the four days is around 3.6 MW.

(Photo used for representational purpose) The minister said as per the minimum support price fixed by the Centre, farmers would get Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety of paddy. (Photo used for representational purpose)In a step to prevent distress sale of paddy in the state, Odisha government today set a tentative target of procuring 30 lakh tonnes of rice during the 2016-17 kharif marketing season (KMS) beginning November 1. The Food and Procurement Policy for Kharif Marketing Season, 2016-17 was approved at the cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here today, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said.The cabinet approved a proposal to extend by another three months the period for reducing the rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) on pulses and dals of all kinds under the Odisha VAT Act, 2004, Chief Secretary A P Padhi said. As the state government procures paddy from farmers during Kharif and Rabi seasons separately under the KMS, the target was set to collect 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice, equivalent to 44 lakh tonnes of paddy.The minister said as per the minimum support price fixed by the Centre, farmers would get Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety of paddy. The rate of Grade-A variety of paddy was fixed at Rs 1,510 per quintal, he said, adding that procuring agencies and district administrations would make wide publicity regarding the FAQ (fair average quality) of paddy.While the state-run Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation procures 95 per cent of paddy, other agencies, if necessary, would be deployed in surplus districts, the minister said. He said the Kharif paddy would be procured during the period from November 2016 to March 2017 and Rabi paddy during May and June, 2017.The paddy would be procured from farmers who are registered in the online portals of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. So far 8.29 lakh farmers have got themselves registered with the department, the minister said, adding 95 per cent of the paddy producers have been provided Aadhaar numbers.Aadhaar seeding would be used for paddy procurement and the farmers would be paid online under the P-PAS system. The facility has been extended to 294 of 314 blocks in the state, he said. Replying to a question, the minister said while the state required only 19 lakh metric tonnes of rice for public distribution system, remaining rice is to be given to the FCI.The cabinet also extended another three months for imposition of one per cent VAT, instead of five per cent on pulses of all kinds in view of the demand of traders. Though the government has sustained a loss of about Rs 5 crore twoards VAT in three months due to reduction of the rate of VAT on pulses, it would like another three months extension as sale of pulses has increased, the Chief Secretary said.In another decision, the cabinet approved a proposal of the finance department to reduce the rate of VAT from 14.5 per cent to 5 per cent on LPG cylinder manufacturing. As neighbouring states like West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand maintain 5 per cent VAT on LPG cylinder manufacturing, the Odisha government would also bring it down to increase transaction, Padhi said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58ff39a57be9e0420db2eb7a,Tribals Mahasweta touched back to cursed life,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/bengal/story_114891.jsp,2016-10-22,"Little Sabars in Akhodbandh village ;villagers play a game of cards in the Sabar village of Bangthupi. Pictures by Snehamoy Chakraborty Purulia, Oct. 21: The Sabar community, the centrepiece of Mahasweta Devi's work, is not very well. Kajali Sabar and her husband Sarat make tea by boiling CTC tea leaves in water with salt. They cannot afford sugar. Kajali and Sarat live in Balakdih Sabar Tola, a village 36km from Purulia town. Around 12,000 Sabars live in Purulia's 164 Sabar tolas. The Sabars were never very well, the reason why Mahasweta Devi, the writer-activist who won the Magsaysay Award, stepped into their lives. British law had declared the Sabars a ""criminal"" tribe in 1872 and they had been ""decriminalised"" in independent India, but when Mahasweta Devi came in, they were still regarded as criminals, being arrested and tortured indiscriminately by police with a little help from other communities. Mahasweta Devi fought on behalf of the Sabars, questioning their ""criminality"", trying to lift them from utter poverty and alienation. They called her mother. At the Sabar Mela in Purulia in 1983, she was anointed ""Sabarer Ma"". She brought them hope - and livelihood. She began to market and sell their handicrafts. But it was short-lived. Her presence was withdrawn from their lives from the time she fell ill five or six years ago, and finally with her death this year on July 28. The Sabars are not picked up for every crime in the neighbourhood any more. But otherwise they are back to where Mahasweta Devi found them: utter poverty and alienation, nursing only a few habits picked up from their recent encounter with the world. Twenty years ago, a Sabar did not know tea. ""We saw people in nearby villages,"" says Sarat, in his late 50s, who makes his living by collecting wood from the forest. ""We can't afford sugar and wanting milk is pointless. We boil water with some tea and salt. It is our tea,"" says Kajali. Finding work is more difficult than finding milk. Says Mahadeb Sabar, a 60-year-old man who folded his hands in respect at the mention of Mahasweta Devi: ""When Ma came to us, we could earn about Rs 1,500 a week by selling our handicrafts. Now it is hard to earn Rs 400 a week from selling these."" In the absence of the projects Mahasweta Devi brought them, many Sabars are turning back to selling wood. This is not easy, as cutting trees is illegal without replantation, and Sabars are facing resistance from forest officials. In Bangthupi Sabar Tola, another Sabar village, Meghnad Sabar, a youth who passed Madhyamik in 2008, then stopped his education, became a labourer and married at 18. ""Two months in monsoon we work as farm labourers as all fields here are single-crop. The rest of the months we cut trees and sell in the markets in Kenda or Puncha blocks in Purulia. My daily income is about Rs 60,"" says Meghnad. ""We only eat once during the day,"" he says. The one proper meal they have is ""just phenabhat (starch rice) with salt"", he adds. Meghnad has a television set and a mobile phone, but neither works because he does not have the money to repair them. Mahasweta Devi, who had been visiting Jharkhand's Palamau tribal areas since the sixties, was introduced to the Sabars in the eighties by activist Gopi Ballabh Singh Deo, or ""Gopibabu"", a retired schoolteacher. Gopibabu, 82, who lives in Rajnowagarh village in Purulia, had already been working for the uplift of the Sabars for two decades. He founded the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti in 1968. The Sabars were ""decriminalised"" in 1952, but only in name. The police would allegedly conduct raids and torture them for every crime in their area. "" Ghorey ghumai murdhumsa, Chorey kate dhan. Jodi kaukey na pali to kheriya dhorey aan (The fat landlord sleeps and thieves cut off paddy from land. If no one can be caught, go catch a Sabar),"" the Sabars would say. The complaint that Sabars don't fit in persists, making it difficult for them to find work and even get state scheme benefits. Gopibabu is unable to speak because of his ill health. Prashanta Rakshit, the current director of the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti, which has its head office in Rajnowagarh, says Gopibabu had acted as a shield for the tribe from the police, running from one place to another to protect the Sabars from the law-enforcers' torture. ""He is the pioneer of the movement for the Sabar tribe,"" says Rakshit. The 1983 Sabar Mela had been organised to bring together members of the tribe people on one platform so that they could fight together for their rights. Mahasweta Devi, who had already written Aranyer Adhikar (The rights of a forest), her novel on the tragic, brilliant life of Santhal leader Birsa Munda, was with them. Later she would write Byadhkanda (The book of the hunter), a historical novel about Kalketu, the founder of the Sabar tribe. It is a passionate appeal to preserve the Sabar world. ""It is not that the tragedy of our life ended as soon as our mother Mahasweta Devi promised to be with us,"" says Jaladhar Sabar, secretary of the Kheriya Sabar Samiti. As the tragedy of Chuni Kotal would prove soon. The first woman graduate among the Lodha Sabars, Chuni, who graduated in 1985, could not bear her harassment in the workplace, a cell made for the welfare of Sabars. She committed suicide in 1992. Mahasweta Devi had reported the incident to the police. ""But it was the beginning of a movement. Most important, we learnt to fight the police and the government,"" Jaladhar Sabar says. The custodial death of Budhon Soren in 1998 was another flashpoint. Budhon, from Akarhbaid village, was believed to have been beaten to death in police custody, but his death was shown as suicide. After the post-mortem, the Sabars kept his body at his home for further autopsy, tricking the police by burning a false pier. Mahasweta Devi filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court and a CBI probe was ordered. The case is still being heard. Mahasweta Devi marketed the Sabar handicrafts made traditionally with Kashi Ghas, leaves of date-palm trees and bamboo as far as she could in original ways. ""We began training camps. Within two years the Sabars, mainly women, started to make money. We used to buy handicrafts directly and our organisation sold it at different shops and fairs in Calcutta and Delhi,"" says Rakshit, who travelled with Mahasweta Devi to various countries. ""Didi (Mahasweta Devi) used to keep the handicrafts in her Calcutta home. She would tell visitors: 'I will give you an autograph if you buy one handicraft made by my Sabar daughters',"" Rakshit adds. Not that targeting Sabars ended following Mahasweta Devi's efforts. In 2003, Bhadra Sabar of Tilabani village under Boro police station was killed when villagers allegedly threw stones at him on charges of theft. The police and officials feel that a section of Sabar men were involved mainly in road robbery till one or two years ago. But as Jaladhar Sabar points out: ""The torture by the police has gone down. We will continue our fight to bring proper financial and social development to our people."" That is the big challenge. The Samiti gives legal help and still conducts training for Sabar people to make handicrafts and market these. But it is not enough. It is also clear that Mahasweta Devi's work model was not sustainable. Some other personalities who promised help have disappointed the Sabars. The Samiti members said that in the nineties, five schools opened in Sabar villages, but have closed down recently because of lack of funding. The villagers in Bangthupi and Akarhbaid said no teacher was willing to teach their children as no one can pay. Individuals and organisations who visited the Sabar villages because of Mahasweta Devi have left. Desperate, many Sabars ""upgraded"" their traditional practices into lucrative ones. Earlier the Sabars would make liquor from Mahua, but now they are using molasses and yeast to brew alcohol and sell it. In Bangthupi, a Class VI student was found making hooch in his house. This business makes his family more prosperous than others in the village. ""My left leg was cut off as it was burnt in an accident. I had no option other than selling hooch. I earn Rs 400 in three days,"" says Anil Sabar, the father of the Class VI student. Other Sabars are going the contemporary way: migrating. Sabar women have begun to go to Purulia to work as maids and a large number of young men are migrating to Gujarat, Mumbai or Bangalore to work as construction labourers. Kalyani Sabar from Balakdih village, who received handicrafts training for Mahasweta Devi's projects, has started working as a maid. She is happy. Kalyani is proud that she could spend Rs 4,000 on the last rites of her father and treat all villagers to lunch, comprising fish, chicken, vegetable curry and plenty of rice with aloo posto and chutney. ""I could afford the money only because I started work as a maid. I earn Rs 4,000 easily a month. My son Motilal works as a labourer in Purulia town,"" she says. At least 1,000 Sabar youths, mostly school dropouts, go to other states every year to work as construction labourers and return home with at least Rs 15,000 every four months or so. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has not been much of a help. Few job cards have been updated since 2008. ""I don't know how to get work under the scheme. No one calls us,"" says Uttor Sabar, 40. A district official from Purulia says the Sabar people had not been brought under the government project successfully because of their ""culture"". The Sabars, hunters and wood-gatheres, do not enjoy the kind of work possible under such a scheme, he adds. Same with government institutions. Sabars do not fit in. ""We have provided concrete houses to them under government schemes. Many of them are not concerned about bank accounts or documents, which we provided by going to their villages. We are trying to connect them with the mainstream with Aadhaar card facilities,"" says Ajay Sengupta, the block development officer of Puncha. One solution would be to give agricultural land, Rakshit feels. ""But it would take a special initiative from the government to provide agricultural land for a 'decriminalised' tribe like the Sabars."""

The motifs are ritualistic images from mythology and scriptures.Joint effortSadly, either brush strokes of acrylic paint or, worse still, printed plastic stickers of the traditional art have taken its place in most of the houses and the myriad community puja-mandaps in and around the city.Now an effort has been mounted to save this art from slipping into oblivion. INTACH, under its cultural heritage programme, has joined hands with the Daricha Foundation, which also works to revive tribal and folk arts, to give alpana a fresh lease of life.INTACH is now exploring whether it can be made into a source of revenue for girls from underprivileged sections.Interestingly, also involved in this revival effort is artist Rabi Biswas, who was fascinated by this art form at a young age and learnt it from his grandmother and village elders. Today, he gives gives lecture demonstrations (lec-dem) and is regarded as an authority in this art form. He is also the pivot around which many revival efforts are woven.Although there is little awareness about alpana among the youth of West Bengal, it has generated interest among people across the seas who see in it a unique art form.Ian Beed, a religious studies scholar from Florida State University, told The Hindu after attending a lec-dem that he was fascinated by the way alpana provided women a vehicle for expression, irrespective of their caste or creed.Alpana is intrinsically linked with religious austerity (called brotos or vrat) practised by women of mostly rural West Bengal for the well-being of the family.Urban women until recently also observed such pujas, whose closure would always be marked by a special puja and alpana drawing with special motifs. So if it is to propitiate Goddess of wealth Lakshmi, it would involve her carrier, the owl, a granary, a conch shell and lotus flower motifs.Young girls and married women alike would draw these designs on walls and floors of their mud houses using rice powder paste."

(PTI Photo) West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. (PTI Photo)A FIVE-DAY food festival, the brainchild of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, meant to celebrate Bengali cuisine globally and provide farmers a platform for their produce, has come in for criticism from the Opposition, which has termed it hypocritical and an insult for a state where poverty and financial crisis have often resulted in many not having enough to eat.The Ahare Bangla food festival, held at the Milan Mela grounds in Kolkata from October 21 to October 25, saw hundreds turning up.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOrganised by the state animal resource development department, the event saw four state organisations, 23 sweet shops and 20 restaurateurs participating. The festival is now in its second year and has an international outreach with stalls from Bangladesh, China and Russia participating. The queues stretched on endlessly. A total 103 food counters served more than 550 items. It was an incredible opportunity for the people to get a taste of classic Bengali dishes alongside new items that they had never tried before, said Animal Husbandry Minister Swapan Debnath.The festival saw a variety of items  from traditional bhapa ilish to emu steaks. While traditional vegetarian dishes were highlighted on October 22, eggs were the delicacy on October 24 and fish on October 25.While the government has been ecstatic at the reception of the event, the Opposition less so. It has alleged that the festival was an unnecessary squandering of tax payers money and an insult to the poor, who cannot even get enough to eat.Ahead of the Assembly elections earlier this year, the ruling Trinamool Congress was confident of its rice politics  extending the scope of the National Food Security Act to reach out to 6.5 crore people instead of 3.5 crore (over 70 per cent of the states population). The Bengal famine of 1943, consequent cases of what the government euphemistically refers to as hunger deaths or death due to chronic ailments neglected in the past have entrenched hunger as a vital issue during elections.A myriad representation of hunger by artists ranging from Chittaprosad to Somnath Hore have formed the iconography for hunger in the post-colonial Bengal, which continues today. Mamata herself is not unaware of this. At rallies, she is often introduced as the anna data  goddess of food  by her party members. It was no accident that the new state secretariat was named Nabanna, after Bijon Bhattacharyas play on famine.For the Left and Congress, the Ahare Bangla festival has proven an ideal platform to hit out at Mamata. Left cadres had hit the street, protesting the wastage of government funds through its Anahare Bangla (Bengal starving) programme. A day before the inauguration of the food fest, Left leaders had organised a protest that defaced the venues gate with posters highlighting starvation in Bengal and deaths due to malnutrition in the tea gardens.The government should give priority to issues like unemployment, factory lockouts, dengue outbreaks and not organise a food festival. It is an insult to those who dont get enough to eat, said Left leader Sujan Chakraborty.The Congress, on the other hand, has alleged that the fest was a gimmick. Party president Adhir Ranjan Chowudhury said: It seems Banerjee is mocking the common people. In a state where farmers do not get paid for their crops and a lot of people cannot buy two square meals a day, what significance does a food festival hold?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
590a00767be9e033b96ea0f4,Demonetisation: How the cash crisis can be used to tame rural commercial capital,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-how-the-cash-crisis-can-be-used-to-tame-rural-commercial-capital-4379593/,2016-11-17,"The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts. The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts.In her insightful study of the working of agricultural markets in West Bengal, British development studies scholar Barbara Harris-White has documented in detail how trade in farm produce is controlled through a web of rural and semi-urban agro commercial enterprises.These enterprises  whom she broadly categorises as rural commercial capital  enjoy privileged access to formal credit networks. The monies borrowed from banks and other financial institutions they use for on-lending to farmers against future deliveries of produce. They also control the functioning of agriculture produce market committees  which oversee the operations of regulated mandis  through cornering of trading licenses and restricting new entrants. Further, they ensure all official procurement of wheat and rice undertaken by the Food Corporation of India and state government agencies is channelised through them, thereby guaranteeing both assured business and almost complete elimination of market risk. Through these economic means, apart from ability to court political patronage, rural commercial capital has managed to squeeze out all potential competition in agricultural produce markets, including from petty traders who can never achieve the same size and volume.Watch What Else is Making NewsWhile Harris-Whites work, based on field studies stretching over a decade, has focused on West Bengal, its findings characterise the behaviour of rural commercial capital in other parts of the country as well. Moreover, they continue to hold good even a decade after being published in the form of a book (Rural Commercial Capital: Agricultural Markets in West Bengal, Oxford University Press 2008). Only around 60 per cent of farm households in India today have access to institutional finance. Even among this 60 per cent, a majority has to supplement bank loans with borrowings from moneylenders and other informal sources. The numbers are worse for small and marginal farmers, where barely 15 per cent can even obtain loans from banks, leaving them almost entirely at the mercy of rural commercial capital.Moreover  and this is important  practically 100 per cent of transactions between farmers and rural commercial capital are conducted in cash. The surpluses, which the latter generates in the form of interest on advances and profits on trading of produce, are also retained in cash for further recycling. Needless to add, most of this income is outside the tax net. The resultant liquidity also provides the basis for the enormous reach and power that rural commercial capital enjoys.The above source of power is what has also today become the cause of its nightmare, following the Narendra Modi governments decision to de-monetise high-denomination currency notes. In one fell swoop, the move has left rural commercial capital exposed and vulnerable. While this entrenched lobby has endured many policy shocks in the past, whether it would survive this blow, however, remains to be seen.As of now, the de-monetisation decision has had three broad impacts in agricultural markets across the country. The first is a drastic fall in mandi arrivals. Farmers, having just finished harvesting their first decent crop in over two years, are facing traders who are asking them to postpone deliveries. Even when they are willing to supply on credit and settling payments later  following an old tradition of trust and faith  traders are unwilling to hold inventories in an atmosphere of uncertainty. There is genuine fear today that the Modi government will follow up on its agenda of unearthing black money through a further tightening of the noose. Old timers say that such fear wasnt experienced by the trading community even during the Emergency  which says a lot.Secondly, cash lending has suddenly dried up, which is proving to be more troublesome for farmers than even postponed sales of produce. The reason for it is that the rabi season sowing operations have just commenced. This is the time when all sorts of expenses on seed, fertiliser, labour, etc. have to be incurred. Replacement of the de-monetised currency with new notes would be much slower in the hinterlands than in urban centres. As a result, banks cannot disburse cash loans for seasonal agricultural operations under the Kisan Credit Card window. And with the enormous cash hoards with rural commercial capital ceasing to be legal tender, there is no finance available to farmers even from this informal ATM (any time money) source.Thirdly, even if farmers are in a position to deliver produce in some mandis, further transportation of it has all but come to a halt. The fragmented nature of Indias transport networks means that most trucks, especially medium and small loaders ferrying fresh produce, are individually owned. They again deal exclusively in cash and are simply unwilling now to transport produce in the absence of access to working capital, whether from institutions or the trade. The result is a severe disruption of daily fruits and vegetables produce flows to major markets like Azadpur in Delhi and Vashi in Mumbai.Even as rural commercial capital copes with perhaps its worst existential crisis in recent memory, the current situation offers a unique opportunity for at least cleaning up the countrys agricultural credit market and linking millions of its farm households to institutional finance. The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts. By enabling assessment of the credit requirements of each holding, it will allow the eligible loan amounts to be transferred directly to the account holders. The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development could probably lead the way here. It should launch a mission to universalise access to farm loans, by focusing particularly on smallholders who are the most deprived of this facility.While all this may not be possible immediately and requires careful planning for proper execution, the target should be to go for a full roll-out during the next kharif season. This step can go a long away in breaking the stranglehold of rural commercial capital, which has thrived by tethering farmers to a vicious cycle of tied credit and captive marketing of their produce. It would also put Indias agriculture economy on the path of sustainable growth and prosperity.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: File Photo) BJP seems to take all its vote from West Bengal districts. (Source: File Photo)THE COLOUR is changing in Dhenua, a village in Bardhaman district, West Bengals rice bowl. As acres of green paddy slowly ripens to gold with the onset of winter, the political mood, having changed from red to green in May this year, is slowly tilting towards saffron, it appears. Dhenua, along with more than 150 villages, will go to the polls on Saturday in Monteswar assembly constituency, necessitated by the death of the local MLA, Trinamool Congresss Sajal Panja.Dhenua, now with 4,600 voters, has been unwaveringly loyal to the CPI(M) for over 40 years. Even when the Red Bastion that was Bardhaman started turning green with rapid inroads by the TMC, and Mamata Banerjee swept the district in 2011, Dhenua stood ground. When Monteswar finally fell in May 2016, after a fierce battle, Dhenua remained unbending, having thrown its weight behind three-time CPI(M) MLA Chaudhry Mohammad Hidaitullah, who lost to Panja by 706 votes.But thats changing.Watch what else is making newsWe have been hearing about the Prime Ministers plans to curtail black money, and to bring it back. We are happy. We dont care whether we directly benefit from this  we are just happy that moneylenders who have been oppressing us for years, and have been stashing cash, may finally be served justice, said Shanti Majhi, 50. This is our revenge  we are very happy that they (moneylenders) will now be very unhappy.Monteswor has a Muslim population of 43 per cent  there are 900 Muslim votes in Dhenua alone  but that is hardly bothering Biswajeet Poddar, 42, the BJP candidate. This vote will be split between CPI(M) and TMC. We dont expect to change the government with just one or two elections. But people are increasingly turning towards us. With the scrapping of notes, the votes are now ours, he said. Voters have been coming up to me and saying that I dont need to campaign; that they will vote for the BJP because of Narendra Modi, because of what he has done.About the issue of demonetisation, Poddar said, No one is against the decision in this constituency. Many shopkeepers are still accepting Rs 500 notes. There is no problem. Local TMC supporters said that the by-election is of huge significance to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee: it is the first election since the Supreme Courts Singur verdict went in her favour, the first since TMC was registered as a national party, and the first since the demonetisation decision that Mamata has hit out against, seeking its revocation.The by-election is seen by many as a precursor to the state panchayat polls in 2018, and the 2019 General Election.We are facing off with the Trinamool but in my mind the greater rival for us in both the state and the country is the BJP. They have polarised the country in way that we thought was not possible, said former CPI(M) MLA Chaudhry Mohammad Hidaitullah, managing the partys campaign for the bypolls.On the eve of the bypolls, the lines outside banks remained long almost through the day, and ATMs had signs of No Cash, but workers of all three main parties maintained that the inconveniences have not reached alarming proportions. Demonitisation has not affected anyone in this village. How can it? We never used Rs 500 or Rs 1000 notes anyway.

(Source: File) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been agitating against demonetisation, tweeted about Nandis suicide. (Source: File)A farmer committed suicide in West Bengal Monday, after which the ruling Trinamool Congress linked it to the Centres demonetisation drive. Shibu Nandi, 61, killed himself because he was unable to withdraw money from his account in a local cooperative bank with which he would have paid labour wages, said TMCs Bardhaman district in-charge Swapan Debnath.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been agitating against demonetisation, tweeted about Nandis suicide: More sad news. A farmer, Shibu Nandi commits suicide in Kalna, Burdwan. He alleges because of demonetisation he could not pay wages to labour.WATCH VIDEO: Shivraj Singh Slams Mamata For Criticising Demonetisation PolicyA bhag chashi or landless farmer, Nandi used to farm onions on one acre that belonged to his landlord. A Santhali tribal, Nandi lived with his family in remote Rahatpur village of Bardhaman district.Villagers said Nandi had been anxious about being unable to pay the labour he had hired to till the field he had rented. He had around Rs 20,000 in an account in the local Samavay Krishi Unnayan Samiti or SKUS. These Samitis are local branches of cooperative banks.He was always very sensitive. His labourers had been taunting him for days. Short of money himself, Nandi couldnt take the abuse anymore, said a villager.Since most famers do not have bank accounts, they deposit their savings in these SUKS branches. Nandi had a certain amount in SKUS but after the directive that no money transactions will take place in cooperative banks, Nandis money was stuck, said Swapan Debnath, who visited the Nandi home in the evening.Nandi is survived by his wife Sundari and son Nirmal. Sundari and their son had gone to another landlords field to work as hired help, leaving Nandi alone at home. When Nirmal, 24, and his mother came back from work they found him hanging from a tree in a corner of their courtyard.He owed his labour team Rs 3,000, said Debnath. Its the farmers who have been hit the most. Nandi was just one such case. Because of this government directive, their cash is stuck and this is harvesting season. Most farmers withdraw their cash in this season and deposit it back after selling their product, before the next season of sowing, Debnath said.Forget the farmers. We have had byelections in Monteswar assembly constituency in Bardhaman and we havent been able to pay party workers. One day we all just survived on puffed rice and tea because we didnt have the notes to buy proper food. Tomorrow is the results of the bypolls and I dont know how were going to pay party workers again, said Debnath.PTI quoted Debnath: We will launch demonstrations to highlight the plights of farmers like him who are faced with starvation in the wake of demonetisation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Parshuram has wound up his work for the day. A worker at the site of an mid-size apartment complex near Clive Battery, he discusses with his colleagues the impact of the demonetisation on workers like them.We talk only about this and live in the hope that notes of all denominations will be available at the earliest. We cannot even take a break and return home for a few days, says Mr. Parshuram, who hails from West Bengal. In his mid 40s, he has to support his family that includes his mother, his wife and their two children. We are not getting our full wages. We are able to manage here, but my family is not in a comfortable situation at the moment, he says, but adds that the site supervisor has arranged for over a weeks provisions for more than a dozen workers employed in the site.The non-availability of cash is hurting workers. It is hurting individuals who are constructing independent homes the most. In large projects, builders can mobilise resources but individuals neither have the cash or the support system to do that. Many workers are returning to their native places, promising to come back after a month, said a promoter of budget home projects.Contractors and supervisors who do not have multiple accounts can withdraw only limited amounts of cash and they give only half the workers wages, spending the rest on buying rice and vegetables for them. Most workers who hail from outside Tamil Nadu do not have bank accounts and there is no point in giving them Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, says N. Chidambaresh, president of the Chennai Civil Engineers Association.Wages for construction workers from Tamil Nadu vary between Rs. 500 per day for a helper and Rs. 700 for a mason, while it is between Rs. 400 and Rs. 650 for workers from other States. We are unable to pay the full wages, but we have assured them that they will be taken care of until the situation stabilises, he adds.Builders of bigger projects  special buildings (apartments less than four floors) and multi-storey buildings (over four floors)  say that supervisors are having a tough time distributing wages to the workers. The companies claim they do not have sufficient cash to disburse the entire weeks wages to all of them. Many workers who have managed to save cash have taken a holiday to go to their native villages, but this has not resulted in mass absenteeism and hence construction work has not been affected. The workers would come back the moment the situation eases, they say."
58e50ac1a3d24b4437c4a825,The centralising instinct,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-centralising-instinct/article16712866.ece,2016-11-28,"The shock and awe of demonetisation has left no one in India untouched. Equally no one has been left with any doubt as to the fact that the policy originates with the Prime Minister, and that they are being asked to bear with short-term inconvenience in order to advance the longer-term national interest.Reams of newsprint have been devoted to the economics of demonetisation. Here I take stock of the questions raised by demonetisation for the direction of Centre-State relations.Unmediated by the StatesAs a policy initiative of the Central government, demonetisation is unique in recent times for reaching everyone in the country directly, unmediated by the filter of State governments. State governments do not appear to have been consulted ahead of the announcement, and in many cases demonetisation has directly undermined the routine administration of policies under their purview. Many have expressed frustration that they are powerless to address hardships faced by people unable to pay for treatment in private hospitals or of farmers unable to access loans from, or make repayments at, cooperative banks.Unsurprisingly, a number of States have complained that the way in which the policy was enacted violates the spirit of cooperative federalism about which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken so often.Furthermore, the design of the new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India include new national symbols that challenge regional sensibilities. For the first time, the new banknotes include Devanagari numerals, threatening to reignite old settled compromises over the national language within Indias federal union. The use of Devanagari numerals is already the subject of a PIL in the Madras High Court.The back-side of the new banknotes also carry the logo of the Union government policy, Swachh Bharat.All of this is in line with broader attempts to refocus political debates around national questions since 2014. Mr. Modi has consistently called for the strengthening of cooperative federalism, recognising that he is reliant on the cooperation of State governments to achieve national policy goals.A matter of identificationFor decades as Indias polity and economy became more decentralised and the States became the centre-ground of political life, they have been the primary level of political identity for most voters.In a situation where voters found it difficult to correctly identify which level of government was responsible for any given policy and chains of electoral accountability became quite opaque, State governments became adept at claiming the credit for Central government initiatives. Voters frequently give the credit for programmes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) or the National Rural Health Mission to their State governments rather than to the Central government.In the post-poll National Election Study conducted by Lokniti, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) during the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 42 per cent of voters who had benefited from MGNREGA gave the credit for the programme to their State government and only 27 per cent to the Central government. This looks vastly different to the situation in Brazils federal setting, for instance, where over 80 per cent of voters in 2010 attributed the countrys flagship social programme, Bolsa Familia, to the President.Mr. Modis election victory in 2014 challenged, although it has not displaced, the idea that the States serve as the primary unit of political affiliation. It was an election campaign that had a more national character and Mr. Modis candidacy and populist leadership style extended the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to farther-flung parts of the country.Once in office, Brand Modi has involved the projection of the Prime Ministers presence and authority across areas of government activity. Programmes have been carefully rebranded in an effort to better enable the Central government to claim credit for them and to limit the ability of the States to do so.Mamata Banerjees challengeStates have had different reactions to this. The most outspoken critic of Mr. Modis style of government at a regional level has been West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation. Just a day earlier she had raised objections to the fact that the Central government now makes MGNREGA payments directly into workers bank accounts. She has also railed against the naming of Central programmes after the Prime Minister, for which State governments are required to provide matched funding.In August, her counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, explained that his State was right to drag its heels over the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme). He called for the scheme to be renamed the PM-CM farmer insurance scheme, or  Kendra-Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana ( Centre-State Crop Insurance Scheme) if the States were expected to bear half the financial burden.Last month, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav distributed ration cards along with bags of wheat and rice  under the National Food Security Act  that carried pictures of him. The BJPs State spokesperson complained bitterly that the State government was playing politics by trying to claim credit for a policy of the Central government.There has not, however, so far been a resounding critique of the Modi governments version of cooperative federalism from most States. Demonetisation itself has been welcomed by Chief Ministers of both BJP and non-BJP ruled States alike, including Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha and Telangana, although some have criticised elements of its execution and potential to hit State revenues.For those critical of the centralising instincts of the Modi government, demonetisation presents an opportunity to refocus debates on Centre-State relations. Yet at the moment, many regional parties seem more intent on continuing a pattern of Centre-region bargaining rather than building new cross-State alliances that would act as a counterweight to the Central government.Even in the absence of a coordinated inter-State opposition alliance, for the Central government there is the risk that the centralisation of credit claiming for government policies could start to reduce the political incentives of opposition-ruled States to cooperate with the Central government in achieving national goals or implementing Centrally designed policies. This matters since State governments remain crucial for policy implementation. It is even more significant after the enhanced fiscal devolution to States following the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which gives States greater flexibility to decide priorities for government expenditure.A deeper debate neededThe time is right to engage in a deeper debate about Centre-State relations and the operation of federalism. There are major constitutional innovations in the offing such as the GST Council, designed to realise a more cooperative model of federalism in which the Central government and the States pool their sovereignty in order to pursue national economic goals. The counterpart to this platform of cooperation should be a deeper discussion about Centre-State relations and a focus on enhancing the incentives for States to cooperate with the Centre while preserving their autonomy.Louise Tillin is Senior Lecturer in Politics at the Kings India Institute, Kings College, London.An outspoken critic at a regional level has been Mamata Banerjee, who was complaining of the violation of cooperative federalism even before demonetisation"

By November 25, 55% of paddy is harvested, but only 22% Kharif paddy has been reaped so far. The government is thinking of diverting 100-day job labourers to fields for reaping the crop.Bengal's food minister Jyotipriya Mullick on Tuesday said: "" After the paddy is procured, it will go to rice mills . Each entry at rice mill will generate three challans, one of which comes straight to food department in Kolkata. Immediately , the fund will be transferred to the bank account of the farmer through RTGS system. The entire procure ment will be monitored at multiple levels so no corruption creeps in.""He added: ""We have Rs 5,000 crore with the department for procurement. Moreover, we are taking a loan of Rs 1,000 crore from the West Bengal Finance Development Corporation. Besides, the Centre is supposed to give us Rs 2,008 crore this year and Rs 481 crore against last year's due.The state has set the minimum support price of Rs 1,490 per quintal (.1 tonne). It has also set a procurement target of 52 lakh tonne paddy which will yield 41.20 lakh tonne rice. The state's requirement out of the procurement is 32 lakh tonne. Six lakh tonne of rice will be sold to Jharkhand. Rest of the rice will be given to state food safety pool and central food safety pool.The food minister also alerted against a fake job racket in the name of paddy procurement. The racket is playing havoc with the youths in rural Bengal. They are duping job-seekers and charging thousands of rupees in the name of recruitment of civic volunteers by the food department. ""We cannot recruit civic volunteers. Civic volunteers are there with the police department. In case of procurement, the civic volunteers will be roped in from the respective superintendent of police of the district. They floated fake websites and I have ordered inquiry by CID,"" said Mullick.Potato clearance deadline extendedThe Bengal government has extended the deadline for clearing potato stock from cold storage by eight more days.Agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta on Tuesday said, ""We have asked all the stakeholders in the potato business to clear the stock immediately. The government will not allow any off-take of potato after December 8. There is 8 lakh tonne of potato stock lying in 480 cold storages in Bengal."

Archive photo Tea plantation workers tend to a garden. Archive photoA state minister has claimed that continued delay in wage payments to tea plantation workers in North Bengal could lead to starvation.Speaking at a series of agitations that the TMC held in the region on Tuesday, north Bengal development minister Goutam Deb said, Since most dont have bank accounts, they will face problems in withdrawing wages from banks. The nearest banks are located around 10-15 km away. They will lose a days wages if they go to banks to withdraw their cash. These poor people have no alternative source of income and ultimately it will lead to starvation of the tea workers, he said.WATCH VIDEO: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjees Flight Reportedly Had Low Fuel: Heres What HappenedThe spectre of starvation has been a constant companion for tea garden workers in north Bengal, which, according to some reports, recorded 1,200 hunger deaths after tea estates began shutting shop from 2002 to 2007  a claim contested by the TMC government.Officials admitted that the continuing cash crisis could have devastating consequences for the vulnerable tea estate workers.Deb added, We are trying to tackle the situation through the Food Security Act. We will talk to the administration whether rations can be arranged on credit for tea workers and likewise.We are poor people, said Mithun Lohan, a tea garden worker at Dhumchipara. I dont think the government realises how poor we are. We get rice at Rs 2 per kg from the state. But even then it is difficult for us to ensure that weve enough money to buy food for our family. If we miss a days work to go to an ATM or a bank that means a loss of Rs 120 for me. I cant afford that. Following demonetisation, the RBI has asked tea plantations to open bank accounts for workers.Salaries have always been paid in cash in tea gardens. But on Sunday, banks set up camps at tea gardens and saw hundreds of bank accounts being opened in the first few days. But like Amita Tanti, another worker, explained there were reasons why many had consciously avoided banks.We know our money will be safer in a bank. But there are no ATMs here. We have to spend on travelling at least 10 kms to go to the nearest bank that works. Our problem wasnt that we were getting paid in cash. But that tea gardens, without warning, would shut and not pay wages, she said.Last year, reports of deaths of tea garden workers due to starvation rocked the government, prompting CM Mamata Banerjee to announce relief packages despite her government contesting the claim.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The herd has been damaging acres of standing paddy and orchards in two range areas.DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said a herd of 45 elephants from neighbouring West Bengal had sneaked into Rasgobindpur range though Badsul forest area as part of their annual sojourn. The elephant herd has already crossed Rasgobindpur range and at present they are roaming in Ashanbani forest under Betnoti range. Another herd of about 20 elephants may have moved towards Raibania forest area under Jaleswar range of Balasore district, the DFO said.The herd moves into the forest during day time and returns at night. The forest officials are keeping a close watch on their movement. A team of 120 trained staff, including elephant experiment squads and forest guards, have been engaged to drive them away. A couple of hired horses has been deployed as horse excreta keeps the elephants away. The neigh, smell of stool and urine of male horses irritate elephants, Swain said.Though no human casualty has been reported so far, the herd has damaged standing paddy crops in several acres.We have warned the locals not to chase the elephants as they may turn violent if they are irritated by fire crackers and pelting of stones. They have also been asked not to stock any intoxicating substance like rice beer and mahuli, Swain added.A 24-hour control room has been opened at Baripada forest divisional office and an Assistant Conservator of Forest has been engaged to monitor the movement of wild elephants and collect information from staff and locals, the DFO said, adding that the movement of the elephants herd is now towards Kuldhia wildlife sanctuary of Balasore district."

Most of the artisans in this Maoist hit block make bamboo products for a living and now, these families are neither able to buy raw materials nor sell their finished products in the wholesale market. Denomination of Rs 2,000 currency poses a new challenge for them as it is too big an amount for their petty needs.Mohan Mohali, a resident of the village , told TOI that he along with his three family members manage to earn Rs 6,000 a month but since note ban, the earning has stopped . ""It is a big blow to our livelihood and none of the local leaders, politicians or government authorities have taken pains to see our condition. Now a days boiled rice is our breakfast, lunch and dinner as there is no loose change to buy pulses or vegetables,"" said Mohali.Aasandabur village which is a part of Ojhadih Katania panchayat has nearly 45 houses and apart from one person who has passed Class X, the rest are uneducated and only depend on bamboo-weaving business . Chhatabad, the village adjacent to Aasandabur, has 40 minority families earning their living by making wooden rolling pins and cots and is in a similar plight. ""We usually sell our products in the wholesale market or take our product to Bihar and sell door-to-door. Loose currency is required at every step right from bus fare to daily food expenses. As we belong to a Maoist dominated area, the traders refuse to give us raw materials on loan,"" said Salim Kazi, an artisan who makes rolling pins.Another village of the same panchayat, Rajak Tola, is a hub of broom manufacturers . This village sells brooms across the state and in a few districts of Bihar and West Bengal. Their business has also taken a hit due to the shortage of cash.Tundi block pramukh Kamla Murmu, while speaking to TOI, said that absence of Rs 500 notes is the main hurdle for the artisans. She added that the grievances would be voiced at the zila parishad meet soon. Murmu also said that most of the villagers do not have bank accounts and the usage of plastic money and other alternatives are out of the question as people here are not educated.DC A Dodde said that immediate steps would be taken to help out the poor. He added a team of bankers and district authorities would be sent on Sunday to take stock of the situation and address the grievances."

It is also true that we remain inactive during those nine days and, at the end of it, make offerings to our ancestors so that we are all safe, says the 70-year-old at his home in Sakhuapani, a village 500 metres from the Hindalco Groups Gurdari bauxite mine in Gumla district of Jharkhand.WATCH VIDEO: The Earliest Known Ramleela In Chitrakoot Preserved In Its Original FormOn February 24, after reading from a pamphlet purportedly distributed in Jawaharlal Nehru University, which, the minister said, had depicted Durga in poor light and Mahishasur as the victim, Irani had said, What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it.As he speaks about his traditions and way of life, Chamru is almost passive  not apologetic, not defensive, not angry, not seeking answers.Chamru is an Asur, a particularly vulnerable tribal group that dominates Sakhuapanis population of about 2,000 and lives in villages spread over a radius of 10 to 20 km. Besides Jharkhand, members of the tribe live in pockets of Bihar, West Bengal and a few other states. The 2011 Census put the number of Asurs at 22,459 in Jharkhand and 4,129 in Bihar.Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur.

Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)The Asurs claim to be descendants of Mahishasur, the buffalo-demon whom Goddess Durga kills after a spirited fight lasting nine nights. Its this mythology in mainstream Hinduism thats celebrated in the form of the nine-day-long Durga Puja, but observed as Mahishasur Dasain among the Asurs, who hold a period of mourning during which they largely stay indoors.Chamru says that even when he was a child, though people had their beliefs and biases, nobody attacked them for it, they merely thought they were different. Those were the days of zamindari. The zamindar of Bishunpur (now the local police station) would ask us to get wood and collect leaves for making pattals for the puja. We would go there, give the zamindar all this and also give him some of our tools. We would then return home before the celebrations began and offer prayers seeking protection from our own ancestors, says Chamru.WATCH VIDEO: Dussehra Celebration At Red FortNow as these cultures are seen as offending, Chamru says these are just beliefs. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you. I cant tell you how our descendants settled down in this part of the country and so on, he says.***Sushma Asur, a tribal activist in Sakhuapani, says the community also celebrates Sohrai, which coincides with Diwali, by applying koronj (or karanja in Hindi) oil on their navel, chest and nose, and eat cucumber. The symbolism here is that when our ancestor Mahishasur was killed, he had blood oozing from his navel, nose and chest. Applying oil on those parts depicts the same. Eating cucumber is a symbol that we are avenging his death by eating the kaleja (liver) of the killer, Sushma explains.In her 20s, Sushma says she has studied up to Class XII and is working with tribal activists to revive our lost traditions, songs and skills. Over the years, she says, there are several of these traditions that have given way to modern practices of the outsiders.Asurs, she says, were once iron smelters, but now the village doesnt have a smelting unit. Chamru says he used to make small weapons, but I have forgotten all that now. According to one of the theories, the Magadh Empire benefited a lot from the weapons the Asurs made. Their iron does not catch rust. And we know there are many Ashokan-era edicts on iron that havent rusted, says Ashwani Kumar Pankaj, a tribal activist in Ranchi.Traditionally, Asurs dont drink cow milk. We want the calf to have all the milk and grow up strong so that it can be used in the fields, says Anil Asur, Sushmas brother. Villagers still dont drink much milk or tea, happy instead to down a glass of rice beer.***Carron tea estate in West Bengals Jalpaiguri district is hundreds of kilometres away from Jharkhands Sakhuapani village.

I couldnt give them a better life, maybe a new faith will bring some light in their lives, he says.Bargi belongs to a group of about 1,000 Asurs, who moved from Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh in the early 20th Century and work and live near the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. My father moved here in 1914 to work for a British tea planter. We have lived here ever since. Its been more than a century now, he says.Jagannath Singh, 67, a social worker who used to work as a primary school teacher at the Carron tea estate school, says the story of the Asurs is like that of most other particularly vulnerable tribal groups of the country, but with a cruel twist. Apart from abject poverty, they also have to deal with social stigma. The Asurs in Jalpaiguri were recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in 2014, after years of struggle, says Singh.He says that of the 101 Asur families living in Carron tea estate, more than 90 have converted to Christianity. They have little choice. They feel this new identity will give them a better life, he says.Yet, some find ways to keep both their new and old identities. We observe Asur puja twice a year, once during the month of Phagun (March-April) and once during Dusshera. The puja can be performed only by men, and women later participate in a traditional asura dance, says Etwari Asur, 75.Lalita Asur, 38, who works in the estate and had converted to Christianity about five years ago, says life has taught her to be careful about revealing her true identity. Why should I claim to be Mahishasurs descendant? Am I mad? she laughs. A lot of us have taken on different surnames such as Topo and Kajur, says Lalita.Over the years, the Asurs, both of Jalpaiguri and of Sakhuapani in Jharkhand, have migrated to cities in search of jobs, most youngsters dont speak the Asuri language any more and their worries are as mainstream as any other. The only thing they hold on to are memories  of stories told by their parents, of childhood fears and anxieties.Back in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand, Sushma recalls how over the years she began getting acutely aware of the fact that the asurs or demons were always depicted as ugly and were primarily painted black. All demons are dark-skinned, ugly and evil. Now, we trace our lineage to them. Tell me, do we look like anything like that? she asks.

(Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)Expert column: Struggle for survival, not of faithThe term tribal defies any universal definition. Between the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia and the Indigenous People of North America, there is a shared historical fact. They were all there before the colonial powers pushed them to margins. This is not so in the case of all tribal communities in India.Some of the Indian tribes such as the Onges and the Jarawas of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been entirely indigenous. Some others like the Banjaras in Western and Central India and the Gujjars in the Himalayas have been nomadic. And, some, such as several sub-groups of Bhills, have migrated in various historical phases to their present geographical locations. The stories of migration of such communities are found in their oral traditions. The diverse histories of tribes in India are seen among the Particularly Vulnerable Groups as well. The term primitive used for them at one time has fortunately been declared as pejorative.

A car parked outside wears the owners identity on its rear windscreen, with stickers of Ravana and Gujjar.In this Uttar Pradesh village thats believed to be the birthplace of the ten-headed king, Ravana is not the villain of mainstream Hinduism mythology, but a scholar, a kind brother and a devout follower of Shiva.Locals take pride in flaunting his name behind cars, and occasionally on sports jerseys when theres a cricket match. A Shiva temple in the village, where his father Vishrava  Bisrakh is said to be named after him  is believed to have prayed, is colloquially called Ravana temple. (Read more)"
58e535977be9e05a951f5afc,Fears of tame Xmas amid tragedy,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161209/jsp/jharkhand/story_123664.jsp,2016-12-09,"Ranchi, Dec. 8: Exactly a month after demonetisation was announced, church leaders have confessed that donations from the faithful had dropped by more than 50 per cent, so much so that philanthropic activities had been cut back and Christmas celebrations were likely to be low-key. ""People, particularly those in remote areas, are now offering us rice and vegetables instead of cash. We fully understand their predicament since the shortage of cash and restrictions on withdrawals have left everyone with very little cash in their hands,"" said Johan Dang, the moderator of Gossner Evangelical Lutheran (GEL) Church, the oldest church in Chotanagpur. The church, the moderator confessed, had always banked on its people and explained that since July 10, 1919 when GEL Church had declared autonomy it meant that all its activities were to be carried out with the help of donations from its own people, without depending on outside sources. A drop in collections meant that the church had very little by way of cash to continue its philanthropic activities. ""While the church depends on its faithful, its people too depend on the church in their hour of need. There are lots of people who are sick and needy and have to be supported. Besides, there are pensions to be paid and scholarships to be given to needy students. The cash crunch would also force us to keep this year's Christmas celebrations low-key,"" Dang lamented. However, GEL Church was appreciative of Prime Minister Modi's initiative against black money. ""We hope that the dislocations are short-lived. We are confident that the Union government would soon come out with appropriate solutions,"" the moderator emphasised. At Church of North India (CNI), Bishop B.B. Baskey revealed that their collections had also nose-dived by more than half in the last month. ""With very little cash with us, many of our charitable activities have been adversely affected. We need to tone down Christmas celebrations this year. While our churches would be lit up, fewer than usual lights would be used. However, like previous years, we would continue to donate warm clothing to the poor,"" the bishop said, adding that the problems notwithstanding, the war on black money should continue. Bishop Baskey described as ""silver lining"", the rapid promotion of a cashless economy. ""Our schools and other educational institutions would now need to upgrade their age-old book keeping system to online methods to ensure complete transparency and accountability,"" he said. At the St. Mary's Cathedral on Purulia Road, Ranchi, parish priest Theodore Toppo confessed that with collections from the Catholic faithful on a downward spiral, he was finding it difficult to meet daily expenses. ""We have more coins than notes. There are many Re1, Rs 2 and Rs 5 coins with us. There are lots of repair and paint jobs to be done before Christmas. Since no one wants to be paid in coins, I don't know what to do,"" he said."

People have lost confidence in the central government and in the banking sector. Hence, we give the call of Modi hatao desh bachao to the people of India.She also claimed that several lakhs of skilled and unskilled Bengali labourers have been rendered jobless and forced to return home due to demonetisation.Diamond artisans from Midnapore, zari (embroidery) artisans from Murshidabad and construction labourers from Coochbehar and Hooghly have returned in lakhs from places such as Mumbai, Delhi and the south. Demonetisation was responsible for unemployment of so many people. We will send an unemployment list due to demonetisation to President Pranab Mukherjee soon, she said.Mamata Banerjee also claimed that demonetisation has brought back barter system on a massive scale throughout the state.When I was young and went to my village, I saw people exchanging rice for salt, fish for onions. Modis policies have brought that once again as over 700 gram panchayats in the state are not connected with the banking system, she said, adding that prices of potato, paddy, pulses and basic consumption needs will be skyrocketed as farming has been affected by demonetisation.For the real black money holders, Modi is like a god but for the remaining 94%, he has caused a nightmare, she said."
58fd873d7be9e012bf282d7f,"2016: Bengal voters, Singur verdict bring cheer for Didi, Left decline continues",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/dec/28/2016-bengal-voters-singur-verdict-bring-cheer-for-didi-left-decline-continues-1553884.html,2016-12-28,"KOLKATA: The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress' resounding win in the assembly polls, the Singur case verdict that further strengthened the ruling party's position and the once invincible Left Front's continued marginalisation were the highlights in the action-packed political theatre of West Bengal in 2016.On the flip side, graft emerged as a major issue, with top Trinamool leaders allegedly seen accepting money in a sting operation, while a ""faulty"" under-construction flyover collapsed in a congested street -- crushing scores of unsuspecting people and vehicles under tons of steel and concrete.The April-May assembly polls, that brought together once arch foes Left Front and the Congress in an alliance, saw the Trinamool retain power with a two-thirds majority. Despite a high-pitched campaign by the opposition parties, and allegations of corruption against its leaders, the Trinamool finished with 211 seats in the 294-member House. The Congress emerged as the principal opposition party, winning 44 seats, followed by the Left Front with 33 (including one independent backed by the Front), while the BJP and its associates got half a dozen seats.The Trinamool, which had campaigned on the plank of development, highlighting the welfare initiatives like providing rice to the poor at Rs 2 a kg, cycles to students and grants to girls under the Kanyashree scheme, decimated the opposition in 15 out of 20 districts.The verdict was particularly disappointing for the Left Front, the state's rulers for 34 years at a stretch from 1977 to 2011. Front major Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), which had taken the lead in cobbling togerher the alliance with the Congress even at the cost of annoying some decades-old Left Front partners, failed to arrest its journey downhill that had started in the twilight years of the Left rule.What rubbed salt into the comrades' wounds was the fact that they had to cede the principal opposition status to the Congress, despite having contested the lion's share of the 294 elected seats in the 295-member house (one member is nominated).The lead-up to the polls was marred by a low-level of political discourse as many of the speakers from various parties were caught in television grabs issuing life threats to opponents, using indecent language and invectives and even threatening the administration and the police.The Narada sting footage, which purportedly showed Trinamool leaders, including ministers, MPs, state lawmakers and party office-bearers, accepting bundles of cash in exchange of a promise to give lucrative contracts to a fictitious company, hit the public domain in the midst of the hurly-burly of campaigning and immediately generated a big political storm. While the Trinamool questioned the genuineness of the footage, the opposition parties made the ""revelations"" a major poll issue.The Vivekananda Road flyover, at the crowded Posta area in north Kolkata, came apart on March 31, taking 26 human lives and injuring over 100 persons. This led to another bout of allegations and counter-allegations among political opponents in the election-bound state.Months later, a report drawn up by former faculty members of the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur concluded that faulty design, sub-standard raw material and inadequate supervision caused the flyover's collapse.After its assembly poll success, the Trinamool had more reason to cheer as the Supreme Court struck down the land acquisition made by the erstwhile Left Front government for the Tata Motors' Nano project in Hooghly district's Singur in 2006, and ordered that the land be returned to the cultivators.As the supremo of the then principal opposition party, the Trinamool, Banerjee had spearheaded the anti-land acquisition protests, undertaking a 26-day hunger-strike followed by a 16-day sit-in demanding 400 of the 997.11 acres acquired for the project be returned to those farmers who did not want to part with their land. Following a sustained movement, the Tatas relocated the factory from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat.In the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgement, the Trinamool administration went into overdrive to return physical and empirical possession of land to the peasants.Banerjee, affectionately called ""didi"" (elder sister), herself made a couple of highly publicised trips to Singur, sowing seeds in the fields and returning title deeds to the farmers.Buoyed by the judicial verdict, the Trinamool went from strength to strength as front-ranking Congress leaders like Manas Bhunia and several other lawmakers from the opposition ranks crossed over to its fold.The Trinamool got a further boost when it received national party status from the Election Commission, and through the year tried to position itself as the epicentre of the anti-BJP political space nationally. Banerjee raised the intensity of her attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the central government demonetised high-value currency notes.In order to tap investments, the Banerjee government organised the Bengal global business summit, and claimed to have received investment proposals worth at least Rs 2,50,104 crore. How many of these proposals will reach the implementation stage of the industry-starved state remains a big question.However, taking a big stride in medical treatment, the state saw a number of cadaver transplants, with the administration providing green channels in Kolkata to vehicles transferring body parts from one hospital to another.During the year, the state lost one of its cultural icons, writer activist Mahasweta Devi, while death also snatched away 103-year-old bodybuilder and former Mr Universe Manohar Aich.But 2016, in its last lap, brought a piece of good news when poet Shankha Ghosh was chosen for the Jnanpith, the country's highest literary award."
