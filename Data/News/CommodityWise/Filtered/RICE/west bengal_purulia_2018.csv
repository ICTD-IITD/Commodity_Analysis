For many decades, Punjabs contribution to Indias production of wheat and rice has been substantial. Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people, Amarinder said.Amarinder said of the states almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. Its our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs, the CM said.With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing high-quantity rice and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into Mohali and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.He said: Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the states youth. I want to see it grow as a major technological hub in north, he said. The city is being equipped with all the necessary facilities. Amarinder said that in the next five years, his government would keep the development of Mohali a continued process towards technological growth."

An initiative of the state fisheries department, battery-operated cars bearing these affordable meals will be placed at popular points across various districts, initially near the office of district magistrates. Officials expect government employees and general public who throng these areas to benefit from the cheap meal scheme.Christened Ekushe Annapurna, this dream project of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will be effective from May 1 in all districts. The scheme will be marketed by the West Bengal State Fishermens Cooperative Limited, which is popularly known as Benfish. The scheme was initially launched as an experiment in Kolkata from February 2017.The scheme was a grand success in Kolkata, where 20 of our battery-operated cars serve the people. Now it is time for us to spread it throughout the state. We will begin by placing the cars with meals near district magistrate offices. Gradually, the same will be extended to major crossings and government buildings, state Fisheries Minister Chandranath Sinha told The Indian Express.According to Sinha, placing the cars near DM offices will cater to not only thousands of visitors, but also hundreds of government employees. Every day, thousands visit these offices and not all of them have the financial capability to get full fish meal at a reasonable price. So keeping that in mind, we have decided to start this scheme at different state government offices in the districts, said Sinha.The minister further said, The scheme will be run on a no-profit and no-loss basis. Above all, there is 100 per cent guarantee of hygiene be it cooking or packaging. The meal at Rs 21 will come in a packet covered with a plastic jacket to prevent contamination.This project is designed to fulfil the dream of our chief minister to offer proper and nutritious food to everyone in the state. Our aim is to provide affordable fish meals in a hygienic manner, Sinha said. The Tamil Nadu government had in 2013 launched a similar scheme called Amma Unavagam (amma canteens), under which select outlets across the state served a piece of idli for Re 1, a plate of sambar rice for Rs 5 and a plate of curd rice for Rs 3.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

The survey will be conducted by an independent agency and not by any agency under the Centre or states control, the letter reads.Bengal food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mullick, however, rubbished the Centres decision, saying, Khadya Sathi is a pet project of the chief minister and the entire cost is borne by the state government.He accused the BJP-led central government of unnecessary interference in the states project.

We have plugged the leakage of subsidised wheat, rice and coarse grains to the tune of Rs 17,500 crore annually. Though there is no direct savings because new beneficiaries also get added, now we are providing the foodgrains to the real beneficiaries, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told TOI.According to government data, about 23.19 crore ration cards have been issued to people under the National Food Security Act ( NFSA ). While all the ration cards have been digitised, the progress of linking ration cards to Aadhaar numbers is about 82%. More bogus ration cards will be out of the system once we have 100% Aadhaar seeding, Paswan said.Data compiled by the food ministry show that nearly 50% of the deleted ration cards across the country came from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal . A large number of bogus ration cards were also deleted in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.NFSA is the worlds largest welfare scheme, which targets ensuring food security to more than 80 crore eligible beneficiaries."

How is being finance minister in the SAD-BJP coalition different from being one in the Congress government The difference between the Akali finance minister and the Congress finance minister is that the style of functioning of Capt Amarinder Singh is very different from Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Capt Singh likes to delegate his work, he trusts you completely and expects results. In Mr Badals case, he never delegated and he didnt expect results. He would take finance departments meetings personally and not invite the finance minister. In the present dispensation, I am expected to tie up everything, sew up everything and give a final presentation either to the CM or the cabinet. In that sense, its quite different.I think the last 10 years had been very reckless in so far as populism is concerned, in terms of good governance or administration. A lot of money was recklessly thrown on projects not in the larger interest of Punjab. For example, for the last 10 years they kept telling us that they had foodstock to cover all the losses. But one day before the counting of votes on March 10, 2017, the Punjab government signed an agreement with the Centre accepting all the losses and converting that account into a term loan. In one stroke of pen, we were saddled with $4.5 billion or Rs 31,000 crore. Similarly, electricity boards losses of about Rs 17,000 crore were converted to UDAY bonds. So about Rs 51,000 crore was loaded in within a few weeks.In the last financial year of the SAD government, they made memorials worth Rs 2,000 crore. But for the first time, there was a strike in the Panjab University for 20 days. Students were beaten up. PU was just asking for Rs 20 crore of additional government support. We have not paid the Sainik School at Kapurthala, which for continuous 17 years got the Presidents medal for sending most cadets to the NDA. The annual grant to the school was Rs 1 crore, which is peanuts. Baba Farid Health Sciences University vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur wanted Rs 50 crore to make it a world class university.Once they have been built, what do you do? Either you complete them or leave them. They are all half-constructed. So well have to complete them. But, why were these decisions taken?All revenue of Mandi Board accounts to the tune of about Rs 5,000 crore, PIDB about Rs 2,000 crore a year have been escrowed with the banks for five years. Before they left, they made sure that they emptied out everything and no sources of revenue were left for the next government. Its, as they call it in military, a scorched earth policy where the retreating forces destroy everything. But in this process, the Congress government has learnt a lesson, that howsoever reckless you are, you will be reduced to 15 seats, if you are not careful, if good governance is not there, and if corruption is there. The basic concern is rozi-roti and, what in Urdu they say, izzat ki roti.We were acutely aware of what was happening in Punjab. Whatever the Congress government has promised is basically with the view to kick-start the economy. Now in this cross-subsidisation of giving free power to farmers, the whole subsidy burden was loaded on to the industry of Punjab. They were getting power at Rs 7.60 a unit. If I can take you 50 years back: Why did Punjab progress? Punjab progressed because it had the Bhakra Dam. Because Punjab had access to cheap power, Punjab industrialised and developed.Industry was leaving Punjab in droves because of the power situation. So how do we retain them? We have to create a level-playing field. So when you talk about populism, I would respectfully disagree with you. It was not populism. It involves a subsidy of about Rs 1,500 crore. But I see benefits or multiplier effects if we can retain our industry. Because you dont just retain industry, you also retain jobs and taxes. So, this was a must.No, this is not the only way. There are two other things that need to be done. Farmers have to be weaned away from agriculture. If agriculture forms 20% of Punjabs GDP and 75% people are engaged in agriculture, that means 75% people are trying to earn Rs 20. They are not going to be rich or well-off. The idea is to give skill sets and job opportunities to farmers children so that they can get away and start doing other jobs. Second step is to give better crop prices and promote alternative crops. It has to be multi-pronged approach and debt has to be taken care of. Unless you do all three simultaneously, you will not have the desired effect.We have to remodel our economy from a foodgrainproducing economy into a more industrialised or a service-oriented one. That model has to be put in place in the next four years. If we dont do that, I foresee our resources will be severely affected in the post-GST situation when compensation stops after four years.The Green Revolution must move eastwards. Punjab should be relieved of this duty of growing foodgrains for the country. We have done this duty for 60 years, but in this process we have poisoned our soil, depleted our aquifers and water sources. Let Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, which form the natural food bowl of India, do that duty.We are saying instead of rice, we will be very interested in growing maize. As long as we get the MSP or a little bit of hand-holding, Punjab could become Denmark of India. Why should there not be MSP on milk, fruits, or vegetables? If you study the food policy of India, it is rooted in the 1960s and Green Revolution was the main thrust at the time.If you look at an average Indian, he is malnourished. So now, the Union government should change the food policy to nutrition policy. An average man should have the access to fruit, milk and vegetables, and Punjab could step in as the producer of milk, fruits and vegetables. And, this is how we can remodel and maize could be one of the options.Of course, maize would give as much income or cash as rice would. There would be no problem of stubble burning as well. It will take care of all that.I think that is the political line. The Punjab government is basically trying to assess the electricity requirement. At present, any transmission losses or any inefficiencies of the electricity board are actually all being billed to free power. This is only a pilot project. We are trying to tell farmers that every tubewell costs us, say Rs 48,000 per year. We have 1.4 million pumps. So we are saying, you take this Rs 48,000 which we anyway have to give. In case, you can save power of say Rs 18,000 out of Rs 48,000 that we pay you, then Rs 18,000 is yours. There is another angle to it. We want to save water as well. If farmers accept it, we are going to go further and if not, let it remain a pilot project.We had flagged this issue with the Union finance and agriculture ministers. Maybe the CM will again meet Union minister (Ram Vilas) Paswan and we again will say, Either you take over the entire procurement operation, or reimburse us our actuals  whichever is convenient for you. Pre-GST, we have been charging some cess from the FCI, but it has been subsumed now.Food procurement exercise is inherently a lossmaking exercise to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore per year for Punjab. The Punjab government has to pay Rs 3,200 crore every year to the Centre for next 20 years. Over that, Rs 1,800 crore is the annual loss for procurement of grains. Why should we suffer a burden of Rs 5,000 crore every year? Why should we be burdened with this huge amount when we are undertaking the procurement exercise for the Centre, we are poisoning our soil and exhausting our ground water?I think we are actually selling water not the foodgrains. Every kilogram of rice takes 5,000 litres of water and every kilogram of wheat takes 3,000 litres. To get a cash credit limit, we have to first deposit that loss with the Central government before they give us the limit. We had paid Rs 1,100 crore before the wheat season.I quite agree with this. We have not been able to increase our revenue share and industry in our economy. We are dependent on the Centre. That is why I said, we need to remodel our economy.There are two huge areas I see for Punjab. One is our excise policy. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have opted for corporation model. We are not trying to go for retail mode, but trying to have wholesale part of it so that we can track every bottle that comes to the state either from our own distilleries or from outside. There is a technology to help curb sale of illegal or nontaxed liquor. My own feeling is that distillers, wholesalers and retailers are the same people. This is the area where Punjab should increase revenue by 25% every year. This year, my target is to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and next year it could go up to Rs 2,000 crore.Second area where our revenue can be increased is mining. My feeling is if we can identify additional mines and if we can install technology to check illegal mining, this is an industry worth Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. We are now generating around Rs 150-200 crore from mining compared to around Rs 45 lakh during the Akali regime. Although we had auctioned around Rs 400 crores of sand mines, some people backed out and there was some controversy.Punjab should also be looking at non-tax revenue as it has the lowest non-tax revenue collection in India. The rates have not been revised for 20-30 years. We would ask all departments to review their non-tax revenue.We have flagged this issue with the RBI and even the Union finance minister that there has been some unethical lending to the farmers by commercial banks. This must be checked because in order to achieve their targets they indulge in such things where they know that this money can never be recovered. It is beyond our purview to bring these banks to kneel. We have made a big hue and cry. The reason why we started farm debt waiver first with cooperative banks was that we did not have data from commercial banks.We have already rolled out some of the bigger promises. There were two types of promises. Ones which did not entail any financial liability like electricity subsidy to industry, or farm debt waiver. So we have already rolled out all these. For smartphones we are in talks with many companies. There are some procedural and tax issues with those firms because it is a service and soon those would be resolved. I dont think smartphones will not be handed out as promised.Sometimes tokenism is also important. Mahatama Gandhi was not short of kurtas. He was a barrister from London. But he never wore kurtas because he realized that 70% of people in India at that time never wore a shirt. I think leaders should be role models. Even tokenism of doing away with red beacons on vehicles was a decision in the same direction.It is not only about PDS. They have not allowed use of ethanol made of foodgrains. They have banned it for rice and maize.At this moment, if I look at the total under the MSP regime what the farmers are being paid is about Rs 55,000 crore and the subsidy bill of power, which is the biggest subsidy, is around Rs 6,000 crore. It would add up to around 15% of the total compensation which is being paid to farmers. At this moment I feel that farmers are not able to take that 15%. That would be a huge blow.We will have to carry on with it till such time when we can have farms up and running. It is not possible at the moment. Basically, you have to prioritise, what needs to be done. In Punjab, human resource needs to be upgraded in a massive way.Manpreet Badal is not a first-time finance minister, he was the finance minister in the Akali government as well. Despite that he has not been able to generate resources and has been taking the shelter of empty coffers left by the SAD-BJP government. If he cannot implement the promises made in the election manifesto and cannot improve the financial condition of the state, it is better for him to give up the post. It is for the first time that the salaries of employees are being delayed. How will there be development in the state? At the same time, he has been making unrealistic promises of making Punjab revenue surplus in next four years.The Punjab finance minister has always been begging for financial support from the Union government when the state government has not even been able to distribute funds released by the Centre for various welfare schemes. One of the best examples is the post-matric scholarship for the Scheduled Caste students where around Rs 115 crore sent by the Centre has not been released by the state. Finance department sher-oshayari se nahi chalta. Jab Raja hi mast ho jayega to wazir se kya umeed ki ja sakti hai? Salaries are not being paid on time to employees, pensions are not being distributed for months, and farm debt waiver has not been properly implemented. What to talk about distribution of smartphones to youth as promised in the election manifesto?It seems to be a totally confused government. The Congress govt totally miscalculated Rs 15,000 crore revenue in its first budget. The finance dept doesnt seem to be in the loop of the decisions being taken by other departments. I had asked them during the last budget session where they would generate Rs 10,000 crore revenue from when they do not have any concrete roadmap. The state cannot borrow more than 3% of the GSDP. The Congress government has not been able to even implement announcements made in the last years budget. They have not even cleared the DA and arrears to employees till date and salaries are being delayed every month."

He points to his field, which had once won him the badge of a successful farmer from the Bihar government. He had grown a record 492 quintals of rice in one acre, in 1977.But for this man, who resettled at Biranchi tola number 3 colony -- one among 46 other East Pakistani Hindu refugee colonies in west Champaram -- life is not the same. A flooded Manihari river left piles of sand on his farm and destroyed his fields and his pride. Havildar, who made his way here in 1956, is a broken man after losing four acres of land which are either filled with sand or have been eroded by the river. Nobody from the government has come here. I am virtually landless, he says.Havildar is not alone. Shyamal Prasad Saha (70) and nonagenarian Rabindra Nath Poddar too lost huge chunks of land to sand, making them virtually landless. Saha, one of the educated Bengali refugees grew rice, wheat and sugarcane in the four acres of land he got from the government as part of the rehabilitation policy. He has now shifted base to one of the refugee colonies situated in Bettiah town.Poddar, who earned name and fame for his treatment of snake bites, lives with his extended family. Nearly 55 families out of 113 families rehabilitated in Biranchi no 3 in 1956, have lost nearly 121 acres of agricultural and 69 decimals of housing land. They now live on the edge of poverty.Land for settlementMany Bengali speaking Hindus were forced to leave East Pakistan and take shelter in India.The Centre arranged for their rehabilitation in West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar, Assam and Tripura.In Bihar, these Bengali speaking refugees were first set up in a camp near Paschim Hazari area. They were then relocated to the 46 refugee colonies spread across West Champaran. Bihar has 115 refugee colonies. West Champaran has the maximum, followed by 38 in Purnia and 13 in East Champaran.Each of the displaced families were given two types of land -- five acres for farming and 18 decimal to build a house, or four acres and 18 decimal land. They were given voting rights only two years back in 2015.Not all refugees were lucky. Nearly 24 families  14 of whom are from Myanmar and living at Paschim Hazari camp set up in 1956  are still to get any land. It is not the issue of citizenship. They all have voting rights, said Dr (Capt) Dilip Kumar Sinha, former vice-president of Bihar Minority Commission and president of Bihar-Bengali Samiti. He did not address the issue of non-allocation of land.We never visited our relatives who stayed back. But nobody cares for our plight, said Girija Lal Sahu, a refugee, who came to Hazari camp in 1974. Sahu makes do plying a rickshaw. Other refugees left out in land settlement either work in fields as daily wagers or are into petty business.While some still do fight for land, at Majaharia, another refugee colony, situated near the Udaipur ox-bow lake, encroachment of their land by locals resulted in a bloody fight in 1997.Caste RecognitionIn a state where caste plays a major role, these Bengali speaking people are also vying for a caste identity.Raja Kumar Das, a student of class 10 at Swatantra Senani Kedarnath Motani High School, has been trying to get a caste certificate to apply for his board examinations for the last eight months.The Bihar School Examination Board has announced the schedule, but Das is still struggling to get the caste certificate that is mandatory.It has been proved that more than 65% of them belong to Scheduled Castes (SC) but they are shown in the list of backward castes and extremely backward caste list in Bihar. This is making it difficult for them to get caste certificates. This deprives them of different welfare projects of government, said Madan Banik, vice president (zone 4), central committee, Bihar Bengali Association.A study conducted by Asian Development Research Institutes Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance (CEPPF) reveals that 36.2% people fail to find their caste in the state list, whereas 66% have been placed in extremely backward class. The survey reveals that 97.1% people claimed themselves to be SC, of which 49% and 38% are in East and West Champaran districts respectively.The same people find place in SC list in neighbouring West Bengal. Does change of place change the caste also? wondered Banik.This has happened despite the state general administration department issuing instructions (letter no 20810, dated 16.6.2009) to district authorities to issue caste certificate.The associations Bettiah chapter president, Radhakant Debnath, had written a letter in October 2017 to the district magistrate to consider the state directive, but has not had a response.Socio-Economic ConditionsThe CEPPF study reveals that only 16.2% Bengali speaking refugees have passed matric or taken to higher education; 11.2% refugees can read in their mother tongue Bengali with difficulty, while just 23.6% can write in Bengali.The economic condition of these refugees has not changed either with only 3.3% of their population in government services.While 43.7% are wage labourers, 28.7% are self-employed, mostly in agriculture. More than half their population, 56.6% have shown their income below Rs 3000 per month. Over 30% of the population does not have ration cards and only 15.2% have concrete shelter.The demand for the formation of a Refugee Development Authority is long pending. In 2011, Bihar government announced the constitution of Tharu Development Authority for the development of Tharus living near the borders with Nepal and gave them the status of scheduled tribes. The Bengali Association has also demanded that they be included. The government has, however, been found lacking."

Several districts which were earlier neglected by businesspersons are seeing an inflow of investment due to assurance on the power front. It has also markedly changed the lifestyle of residents, with thousands of people purchasing air-conditioners.A recent study by discoms showed a rise in domestic and industrial power consumption as several industrialists are setting up small and medium units in rural areas. This is particularly visible in most backward districts such as Adilabad, Asifabad, Mahabubabad, Mahbubnagar and Kothagudem, where the land prices are cheap. Availability of cheap labour is an added attraction that is pulling in fresh investments.Sources in the industries department said that they are overwhelmed with the response from industrialists for setting up new units in most backward districts. We received more than 4,000 new enquiries for fresh investments in rural Telangana , which is unprecedented, said sources.Self-employment units also coming up in the villages with the availability of power. Youth who have some technical skill and a diploma are looking to open their own ventures in the villages. Rice mills, granite polishing, pumps and motors repair, floor mills, welding units and service centres are coming up with the introduction of 24-hour power supply, said a senior official of energy department.Across the country, only Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana supply 24-hour power to rural areas. Rural households in nine out of 28 states  Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Mizoram, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh  receive less than 18 hours of power a day.Till recently, urban areas, particularly cities such as Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad and Khammam were attracting new industries due to availability of power and other infrastructure. But as the expenditure of setting up business increased in the urban areas, industrialists have started looking at backward districts."

We have started the case based on a complaint by a nationalized bank. The searches on Friday have led to recovery of incriminating documents, said a CBI spokesperson .CBIs FIR alleged that the directors had entered into a conspiracy with the empanelled lawyer, the chief manager and deputy manager-level officials. In 2009 and 2014, they availed a cash credit limit of Rs 4.45 crore for a rice mill. After a few months, the company stopped paying interest and the principal amount. The loan turned into an NPA and increased to Rs 4.12 crore.During searches, CBI stumbled upon a similar mode of operation used by the directors while taking loans in the names of another company they had floated. The directors, all residents of Burdwan, had taken a loan of Rs 29.23 crore from the bank to set up a food processing unit. The company eventually acquired a rice mill and funds were diverted. Some time after the acquisition, the company started reporting shortage of working capital. The directors applied for restructuri-ng the loan limi-ts but that didnt help. As the company started defaulting on payments, the bank reported the case to CBI.While probing the case, CBI officials found that a director of the company had gifted the food processing unit to his son while the property was mortgaged to the bank. His son re-mortgaged the same property to a second company and took loans. Eventually he applied for a loan of Rs 4.12 core for the second company.The loan was given to him while ignoring the past records and the new loan turned into an NPA in a similar way."

But there is no such plan in case of Birbhum where 12-odd rice mills supplied 26,000 tonnes of poor quality rice,"" said a senior official. In Nadia, the figure for such poor-quality rice is about 1,000 tonnes.Unlike Nadia, the government has decided to give a chance to the mills in Birbhum to replace the poor-quality rice.According to the reports with the food and supplies department, such rice for Khadyasathi - the scheme through which the government supplies cheap rice to two crore people in the state - was given out through seven to eight ration shops spread across four panchayats in the Karimpur block of Nadia.But the allegations appear more serious in Birbhum where the mills supplied rice to a larger area that included the Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore districts from where complaints were lodged with the department.""The allegation is more serious in Birbhum as the allegations have been levelled against several rice mills and it appears a pre-planned conspiracy,"" said an official.Food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mallick visited Birbhum on Thursday and rapped officials.""But nobody in the government tried to identify the mills and blacklist them,"" said an official in the district."

Currently, the company retails specific menu seasoning mix Hapima, which is available in fried rice mix-original, hot and spicy and masala.Declining to reveal figures, he said, the consumption of Hapima in India witnessed a 200 per cent increase last year.As part of diversifying the company's products apart from Aji-no-moto, he said, the company was also retailing Blendy-3-in-1 Masala Chai and Coffee for the Indian market.""Blendy can be consumed as an instant coffee by adding a cup of hot water,"" he said.The pre-mix powdered beverages market in India is estimated at 4,100 tonne and is growing at a rate of six per cent, every year, he said.Aji-no-moto currently has about 44,000 outlets in Tamil Nadu and plans to offer Blendy in 22,000 outlets by next year.He said Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has certified Aji-no-moto while US Food and Drug Administration has given MSG as ""generally recognised as safe"".Currently, MSG was widely used in China, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, African markets, he said."
5b1483cc9855b75db2e6c86c,A piece of Jharkhand in Kerala,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-piece-of-jharkhand-in-kerala/article23396199.ece,2018-03-31,"The migrant workers at the plantations in Munnar enjoy a quality of life not available to their counterparts in most other parts of India. Workers from Jharkhand and Odisha play a hockey match at the Gundumalai tea estate. (Below) Rahil Lomga, a Hindi teacher at a lower primary school in the same tea estate.Thulasi KakkatOn a pleasant Sunday afternoon in the upper reaches of Munnar, on a playfield hidden in the rolling slopes of the Gundumalai tea estate, a game of hockey is in progress. Just beyond the sidelines, standing beside an old cricket pitch roller, six-year-old Lalita Barayudh, still in her school uniform, takes an imaginary slap shot with a crooked twig. She follows the unfolding game with keen interest.The series of weekend hockey matches between plantation workers from Jharkhand and Odisha are played on an improvised pitch marked out with quicklime, often with a goat as a wager. The main organiser is Lalitas father, Lipi Barayudh, a tribal Munda youth from Jharkhands Khunti district. Lipi is the man responsible for bringing nearly 400 labourers from his native State to work in the tea gardens of the Kanan Devan Hills Plantations (KDHP) in Munnar. He is a playmaker in hockey as well, playing on the centre-midfield position.The idyllic scene of a hockey match unfolding in the cool environs of the hills repeats itself every weekend. It also points to the changing profile of workers in Keralas plantation sector, where the receding Tamil labour population is being rapidly replaced by workers from the tribal districts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, besides Muslims from Assam.Train to prosperityKDHP alone has engaged thousands of them, mostly as whole family units, to work as plantation and tea factory workers. For the record, the Gundumalai estate has on its rolls 1,368 workers, including a few migrant workers from eastern India. But the 713-strong temporary workforce is entirely from the migrant community.Its their Persian Gulf, laughs Jeevan Raj, manager of the Gundumalai estate. Deprivation back home, coupled with a dire shortage of blue-collar workers in Kerala, is driving the trend. Unlike the typical labour migration involving young, male footloose labour, Keralas plantation sector  primarily tea, coffee and cardamom estates spread over Idukki, Thrissur and Palakkad districts  has witnessed the relocation of entire families, mostly from the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Muslim communities looking for socio-economic security and mobility. Workers from Jharkhand typically hop on to the Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express and alight at Tiruppur for the onward journey to Munnar in Idukki.The migrant workers at these plantations enjoy a quality of life not available to their counterparts in most other parts of India. Lipi, with a middle school education, was working at a coffee plantation at Yercaud in Tamil Nadu when two of his co-workers left for the greener pastures of Munnar. He followed suit in 2014. His mother is now a permanent worker at KDHP, entitled to 14 days of paid leave and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), besides health care benefits, gratuity, and incentives.Lipis wife, a temporary worker, enjoys the same benefits minus paid leave and LTA. With a robust network in his home town, Lipi started bringing more families to the plantation and acts as a vital link between these workers and the company. You may get higher wages in big cities, but they will still fall far short of your housing, health care, and livelihood requirements. And if an accident at the workplace leaves you incapacitated, you are left to fend for yourself, says Lipi, who takes pride in being able to send Lalita, in Class 2, to a CBSE school. Her schooling costs him about Rs. 40,000 annually.Apart from decent employment, Kerala also holds other charms for Lipi. The hills of Munnar are cool and breezy, with friendly people, he says. In the town, nobody stops you from going to a temple, mosque or church. Our caste doesnt stand in our way.From tea-picker to Hindi teacherThe Lomga couple has more or less the same story to tell. Also from the Munda tribe, Amos Lomga, a matriculate from West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, used to drive a pickup van in Palamau. After seven years, he had nothing to show in the form of savings. Amos and his wife Rahil, a Hindi graduate from Khunti, followed in a relatives footsteps to Kerala. They both found a job and a home in the plantation.Amos and Rahil were both tea pickers when in October, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) engaged the latter to teach Hindi at a lower primary school in the estate. There are about 45 children, and over half are Hindi-speaking. Earlier, just three children of migrant workers from the lower division used to come to school. Now there are seven, and even Tamil children have started communicating in Hindi, says Rahil, as her husband demonstrates his fluency in Tamil. Within the community, they speak Mundari or Sadri (also called Nagpuri). But the multicultural environment has given confidence to their only son, Olive Bikas. The mamas and mamis made us comfortable right from the beginning, says Rahil. They own farmland back home, where rice and pulses are cultivated by Amoss brothers. He says the job has made him fit and a game of hockey transports the community to Jharkhand, where hockey is very popular. We dont want to buy a bike now as the priority is to save up for the boys studies, says Amos.Sunita Devi and her husband, from the OBC Kumhar community, came to work in Munnar last June at the suggestion of her brother-in-law. She has learnt tea leaf picking and the art of manuring the tea plants. Her only grouse is that leafy vegetables are at a premium in these parts.Migrants from the east constitute 80% of the workforce in the Kadukumudi division of the estate. In other divisions, their percentage is at level with that of the locals. Estates are divided area-wise into divisions for administrative purposes. There are Thenmalai, Benmore, Lower, Upper, Kadukumudi and many other divisions constituting the Gundumalai estate.Indira Gandhi, supervisor of the lower division for two years, says shes quite happy with the 50 hardworking migrants who report to her. I communicate with them in Tamil, which they pick up fast. They come to me for anything they need, be it a requirement in the lines [their living quarters in the plantation, typically comprising three to five dwelling units] or for permission to go to the dispensary.Estate doctor Naveen Kumar recalls that initially it was difficult to get the migrants to the dispensary. Even pregnancies would be kept secret till the last term, but things are different now. We have placed emphasis on hygiene, and on ante- and post-natal care to arrest malnutrition. We beat the language barrier by running a visual campaign on the importance of birth control. We have also intervened to curb instances of alcohol abuse and domestic violence, he says.Medical screening at a tertiary care hospital in Devikulam is a mandatory part of the recruitment process for migrant workers, and the State health department has been making frequent visits to the estate to prevent communicable diseases, says Raj. The KDHP covers the expenses for the first two pregnancies up to Rs. 60,000 each, and this has helped underscore the need for birth control.Seamless integrationPremchand and Bamini were tilling the fields in Khunti until three years ago, when they decided to work in Munnar. They have just had a baby and a new bike, bought on cash payment. He believes in one bike per delivery policy, jokes Manimekhalai, a resource person of the SSA in the region. As is the case with many Tamils in the region, Manimekhalais parents still work in the plantations, something the next generation is keen to avoid.Both the sons of Subramaniam, the estate watcher, have sought careers outside of the sector. They do not want to do hard labour as we have done, he says. A native of Tenkasi, Subramaniam hopes to build a house on the three cents of land he owns there, once he and his wife retire from their plantation jobs. Until then, we can stay in the lines. He is happy to be in the company of these workers from Jharkhand and Odisha. Without them, we wouldnt get a break as there would be no one to share the workload. This is also echoed by the caretaker at the crche in the lower division, Arul Jyothi, whose two sons work outside the plantation as lecturer and engineer.Such seamless integration with the local community is perhaps why the migrant workers have been so welcome. The first batch of migrants from these parts, starting with Pithai Munda, who arrived over five years ago and has a child studying in the nearby CBSE school, landed almost empty-handed. The locals provided them warm clothes, took them to the clinic, and helped them settle down until the company took over, issuing them the items needed for daily life. Earlier, they would ask an older kid in the community to look after the infants. But with the governments help, we were able to push almost all the children to school and infants to the crches, where they can have a balanced diet. In fact, the salary of SSA teachers like Rahil is too little compared to what is earned by a worker in the plantation, but the position is empowering. It has helped the community become more aware of the need to educate their children. When the school is on a holiday, Rahil works in the field, says Raj.The real challenge for the government is to address the growing aspirations of the migrant labour community from the Hindi belt. They would need Hindi medium schools and colleges for their wards, Raj adds.Workers like Premchand had slogged in the construction sector in Mumbai before arriving in Munnar. Now Premchand gets to save at least Rs. 10,000 a month in preparation for his childs schooling five years down the line. Over the years, social networking and matrimonial alliances have carried word about these job opportunities from Jharkhand to neighbouring Odisha as well. Subhash Gudia and Maxwell Topno from Sundargarh work in the estate factory and live with four others in a bachelors pad in the line. We encourage families or single men in groups of four or five, says Raj.Muslim families do not get employed in the plantations in Assam, according to Abdul Salam and Mansur Ali, from Udalguri district. In Munnar for a few years, they have also brought in their in-laws and extended family to work in the tea gardens. Its a five-day journey for us and we take the Guwahati-Trivandrum Express. Our women do not get employment even in West Bengal, says Ali. His brother used to work in the plantation before returning to Assam, where he now owns two autorickshaws. The Assamese workers prolonged absence from the plantations has been a thorny issue, says Raj. While some return home for a month or two for no particular reason, some are forced to stay back due to verification requirements of the National Register of Citizens.A win-win phenomenonA recent survey by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) documented the presence of a large number of migrant workers from the tribal districts of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Assam and Bihar in Nedumkandam, Peerumedu, Devikulam and Udumbanchola in Idukki, Mannarkkad and Nelliyampathy in Palakkad, and Malakkappara in Thrissur. Although migrants from distant States are not skilled enough to work in plantations, shortage of labour has been forcing plantation managements to hire them. Plantations tend to hire families as they are less likely to move quickly compared to single men. Because of this, theres a significant number of migrant children in the plantation areas, the study, published in a volume titled Gods Own Workforce , noted.The Economic Survey of the Kerala State Planning Board, published in January, points out that the decadal growth rate of Keralas population, going by the 2011 Census, was 4.9%, the lowest among States, with Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts registering negative population growth rates. Given the situation, the influx of migrant labour from the east presents a win-win for all these States as well as Kerala, says Benoy Peter, executive director of CMID.The tribal districts of these States are marred by inequitable human development and disparities in the sharing of livelihood opportunities. This has forced these people to look towards Kerala, a frontrunner in social development. The Tamil youth who used to fill the labour vacuum have become upwardly mobile. This has paved the way for mobilisation of a captive workforce that could carry out hard labour as demanded by the sector. For the undereducated, less informed youth in the source States, it is a survival strategy. Relatively high wage rates, sustainable job opportunities, a peaceful social environment and less discriminatory treatment, besides access to free health care, education, housing, and socio-economic mobility, are all factors that pull them to Keralas plantations. It is just a matter of time before they become its mainstay, says Peter. In the meantime, their remittances are sure to have a positive impact on the social development of their native States as well. Strong social networks, direct rail connectivity, ease of sending money home, and better communication facilities are all factors catalysing the long-distance migration, he says.But there are challenges too. First and foremost, not every plantation is keen on the social development of the community, and labour exploitation is by no means unknown. Kerala, with its ageing population and changing demography, should gear up for a large-scale social intervention of the kind that it had marshalled in the 1970s and 1980s, because the future of its human development will depend on the pace with which the migrant population catches up with the States present level. It is therefore imperative to have migrant-inclusive development plans, says Peter.R. Pramod, chief inspector of plantations, Kerala, argues that all the workers in the sector, irrespective of their place of origin, are paid wages as fixed by the Plantation Labour Committee. But there is no guarantee that wages and allowances are uniform across the sector, as only those plantations with an area of at least five hectares and employing a minimum of 15 workers are registered with the Chief Inspector of Plantations.Data available with us shows that there are 58,000 workers in 634 estates in Kerala, not counting those working in the more than one lakh minor plantations, Pramod says. There is no separate data on the quantum of migrant labour force in the minor plantation sector. These workers are covered under the relatively new Small Plantation Workers Welfare Fund Board, which is only subscribed by 16,000 workers.Implementation of the States Awas insurance scheme for migrant workers, which guarantees medical care of up to Rs. 15,000 and insurance worth Rs. 2 lakh in case of death by accident, has made slow progress. Only about 2.5 lakh workers out of an estimated population of 30 to 40 lakh have been brought under its ambit so far.As the CMID study concludes, Kerala needs to realise that it needs the migrant labourers more than they need it. Ultimately, the mainstreaming of migrant workers holds the key to successful integration.Their remittances are sure to have a positive impact on the social development of their native States as well.Benoy PeterExecutive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive DevelopmentYou may get higher wages in big cities, but they will still fall far short of your housing, health care, and livelihood requirements.Lipi BarayudhA temporary worker from Jharkhand"

A narrative of north versus south, them versus us, Centre versus states with splices of rationality riveted with rhetoric has come to occupy centre stage.Context crafts the contours of dissent, discord and discourse. The immediate provocation is the change in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, set up to design devolution of funds to states. Population is and has been a determinant of allocation. Hitherto, Finance Commissions used the 1971 data. The 15th FC will use 2011 data. States with lower population assert that they will be shortchanged.On Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan used Facebook and Twitter, no less, to state: Presently, Kerala receives only a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee of tax it contributes to the Union, Tamil Nadus benefit is a mere 40 and Karnataka gets only 47 paisa. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh receives `1.79 for every rupee they contribute. The new move will further aggravate this disparity.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, tagging the CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Puducherry, tweeted: This will further affect the interests of the south: we need to resist. DMK leader M K Stalin charged the Centre with unilateralism and wrote to 10 CMs, including those of the south, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, already in a face-off with the Centre, called out, There is nothing called Centres or States money. It is the taxpayers money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre, but they are diverting the money to the development of the north.Assertions aside, the actuality is that states with smaller populations and lower rates of growth in population could be affected. It is also true that use of data from 1971, when India had 54 crore people, in 2018, when the population is 131 crore, is irrational. Besides, population is only one of the factorsothers, including progress in moving towards a replacement rate of population growth, will deliver compensatory dividends.Political narratives are rarely linear. The southern states have delivered better outcomes and the anger is about the incentive structures and the lack of disincentives. The articulation and the underlying angst is less about who is getting more and more about how states that do less get more.In 1960, the government of India identified the 100 most backward districts. Over 80 of them were from the Hindi heartlandBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Four decades later, a study on the 100 worst districts by this author found that laggards continued to lag. After much was said and done, little had changed. In 2001, a study by N J Kurian found that not a single district from Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh figured among the top 100 districts of India.It is true that the Constitution obliges governments to deliver a minimum level of public goods and services. Ergo population matters. But so does governance. Poor governance is best illustrated by the level of vacancies in the fields of education, health care and security. The largest numbers of teacher vacancies are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The largest number of vacant posts for police personnel is in Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar, the hospital bed to population ratio is one bed per 8,681 persons. Bihar has 40,043 registered allopathic doctors for over 10 crore persons, Uttar Pradesh has 65,343 for over 20 crore people.Governance requires interventions, and some of the most transformative interventions have been in the south. It is, therefore, shocking to find Control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures among the terms of reference of the 15th FC. Fact is what is populist today most often than not becomes policy sooner or later.When M G Ramachandran introduced midday meals in Tamil Nadu in 1982, it was considered populist. It became policy in 1995. The 1983 two-rupee rice scheme of N T Rama Rao led to the National Food Security Act. The 1960s EGS was born south of the Vindhyas in Maharashtra, and became MGNREGS. Amma canteens are now sprouting in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as are fair price medicine shops.The schism is not necessarily geographicit is about performers and non-performe0rs. On October 29, 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the 14th Finance Commission and urged a paradigm shift in the approach. He argued that the Centre share 50 per cent of the divisible pool and that fiscal discipline, revenue collection and contribution to national growth be factored in for allocation. The argument is just as valid in 2018.Article 1 of the Constitution states, India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. This is us. That said, there is no mistaking the discontent bordering on alienation born out of a real and perceived sense of discrimination coloured by social, cultural, religious, political and economic interests. Perception is a high-octane volatile cocktail of facts, fancies, finger-pointing and frailties. Embedded therein are questions that demand dialogue, debate and a dtente of thoughts. To argue that much of it is political is to state the obvious. There is no politics without economics. shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

Nothing survived the inferno that was triggered by a suspected leak in a cooking gas cylinder. But the community-driven effort from neighbouring localities give hope of a better future to the affected men, women and children, most of whom are migrant daily wage earners from Bihar and West Bengal.We never thought we would get so much support. It will take a long time for us to rebuild our lives, but people came to help us within hours, said Vishnu, a native of West Champaran who ran a small tailoring shop in Kanawani near his tenement. Within two hours on Tuesday, Vishnu, had lost his home and the means to rebuild it.After the tragedy struck Kanawani, dozens of residents from the towering high-rises in Indirapuram, the Ghaziabad police, and the municipal corporation came forward to help.SK Jain, a retired officer from IEL, Kanpur, arrived from the Pinnacle Tower nearby with a group of 10 residents and set up a food stall by a burnt tree. We prepared food for nearly 1,000 people and will give them more help in coming time. We are collecting materials and money from residents in our high-rise, Jain said.Members of the federation of association of apartment owners also distributed food packets, water and clothes.From our federation fund, we are trying to get at least 100 durries (floor spreads) from Chandni Chowk. These can be used by families to sleep on as theyre sleeping on the floor, which is basically mud, Alok Kumar, president of the federation, said, adding that they are also collecting items of daily need and getting more aid, in cash and in kind, from residents.The rising heat is also making it difficult for the destitute families who are completely exposed to the elements, and thus more vulnerable to diseases.We used to pay 1,500 to 2,500 as rent for our tenements here. Now, the land owner is refusing to set up shelters again, said Saraswati, who is from Betia in Bihar.Mamta Devi, who rescued her daughters despite being pregnant, pitched four sticks around the space where her house once was and spread a half-burnt saree to create shelter from the sun.Most of the families are trying to cover them from heat this way. I lost my house and also my grocery shop. Luckily my family was saved. If the incident had happened during night, there would have been many casualties, said Subrata Saha, a resident and native of Farukkhabad.Dr Renu Verma, a medical practitioner and social activist from Noida, is among the few who are providing medical aid. Dr Verma, who arrived with a group of volunteers, said, We have come here to assess the needs of the people. We will be sending a team of doctors for medical checkups and to provide medicines. The families have pregnant women. The victims will also need psychological therapy.An ambulance from the nearby Shanti Gopal Hospital was also stationed at the spot as doctors distributed medicines.Some people who suffered minor burn injuries are being treated. Those who have other complications will be treated for free at the hospital. We are trying to arrange for 100 tarpaulin sheets which will give families relief from the scorching heat, said Arun Agarwal, owner of the hospital.Local residents of Kanawani village, too, have come forward to help the affected in their hour of need.Class 10 students Sumit and Rohit skipped school on Tuesday to distribute cooked food and water packets.We have organised a bhandara (community kitchen) and are distributing potatoes, pooris and rice to the affected families. Villagers have pooled in money and we will continue to give them food for a few more days, said Bijender Singh, a resident of Kanawani.Bijenders sister Anita Verma also arrived from Niti Khand with her family and children to help.I specially brought my teenage children to understand what is hardship and that children from well-off families should know their responsibility towards the poor and teach them the spirit of charity, she said.Pradeep Kumar, who lead a group of volunteers from Sewa Bhati, an NGO, cleaned the area. Garbage needs to be cleared. The administration should also come out and help in rehabilitation of the affected people, he said.While the Ghaziabad police pitched in with nearly 200 food packets on Tuesday, municipal commissioner CP Singh sent three teams to clean the area, and address the hygienic issues that may crop up. Kanawani does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation.Stating that the district administration will do everything to help these families, district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari said, As an immediate option, they can be shifted to nearby shelter homes. We will discuss options through which shelter can be provided to the affected families. The administration will continue to help them on humanitarian basis, Maheshwari said."

We chop the prawn, saute and mix it with mashed potatoes before rolling it as patishapta.Ghoti delicacies include Dal Raibahadur and Ghoti murgi while bangal ones include Chitol Kalia and Sorshe Roopchada. Even dishes like shuko will be given a Bangal tinge.

So this time we are hosting a three-day festival.Where: Cafe Studio, IA BlockWhen: April 14 to 30What: Italian food with a Bengali twist. So while Spinach Tortellini, a ring-shaped pasta, uses mascarpone cheese sauce, its base is the ever-familiar lal shak with panch phoron. Fish gets prominence in any Bengali festival so we have items like Fish Pie and Fish Ravioli, which is smoked bekti in tangy tomato and kasundi sauce, says head chef Debasish Paul.But the star dish is the Grilled Baby Bhetki, thats seasoned, pan friend, topped with nichoise sauce and placed on a bed of pesto pearl barley risotto. This dish is for mach-bhat lovers. But we since we replace the rice with barley and go easy on the spices, its healthier, says the chef.Pocket pinch: Spinach Tortellini is Rs 236, Grilled Baby Bhetki Rs 394Restospeak: Tastes are changing these days and so we think diners would like to try new options this festive season, said one of the owners Sarika Agarwal.A sweet platter at Fern Residency.

So if you feel like exploring how the occasion is celebrated in gods own country, head to the Vishu food festival at GD Blocks Kurry n Kebab.Onam and Vishu are the most important festivals of the state, says Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab. And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis. Lets see what happens this time, smiles Menon."
5aea904e9855b73f522c0ad6,Jagannath Temple: Deserted Anand Bazaar leaves devotees hungry and unhappy,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/apr/19/jagannath-temple-deserted-anand-bazaar-leaves-devotees-hungry-and-unhappy-1803502.html,2018-04-19,"Hemant Kumar Rout ByExpress News ServicePURI: Generally a picture of hustle and bustle, Anand Bazaar in Sri Jagannath Temple at Puri wore a deserted look on Wednesday. Considered the biggest open-air eatery in the world where devotees jostle for Mahaprasad every day, the place, however, appeared lifeless on the day.The stalls that sell Mahaprasad and dry prasad were found covered with polythene sheets, while some priests could be seen persuading devotees for dakhina citing that donations on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya can bring them good fortune.Baisi Pahacha, the 22 steps which connect the Lions Gate of the temple to the main premises, was however crowded for sometime as devotees struggled to get khichidi that was being served by a group of servitors.For the last three days, Mahaprasad has not been prepared after a rift between Suar Mahasuar Nijog and the temple administration over unsold Abadha after delay in rituals of the Trinity - Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra on April 16.The body of cooks, which has the sole right of preparing Mahaprasad in the 12th century shrine, demanded a `50 lakh compensation as the unsold Abadha had to be buried as per the tradition.This is perhaps for the first time that devotees were denied Abadha on Akshaya Tritiya which is believed to be one of the most auspicious days in the Hindu calendar. The day also marks beginning of agriculture season and construction of chariots for Rath Yatra.I visit Jagannath temple at least once a month but never experienced such a situation. Whenever I visit the temple, I take plenty of Mahaprasad packed for my family members back home. For the first time, I am returning empty-handed. No one is above the Lord and the law. Whoever is responsible must be dealt with iron hands, said Bhubanananda Sahu, a resident of Patia in Bhubaneswar.Devotees from as far as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, who had come to witness the rituals, were left disheartened too.This is my first visit to Puri and I feel unlucky to have missed out on Abadha. I will stay back for one more day, said Sambhunath Jha, a devotee from Rajasthan. Earlier in 2015 and 2011, a cease work agitation by the cooks had deprived Mahaprasad to devotees. Around 600 cooks prepare Mahaprasad for about 10,000 pilgrims everyday and on special occasions, the number touches one lakh. Nearly 20 quintals of rice and 10 quintals of dal besides other vegetables are used to cook the Mahaprasad daily."
5b2e72669855b74d9fcd4d9b,Animal wrongs,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/animalwrongs-225038?ref=west-bengal-new-stry,2018-04-22,"Paromita KarUNFAIR GAME: (From top) Hunters return to Pakhibaand with a wild boar; armed personnel guarding the road to the forest; a dead rabbit strung from a bunch of spears and axes. Photographs by Paromita Kar9am: We are still a few kilometres from the forests of Lalgarh in Jhargram, where the grand event would unfold. Thousands of people from the bush and surrounding villages would gather in Jangalmahal - the forested belt straddling Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore and Birbhum. It is April 13, another day marked by tribals for a hunt.Hunting is not a rare occasion in these parts. Only a few days ago - on March 27 - the additional divisional forest officer of Midnapore, Purabi Mahato, fell at the feet of Adivasi elders to dissuade them from going inside the forest. It might disturb the tiger, she had pleaded. Some hunters went back, but many others didn't.A full-grown Royal Bengal tiger had strayed into these forests, but where from the authorities hadn't been able to ascertain. Camera traps installed by the WWF-India had confirmed the visitor's presence in early March. Subsequently, there were attempts to catch the big cat - in order to move it to a more suitable habitat - but in vain. Two guards even lost their lives in the line of duty, although their deaths were due to suffocation inside their car and not because the beast had mauled them.9.20am: We are passing through the village of Pirakata. There is a lengthy procession of devotees. Most of them are children. They are balancing on their slender shoulders bamboo sticks with earthen pots hanging from either end.Further down the road, flanked by fields, are a couple of open trucks, fitted with loudspeakers. They are playing Bambaiya filmi music. Groups of men, bright red and pink ribbons tied around their heads, are hanging around, enjoying the festive air. Their pots of sacred water peep out of the trucks. There are others riding bicycles with their holy contraptions. A little dilution in rituals and traditions never hurt anyone, after all.9.45am: The metal road eventually gives way to a red one. An armed guard signals us to stop. He briefly surveys the inside of the car, while his two female associates sit under a neem tree a few metres away.10am: We enter the forest. Deeper. Deeper. The more it closes in on us, the more we become aware of our diminutiveness. A different set of rules and equations play out in shades of green and brown, suffused with the humming of insects, each a pitch of its own. It is as though the scorching heat has turned on all the sounds and smells. The scent of eucalyptus sometimes spews about distinct, through the glowing sal. At least, there is not much dust... only small and big puddles on the brilliant red earth.""These parts are khoni, khoni (treasure),"" cries out Arabinda. He is part of the team of young conservationists visiting the forest. ""The last time I was here, I saw the most beautiful sight - a pregnant wolf slinking away."" Lalgarh's forests are still home to the wild boar, rabbit, fishing cat or baghrul, which is the state animal, the Bengal fox and others. But Arabinda knows that the organic alliances that make up this precious forestland are under serious threat. ""The deer, pangolin and porcupine... shob shesh, wiped out,"" he laments.GROUND ZERO: (From top) Young Adivasis with their hunting equipment; womenfolk preparing handiya; a snack of the leftover rice and chilli powder; Badal Hansda, who was injured by the tiger, at Midnapore Sadar HospitalTwenty minutes down the road, we spot the first hunter. He is past his prime but rugged and strong. In one hand he holds a borsha (spear fitted to a long, sturdy bamboo). An axe rests on his shoulder. The man is, however, in no mood to speak to strangers, or even acknowledge our presence as we stop the car and roll down the windows.A few minutes away, in a small clearing, we come upon a hunting party. There are about 20-odd men, some sitting on a broken culvert. They haven't chanced upon a kill yet and speak with caution, as if not wanting to let out the secrets of the task in which they excel. Some of them are from Jhitka, a tiny hamlet on the forest outskirts; others are from villages further away. They are headed to Pakhibaand, where hunters from all directions are supposed to assemble after killing their trophy animals.The name Pakhibaand brings to mind an image - a textbook image of an expanse of water with birds fluttering on top. Is it someplace where birds come down for a vacation? No one can tell. Not even Hembrom, the old man who waves at us for a lift. He is 86, has only one arm and is carrying an axe. But you don't look your age, I say. He replies: ""I have three cows; the milk keeps me strong and able."" And then proudly adds, ""Today you will see what an Adivasi hunt is all about; come with me."" And the missing hand? ""I was shot at... years ago,"" he says. No further explanation offered.A few empty vans rest along the bumpy path. The mud houses - with roofs of tin and asbestos - appear abandoned, with not a soul near them. Only the calls of a myriad birds ring about, as if to remind that they are watching.Everyone is where the action is. The shikar utsab is a big draw - in spite of the strict laws against hunting - and even non-Adivasis of the area and those in far-off villages and towns participate in it.10.30am: All along the way, there is no sign of any regulation. At Dherua village, the forest department's beat office is small and insignificant. ""Sometimes the authorities put up barricades - simply, bamboo sticks thrown across the kuchcha path - that serve as a signal, however weak, for the incoming trucks and vans to stop. None of that seems to be in place today,"" rues Meghna Banerjee, a lawyer by profession and wildlife activist by passion. ""I had intimated the additional principal chief conservator of forests about the event, and he had assured action would be taken,"" she adds.A few days ago, the divisional forest officer of Midnapore, Rabindranath Saha, too had said that hunters come in from as far as Bankura and even neighbouring Odisha. ""March 27 is part of their annual events calendar,"" Saha had said. ""But in our eyes, it's hunting and prohibited by law... Efforts are on at various levels to bring change, more so at the interface of technological advancement and the younger generations.""Most wildlife conservationists, however, say that the efforts are not enough. ""The number of hunting events has increased over the last many years, in a clear departure from the original calendar,"" points out Banerjee.11.15am: Pakhibaand is an open-air stage teeming with people, who have turned it into a makeshift bazaar. Chopped sal branches have been dug into the dry ground and strung over with tarpaulin sheets to create patches of shade. Women are sitting under these with huge hindalium vessels full of handiya, the local brew. The air is thick with the pungent-sweet smell of fermentation. Some of it is in the final stage of preparation. ""Khaabey?"" asks a woman, laughing, as she squashes clods of rice and strains the liquid through a piece of cloth.Some folks are frying alur chop, some selling bidis and biscuits, and yet others minding mounds of spicy gram and jhuri bhaja.11am: Evidently, most of the crowd has gathered to cheer and partake of the spectacle. About a hundred metres away, through a wide crack in the earth, runs a trickle of muddy water. Some are scooping up the water in bowls and plastic cans.The hunters have spread in all directions, says old man Hembrom. They will be back here after they have got their kill. And then, you will not find even an inch of space to stand on, he boasts. Later, we learnt that the turnout that day was over 10,000.One of them, a particularly chatty 30-something, takes it upon himself to set out the happenings around us. Our desi dogs are very smart, he says, patting one that lies at his feet. He describes in detail how they make excellent watchdogs. They also know exactly which (wild) hen to pounce on, but will never even get close to a boar. Wild boars can be tough game, and can even kill a man. A couple of hunters injured themselves that day.Our man continues. I am a Muslim fellow. I have been driving a van for seven years now, bringing hunting parties to this place. Sometimes they pay me, sometimes they pay for the petrol, he said. Then edging closer, adds, We are such good friends, we can even die for each other.11.45am: We resume our trek. We are now going deeper into the jungle in search of the hunters and the hunted. Our young companions are determined to note as much as they can. To me, however, the sheer enormity of the arena is overpowering, and appears to render such efforts futile.After an hour of dodging low hanging branches, frogs, geckos, nests of red ants and what not, I have given out very strong signals, to stop. Hereon, two members continue on their way, while three of us wait. I settle on the warm dry floor, in an effort to keep myself above water. The breeze is surprisingly cool in my face, perhaps because I know what the forest heat is like. In that concurrence of time, place and action only my sense of hearing seems to work, and how!There is the distant but intermittent dhook dhook, which someone suggests is from a faraway sound box. There is an assortment of birdcalls  to warn, ridicule or entertain, I cannot tell. Then there is the sound of shuffling feet and hushed voices  hunters keeping an eye on us.Phone connectivity is an idea under construction, and sustenance sips off a pale orange energy drink. When we stray from the set path, a sinister sound checks our steps  the sound of trees being chopped.1.50pm: After about two long hours, we are back at Pakhibaand. By then the smell of handiya has grown much stronger and the buzz louder. Many of the revellers are lying on the ground, unable to move, but perhaps a big part of their being is in another realm.The men are trooping in with the dead animals tied to their bows and arrows, spears and axes. As old man Hembrom had foretold, soon there will be no space for us.There is nothing that the jungle hasnt given us, says a man who has come from another village, with two others, on a bike. Why should we be afraid of the jungle?Among the dead animals that day are 15 jungle cats, 30 boars and an equal number of rabbits.3.30pm: We just about begin our return journey when we get the big news. The tiger has been killed. From the beat office at Dherua, where two uniformed guards lie on the grass in the shade of a magnificent tree, we speed in the other direction, towards Chandra village.Earlier in the day, two hunters were injured when their paths crossed with the tigers.The beast was killed by a group of hunters in Baghghora. When those men formed a circle around it and attacked it with spears, it was apparently enjoying a meal  a boar. And to think just then, we were only a few kilometres away.Back in the car and heading home. Something growls making my companions start. I discreetly clutch the handbag closer to my stomach. Which too is growling with hunger. Such a long journey."

Undeterred by the forfeiture of deposits on every occasion, either the husband, or the wife, has been filing nomination for Bengal panchayat elections for 25 years. But intimidation by ruling Trinamool Congress supporters has discouraged them from contesting this year -- for the first time in three decades.The Bagdis live in Dubrajpur area of West Bengals Birbhum district where the ruling party has won all 42 seats of the zilla parishad (100%), 16 out of 19 panchayat samitis (84%) and 140 out of 167 gram panchayats (84%) without contest, leaving the state average of 34.2% seats behind by a long shot.Read: Calcutta HC says division bench will take final call on date of Bengal rural pollsWe are getting old. What will happen if we are beaten up and limbs are broken? We dont have any child to look after us, said Ajay Bagdi, who is in his mid sixties.Its better to be safe than sorry, he said with a sigh.Ajay Bagdi earns his living as a daily labourer. He has contested thrice so far, and his wife twice.The Bagdis live in Hetampur gram panchayat, about 200 km from Kolkata. There are about 1,350 voters in the area.Read: Bengal panchayat polls: Thanks to TMC, the process has turned into a travestyIn a microcosm, the couple captures the spirit of Indian democracy. Last time, Ajay Bagdi contested with the symbol of a mango. He won 45 votes.Though they earn about Rs 3,000 a month, they used to pay the deposit of Rs 150 required for contesting at the gram panchayat level with a smile.The Bagdis would manage to write about four to five graffiti, and would go around the village on foot pleading with the neighbours to vote for him. Often the neighbours would offer them a seat, tea and puffed rice and chat for some time. In 2013, Ajay Bagdi contested with the symbol of a mango. He got about 45 votes.Read: Ahead of elections, Mamata Banerjees TMC takes right turn to counter BJP in BengalTo win or lose is a part of life, and also elections. I wanted to contest this time too, said Madhuri, who is in her early fifties. I am unwell, but still I wanted to visit the block development office to propose the name of my wife. But I could not muster enough courage after watching how blows rained on many candidates, said Bagdi.This time the seat was reserved for women.In 2013, there were six contestants in Hetampur gram panchayat, but this time Swantana Hazra of Trinamool Congress won without a contest. None else could file nomination.This seat is no exception. We are not been able to file a single nomination in 10 gram panchayats in Dubrajpur area. None dared to face the goons of the ruling party, remarked Ramkrishna Roy, BJP president of Birbhum district.Trinamool leaders, however, trashed the allegations. We have not prevented anyone for filing nomination. The opposition does not simply exist. If the woman really wanted to contest then she could easily file nomination papers, said Piyush Pandey, Trinamool Congress leader from Dubrajpur area.Democracy is in danger. The elderly couple is a proof how the rights of the common people has been trampled upon in these elections. They are not even able to contest and the ruling party is boasting of developments and upholding rights for the poor, said Sailen Mishra, the secretary of CPI(ML) in Birbhum district."

The convoy on Thursday morning took break at Fetri near Gorewada in order to protect the elephants from scorching sun, drawing curious onlookers to the spot.The trucks carrying elephants had stopped at Gorewada for feeding, bathing and health check-up. We are taking them for rhino monitoring and patrolling. They will also be helpful for tackling man-animal conflict. We have 13 elephants at Dudhwa camps, said Mahavir Koujalagi, deputy director, Dudhwa, who is leading the group.To restore number of elephants in the camps, Karnataka has come to our rescue by gifting these elephants. The job becomes tougher in Terai region during rainy season when forest is dense, says Koujalagi.He along with one ACF, three foresters, one RFO and three vets, besides 60 others including transporters, drivers, mahouts, caretakers, and labourers are taking care of the tuskers during transit.Apart from trucks carrying the elephants, there are three cars and a jeep for vets and motor pump to draw water. There are water tanks of 200 litres in the truck from which they can drink water. Two trucks carry feed like water melons, sugarcane, green grass, coconuts, and jaggery etc.WWF-Indias senior project manager Ajinkya Bhatkar was present at the spot and coordinated teams visit with the help of Gorewada officials. As per request by UP PCCF (wildlife) SK Upadhyay, our field formations have been coordinating with the convoy throughout the tour. We got water tankers at Fetri and water melons to avoid dehydration to animals, said Bhatkar.The convoy started on April 29 from Karnataka with four elephants from Shimoga and seven from Mysore. It took four days to reach Nagpur passing through Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. It will take another week to reach Dudhwa, says Koujalagi.As there is no shade in Gorewada, we took shelter under trees near Fetri. It is a tough exercise. We bagged the contract to shift the animals. So far, we have shifted 50 odd elephants to places in MP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, said Mohammed Rafi, the transporter.Our biggest problem is not feeding elephants or transporting them but food for around 30 men from Karnataka, who want rice and in Maharashtra and MP, roti-sabji is the staple diet, adds Rafi. Breakfast for all costs around Rs8,000, lunch and dinner even more.This is a classic example of interstate coordination. We have failed to shift elephants from Gadchiroli to Pench to create a permanent rescue unit but UP is transporting elephants all the way from Karnataka by spending lakhs of rupees, said local wildlife lovers."

The play being performed at a theatre in Kolkata.A play written by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, highlighting her governments development initiatives and taking a dig at opposition parties, is now a key part of the Trinamool Congresss campaign in villages in the run-up to the panchayat polls. Around a hundred folk theatre and street theatre groups are performing hundreds of shows in rural Bengal at public meetings and street corners as the polling day draws close.The entire initiative is being overseen by Bratya Basu, theatre personality and the state IT Minister, according to people involved in the project. Avi Chakraborty, who directed the play, titled Jayatu (victorious), said, Bratya Basu gave us the script a week ago. We did rehearsals and then a show, which was videographed. Around a hundred street theatre and folk theatre groups have been chosen (to perform it in different parts of the state). Wehave sent them the CD, which is a kind of guideline for enacting it.Chakraborty said theatre reaches out to people in a more stirring manner than political speeches. A live street theatre or a drama on stage is more appealing to the people, he maintained.Chakraborty, part of Ashoknagar Nattyamukh, a theatre group, said, The play has been kept at 15 minutes and is part of campaign for the panchayat polls. Basu could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Having eight rural characters, Jayatus central theme revolves around development initiatives undertaken by the Banerjee government since 2011. It has songs and poems, narrated by the characters, highlighting initiatives such as Kanyashree (Bengal governments programme for the girl child), Jubashree (programme for the youth), Rupashree (initiative for marriage of young women).Among other government initiatives, it also takes up distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg, free bicycles to schoolchildren, establishment of new colleges and universities in the state.The dialogue speaks about initiatives for minority development such as scholarships for students, stipends for imams, among others.The play takes a dig at the Opposition, mainly Lal Party  or the CPI(M)  and calls the BJP (the party is also called Bharat Jalao Party and Manush Jalao Party in the play) a divisive force. Theatre groups are adapting tunes for the song in the play according to local folk song flavours and traditions.One of the characters highlights the purported danger emerging from a party that wants to divide people on religious lines, indicating the BJP. This is the same party which withdrew all currency, and created trouble for all of us one of the characters says, indicating the demonetisation drive of November 2016. The play speaks about armed rallies during Ram Navami and divisive forces trying to find their feet in Bengal.One character in the play, named Chetri, purportedly representing the Darjeeling Hills, highlights how Banerjee solved the months-long problem in the Hills by travelling there on several occasions to bring peace. Sidhartha Kishore Roy Bhandari, head of the theatre group Kisholoy Natya Sanastha, which has been roped in to cover West Midnapore district, said, We have performed at 25 places in the last three days. We have adopted the tune of Jhumur dance (traditional dance of Purulia) for the main song. We are holding shows at street corners and large public meetings were ministers and party leaders address the people, and also (organising) independent shows.Recalling a show they did in Debra, in Kharagpur subdivision of the district, at 11 on Tuesday night, Bhandari said, The response from the people is tremendous. Representatives in the theatre groups said they hold shows from 8 am to 11 am and then 5 pm to 11 pm in an effort to avoid the afternoon heat. Each group is paid Rs 1,500 per show, and according to people participating in the campaign there is much demand for such plays in the states rural areas.So many requests from villagers and local party leaders are pouring in to perform in their areas. We are trying our best to get some time out and visit most place, Bhandari said. The best about theatre is that we the response from the crowd is immediateit is good.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

As a result of 3,957 hectares of mangroves being deforested between 2000 and 2015, India ranked eighth worldwide for the amount of carbon stock loss.However, since India has been effective in its efforts to curtail mangrove deforestation, it is also among the top 20 for the amount of soil carbon storage in mangrove forests globally.Carbon stock refers to the amount of carbon stored in the forest ecosystem. It helps mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases, which lead to global warming and climate change. Soil carbon  the amount of carbon stored in soil  is the basis of fertility.A study by USA-based think tank Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), used satellite (30-meter resolution) remote sensing data to estimate soil carbon emissions.Our analysis revealed that soil carbon stored in mangrove forests across the world holds more than 6.4 billion tonnes of carbon globally, which is about 4.5 times the amount of carbon emitted by the US economy in one year, said Jon Sanderman, lead author of the study and associate scientist at WHRC.According to the India State of Forest Report 2017 compiled by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), mangrove cover in India was calculated at 4,92,100 hectares, which 0.15% of the countrys geographical area. FSI estimated soil carbon stock for mangrove forests in India to be 3,979 million tonnes. Overall, carbon stock from all forests in India is 7,082 million tonnes.Loss of soil carbon depends on how the land is used. Sanderman said, Deforestation due to wood harvesting or conversion to rice will results in much lower losses of the soil carbon than conversion to shrimp aquaculture or draining, filling for urban development.In India, the study found that soil carbon storage in mangrove forests varied dramatically depending upon location.The Sundarbans in West Bengal have very low soil carbon stocks primarily due to the fact that there is high sediment input from the Ganges River system. A similar system is observed along the west coast of India. Whereas, mangroves down the coast in Tamil Nadu, such as the Pichavaram mangroves, contain almost four times as much carbon in a given hectare of forest due to low sediment deposition, said Sanderman."

(Clockwise from top) Phool Kumari Das, whose husband Anil Das died of arsenic-related cancer, holds their family photos in Madhusudankati village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal; Students of class one in Madhusudankati's primary school; Monotosh Biswas, a 65-year-old farmer, has been suffering from arsenicosis for over two decades.K.R. DEEPAKOn a Thursday morning at the government primary school in Madhusudankati, a village in West Bengals North 24 Parganas district, a gaggle of five-year-olds chatter animatedly in a classroom. A teacher walks in. They stand up and chant Good morning, teacher in a high-pitched sing-song. There is momentary quiet, and the rustle of textbooks being opened, but the giggling and chattering return soon. Its a school scene that is as ordinary as it gets, but behind its normalcy lies a disturbing fact: the bodies of these children contain alarming levels of arsenic  a poisonous metalloid that sickens and kills with chronic exposure. Unlike the adults in Madhusudankati though, the children dont show any symptoms yet.Madhusudankati is a lush green agricultural village about 14 km from the border with Bangladesh and deep inside Indias arsenic territory. About 15 years ago, scientists discovered that the shallow groundwater here had high levels of the mineral: up to 1,000 micrograms (mcg) per litre in places. The World Health Organisations (WHO) prescribed safe level is 10 mcg per litre. When such water is consumed for years, either directly or through the food chain, the mineral damages organs like the skin, kidneys and lungs.The most visible symptom in early years is a classic blotchy pattern on the skin, a condition called raindrop pigmentation. If people showing such pigmentation dont switch to safer water, they develop hyperkeratosis  dark crusts on their palms and soles, which can get infected and make it painful to work. Eventually, the skin can turn cancerous. Simultaneously, arsenic can destroy the kidneys and liver tissue, cause conjunctivitis and affect the lungs, just as heavy smoking does. There are few organs that arsenic spares.Mass poisoningToday, an estimated 10 million people in nine districts in West Bengal drink arsenic-laden groundwater. It is the worst worldwide case of mass poisoning alongside Bangladesh, which has 40 million people at risk. When West Bengals problem first attracted international attention in 1995, a researcher from the University of Colorado compared its scale with the Chernobyl disaster. Today, we know it is worse. But despite the grave warnings from international bodies like the WHO, the West Bengal government has moved excruciatingly slowly to tackle the crisis. A critical shortcoming in its efforts was the delay in realising that mitigation is a sociological challenge, not just a technological one. This is why, even though multiple technologies to filter arsenic from groundwater are there, awareness of arsenics ill-effects remains low. So, people continue drinking toxic water, even when alternatives exist.Madhusudankati is an example of this. In 2013, a farmers cooperative society, the Madhusudankati Samabay Krishi Unnayan Samity (MSKUS), installed a water treatment plant in the village with help from the Sulabh International Social Service Organisation. Today, the plant supplies treated water from a local pond to 500 families and the primary school. However, studies show that despite the availability of MSKUS water, several people continue drinking contaminated groundwater.In August 2017, a team led by Tarit Roychowdhury, an Associate Professor at the School of Environmental Studies (SOES) in Kolkatas Jadavpur University, collected urine, nail and hair samples from the children in Madhusudankatis primary school. By then, the school had stopped using water from its contaminated tube well for drinking and cooking midday meals, switching to MSKUS water instead. Several village families had done the same.Yet, Roychowdhurys team found between 20 and 200 mcg per litre of arsenic in the childrens urine, a sign that they were still consuming the poison. This means the children are still drinking polluted water at their homes or somewhere else, says Roychowdhury.Outwardly, the children seem symptom-free. Arsenic is a silent killer; it takes years for keratosis to show in adults and even longer in children. But there is extensive evidence that children are not immune to internal damage  their lungs, kidneys and other organs are slowly being ravaged. Studies also show that arsenic-exposed children have lower IQ compared to control groups. If they continue drinking this water, they will definitely develop keratosis, says Roychowdhury.Years of neglectIn 1983, a doctor called Kshitij Chandra Saha from the West Bengal Health Services began examining a cluster of patients with skin lesions in the formerly undivided 24 Parganas district. Saha diagnosed them with arsenicosis, the first record of the illness in the Indian subcontinent. In the following years, Saha and epidemiologist Dipankar Chakraborti, the founder of SOES, surveyed more villages. It dawned upon them that they were uncovering a massive epidemic. By 1988, six arsenic-affected districts had been identified along the eastern border of West Bengal. The source of the toxin seemed to be the thousands of shallow tube wells that dotted the region. But there was confusion about why the arsenic was there  some suggested that the metal strainers in the tube wells were leaching the mineral, some thought pesticides were the culprit, and some others thought arsenic-treated electric poles were at fault.The researchers sounded the alarm. They warned the government that people would grow sicker unless they switched immediately to safe water. But the governments first reaction was denial, Chakraborti noted in a paper published in the journal Talanta in 2002. It was a theme that continued for years. The government did appoint committees in 1983, 88, 92 and 93 to examine the problem, but the findings didnt trigger substantial action. Presciently, a member of the 93 committee even resigned, saying schoolchildren were continuing to drink contaminated water because the government wasnt digging alternative tube wells. Over a decade later, researchers are still reporting the consumption of contaminated water by schoolchildren in districts like Malda.After denial in the initial years came some questionable decisions by the government. Even though the State had tested 1,32,267 tube wells for contamination by 2007, the polluted wells werent marked. Instead, the government dug alternative tube wells in some spots and installed filters in some others. Several experts, and the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), advocated that unsafe tube wells immediately be painted red, so that people would avoid them. But there was strong resistance to the idea from the government, says Kumar Jyoti Nath, the chairman of West Bengals Arsenic Task Force, an advisory body. We told them again and again that the scientific truth must be shared with the public. But they said it would create panic, Nath says.UNICEF consultants, SOES, and Nath were also of the opinion that public outreach ought to be the foundation of the governments mitigation strategy. This would mean not just painting wells, but also holding door-to-door campaigns, conducting street plays and distributing flyers about the danger of using contaminated tube wells. Unless this happened, patients would not go to government-run arsenic clinics or switch to safe tube wells. But this did not happen on a large enough scale.Such outreach campaigns would have needed dedicated communication experts, which the government did not have. The West Bengal Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), which is at the helm of the States mitigation efforts today, is manned by engineers. There was no one to advise them on the communication strategy; on how to ensure peoples participation, says Nath. So, the department has always been hardware-oriented. The software has been neglected.Impact on hardwareThis neglect impacted the hardware too. Over the years, countless arsenic-filtration technologies were developed by institutions like the SOES and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute. Some, like SOESs filter, were for household use. This device had two components. This first was a tablet made of an iron salt, an oxidising agent and activated charcoal which reacted with arsenic in water to turn it into a filtrable floc. The second component, a fly-ash filter, would filter out the floc, which would then have to be disposed of safely. But even though the SOES filter and others like it worked flawlessly in the lab, they failed frequently in the field. Several people couldnt figure out how to use them. During an evaluation, Roychowdhurys team found that villagers would use multiple tablets in the filter instead of one, or expose the tablets to sunlight, or let the filter run dry. Such problems plagued community filters too, which were designed for several households. Toxic arsenic sludge was sometimes disposed of unsafely, sent back into the environment, instead of being treated as per protocol. Meanwhile, materials used in the filter, such as bleaching powder, werent stored properly, causing them to lose efficacy. At some point, you realise that the investments in hardware are not yielding returns, because you have not invested in awareness, says Nath.In 2016, a study in North 24 Parganas district, jointly conducted by UNICEF and PHED, found that merely marking tube wells as safe or unsafe and conducting awareness campaigns brought about large behavioural changes. Even if we dont provide alternative safe water sources, just marking tube wells can go a long way in mitigation, says Shyamnarayan Dave, who was a UNICEF consultant to the West Bengal government till 2015. But the State government realised this truth rather late. Almost after a decade of advocacy for awareness campaigns, it officially began painting tube wells two years ago.A geological curseEven as the government struggles to implement technological solutions to arsenic contamination, there is good news on another front. Scientists today broadly agree on the source of arsenic in the Ganga delta, a consensus that didnt exist earlier. John McArthur, a geochemist at the University College of London, explains the science in simple terms. The process is thought to have begun between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago, when small Himalayan rock particles, coated with iron oxide, entered the Ganga river delta. Along the way, these particles absorbed the tiny amounts of arsenic in the river water, like a sponge soaking liquid. These particles were then deposited in layers of sediment, over thousands of years, in what is now West Bengal and Bangladesh.Here, the rocks stayed in a more or less stable state until another actor entered the scene: decaying organic matter, or peat, says McArthur. The Ganga delta was also home to swampy wetlands some 5,000 years ago. The organic matter from these wetlands is now decaying slowly, alongside the arsenic. When the bacteria responsible for this decay come in contact with the iron oxide in the arsenic-bearing rocks, they use the oxygen from the iron oxide for their own metabolism, setting both arsenic and iron free. This is why the groundwater in West Bengal and Bangladesh are rich in both minerals.The free arsenic, buried under the soil, did not pose a human threat until three decades ago. Till then, most Bengali and Bangladeshi homes depended on lakes and rivers for their domestic needs. But some time in the 70s, families switched en masse to tube wells, because the surface water was growing increasingly contaminated, spreading diseases like cholera. In this region, you can get groundwater at depth of a few meters. So, everyone began digging tube wells in their own backyards, says Roychowdhury. This unleashed the underground arsenic.There is uncertainty today on how the geological mechanism of arsenic release impacts policy. Researchers agree that shallow tube wells, less than 150 meters deep, are the worst affected, because they contain arsenic-rich sediments from the Holocene era, when the arsenic arrived in the delta. Conversely, deep aquifers, more than 150 meters underground, are unaffected because they tap into the older Pleistocene sediments. According to McArthur, such deep tube wells can potentially be used for a long time without fear of contamination, as they have been in Bangladesh. The smart money is on the deep aquifer remaining viable for many decades, if not forever, he says.But Roychowdhury argues that even deep aquifers can become tainted with the overuse of groundwater. Such overuse is disturbing the clay separating the deep and shallow aquifers, allowing the arsenic to enter previously pristine waters, he says. His research seems to bear this out. In a study in North 24 Parganas, deep tube wells which were uncontaminated initially saw arsenic levels rise in about five years. If this phenomenon is typical across West Bengal, the governments initial strategy of digging deeper tube wells to replace shallow ones may not even be a good stopgap. Until we stop using groundwater, and focus on watershed management, this problem will remain, he says.Piped dreamThe endgame for the West Bengal government is to replace all groundwater for domestic use with water from the river Hooghly, using pipelines. But there are technical and financial challenges in laying such long pipelines. A senior official from the PHED, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the total cost of providing river water to all villages was an estimated Rs. 100,000 crore, money the government currently doesnt have.This is why the States short-term strategy is to provide Hooghly water to about half the arsenic-affected villages. The other half are to be served by community arsenic-treatment plants. The first part of this strategy has been easy to execute, because West Bengal has years of experience in sanitising surface water. Even though this water is heavily contaminated with bacteria, technologies to remove these bacteria have been tried and tested. For bacteriological quality improvement, we have experience for over 150 years, says Nath. The first water treatment plant in Kolkatta was 175 years old. The problem lies with arsenic-removal technologies, which are still emerging.About 170 such community arsenic treatment plants are to be installed across the State before the end of 2018. This deadline could be tough to meet, given that only 60 plants have been commissioned so far. Moreover, many of the commissioned plants are still operating at low efficiency because of maintenance issues.A socially isolating illnessUntil West Bengal is able to get safe water for all the 10 million at risk, its villages will remain dotted with tragedy. In Madhusudankati, a few km from the primary school lives a farmer, Monotosh Biswas. About 25 years ago, he began showing symptoms of toxicity. Today, his torso, palms and feet are dotted with lesions. A few years back, he developed Bowens Carcinoma, a skin cancer, on his hip. He went to Kolkata to get the lesion removed, spending Rs. 12,000 on medicines. While Bowens Carcinoma is treatable, others in the village have died of more lethal cancers.Between shallow breaths, a sign of arsenic-induced bronchitis, Biswas says his illness has also affected his farm work. The impact of arsenicosis on ones livelihood and the social stigma attached to it extracts a high cost from sufferers, says Kunal Kanti Majumdar, a doctor at Kolkatas KPC Medical College, who has worked in arsenic-affected areas for about two decades now. Wherever I went, I found depression, social isolation and suicidal thoughts. It is not just a health problem, but also a social problem, he says.As researchers fret about tackling the crisis, the schoolchildren in Madhusudankati are untroubled. It will be lunchtime soon. Roychowdhurys team collects food samples from the kitchen, which will be tested. Even though the school water is now safe, the rice and vegetables being used could have been grown in soil containing arsenic. Understanding the impact of this on the children is the teams next goal. So far, we have only tested water and biological samples. Now, we have to test the food, says Roychowdhury. Maybe it will have arsenic. Maybe it wont. Let us see."

Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

He returns 15 minutes and several phone calls later. A slender man of 30, dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers, nursing a gun wound in his leg, Dibakar smiles nervously, saying he had mistaken the occupants of the car for people who had been threatening him. I thought they had come, he says, entering the mud hut with cracked patches and a kuchcha roof, and turning on a television set.The old TV, kept on a stool, was arranged by Dibakar recently to track developments since the violence-ridden panchayat poll process began in West Bengal. Dibakar is a candidate of the BJP, which is contesting all the three panchayat samitis in Lakshmikantpur, located 60 km from Kolkata. He was shot in the right leg when he refused to withdraw his nomination, and has been hiding out here since then along with nine others, all BJP supporters. With fields of grains and pulses spread all across and the lush-green growth around them, Mainan appears a picture of serenity. But tension is running high, and like Dibakar, other BJP candidates of this village have taken shelter in mud houses like the one he is occupying. In all, Magrahat 1 block had 11 BJP contestants in the panchayat polls.South 24 Parganas district has 4,884 gram panchayat seats, of which elections were held on 3,058 seats, the remaining having been won uncontested by the TMC. Between April 3, when the nomination process began, and May 14, there were several instances of violence, leaving more than 10 injured. Dibakar was shot on April 5, when he was leading a group of BJP workers to file nominations. Says BJP district president Abhijeet Das, Dibakar was being threatened to withdraw his nomination. When he refused to do so, a group of TMC goons attacked him and he was shot from point blank range.Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384.Denying this, TMC local leader Subhasish Chakraborty says, Losers always have some excuse or the other. The BJP as a party has no base in South 24 Parganas. As far as Dibakars bullet injury is concerned, it was a fallout of a group fight. They are unnecessarily blaming the TMC. People of Bengal are happy with us and hence they voted (for us). Counting is on today at the Usthi Block Development Office, about 7 km from the hut he is in. But Dibakar says he doesnt dare venture out to check.Bijoy Bayen, 36, who is staying along with Dibakar, says he has picked up cooking since the job of feeding the party mates fell upon him. I had no idea about cooking, but now that we are living like refugees, I have learnt, says Bayen, who adds that he too has been threatened as he is a close aide of Dibakars. Dibakar, meanwhile, keeps switching between news channels, and making phone calls.Around 8 am, TV channels start reporting that some panchayat poll results have come. Quickly, Dibakar turns the set off, and starts reading a Bengali newspaper from among the several lying around.Dibakar explains that he is not too keen to know the results. No one was allowed to vote here after 9 am (on polling day). It was all rigged, counting is just a formality.Shankar Mondal, 29, who has been listening to the conversation, says its too scary to contest on a ticket other than the TMCs in West Bengal. I have been hiding for several days for my survival. I keep moving from one house to another, he says, just before stepping out to relieve himself after tying a handkerchief around his face.Before he has his breakfast around 10 am  usually roti-sabzi  Dibakar offers prayers at the idols of lords Laxmi and Narayan he has placed in a corner. He picks up a party pamphlet lying on the floor, puts some prasad of nakul dana (sweet makhana) on it, and says some mantras. However, this daily puja routine, lasting him around 5 minutes, is disrupted when Dibakar gets a call on his mobile.He answers the phone but keeps silent until he is sure its his family on the other side. They told him once again to stay safe, he says later. Hanging up the phone, Dibakar serves himself breakfast in an aluminum plate. Eating the food, he talks about how great a cook his wife is. Not a day goes by without me eating fish and rice at home, but here we will have chingri maach (prawn) and rice after so many days for lunch today, he says.However, its not safe yet to return home, Dibakar adds. My days start with a call to my family to find out if they are fine and end with sleepless nights.Breakfast done, he again decides to sit in front of the TV to get an update on the panchayat polls. The results of the Lakshmikantpur panchayat samitis come in around 2 pm. All the three seats go to the TMC. Dibakar shows no reaction, saying, None of the opposition parties could station their polling agents in booths on election date. No one was allowed in the vicinity. People didnt come to vote because there was continuous bombing in the area. The TMC took all the seats through rigging.Around noon, Dibakars friend Kali comes with his two-year-old son. As the friends play with him, for a while, tension seems to leave the hut. Meanwhile, the TV is on, updating the count. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 913 zilla parishad seats, elections were held on 579; 354 go to the TMC and only 15 to the BJP.As the day draws to a close, a stoic Dibakar says, I was threatened, received a bullet injury, but none of the top party leaders visited me. Now that everything is done counting too has been completed we are still running from one place to another to save our lives. Local goons of the ruling party are watching us. We are scared because they can easily outnumber us and attack. However, Dibakar asserts, he wont cow down. I have been in active politics since 2016 and will not leave until the Lok Sabha elections of 2019.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo: Subham Dutta)AT SUPURDI in Purulia district, the house of the 21-year-old History (honours) student is known to everyone, not only because Trilochon Mahato was a BJP worker but also because he was the only one in the village to have a computer. However, the BJP had been a recent choice for the youth, who had emerged as the partys go-to man for painting graffiti, and who was found hanging from a tree near his home on May 30. He would always support a party in opposition to the government of the state, and the 21-year-olds 7-by-5 ft room is still adorned with a photo of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi.Just 10 km away in Dava village, Dulal Kumar, 30, died under similar circumstances. The family refuses to believe the police claim of suicide.READ | West Bengal BJP workers death: Then Maoists were after our lives. Now its the TMCDulal, a father of three, and Trilochon may have had little in common, but there was one crucial link that joined them: both had joined the BJP just before the panchayat polls in their Balarampur block, in which the party would go on to win seven gram panchayat sansads, 17 of 20 panchayat seats and two zilla parishads.It was during the Ram Navmi celebrations in March, organised on a big scale by the Bajrang Dal for the first time in Purulia, that Trilochon first got involved with the BJP. Family members, who describe him as a rebel, say Trilochon had been a Congress supporter during the CPM regime, but after the Trinamool Congress came to power, had started focusing on his studies as well as opened a catering business, which was doing well.READ | BJP worker in Bengal found hanging, note left on bodyIn the wake of the Bajrang Dals huge Ram Navmi rallies, many local youths including Trilochon had got swept into the BJP fold here. A large number of them later joined the party just a month before the panchayat polls. Trilochon was made the pramukh of a Booth Suraksha (booth protection) committee.While Balarampur had seen sporadic violence between TMC and BJP, Bajrang Dal workers during the panchayat polls, there was no major incident in Supurdi. The BJP had claimed to have thwarted attempts to storm polling booths in some areas.Trilochons parents Hariram and Pano at Supurdi.

(Photo: Subham Dutta)On May 30, Trilochons body was found along with a message, written on his T-shirt as well as on a paper attached to it, saying he was killed for daring to join the BJP. He had gone missing the evening before.READ | One more BJP worker found dead, West Bengal CID to probePolice have confirmed Trilochon was murdered, but attribute it to personal enmity. Joy Biswas, who has since been shifted out as Purulia Superintendent of Police, refused to elaborate on this, while his replacement, Akash Magharia, declined comment.Trilochons father Hariram Mahato said police were trying to hush up the matter. I know he had no enmity with anyone. He had been threatened by TMC workers. After the BJPs win, there was a victory celebration in the village. Trilochon had played a major role in organising it. Some people didnt like that, he said.Trilochons brother Shibnath claimed he had received a call from Trilochon around 8.15 pm on the day he went missing to say he was being abducted.A heartbroken Hariram, 58, said the family had vested all its hopes in Trilochon, the youngest of his four sons. I work at a shop in Balarampur bazar. Two of my sons left their studies to work outside the state. We spent all we earned on him. We hoped at least Trilochon would study and become someone some day.The evening he went missing, the family said, Trilochon had gone to Balarampur town, about 8 km away, on his bicycle to photocopy some papers for a coming examination. Around 8 pm, Trilochon reportedly called up brother Shibnath to say some people were forcibly dragging him to a jungle nearby.At Dava village, Dulals 29-year-old wife Monika sits in a state of shock holding their three children, Aditya (11), Pooja (9) and Adarsh (7). Like Trilochon, Dulal had drifted to the BJP after participating in the March Ram Navmi rallies, and turned up dead a day after he went missing. He was found hanging from a high-tension wire, about a kilometre his home, on June 2.A team of five doctors did the postmortem at Purulia Sadar hospital. It is clearly written due to asphyxia, due to hanging, antemortem and suicidal in nature, said SP Magharia.Dulals family members and villagers say he could not have killed himself, pointing to the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Said Monika, Would a person leave his motorbike a kilometre away, with the keys in it, and walk all the way to hang himself? Police are lying Why would he commit suicide? He had no problems at home, no financial crisis.She also claimed threats from the TMC. Just a day before he was abducted and killed, local TMC workers had threatened him.According to the family members, on June 1, the day Dulal went missing, he had participated in the BJPs state-wide Thana Gherao programme to protest against Trilochons killing. In the evening, he left with food for his father, who was at the family shop of paddy rice cutter machine about a kilometre away. The family, that is relatively well-off, also owns a ration shop.He was very active in politics and that is why he was targeted. Police took away seven TMC men from the village for interrogation, but no one has been arrested, said Dinabandhu Kumar, a nephew of Dulal.Denying TMC involvement in the deaths, general secretary Partha Chatterjee said on Sunday, The postmortem report (of Dulal) has made it clear it is a case of suicide.

We received the post-mortem report. In the opinion of the doctors, the death was due to asphyxia due to hanging, anti-mortem and suicidal in nature,"" said Akash Magharia, the superintendent of police, Purulia.Bengal BJP leaders contested the post-mortem report and said they would move the high court seeking a CBI probe into Dulal's death.Some local Trinamul leaders this newspaper spoke to said the post-mortem report revealed the truth and exposed the BJP's politics with bodies.Shortly after Magharia's news conference was broadcast live, Trinamul's secretary general Partha Chatterjee said: ""The BJP is left with no political issue now. They are only trying to malign Trinamul, but the post-mortem report states it as a suicide.""BJP national president Amit Shah had condemned the deaths and accused the Mamata Banerjee government of failing to maintain law and order in Bengal.The politics over the death prompted the state government to bring in Magharia in place of Joy Biswas, who was the SP of Purulia till Saturday.The Bengal government also ordered a CID probe into the death of Dulal and another BJP worker in Purulia. A CID team visited Balarampur on Sunday.A senior police officer said the state's response to the deaths was unusual, referring to the involvement of five doctors in Dulal's post-mortem.""I can't recall an incident in which five doctors were involved in a post-mortem. The decision was taken probably in the wake of the controversy surrounding the death,"" said the officer, not connected with the case.According to him, the post-mortem was conducted in record time as the report came on Sunday.Dulal's family and a section of residents of Dava, where he used to live, refused to accept the suicide theory. ""We were a happy family with our three children. He was absolutely normal when I saw him last time on Friday evening. He took food for my father-in-law, who was at our shop in the village,"" said Monika, Dulal's wife.Mahabir, the deceased BJP worker's father, echoed Monika. ""We have a paddy thrashing shop and we sell rice bran. We don't have any financial problems. Why should he kill himself?"" he asked.When The Telegraph visited the village, several residents said they were shocked. ""How can we tell you whether it was a suicide or he was murdered?"" said a neighbour, who refused to be named."
5b2046d59855b70ae8cad01c,Poachers play deadly ivory game in Kerala,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poachers-play-deadly-ivory-game-in-kerala/article24125837.ece,2018-06-10,"On March 29, 2018, another undercover operation led to the seizure of ivory figurines from wildlife traffickers operating in Paruthipally range in Thiruvananthapuram. An investigator said their shine indicated that the statuettes of Hindu gods had been carved recently from fresh tusks.It seemed that after a lull of two years, once again, there was a growing market for magic cures while ivory artefacts also witnessed renewed demand. Since January 2017, forest officers say they have seized more than 50 kg of ivory from traffickers in Kerala. Yet, the provenance of much of the impounded ivory remained unknown. Investigations often hit a dead-end because forest officers, dreading departmental action, were loath to admit wild elephant killings in their jurisdiction.To dodge departmental enquiries, some incorrectly certified that the tusks were from elephants that had died due to natural causes. In 2017, at least three carcasses of wild elephants were discovered by chance in Chithalathu, Nagaranpara and Pariyaram in Wayanad, Kottayam and Thrissur districts respectively.The post-mortem examinations on the decomposed bodies were inconclusive. They were found disintegrated and in at least one case burned, possibly in a forest fire or by wildlife traffickers themselves.Officials say that elephants are vulnerable to poaching in at least 20 forest localities in the State, especially during monsoon. The areas also include forests contiguous to Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.A review conducted by Chief Conservator, Dr. B. S Corrie after the killing of at least a score of wild elephants in Malayattoor, Vazhachal and Munnar forest divisions in 2014-15 helped the forest department map the poorly protected sites.The slaughter of at least 18 tuskers for their ivory in the deep forests had come to light when one of the gang members, a forest watcher who moonlighted as a guide for the poachers, had a change of heart and disclosed the killings.Operation ShikkarK. D. Kunjumons confession on May 21, 2015, to officers in Athirapally forest range had prompted Operation Shikkar, that resulted in the seizure of 464 kg of ivory and the arrest of 73 persons. The probe that unfolded across the country revealed how poachers shot elephants dead on order, hacked their tusks with camp axes and delivered the ivory to Thiruvananthapuram-based middle-men.Thiruvananthapuram is the hub of ivory trade in South India because of its vast pool of traditional artisans who are adept at carving wood, animal bone and also ivory. Traffickers offer them higher wages than what they get for working on wood or camel bone.Operation Shikkar relied heavily on the personal journal of an ivory trafficker targeted a secret warehouse in New Delhi, which had operated under cover of a handicrafts shop.It showed how the poachers led by Aikkaramattom Vasu alias Varattupara Veerappan  a sobriquet the hunter earned for his skilled shooting with locally made muzzle loaders  remained off the forest departments radar for years and ranged freely in dense forests, killing tuskers. It also led to the seizure of 28 guns hidden in forest locations.In the thick of woodsVasus method was to camp in the forest for days with few aides. They survived mostly on dried rice balls to avoid lighting fires. Vasu enlisted the help of tribals and corrupt forest watchers to shoot tuskers. He was then found dead, hanging in a remote pineapple farm in Sindhudurgh district in Maharashtra in 2015, and thereafter ivory seizures dwindled with his collaborators on the run.However, now officials fear that front-persons of Thiruvananthapuram-based ivory traders have recommenced their operations.Officials say the accused have now shifted their operations to Kolkata. Now, a woman from Thiruvananthapuram, who goes by the moniker Calcutta Thankachi heads the illegal operations.She has hired artisans from Thiruvananthapuram to carve ivory and accommodated them in West Bengal. Investigators say that she along with her Mumbai-based associate, who goes by the name Pi Mundi are responsible for the resurgence of the ivory trade.Officers say they have partly responded to the threat by identifying and naming big herds and counting them in their home range with particular emphasis on photographing and documenting tuskers.They also have suggested equipping forest watchers with GPS to track their movements, and placing camera traps and other remote sensors to deter poachers."

However, if the low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal intensifies into a depression, it can push the monsoon current towards Bihar. However, no change has been witnessed in the low-pressure area since Sunday, which means it is stagnant, said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, department of environmental science, Central University of South Bihar and secretary of Indian Meteorological Society, Bihar.Meanwhile, the IMDs Patna office has predicted widespread pre-monsoon rainfall in several districts of state on Tuesday and Wednesday and scattered rainfall from Thursday onwards.Weathermen have attributed the prevailing weather conditions to an east-west trough that runs from Punjab to the centre of a low-pressure area over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.The late arrival of monsoon adversely affects rice crops. Although with scientific advancements, enough awareness has been created on how to save the rice seeds from damage. IMD, weather and agricultural scientists from Bihar have also planned to conduct an awareness programme by the end of June to create awareness about sustainable ways of farming when the onset of monsoon is late. It includes information on certain rice seeds that sustain and grow in less amount of water, Sarthi said."

Speaking at a meeting in Purulia -- once the heart of the state's Maoist zone -- the BJP chief launched an all-out attack on the two-time Chief Minister's government. Bengal, he pointed out, was given a sweet deal by the NDA government in terms of financial packages, still parts of the state does not have clean drinking water or electricity.""BJP distributes rice at Rs 2 a kg. Do the people in Purulia get it? Mamata is busy stitching a grand coalition. We are not opposed to it, but handle West Bengal first,"" the BJP chief said.Purulia is also the state where two BJP workers died over the last month in suspicious circumstances. Trilochan Mahato, 18, was found hanging from a tree, with a note pinned to his shirt. ""This is for doing BJP politics from age 18. Been trying to kill you since the vote. Failed. Today you are dead."" On Saturday, the police made the first arrest in the cases.""More than 65 BJP workers were killed in the violence in Bengal and more than 1,341 workers were injured,"" Mr Shah said, adding that only the ""thugs"" of the TMC are thriving in the state. In the evening, he met the families of the men.Mr Shah, whose party has two parliamentary seats in Bengal, has set an ambitious target for his local leaders. He wants at least 22 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state - and there is no question of any understanding with Ms Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, which happens to be a pet allegation by the state leaders of the opposition Congress and the Left Front.State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh is confident. ""Amit Shah has set us a minimum 22 as the target. We will get many more,"" he told reporters. The state BJP's confidence is likely to stem from the recent panchayat poll elections. The party has outstripped the Left Front to become the main opposition in the state.The gap in BJP-TMC vote share is huge, but the BJP numbers are rising with every election.In the evening, senior Trinamool leader Partha Chatterjee said Amit Shah should pay more attention to his party's government at the Centre and states where assembly polls are due, instead of ""looking at"" West Bengal.""There is a saying that empty vessels make the greatest sound. Amit Shah's speech in Purulia is a reflection of it,"" Mr Chatterjee said."

My wife made besan ladoos and some other sweets for my daughter who was set to leave for the US. We used up all the sugar. While tasting the ladoos, we realised it was impossible to bite into them. When we dissolved them in water, we could see transparent crystals settling down. I complained to the shopkeeper, said Karki.Prof Patil, chair professor of consumer law and practice, National Law School of India University, learnt about the matter and lodged the complaint  TOI has a copy  alleging that the sugar was adulterated with plastic grains.We informed the food safety officer to take action against the manufacturers and sellers involved. We have kept a sample of the sweet for lab test. The matter needs to be investigated further, said Patil. With the family having used all the sugar purchased from the store, theres no way to verify the extent of adulteration Maneesh Singh, proprietor of Krishna Provision Store, said he did not receive a complaint from any other customer. I buy a gunny bag of 50kg of sugar from the wholesale market, he said.However, Patil claimed the shopkeeper had admitted to some problem in the sugar when Karki questioned him.Dr Harshavardhan B, joint commissioner, Food Safety & Standard Authority of India (FSSAI), Karnataka, said he has received a complaint and his officers would inspect the store.If it is settling at the bottom of the vessel, it might not be plastic grains. They would float. We have received over 90 samples of rice and sugar in the past one month and in none of the cases was the presence of plastic grains proven. Testing samples for the presence of plastic grains costs Rs 6,000. The complainant has sent us an email. We will collect the sample and test it further, he said, adding that it could be a case of adulteration."

The procurement definitely will exceed the target this year too,"" the official told .There will not be any impact on procurement, though crop in Punjab, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh has been affected by deficient rain during September-end, he said.Asked about private procurement, the official said a pilot was to be taken up in Jharkhand but the companies have not shown interest and not placed any bids so far.""Wheat is easier to procure. In case of rice, they have to buy paddy and get it milled and stored. Many issues have to be kept in mind...,"" the official added.As per the latest data, rice procurement in Punjab reached 10.86 million tonnes, Haryana at 3.88 million tonnes, Telangana at 9,96,779 tonnes, Chhattishgarh at 3,02,319 tonnes and Uttrakhand at 1,71,098 tonnes so far this marketing year.Tamil Nadu has procured 1,10,771 tonnes of rice, while in case of Kerala it stood at 49,813 tonnes and Maharashtra at 17,880 tonnes in the said period, the data showed.Procurement is yet to begin in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The official said that Punjab and Haryana have completed 60 per cent of the their rice procurement. The buying is underway in other states like Chattishgarh.The paddy is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). State-run FCI and state agencies undertake procurement operation.For the current year, the government has fixed paddy MSP of 'common' grade variety at Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of 'A' grade variety at Rs 1,770 per quintal.The government has pegged rice output to be 99.21 million tonnes in the kharif season of the 2018-19 crop year (July-June), as against the actual output of 97.50 million tonnes in the same season last year.

So if someone says people are dying of starvation, it is untrue. I will not accept it,"" she said at a public meeting here.A section of media recently reported that seven people of Sabar community in Jangalmahal area of Jhargram district died due to starvation.Sabar community is an ethnic tribe, mainly residing in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The chief minister also claimed to have received information about people selling off their quota of food grains.""Every person gets 8 kg rice and 3 kg wheat per month. However, I have come to know that people who don't require the grains sell part of their quota in the open market,"" she said.Last week, during her Assembly address, Banerjee had said that the deaths in the former Maoist stronghold resulted from ""age-related ailments"" or ""excessive liquor consumption"".Maintaining that the West Bengal government gave subsidies and sops to people on all occasions, she asserted that no other state could match up to the welfare programmes run by her government.""The former CPI(M)-led Left Front regime had saddled us with debts.The NDA government, too, takes away huge amount of money for servicing debts.However, we haven't let all that factors affect our schemes.""From birth to death, the TMC government doles out benefits on all occasions, including marriage and child birth. No state in country in on par with the West Bengal government when it comes to sops disbursal,"" the chief minister said.Alleging that the BJP was trying to ""divide people on religious lines"", the TMC supremo sought to know the role played the saffron party during Maoist violence in Jangalmahal.""Hundreds of people died every year from Maoist violence and police action during the period of unrest in Jangalmahal. Where were they (BJP) when people were actually starving to death?"" she said.Maoist violence was largely contained in the rural areas of West Bengal after the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power in 2011.""I had visited all Maoist-affected places, including Lalgarh and Goaltore, where no one dared to tread foot at that time,"" she recounted.Without taking names, Banerjee also alleged that ""Maoists were being brought to Bengal from neighbouring Jharkhand"" to create unrest in the state.She also took at a dig at the Chhattisgarh government for not being able to control the menace.Banerjee's jibe at the Raman Singh-led government came around an hour after eight Naxals and two police personnel were killed in an encounter between ultras and security men in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district.""In Chhattisgarh, the BJP has been in power for many years, but the Maoist violence is still rampant in the state,"" she added."

After day-long campaigning in politically recharged Chambal-Gwalior region including a roadshow in neighbouring Ashok Nagar,presidentwas visibly upbeat of retaining power in Madhya Pradesh despite three terms of incumbency. After staying the night in Gwalior, he was ready to leave for Telangana. Before leaving, he spoke toon burning issues, including Ayodhya, andreiterated the promise of a grand Ram temple. Excerpts:BJP won many seats after you took over as party chief. But yourparty seems to be strugglingto defeat the challenge of incumbency in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Is the prospect of a setback unsettling you?It is fact that rising expectations have increased the vulnerability of incumbents. A long spell in power did impact your performance in Gujarat polls. You have been in power in MP and Chhattisgarh for 15 years now, whereas in Rajasthan you are up against the pattern of politics where the ruling party has invariably lost polls for two decades. Your party is obviously facing a challenge.Do you think the outcome, whichever way it goes, will have an impact on next years Lok Sabha elections?In Chhattisgarh, Congresss promise of a farm loan waiver appears to have helped them. But BJP did not move to match the promise in MP. Was it too late for you to make a similar announcement? After all, you promised and implemented loan waivers in both UP and Maharashtra.Demand for temple construction in Ayodhya is gaining momentum. RSS and VHP want construction to start and now Shiv Sena is seeking to outpace you on that front. Even Congresss C P Joshi has claimed only they can construct the temple. What is the problem in bringing a legislation to clear the way for temple construction as has been demanded by RSS and VHP?How do you see Congresss promises of gaushala, promotion of cow urine products, and Ram van gaman path. Congress has in the past accused BJP of Hindu polarisation by using these themes. Do you think they will use soft Hindutva from now on?But at the same time, Congress leader Kamal Nath was seen in a video asking Muslim groups to ensure 90% turnout of the community?Leaders like Kamal NathBJP quickly pounced upon remarks by Joshi about the non-upper caste backgrounds of Prime Minister and Uma Bharati, and Raj Babbar who brought in PMs mother. It seems you have too many friends in Congress.You have on several occasions said that illegal immigrants like Rohingyas will be deported but home ministry is planning to give them work permits although they will be disenfranchised?There were reports about anger in upper castes over changes in SC/ST Act. Dont you think it will hurt the party in the three states?In Telangana, BJP is suddenly very aggressive against TRS although there was speculation of a friendly fight between the two parties as TRS supported you in Parliament. What is the party strategy in the state?Rahul Gandhi has used his campaign against the purchase of Rafale fighter jets to attack the PMs image of honesty?The opposition has alleged misuse of central agencies and Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal CMs have withdrawn CBIs general consent. Isnt it a threat to the federal structure of the country?How do you justify dissolution of the J&K assembly? The opposition is alleging that if BJP wont rule, it wont let others rule.That is your perception. I know it is shared by others but I dont agree. BJP will retain power in all three states and the outcome on December 11 will enhance PM Narendra Modis stature as a strong and popular leader who will return as PM in 2019 with bigger numbers.There are two terms in political science  anti-incumbency and pro-incumbency. Unfortunately, our media friends focus on just one of them, that is anti-incumbency. We are contesting assembly polls on the agenda of good governance and development. There is pro-incumbency in the three states as people recognise the good work of our governments and want them to continue. We have implemented 129 welfare schemes in these states through which BJP governments have developed a strong constituency and support base. Anti-incumbency is being talked now just as it was invoked to claim that we would lose Gujarat polls badly. But we formed a full majority government. It is time people talked about performers too.Each election has its own dynamic and logic. Local issues and personalities matter a lot in state elections. However, ours is a federal polity and elections are not completely divorced from each other. They even influence each other. These elections will certainly have an influence on voters across the country and of course on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Our federal structure is a factor in governance as well. For example, if you talk about Madhya Pradesh, the speed of growth and development in the first two terms of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government was not as fast as it was in the last five years as central assistance increased manifold after BJP formed government at the Centre. The result of 2014 elections created headwind for BJP in state polls as we scored victories in UP, Maharashtra, Haryana and many more. Therefore, I feel the elections in five states are important for us.There is already a loan waiver in MP. Congress government under Digvijay Singh used to give loan to farmers at 18% interest but Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been giving at 5%. Loan of over Rs 13,000 crore in MP has been distributed on 0% interest. Our government has done a lot for farmers. Huge quantities of wheat and rice being purchased at MSP and now soyabean has also been included in the price support scheme. What Chouhan and Raman Singh have delivered in the past 15 years, none has done that much. In UP and Maharashtra, the situation was different as farmers were distressed after years of misrule.Let me reiterate that our commitment to construct a grand temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya is non-negotiable. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court and lets wait until it is heard in January. However, it should be borne in mind that the case was pending in the SC for nine years and still Congress leader Kapil Sibal went on to demand that the hearing should be taken up after 2019 polls. Lawyers of Akhara, Ram Lalla all have insisted on hearing the case on priority but Congress wanted to postpone it. We are expecting a favourable judgment and let us wait. However, no one can doubt our intentions. Congress should also stop making false claims. About Shiv Sena, we are two different parties although we are in alliance. There is no rift among us on the issue.After 2014, people of the country rejected 21 out of 22 poll manifestos of the Congress. Their manifesto will be rejected again. As far as their embrace of Hindutva is concerned, they are welcome. We have been talking gaushala and all such issues since 1950. We wish all political parties talk about these issues, but not for political gain and only during election season.Not just Kamal Nath wooed a particular community, even C P Joshi (senior Congress leader in Rajasthan) was seen talking about PMs caste and that shows the partys mindset. Congress is desperately trying to reintroduce the politics of appeasement, which has been rejected. People of the country have already suffered a lot but they have seen the true colours of Congress leaders, who were divisive in the past and are again trying to divide society on caste, communal lines.are hell bent on communal politics and appeasement and I am sure they will face the consequences.We dont need Congress leaders cheap gimmicks to boost party morale and our campaign. However, the levels to which Congress leaders are stooping is certainly a matter of serious concern. BJP has pledged to eradicate influence of dynasty, caste and appeasement from the countrys politics. However, Congress is hell bent on reviving them and making them central to the countrys politics. As far as language used by Congress leaders against Modijis mother, it is most unfortunate and highly condemnable.I have insisted on deportation of illegal immigrants settled in the country and I am firm on my commitment. However, there is a process for detection, disenfranchisement and deportation which is time consuming. We also have to abide by international conventions and laws. But we are clear that illegal foreigners are a threat to national security and they must not be allowed to enter. As far as reported work permits from MHA is concerned, I dont think any such initiative has been taken so far.I dont deny outburst of emotions when issues related to caste come to the forefront. However, BJPs main poll plank is inclusive development of all castes and communities. There are schemes of the Centre helping people of all sections. After several days of campaigning, I can say with confidence that BJP is getting support of all castes for its development oriented agenda.There is no question of a friendly fight. We are contesting Telangana assembly polls with full force. In Parliament, TRS had only two options  either to support us or stand with the opposition. They supported us but that does not mean that we are together even in the state.Whether allegations carry conviction or not depend on the image and track record of the person they are levelled against. In case of Narendra Modi, I can say with full conviction that such false allegations will not work as people wont believe it. I challenge Rahul to substantiate the allegations. The Centre has given details of the deal in a sealed envelope in the Supreme Court but Rahul has not done so because his allegations are blatant lies. In MP, they were talking about Vyapam but dropped the matter after the involvement of their own leaders came to light. Congress has no issues against the Centre, therefore, its president is trying to distract attention from core issues like development.What they (Naidu, Mamata) have done is most unfortunate. On CBI, two senior most officers of the agency were up against each other with allegations and counter allegations leaving no option for the Centre but to intervene. Complying with CBI bylaws, the matter related to the director was handed over to the CVC. Where is the scope for allegations against the BJP government. Even in case of RBI, the discussion happened as per the RBI Act, which doesnt amount to interference in independent functioning of the central bank.The decision was the prerogative of the state governor, who rightly dissolved the assembly as horse trading was going on for three days. Even I learnt about the decision through media. The PDP letter for government formation was merely a desperate bid as the letter had no mention of support of the other parties. There was no letter of any group supporting the PDP to form government."

5ce5967be8e3fc56af40d5eb,Revenge of the antique rice grain,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/people/revenge-of-the-antique-rice-grain/cid/1678937,2018-12-16,"As Chinmoy Das tells it, it all began in September 2007. Several districts of West Bengal were flooded. Walking through one such limpid countryside along the banks of the Kulik river in North Dinajpur, Das, a Geography teacher, was surprised to see some paddy crops still standing erect, undamaged.That left Das and his two friends  Sudipta Mukherjee, an officer with the fire services department in Calcutta, and Rupak Kumar Paul, a college teacher  intrigued. Das says, That is the first time we learnt about paddy that is flood-resistant. Thereafter, the three decided to follow up the revelation with some serious research. In due course, they came to know about paddy varieties that are drought-resistant and others that can grow in brackish water.They also learnt that these indigenous or folk varieties with names such as Kalli, Changa, Kochi, Malsera, Kakri, Bahurupi had ceded place to high-yielding hybrid rice, a hot market favourite. Five years later, Das and his friends launched the Forum for Indigenous Agricultural Movement or Fiam, a platform to rejuvenate lost varieties of rice.The first step was finding as many varieties of seeds as possible. One stop was the Agriculture Training Centre at Phulia; it had over 400 varieties of heirloom seeds. The other thing to do was identify individuals with collections.Abhra Chakraborty of Guskara in Burdwan is such a person. Chakraborty works in the state fisheries department but paddy is his passion. He has preserved nearly 440 varieties. He has also cultivated some and taken more land on lease recently to plant the rest.Abhra talks about how seed conservation is a tricky science and has to be done with some art. It needs a lot of knowledge and involvement. I divide my plot into several parts, keeping in mind the time of pollination of each variety. He explains that self pollination does happen but it is not desirable as it compromises the genetic purity of a particular variety.Das has also converted a portion of the 24 bighas of land owned by him for conservation. He has planted a variety of paddy seeds. The thrust of his initiative, Fiam, is to produce more rice of the available variety so that there is enough seed for mass production.He distributes these seeds among farmers, simultaneously educating them about the virtues of indigenous crop. We managed to cultivate 50 bighas of land in 2014; 200 farmers were involved, he says.Ten years on, Fiam has many more stakeholders. Says Das, It is a mixed group. There are those who have degrees in Computer Science, there are English Literature graduates. Many of them have chosen not to leave their native village for urban opportunities. Instead, they have taken up farming and the cause of folk rice.Fresh graduate Tanmay Das of Raiganj district is one of them. He tells The Telegraph, It is a misconception that hybrid varieties give better yield. There are high yielding folk varieties too. Also, hybrids require a lot of chemical fertilisers; this is bad for soil health. Salim Naskar is also a graduate farmer from South Dinajpur. He says, I have come to know about organic farming. I can easily integrate my knowledge about modern farming techniques with the legacy knowledge handed down to me by my forefathers.The vice-president of Fiam is Dr Sudeb Saha, a practicing doctor. It has been 30 years since hybrids took over the market. There is a resurgence of folk varieties no doubt, but it will be some time before they can even begin to catch up, he says."
5ce57b3ee8e3fc56af40c744,Despair in North Bengal’s tea gardens despite Mamata Banerjee’s welfare claims,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/19/despair-in-north-bengals-tea-gardens-despite-mamatas-welfare-claims-1913721.html,2018-12-19,"Alisha Rahaman Sarkar ByOnline DeskOn international tea day, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that her government had allocated more than Rs 1000 crore for the welfare of tea garden workers since coming to power in 2011. Though she didnt share the division, this amounts to roughly Rs 142 crores in welfare handouts per year.But the reality in the tea gardens of the state remains grim.The tea industry is the second largest employer in India. In its ranks are 3.5 lakh workers from North Bengal. Crippled by starvation, unemployment, low wages, inadequate medical facility and to top it off corruption, the lives of plantation workers here has turned into a brewing cup of misery.The picturesque tea gardens in the Dooars region of Bengal spread over Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts account for 330 registered big tea gardens where 186559 families reside.The tea business that witnessed a boom in the mid-1990s is now facing an existential crisis. As per Tea Board data, the number of tea plantations in north India, including in Bengal and the seven northeastern states, had scaled up from 3141 in 1994 to 36836 in 1999. In the Dooars alone, this number went up from 168 to 532 during this period.But the cost of running many of these major plantations shot up and an increasing number of them were shut down over the past decade. This led to many second-generation workers losing their jobs. Uneducated and in search of a living, many turned to breaking stones to make money.Out of the 32 defunct tea gardens across the Dooars, the condition of Nirpania tea garden in Alipurduar is reportedly the worst. Madhu, Bandapani, Dheklapara, Lankapara and Dimdima tea estates have also been shut down for years. With no immediate chance of re-opening, the workers are staring at a bleak future. Taking advantage of their destitution, local contractors, who operate within the closed tea estates, have started exploiting the workers by paying salaries as low as Rs 70 a day.In August this year, thousands of workers finally decided enough was enough and under the banner of Joint Forum of Trade Unions went on strike demanding a hike in their minimum wages.Currently, the prevailing daily wage is Rs 159, whereas the prescribed minimum wages for unskilled agricultural workers in West Bengal is fixed at Rs 244 while the MGNREGA wage is Rs 191 per day.Following a persistent protest, the state labour department on August 29 announced a hike in the minimum wage but the new amount is still unknown. Neighbouring Assam has already proposed a composite daily wage of Rs 351.33 and sought the opinion of tea planters so that it can be finalised.Seeking to get a similar deal in West Bengal, tea plantation workers under the banner of 'Joint Forum of Traders Union' have called for a nationwide strike on January 8 and 9 to voice their demands.Neither the Centre nor the state government is paying heeds to our demands. (The ruling) TMC alleges that the CPI(M) failed to do anything for us, but the present government is also not doing anything. The government is blatantly lying. We dont get ration under Centres flagship programme National rural health mission, which we used to get few months back, rued Mani Darnal, INTUC leader and general secretary of National Union of plantation workers.He says the beautiful landscapes of the hills have been guarding the secret of the state government well. Although Mamata Banerjee has been lauded for her Khadya Sathi (Food Partner) scheme (under which rice is sold at Rs 2 per kg), the starvation deaths in the hills highlight a different reality altogether.Between 2014 and 2015, over 150 starvation deaths were reported in the Dooars and despite the Tea Association refusing to comment on the subject, stray incidents of deaths often pop up from the Bengal hamlets.Ms Banerjee rubbished the reports of deaths and said, her government ensures supply of foodgrains to every single individual and there is not a single person in the state who does not get food. However, contrary to her claims, post demonetisation in 2016, workers in the tea gardens of Darjeeling have on many occasions been left to consume tea leaves in order to appease their hunger. Darjeeling, it must be underlined, alone has 38 registered tea gardens.Not only nutrition, but the tea workers are also deprived of basic amenities such as toilets and access to clean water. Under the Plantation Labour Act of 195, the workers are entitled to basic shelter. However, most of those working in gardens are homeless, shelterless or living on leased lands.Whatever development CM Banerjee has been talking about must have been on paper because, in reality, we dont see anything. Foreign export has tanked and the market rates have fallen drastically. Nobody wants to invest in this business. Only the two Tata and Godrej estates are making profit. There are no proper health or educational institutions, says Raju Nepali, social activist.A sliver of good news is the drop in child trafficking once rampant in the secluded parts of the Dooars. This has fallen since the introduction of state governments flagship programme Kanyashree, Raju added. Under the scheme, underprivileged school going girls are given a cycle to cut down their travel time."
5ce55958e8e3fc56af40b8a6,Is there turkey on your Christmas menu?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/is-there-turkey-on-your-christmas-menu/cid/1679629,2018-12-23,"Sanjit Mondal is mixing something in a plastic tub. Soyabean, bhutta (corn) rice flour, shutki machh or Bombay Duck (a kind of dried fish), seed meal, a mineral and vitamin powder, he rattles off the ingredients list. This is turkey feed and we are at Mondals turkey farm in Sodepur, 20 kilometres north of Calcutta.He continues, This I have to feed them four times a day. They grow very fast; attain maturity by six-and-a-half months and can lay eggs anytime after that.Mondal has been rearing turkey in his four-storey house the past three years. I find him after a spot of reverse investigation. The starting point, a shopping mall advertisement about pre-ordering Christmas meats.Indeed, it is Christmas season and our man is very busy. The turkey is a relatively new entrant to the seasons menu but one that is gaining in popularity. Mondal has just got an order for 100 birds from Siliguri. Some of the other places from where he gets regular orders are Coochbehar, Calcutta, Malda and North Dinajpur.People seem to think this meat is healthy, at least that is what Mondal has gathered. He says, The market in West Bengal is still premature. The demand is low and prices are high. And that perhaps explains the presence of the shy quails, the robust desi roosters, jet black Kadaknath roosters and plump ducks on his farm.The longish hall on the first floor is partitioned into several netted enclosures. One enclosure is chock-a-block with 50 turkeys  there are two more enclosures on the second floor, I am told. The gaggle of birds are most odd-looking. Pale pink head, somewhat like a bald pate, a long neck  part pink, the rest black  and body covered with jet black plumes with white trimmings.There is one of the flock that stands out though. A handsome bird that struts and swaggers from one corner of the enclosure to the other, occasionally stopping to preen. It is quite obvious that he is upset with the advent of inquisitive strangers into what is his private space. He rolls his eyes and the pink of his neck and chin appears flushed  from displeasure, most likely. Mondal cannot say if it is a gobbler (male) or a hen. It is difficult to tell them apart till the birds are about six months old. These birds are younger.The TelegraphMondal, who has been into livestock farming for many years now, bought his first batch of turkeys only three years ago. I got 55 birds at Rs 600 each from Midnapore. But after that I decided I would breed eggs on my own, rear birds and sell them myself. That way, it is more cost-effective. Today, he also manufactures and sells the breeding apparatus.He talks excitedly, quite knowledgeably  clearly no one has had a turkey conversation with him before. No, he cannot say what triggered the turkey farming trend. The bird is not native to India; there are two breeds available here  one from Holland and another from the US.But Mondal holds forth confidently on other specifics  how a turkey is not banquet-fit, in terms of size as well as taste, unless it is at least eight months old. That is when it weighs eight to 10 kilos. More facts: by the time a bird is two years old, it is full-grown and weighs about 20 kilos, the average lifespan of a turkey is 13 years, and so on and so forth.Mondal says a female bird lays about 100 eggs a year but makes an impatient mother-to-be; wont warm the eggs diligently, leading to a lot of wasted eggs.The birds are also apparently most quarrelsome, especially the male of the species. Says Mondal, During breeding season, when we put both the sexes in the same enclosure, the gobblers are forever pecking at each other. We have to be careful. It is not easy to prise them apart. I have lost a couple of birds this way.And has he ever cooked turkey meat himself? Mondals expression relaxes for the first time. Smiling and a tad shy, he says, Yes. Once during Vishwakarma Puja. We cooked it just like we cook chicken kasha (a dry dish). But later someone who lives in the US told me this is not the way to cook a turkey. And then very swiftly his expression changes and he says earnestly, But you know, it didnt taste bad this way either. It was quite good, in fact. In India, curry works."
5ce53b5ee8e3fc56af40ad9e,Mamata Banerjee: Centre making false claims on crop insurance,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-centre-making-false-claims-on-crop-insurance-5511152/,2018-12-26,"Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Wednesday accused the Centre of making false claims of providing crop insurance to farmers in West Bengal.AdvertisingAddressing a public meeting at Mandirbazar area of South 24 Parganas, Mamata said the state government has paid 80 per cent of the insurance payout.The Centre takes away our taxes and gives back a pittance. There is a crop insurance scheme for farmers. How much does the Centre pay? It pays Rs 20 out of Rs 100 and we give Rs 80. The state government gives 80 per cent of the cost. If we can give Rs 80, we can give the rest also. We do not need their pittance. We transferred the amount to the banks and now the Centre is taking credit for it and spreading lies, she said.Explained Measures positive, impact depends on implementation By promising measures such as increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for paddy and dealing with issues regarding middlemen, TMC is attempting to portray a farmer-friendly image ahead of election season. An agricultural expert opined that both moves are positive, especially the decision to rein in middlemen. However, the success of the measures depends on how well they are implemented after the time for poll rhetoric is over.Accusing the Centre of not being serious about addressing the farmers distress, the chief minister claimed her government has taken a lot of initiative for farmers, including raising the MSP for paddy.AdvertisingWe have waived off mutation fees and khajna tax on agricultural land. We have given financial compensation to farmers for natural disasters. We are procuring rice from farmers at Rs 1,750 per quintal (from Rs 1,550 per quintal last year). We are starting a new system  dhan din, cheque nin (give paddy, take cheque) and setting up more procurement centres in interior areas, she said.Reacting to Mamatas comments, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said, The state government has done nothing for the farmers here. They only claim they have done a lot for them.Mamata slammed the BJP for allegedly committing atrocities on members of the minority community and Dalits.Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress chief also announced government jobs to family members of three of her party workers who were recently killed in South 24 Parganas."
