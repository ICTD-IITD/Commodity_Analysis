58fcf1567be9e06c93711b50,Paramilitary forces in Bengal on the edge of outburst,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jan/13/paramilitary-forces-in-bengal-on-the-edge-of-outburst-1559299.html,2017-01-13,"KOLKATA: In the light of a second paramilitary jawan uploading a video highlighting the discrimination faced by them in terms of pay, ration and treatment and a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawan killing four of his colleagues in a fratricidal shootout in Bihar on Friday, the paramilitary forces stationed in West Bengal are not immune to the ongoing cauldron.With a troubled past during the height of Maoist insurgency from 2008-11, more skeletons are likely to tumble out of the closet in the ongoing crisis in the paramilitary forces, fear many associated with the forces.Though the ration provided to the paramilitary forces depend largely on the local availability and the needs of the personnel, discrimination is rife. The para forces in the northeast region are, Border Security Force (BSF), Shasastra Seema Bal (SSB), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel stationed at the Indo-Bangladesh border, Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders and the former Left Wing Extremism affected districts of Jangalmahal in western West Bengal.""We are the first line of defence at the eastern borders of the country, to check illegal immigration and stop cow smuggling. The Army is largely confined to the Eastern Command Headquarters and thebases in Panagarh, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and a few other places. Still, our pay and ration are not at par with Army,"" said a BSF official on the condition of anonymity.As north Indians dominate the three paramilitary forces in the state, rotis are more common than rice that is the staple of the local populace. Non-vegetarian food is generally served once a week and chicken is more preferred than fish, a source said. However, a lot of local Bengali recruits work in the paramilitary forces, more specifically in the BSF and the CRPF. According to their dietary needs, rice and fish are also provided, the source added.However, the central and state paramilitary forces in West Bengal had witnessed a period of intense breakdowns, fratricidal killings and open protests during the peak of Maoist insurgency in Jangalmahal from 2008-11. Psychiatrists feel that may return if the issue is not dealt with care.""CRPF jawans stationed in guerrilla war zone have to deal with a lot of psychological pressure. If that is not assuaged by giving them a sense that they are being taken care of -- by providing good food, healthcare and of course better pay -- we should be ready to witness periodic bouts of outbreak of anger,"" said psychiatrist Manoj Bandopadhyay, who has extensively studied the psychology of soldiers conducting counterinsurgency operations.The Maoist attack on a camp of West Bengal Police's paramilitary force, Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) at Silda in Paschim Medinipur district in 2010 that claimed the lives of 24 jawans opened a can of worms.Alleging discrimination in provision and facilities, the families of the jawans refused to allow the bodies to be taken away from the EFR headquarters at Salua in the same district and blocked the road, preventing any West Bengal police official to enter the camp. The then Inspector General (IG) of EFR, Benoy Chakraborty, covering his face with a black cloth in protest, had told the media about the discrimination his soldiers had to face in terms of pay, rations and other benefits. He was given a showcause notice for his 'masked presser' but no action was taken against him.Finally, the then Left Front finance minister Ashim Dasgupta, on behalf of the then Chief Minister and Home Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, had to visit the camp and placate the families after speaking to IG Chakraborty.Since then, a high wall with concertina wires has been erected around the EFRheadquarters, the pay of the soldiers increased and quarters where the families of the soldiers live have been freshly painted. However, not all issues have been resolved.""Besides Centre taking care of BSF, SSB and CRPF, the West Bengal government must make sure that the demands of the anti-insurgency STRACO force based in Jangalmahal are met. The force is made up of local boys who get much lesser facilities than EFR, leave alone WB Police. Though insurgency has waned, these local jawans are the ones who have prevented the reentry of Maoists from Jharkhand and that means a lot of pressure, which may burst if not fizzed out with better perks,"" psychiatrist Ajay Biswas said."

58fcfc677be9e06c937128d1,Rice prices touch boiling point across Kochi,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/jan/28/rice-prices-touch-boiling-point-across-kochi-1564255.html,2017-01-28,"KOCHI: The shortage of Jaya and Surekha -- two popular rice varieties from Andhra -- has triggered a 40 per cent spike in their prices in the last four months, pinching the pocket of the common man.The bad news: The shortage will continue till April, the next harvest season in Andhra.It is estimated that the two rice varieties are consumed by around 70 percent of the states population where rice is the staple diet. They arent able to supply the rice varieties even at a higher price, said Hari Sharma of Lalitha Mills, a leading rice dealer. He attributed the shortage during the season to the sale of rice by Andhra rice merchants to the Food Corporation of India (FCI).The state consumes about 38-40 lakh tonnes of rice per annum and Jaya and Surekha varieties account for at least 22 lakh tonnes of the total consumption.The reason for the shortage in Andhra Pradesh could be the drought conditions prevailing in the region, or an artificial scarcity created to jack up the prices, reckoned S Leena Kumari, project co-coordinator (Rice), Rice Research Station, Moncompu, Kerala Agriculture University.The prices of the two varieties, which lingered around Rs 26-27/kg range during Onam last year (September), has spiralled, touching Rs 38/kg.While Jaya variety is preferred in the southern parts of the state from Alappuzha to Thiruvananthapuram, Surekha is the most sought after variety in Ernakulam and surrounding areas. Hari Sharma said there was sufficient supply of other grades of rice such as Kuruva, Swarna and Cherumani which are priced lower at Rs 23-24/kg.We can supply as much of Swarna rice as we want, but theres not much demand for the variety, he said. Swarna is sourced from West Bengal. People in north Kerala have cultivated the taste for Kuruva and Kranti rice varieties, he said.C S Saresh of SA Enterprises, a rice dealer, said a major reason for the increase in prices is the increase in transportation costs. The lorry charges have escalated from Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.09 lakh in the last two months as the return trip carrying plywood from Kerala has come to a halt, said another dealer."

The villagers claimed they have become refugees in their own country yet again. This is not the first time that these people, mostly bidi workers and daily wage earners, have been displaced by the mighty river. It has been going on for the last three decades. The 120-km stretch of the right bank of the Ganges -- from Farakka to Jalangi in the district -- is especially prone to erosion.The displacement due to river bank erosion took place mainly in the districts Suti, Raninagar II, Bhagobangola II and Lalgola blocks. Speaking to The Hindu, the locals said that that if river embankments were set up in between the dry season, from March to July, the displacement could have been minimised. But West Bengal irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that the protection of river banks was the Centres responsibility.Now we are just refugees in our own country. I had to spend the winter living in a temporary shelter with my family of seven. Even the lives of stray dogs are more valued than us, said Golam Hussain, a labourer and a resident of the Char Krishnapur Bhagobangola II block, who has lost his house for the third time since 1989.Habibur Rehman, a resident of the same village was seething in anger when narrating his ordeal. He said that if the Ganges swallowed his land again, he will have no choice but to squat on others land.About 120 km away, in the Kamalpur area of the districts Samsherganj block, Akhtar Hossain (56), a bidi binder by profession, tried to swat away the flies hovering over a plate of stale rice as one of his neighbours told him about the river bank erosion in other parts of district. The Ganges is yet to strike Kamalpur after the last monsoon. But the river is just within a few hundred metres away from our makeshift huts, he said. His family got displaced seven times in last four decades as the Ganges swallowed their house and land.Speaking to The Hindu , irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that the state government was yet to asses the damage due to the latest river bank erosion. Currently we do not have the figures relating to the number of people who got displaced after the river bank erosion. We are in the process of assessing the damage, he said. Pointing out that the prevention of river bank of erosion came under the Centres jurisdiction, he said the state had written to the Centre several times about the issue, but they are aloof."

Representatives of a consortium of 26 primary cooperatives formed by Consumerfed are currently holding negotiations with Food Corporation of India officers and rice mills in West Bengal, Surendran informed the Assembly on Tuesday.The negotiations are expected to conclude by Thursday. The consignments will arrive by March 10, he said. Consumerfed had difficulties in procuring rice from Andhra Pradesh as mill owners were reluctant to supply rice due to delay in payment in the past. The agency had run up massive dues, forcing mill owners and middlemen in Andhra Pradesh to cut off supply.The LDF Government has paid Rs 52 crore to 241 suppliers after assuming office. The ar rears now stand at Rs 157 crore and steps are being taken to clear the arrears, Surendran said. Also, the shortage in supply of Jaya and Surekha, the popular varieties in Kerala, prompted Consumerfed to knock at West Bengals doors.Even as rice prices were climbing past Rs 45 per kg, the minister informed the Assembly the hike in rice prices was a national phenomenon. In Andhra Pradesh, the prices ranged between Rs 46 and Rs 49 per kg, while in Gujarat it stood at Rs 30-34. The prices ranged between Rs 29 and Rs 32 in Uttar Pradesh.

Prices of the Jaya variety have shot through the roof in Kerala in recent week, reaching record levels. As the government admitted in the states Assembly, rice prices have shot up by 21 per cent in the state. And the reason for this is the reduction in rice arrivals from Andhra Pradesh.Andhra Pradesh has begun exporting rice to Africa and the other southern states, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, have increased their procurement of rice from Andhra. As a consequence, prices of Andhra rice varieties have risen.With the Pinarayi Vijayan government facing heat on the rice price issue in the Assembly, the Kerala government hurriedly arranged to buy 1000 tonnes of rice from Andhra Pradesh. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation has finalised a deal with Andhra traders for supply of 1000 tonnes of Lalitha brand Jaya variety rice, Kerala food minister P Thilothaman.As per the deal, Kerala will get the rice for Rs 39.50 a kg. It will be sold in Keralas subsidized outlets at Rs 25 per kg and for Rs 41 in the free sale market.Concurrently, Kerala civil supplies officials are frantically knocking on the doors of West Bengal traders to place urgent orders. The Kerala State Co-operative Consumers Federation Limited (Consumerfed) is conducting the negotiations and the first consignments from West Bengal are expected to arrive in Kerala by March 10.In the Assembly, the Pinarayi government continued to be pilloried over the rice issue.

58f508237be9e018510a1e5b,Bengal opens farm trade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170303/jsp/bengal/story_138748.jsp,2017-03-03,"Calcutta, March 2: The Mamata Banerjee government today amended the agriculture produce marketing act to allow the entry of major private players in the trade so that better prices were ensured for commodities produced by farmers. But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

The PACS have been asked to procure rice from Consumerfed depots. The rice being procured from West Bengal will cost Rs 27 for the cooperative societies. But the cooperatives will sell it at Rs 25 to economically weaker sections, he said.The Rs 100 crore-consortium set up by the Consumerfed and cooperative societies has given orders for 2,500 tonnes of Suvarna rice from West Bengal. Of this, 800 tonnes has already reached the state and is ready for distribution. The remaining 1,700 tonnes will be ready for distribution by March 10.The Minister said cooperative societies with prior experience in the sale of rice and essential items have been selected for the market intervention. The focus will be on the coastal belt and hilly regions where the price rise has affected people the most. Five kg of rice will be given to each family in the initial phase and the same will be increased to 10 kg per week. It will continue until the prices come down in the open market, the minister said.Surendran said it was the handiwork of a group of Kollam-based rice agents who consistently work towards unrealistic price rise in the domestic market.The consortium members went to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The unprecedented summer has led to price rise of brands like Jaya. The price of original Jaya rice per kg in Karnataka is Rs 36. It was in this background that the team went to West Bengal and identified Survarna rice, which is almost similar to rice varieties popular in Kerala, he said."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

Bishnu Kumar Chhetri, the secretary of Kalimpong Krishak Kalyan Sangathan that filed the PIL against the agricultural marketing department of the state government on March 24, said local farmers were incurring financial losses in the absence of a regulated market here. Chhetri said the proposal for the regulated market had been mooted way back in 1975, but the construction of the complex was completed much later in 2005. ""However, even after the completion of the complex and its subsequent renovation in 2012, it functioned only for a brief period. In November last year, the government constituted a 10-member market committee with GTA secretary as the chairman, but the panel does not have a single local farmer or trader as member, which is against the provision of the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (regulation) Act, 1972,"" he said. Chhetri has prayed for an interim order reconstituting the market committee with proper representation of local stakeholders and early operation of the complex. ""In my PIL, I also challenged the transfer of the market complex to the GTA, which the state government did in November 2012."" ""Local crops like cardamom, ginger, orange, vegetables, broom, rice and millets worth close to Rs 1.5 crore are traded annually.

Diversity of culture creates demand for different kinds of eatables, fruit, flowers, dress material, ornaments, artefact etc for a variety of services.The Koya tribe of Khamam district make delicious bamboo chicken. They stuff chicken pieces mixed with spices inside a piece of bamboo and bake it on fire. Once it is baked, chicken is served to tourists. The Koyas in around 300 habitats collect honey, gum, custard apple, medicinal plants and make bamboo craft.Many of the Koyas live near Panashala, an exotic tourist spot on the bank of the Godavari river. Their origin dates back to the Ramayana age. Here, the governments job is to provide safety to tourists and protect the Koyas from exploitation by the traders and middlemen.Thousands of villagers in Madurai district collect herbs for agents who supply bulk quantity herbs to big companies.

Ten years ago, the tiny jeera-size Katrani rice of Jagdishpur block of Bhagalpur district cost Rs 300 per kg. Today, it is facing extinction. Water is the lifeline of the village.Over the years, thousands of rivers across the country have lost their stream, disappeared in the maze of unplanned realty sector growth and aggressive deforestation. Millions of fishermen across the country lost their jobs and villages lost their productivity. According to the Ministry of Water Resources, a total of 85,807 water bodies in the country are not in use, out of which 8,152 have totally dried up. Give the farmers their water bodies and they will double their income within three years.Baispur of Puri district was a vegetable belt where farmers produced variety of vegetables with organic fertiliser. Vegetable traders in order to have monopoly over the local producers, marketed vegetables from West Bengal, Ranchi and Chhattisgarh at a cheaper rate which had made vegetable farming in Baispur unsustainable.When the villagers left vegetable farming, the traders increased the price again. Here the role of the state government was to check the unscrupulous practices. Over 800 years, the Muslim artisans of Pipli have been making applique umbrellas, banners, fans and flags for Lord Jagannath temple of Puri. Thirty years ago, those artisans used to make more than 60 intricate stitching patterns on clothes.Today, one can come across a few artisans who can create such artistry. This is the main reason why applique work loses its popularity in global craft bazaar. There is need for a proper environment to turn enthusiasm and skill into income generating activities."

Except for vegetables, no produce is arriving at the APMC yard. Similarly, transportation of vegetables from the yard to neighbouring states is unhindered.Supply of tur dal from Kalaburagi, Bidar and Gujarat, bengal gram from Madhya Pradesh, and rice from Raichur, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal has been stopped. In the same way, the transportation of horse gram from the yard to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other states has been stalled. There is no change in the supply of water, medicines, milk and vegetables. However, over 1,500 trucks have been parked at various places, including the truck terminal at Bandipalya, Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed and at the Old RMC yard.According to sources, the truck owners have refused to lift cement and fertilisers from the Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed, 230 loads each, which have arrived by goods trains on Saturday. Goods Shed Lorry Owners Association president Abdul Khader Sahid said, they have received requests to lift the loads, but the association has clarified that the loads cannot be lifted until the demands of reduction of insurance premium and RTO fees are fulfilled.Sources said, the supply of gas (LPG) will not be affected in the city. LPG is supplied to the city from Mangaluru through pipelines. So, the truck protest will not have any effect on the LPG supply, said the sources. However, Petroleum Distributors Association S K Dinesh said, the association is morally supporting the protest. If the governments do not fulfil the demands, petroleum tankers will also join the protest, he said.In-charge Deputy Director for Food and Civil Supplies C L Anand said, the stocks of provisions, slated for distribution in fair price shops to ration card holders, is sufficient for April month quota.

Often they are reduced to a mere statistic.But they only wish for a better life and want nothing more than a chance to earn a living.Express met some of these migrant workers and found out what keeps them going in a state far away from home and where people speak an unfamiliar tongue. Everyone acknowledged that language was a big barrier, but that with time, they figure out how to work around it. As many of them work with others who speak Hindi, it fosters a sense of family and belonging.The people in Chennai are very nice but not knowing Tamil is a huge problem, said Rabi Marandi (24) from a village in Jharkhand. There are about two-three others from my village who work with me here and the rest of the people too speak Hindi. But who doesnt miss family?Many of these workers have to live in rooms built of tin or asbestos sheets. During the summer, this can be like a microwave oven as six-seven people share a room.Chennai is extremely hot during summers, said Mohammad Isa of West Bengal who has been coming to the city the last seven years. I dread to come here during this period but what can I do? The work seems to be here. It isnt that there is no work in West Bengal, but it is not regular work.If I had the ability to work in my home town and provide for my family, why would I leave to come here? said 39-year-old Jitendra from Gorakhpur. I have been coming to Chennai for the last 10-12 years. I miss my wife and children terribly and I have to speak to them at least four-five times a day.For 33-year-old Rintu Sheikh from Kolkata, being separated from his three-year-old daughter for months is heart-breaking. I am missing out on watching my daughter grow, Sheikh rues. I just keep pacifying myself that I am doing this so she has a better future. I have four more months to go before I go home and I cant wait to see how much she has grown.Food too is major barrier for migrants from up north. For people used to a staple diet of rotis, rice is a big change. While many of the workers said they made their own food, some confessed they did not have the time or facilities to cook. For those from West Bengal, sweets were what they missed the most.Chennai just doesnt match up in sweets, declared Isa. In my village, my neighbour used to make sweets every day out of fresh milk. I think about it and start drooling!Up close and personalRam SinghAge 23He has been working as a painter here for the last eight years. He is from Gorakhpur, and has a thick Bhojpuri accent. While in Chennai, he relies on some Tamil words he has picked up over the years, and sign language to communicate with non-Hindi speaking workers. I stay with others from UP in a room in Neelankarai. so language isnt a problem, he quips. Its almost like living with family. But if there was work in UP, I wouldve preferred to stay there. He watches movies on his phone in his free time. He cannot stop gushing about popular Bhojpuri actor Dinesh Lal Yadav. I watch at least three films a day, he beamed. I just watched Andaz Apna Apna for the nth time! I dont like Hindi films these days though, and watch Bhojpuri films because they have everything  action, drama, romance, songs.Sumitra Maity Age 37She seems demure at first. Her petite frame could fool anyone, but the 37-year-old woman from a small village in West Bengal works in the scorching heat all day, helping men with construction work. Earlier, she used to make mats but when her husband, Srikantho Maity, met with an accident, a lot of money was spent on his operation. Making mats could not generate enough income for the family. This is the first time Ive left home, she rues as her husband translates from Bengali to Hindi. It has been an experience. While I am happy that I am with my husband, I really miss my daughters. One of her girls is 16 and is married, while the other is 12 and stays with her in-laws in her village. She missed being around women as there is only one other woman at her construction site.Bablu KumarAge 24It isnt just construction workers who flock to Chennai for work. There are those who engage in other work, like Bablu Kumar. A vegetable seller in UP, Kumar (24) becomes a kulfi and ice-cream seller in Chennai every year from Pongal till June. He has been doing this for over 10 years. I would have sold vegetables here also but I dont know Tamil so that is a problem, he said. Selling kulfis in the summer makes sense. I generally go from Neelankarai beach till Thiruvanmiyur beach as most people who buy from me are beach-goers. He does however make a special stop everyday around 11:00 am at a construction site where there are others from UP. I come to this site every morning, he said. I have friends who I can speak to in my language and that feels very good."

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will lay the foundation stone for a dharmashala, the second to be built on the premises by Infosys Foundation, at a cost of Rs 60 crore.Chemotherapy may last weeks, months or years depending on the severity of the case.For the benefit of patients and their attendants, the municipal corporation funded the first dharmashala, the Sri Venkateshwara Dharmashala, in 1984 which accomodates 400 patients. The Infosys Foundation sponsored the second dharmashala a few years later with the same capacity. Now, a third one will be constructed.There are cancer patients from North India who have to stay here for as long as one year for radiotherapy. There are already two dharamshalas, but they are inadequate. The new facility will have a capacity of 300 people. The construction will take nearly a year, Kidwai authorities said.On Saturday evening, a music performance for the patients was under way at Sri Venkateshwara Dharmashala. It is a part of what we call devotional therapy, to take the patients mind off cancer and chemotherapy. We have donors coming to perform, distribute fruits, clothes, buckets and other necessities, said on-duty nurse Dakshayini V.The dharmashala has three floors with a dormitory hall for male and female patients that costs Rs 100 per week, while single rooms with no bathroom cost Rs 200 and single room with attached bathroom costs Rs 300. The patients and their attendants are served three meals a day.Venkatalakshmamma (82) has uterine cancer and hails from Chikkabalapur. Her caretaker daughter Gayathri queues up to collect their share of steaming porridge, rice and sambhar. We have a BPL card so its free for us. The facilities are good here.

The government sourced rice from West Bengal and the issue was solved. The price of rice in the open market plummeted. Only branded and packaged rice was sold at more than Rs. 50 a kg as alleged by the Opposition.He said ration shops would be modernised.

With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"

Express Photo by Partha Paul Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. Express Photo by Partha Paul50 years ago, on May 25, an uprising in this North Bengal block changed the politics of the country, and continues to agitate it. But where it all started, the original rebels have little strength left against a new breed of landowners, the land mafia, allowing BJP a foothold in its ideological battle against the Left. Esha Roy goes to the ground.In March 1967, after years of oppression by landlords, the peasants of Naxalbari village in North Bengals Darjeeling district rose up in revolt, in one of the countrys most defining uprisings. Under Charu Majumdar, Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal, the Naxals, as they came to be known, seized land from the jotedars (landlords), grains from their godowns and distributed it among the peasants.The State retaliated by torturing villages, leading to May 24, when thousands gheraoed a police party at Jharujote. Inspector Sonam Wangdi was killed, three officers were injured. The next day, at Bengai Jote, 11 villagers, including eight women and two children, were shot dead by police. The firing would trigger an armed guerrilla resistance that, 50 years later, continues to inspire other such movements in the country, including in neighbouring Nepal and the Maoists. Today, as tea workers pick the First Flush of Darjeeling in Naxalbaris lush tea estates, the blood bath is a distant memory.Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)As the CPI (ML) Liberation and other fractured smaller Left parties prepare for the 50th anniversary of the uprising, the preparations are low-key. The headlines have instead been hijacked by the BJP, after its president Amit Shah chose Naxalbari to begin his tour of the five states where the party is yet to make his mark including, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana. Addressing party workers, Shah said, This is the place where violence had started. Now this is the same Naxalbari where Modijis Sabka Saath, Sabka Bikash slogan can be heard. I have full faith that development will defeat the violence.On May 29, says Naxalbari block BJP president Dilip Barui, the party unit will be inducting 220 new members. Asserting that the party presence in the region once dominated by the Left is steadily growing, Barui says, Local leaders and workers from the CPM, Congress and TMC from Naxalbari, Matigara, Bagdogra, Batasi will be joining us.Barui also points out that in the last panchayat elections, held in 2014, the BJP won one or two seats in every panchayat. In the 2016 Assembly polls, its candidate came in third, close on the heels of the TMC. While the Congress-CPM joint candidate won, the BJP leader says the gap is closing. This is a Left-dominated area. But people know there is no point supporting the Left any longer. The BJP is the future.Abhijeet Majumdar, the Darjeeling district secretary of the CPI(ML) Liberation and the son of Charu Majumdar, says there is more to the BJP campaign than the tussle for Naxalbari. Amit Shah knows that there is only one faction that can stand up to the huge Hindutva surge in the country. After the BJPs victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections, he did not celebrate. Instead his statement was that the BJPs golden era would come only when Bengal and Kerala are taken. He knows it is only with the death of the Left that Hindutva can flourish in the country.The six gram panchayats that make up the Naxalbari block are a patchwork of old tea estates, but now there is a new rush in the air. The National Highway that cuts through the area is being widened to a six-lane road, flyovers are being constructed, hotels and flashy malls have sprung up. And once again, real estate is at a premium.However, unlike that time half a century ago, with its call of Langor jaar, jamin taar (land belongs to those who till it), the battle for land today is more insidious. There are no loud protests or gunfire as the new breed of landlords, the land mafia, mops up chunks. Mani Mahatos 22-year-old primary school for tribal children in Jharujote, a stones throw away from where Inspector Wangdi was killed, shut down in 2011. Well-respected in the area, he no longer teaches, instead selling chaat from a small stall.Mahato recalls how they had all got land after the 1967 movement. But several years ago, people claiming to be descendants of our landlords came, propped up by the land mafia. The mafia told us to give up our land in return for compensation. They also said we would have to fight long-drawn battles in court. We were all scared. So most of us gave up our land. I got Rs 2 lakh for my 1.5 bighas, he says.Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul)He adds that many descendants later turned out to be fake but, when the real ones came, they too struck a deal with the land mafia. The mafia has been selling off land to people from Manipur, Nagaland and Shillong. Nepali families who cant buy land there have come here to settle down. The land grab means that members of the 50-odd tribal families who live in the village and had tilled the land earlier are now daily wagers. Most people have left. They have gone to Kerala, Gujarat and Chennai in search of work, Mahato says.He admits he supported the BJP candidate in the last panchayat polls (he lost by a mere 40 votes). The CPM did nothing for us, nor did the TMC. When they first came to power, I thought maybe this new party will help. We have tried the Congress, the Left, the TMC. Let us give the BJP a chance.Among the early members of the Naxal guerrilla force was Kandra Murmu, 62, who continues to live in Bittan Jote, once a part of the Naxal liberated zone. Like his village, his life is sedate now. Hailing from a family of bhagchashis (share croppers), Murmu tills his one bigha of land. He used to grow paddy, now he grows jute. His son helps. But the battle for land has returned.Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul)When the andolan was over, Charu Majumdar made sure we all got land. Jotedars were eliminated and we got pattas. But it turns out that in legal government documents, the land still belongs to the landlord. I registered my complaint to the panchayat but nothing changes, he says. After a pause, he adds, Its not possible to take up arms again. That atmosphere is just not conducive.Murmu joined the Naxals when 12, and spent many years underground. He is sad at the fate of the agitation he gave some of his best years to. If it wasnt for Naxalbari, zamindari would still exist in the country. But farmers still dont have land rights. It is a different kind of battle now, more difficult. But the government and the political parties are self-serving.Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. We have received reports of this. But the government has issued pattas to tribal families to cultivate these plots and if they are selling these on their own volition, there is nothing we can do, she says, adding their hands are tied without a complaint. We have come to know plots are being sold to outsiders at Rs 3-4 lakh a plot. At some point, we will take action, she adds.Shanti Munda, 74, one of the most well-known faces of the Naxalbari movement, who joined the protests as a young mother with her newborn, says the situation is the same in her Hathighisa village, neighbouring Naxalbari village. There are no jobs here. People cant eat. In order to sustain themselves, they have sold off their land. As many as 16 tea gardens have shut down in the Dooars. In this area alone, four tea gardens have shut down. The government says it is providing rice at Rs 2 a kg for the affected tea garden workers. But you need to be able to earn to even pay that Rs 2, she says.Munda, who unsuccessfully contested the local elections in 1982, winning just 3,500 votes, adds that Modis people keep visiting her. They came one-and-a-half months ago, just before Shahs visit. They said, We will do the work here, what you tried with the bullet, we will bring with the ballot. Another time they came to me and said that they would construct a new village at Hathighisa, make it a model one.Nantu Ghoshs family has owned a Hero cycle dealership for over 35 years in Naxalbari town, which is like any other flourishing Indian town. Rows of shops selling electronics, garments, sweets, furniture jostle for space. The town was never that affected by the Naxals, Ghosh says. There is a BSF camp here, so they mainly steered clear. Nevertheless there was an atmosphere of fear.Now, the 60-year-old believes, the Naxal movement is finished for good. Nothing good can happen in India. There is so much corruption, all parties are the same. If the Naxals couldnt bring about changes, nobody can. We have a Congress MLA here but he won because of the alliance with the CPM. But the Left is waning too. We feel that if there is a party that can compete with Mamata Banerjee now, it is the BJP.Ghosh understands that much of what parties do is petty politics. But adds, The Naxal leaders are all dead Kanu Sanyal died in abject poverty. In this day and age, one has to look after ones family, you have to survive. You cant be a revolutionary.Naxalbari Sharada Shishu Tirtha Vidyalaya was established in 1999 by RSS swayamsevak Sujit Das, who is also the schools Pradhan Acharya (principal). It began as a single rented room in Naxalbari village, but by 2002 had amassed enough funds to buy a two-acre plot in a quieter part of Naxalbari town. The school now caters to 539 students, mostly from Rajbongshi (SC) and Adivasi (ST) communities, and has expanded up to Class VIII. It is one of the largest primary schools in Naxalbari and Das says the aim is to grow up to Class X. He says he has applied for registration with the Education Department. When we started, Naxalbari had just one government higher secondary school and some private primary schools. People wanted to send their children to school. They just didnt have anywhere to send them, says Das.Apart from regular schooling, the students learn yoga, moral science and music, where they are taught patriotic songs. Das says they are encouraged to eat vegetarian food.At shivir camps at the school, children stay for two-three days to learn the correct lifestyle, and are also taken to tribal areas and tea gardens to distribute clothes and food to the underprivileged. We have many such social activities. When Panighata tea garden shut down, we provided food to the 11 tea garden families for a month and a half, says Das.It helps that about 60 per cent of North Bengals votes lie in its tea gardens. Das is also the advisor to the RSS shakha which operates in Naxalbari town. While he does not reveal numbers, he says membership to the RSS is growing. Seventeen of Naxalbaris young swayamsevaks just left for Muslim-dominated Malda district for a camp.The Left realises the danger it is facing. Outside the office of the CPI(ML) Liberation, a large sign says: Resist the onslaught of BJP-RSS combine. As part of the Naxalbari Golden Jubilee Celebrations, the CPI (ML) Liberation has planned marches and a large public event at Siliguri, where Communists from across the country are expected to come. Seventy-five cultural activist troupes from across the country will perform.Sitting inside, beneath photos of Left icons such as Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong, Abhijeet Majumdar, laments that the Left remains disjointed to take on the BJP onslaught. Right after the BJP came to power in 2014, we held a Central Committee meeting in Delhi. We resolved that keeping in mind that the BJP had a corporate-fascist agenda, it was imperative that all the Left parties come together and form a united front. We even invited the Aam Aadmi Party. The first person to respond to this was Prakash Karat. But the initiative remained still-born.The vice-president of the TMCs Darjeeling district unit, Amar Sinha, insists they are not worried about the BJP. In Naxalbari, the BJP is basically the RSS. They are playing their usual dirty communal politics. We conduct awareness campaigns, explain to people what this is. No doubt, some are swayed by the BJP. But many are not.West Bengal Congress general secretary O P Mishra calls Shahs visit nothing more than good optics for the BJP. The Congress-CPM combine is strong here. Mishra also claims that the land mafia in the area is controlled by the TMC. Naxalbari is close to Siliguri and located at the foothills of Darjeeling. So the land prices have been going up. This is being exploited by the land mafia. But when the administration and police are partisan, it becomes difficult for us to do anything. With the tea gardens shutting down, the economic situation has worsened, making people more desperate. Shanti Munda says it may be too early to write the Left obituary. People believe that the Naxals are irrelevant, this is not true. It is not over yet. We will be back.Agrees CPI(ML) general secretary Partha Ghosh. Our numbers may have come down, the Naxals may have been wiped out, but every one who resists is a Naxal  the student in JNU who stood up to Smriti Irani, the Maruti factory worker who resists oppression, those in the movements against POSCO.To read this article in Malayalam, click hereFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI Photo) The animal markets are meant for farmers and not for traders, Jaitley said, adding that this is the only effect of the notification. (Source: PTI Photo)The row over beef eating and cattle trade kept the political cauldron astir on Thursday despite Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys attempt to calm frayed tempers by insisting the new central notification will not interfere with state laws on slaughtering animals. Following several days of protests, particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Jaitley told a press conference in New Delhi that the ban imposed by the Centre on sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter had nothing to do with state legislations.The animal markets are meant for farmers and not for traders, he said, adding that this is the only effect of the notification.Every state has its own legislation or no legislation (with regard to slaughter of cattle). You have provision in the Constitution Article 48 (Directive Principles) which says that certain category of animals have to be protected, Jaitley said.Prohibition of cow slaughter mentioned in Article 48 of the Constitution is not an enforceable article, but a Directive Principle of State Policy.West Bengals feisty Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been at the forefront of the oppositions attack on the ban, added a new twist to the row, claiming the Centre was planning to omit buffalo from the abmit of its notification to favour certain people close to BJP involved in trade of its meat.Some people close to the BJP are involved in the buffalo meat trade and that is why, they (Centre) are planning to allow the slaughter of buffaloes, she told a public meeting in Tarakeshwar in West Bengal.Assailing vigilantism in the name of cow protection, she said,The BJP has got only 29 per cent of the votes, but they are trying to bulldoze the entire people. Who are they to decide what one will eat? Who are they to decide what one will wear? It is a matter of personal choice.Notwithstanding Jaitleys attempt to pacify those angry at the ban, a top leader of the RSS, the BJPs ideological mentor, denounced beef parties being organised to protest the Modi governments measure as against humanity, and suggested that they should change their ways.Those who are doing this (hosting beef parties) are just a few in the population of 121 crore. They do not represent the opinion of the nation. Their act is against humanity and they should change their ways, veteran RSS leader Indresh Kumar told a press conference at Jaipur.Cow milk is healthier than beef. Milk is medicine while beef makes you prone to diseases. People should understand this and not eat beef, Kumar said.There also was a bit of political churning in Meghalaya where a senior BJP leader, who had announced a beef party in his hometown to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modis three years in office, resigned from the party.BJP district president of Garo Hills Bernard Rimpu Marak, who had joined the party last year, was understood to have been asked to put in his papers. He, however, claimed his resignation was to protest the BJPs stand on beef.In the interest of the Garo people, I have put in my papers today as a mark of protest against the partys stand on beef, Marak told PTI.I have resigned because I am a Christian and a Garo first. Steps taken by the party, especially in the Garo Hills, are not in the interest of the people, he said.Marak had in a Facebook post yesterday said the BJP in Garo Hills will organise a bitchy-beef party to celebrate three years of Modi government. Bitchy is a local alcoholic brew made from rice which is consumed during festivals.Reacting to Maraks post, BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli had told reporters that the party will either sack him or ask him to tender his resignation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Source: Indian Express) The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and affects children. (Source: Indian Express)The first case of Japanese Encephalitis in the city this year, detected in a ten-month-old baby, has put the health department on high alert. This is the second such case in the state. The infant, who hails from Kondhwa, is in a stable condition and has been admitted to a private hospital in the area, said Dr Kalpana Baliwant, in-charge of the Insect Control Cell at the Pune Municipal Corporation.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that the serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and primarily affects children.However, Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, These are sporadic cases and our surveillance network has been able to pick up the cases. The first one was from Raigad district and the second case this year is from Pune.The virus that causes JE is transmitted by the culex species of mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields as well as in water-logged areas of urban regions. The disease has assumed epidemic proportions in pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal, with sporadic cases reported from Maharashtra.According to Awate, the problem-prone areas in Maharashtra are Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia. Last year, 12 cases of JE, and one death due to the disease, were reported from the state; two of the cases were from Pune.As many as 100 houses around the society at Kondhwa have been surveyed for the culex mosquito, said Baliwant. We conducted the container surveillance for the last four days and have not been able to find the mosquito. The parents had taken the baby to Mumbai 10 days ago, and its likely that the infection was picked up from there, she said.Awate said field officers from the state entomology section had carried out their own survey. We are waiting for the report but in all probability, it is a sporadic case. Most JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms. However, one in 250 infections result in severe clinical illness, according to the World Health Organisation. JE is a serious virus infection resulting in the inflammation of the brain. The disease is characterised by the onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, coma, seizures and spastic paralysis, he said.This year, 111 JE virus cases and 20 deaths have been reported from across the country. A majority of the cases are from UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. Last year, there were 1,676 cases and 283 deaths in the country, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.Meanwhile, PMC officials have urged local residents to take preventive measures and ensure there are no mosquito breeding sites nearby. While carrying out the container survey PMC officials found the dengue causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito breeding site at a swimming pool in the same society. We have slapped a fine against them, said Baliwant.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

From 2010, we have been working to improve the lives of farmers by providing good quality seeds, advisory services, agrichemicals, micro irrigation and even buyback service. Our objective is to make farmers prosperous, Mr. Sharma said.The seeds business is now into research and development in a big way. Last year we introduced our first hybrid corn seed and we have just introduced our first hybrid rice. This year, five more rice seeds will be introduced, he said.The companys seed potato business is undertaken by Mahindra HZPC, a 60:40 JV between MASL and HZPC of Netherlands. We have got approvals for nine new varieties of seed potato which we will introduce within the next three years. he said. The agrichemicals business has grown five times in four years, he said, adding the focus was now on biological chemicals.On the output front, the company operates the edible oil business in West Bengal, pulses in Maharashtra under the brand name NuPro, dairy business in MP and Saboro Lounge in Mumbai under Saboro (which stands for taste in Spanish). The fruits business too operates under the Saboro brand.MASL, Indias largest grapes exporter, last year acquired Netherlands-based Origin Fruit Direct which has distribution chains in Europe and China. With Origin Fruit Direct we [also] got sourcing access from South Africa, Chile and Peru.The company now plans to foray into value-added products such as curd, yogurt and lassi in its dairy business. We may look for acquisitions in that space, he said."

Insiders, however, recalled that the name of Kovind, along with that of Droupadi Murmu, was all along on their mind since they were picked by the prime minister to occupy the Raj Bhavans in Patna and Ranchi two years ago.A soft-spoken Kovind made it a point to call on veterans L K Advani as well as Murli Manohar Joshi to take their blessings after his name was announced. On the day of his nomination, Kovind held on to the hands of Advani and Joshi to show everyone that the seniors, who could have felt left out of the race, were also supporting him. Finally, Modi too was seen holding Advani's hands as cameras clicked away.Shekhar Iyer, New DelhiQuick planThe Opposition is already rattled by the JD(U)s support to BJP Presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind. Therefore, it was no surprise that the parties did not want to leave anything to chance when they met to choose their candidate on June 22. While Uttar Pradesh-based parties SP and BSP were in a tight spot because Kovind hails from the state, NCP chief Sharad Pawar was wavering on whether to announce a candidate on the same day.Opposition leaders were still uncertain if all their plans would fall in line when they turned up at the meeting that decided Meira Kumars candidature. It was then that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury came up with a plan  get the signatures of the leaders of 17 parties on Kumars nomination papers at the meeting venue itself before venturing out of the room after the press conference.Shemin Joy, New DelhiSharmishtas strikesPresident Pranab Mukherjees daughter Sharmishta Mukherjee has not minced words in criticising West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her governments mishandling of the Darjeeling agitation. Blaming her for triggering a huge crisis during peak tourist season in the hills, she reminded the chief minister that the language issue had to be handled carefully. In a newspaper article, Sharmishta recalled several instances when row over languages even led to creation of a new country, like Bangladesh, and trouble over Hindi left a divide in the south in the 1950s and 1960s.Sharmishtas piece has come as a surprise to many. Only two months ago, Mamata was not averse to backing her as a Rajya Sabha candidate from the state if the Congress nominated her. Considering that West Bengal CM has had close ties with her father, Sharmishtas criticism of Didi has set tongues wagging. So far, Sharmishta had confined herself to Delhi politics. But is she considering her home state of Bengal for future course of action?SI, New DelhiRice blackmailWith rumours of plastic rice spreading on the social media, the owner of a hotel in Chennai claimed that a few persons, supposedly from the media, threatened to spoil the image of his restaurant if he did not take care of them. Two persons argued with Kumar, the restaurant owner, and said that the food they had bought from his restaurant was of bad quality. The hotelier apologised and returned the money. However, the duo returned that evening with two others, who claimed that they were from the media. They said that the rice used by the hotel was plastic rice.Though Kumar reasoned with them that even the government had clarified that there was no plastic rice, one of the mediaperson started bargaining. He demanded money from me and threatened that if I fail to offer, he would publish a news against my hotel, Kumar said. It was only when Kumar said he would lodge a complaint with the police, that the four left the place.R Sathyanarayana, ChennaiSenas recordVeteran Congressman Narayan Ranes son Nitesh Rane, had taken a dig at the Shiv Sena by writing to the Guinness World Records to feature a place in the record books for the most repeated threats to withdraw from a government.

He walks 4 km down the hill, crosses the Relli river to reach the nearest blockade at Relli Bridge, some 10 km south from Kalimpong town, to join other protesters of various political parties.We gather by 5.30 am as people in the hills start day early. Blockade enforcers who commute from as far as 8-10 km are allowed to come in their motorbikes. We take turns every day to maintain a register of emergency vehicles who are allowed to pass through our blockade but only with valid pass from Gorkha Janmukti Morcha party office, Rajen said.Blockade enforcer Pemba Sherpa does multi-tasking at 7th mile bridge blockade, 5 km from Kalimpong. I give water bottles to participants of political rallies, stop and verify each vehicle passing through our blockade and also counsel intoxicated youth who try to create ruckus and bring bad name to the Gorkhaland movement, Pemba said.Though the blockade enforcers know that many of the hill residents defy the shutdown by commuting to Siliguri and other parts of the hills during the night, when blockades are abandoned, they plead helplessness because of the family they have to run.I have to cut grass for the cattle and milk the cows after sitting the entire day at the blockade. The family has to run despite the blockade. Every one of us has to work back at home due to which, we return at dusk, said 7th mile blockade enforcer Roshan Rai.When no vehicle is passing their blockade, the enforcers engage in long discussions about the events of the hills. We are not against Bengalis or Mamata Banerjee. We just want our own state. Look at the glory and money of our neighbours in Sikkim and then look at our poverty despite us being more enriched in natural resources than Sikkim, said Relli blockade enforcer Tenzing Bhutia.On the other hand, the blockade enforcers vow not to vandalise vehicles in response to vandalising of Sikkim vehicles in Siliguri. Several Sikkim vehicles were vandalised and Sikkimese people harassed in Siliguri after Sikkim chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling wrote a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh extending his support to Gorkhaland statehood.Those people (vandals in Siliguri) are actually strengthening our movement by attacking the people of Sikkim. We dont want to bring a bad name to Gorkhaland movement by copying them, said Relli blockade enforcer Bikash Chhetri."

(File Photo) Operators of trucks that ferry goods from Siliguri to Sikkim called an indefinite bandh on June 30 to protest the alleged attack on Sikkim-bound trucks by anti-Gorkhaland protesters. (File Photo)The Sikkim government is set to take the West Bengal government to court for losses it incurred because of the Gorkhaland agitation in Darjeeling.Government representatives claimed that ever since the protests began, the West Bengal government and its police have deliberately prevented supply of goods to Sikkim, stopping trucks from entering the state because of the support Sikkim  including its Chief Minister Pawan Chamling  has shown for a separate Gorkhaland.National Highway 10, which connects Siliguri in North Bengal to Gangtok, is the only highway that connects Sikkim to the rest of the country and serves as the states lifeline.Sikkims lone Member of Parliament P D Rai, speaking with The Indian Express, said, We are planning to approach the Supreme Court next week. The circumstances which have been created are unconstitutional. Our food supply and all other essential goods coming to Sikkim have been stopped. In Siliguri, many of our trucks carrying essential goods have been stopped by police in civil clothes, while uniformed police have looked on. Just because we have a particular stand, which has been a known stand for many years, this is being done.Rai said that such disruptions have taken place routinely due to the shared highway with West Bengal, but the past 20 days  since the agitations began  have been particularly bad. Over the past 30 years, Sikkim has incurred losses worth Rs 60,000 crore due to such disruptions. We want the West Bengal government to make good on these losses, he said, adding that in the past 20 days alone, the state has incurred losses of Rs 200 crore.Till the day before Mamata Banerjee decided to hold her cabinet meeting in Darjeeling, there was not a single room vacant in any hotel in Sikkim. But since then, there is not a single room that is occupied. Our economic losses have been huge. Disruptions and agitations will occur, you cant prevent that. But the highway should have been protected by paramilitary to ensure that essential goods reach us. Yesterday, areas in north Sikkim ran out of rice and pulses; we have shipped these items to them today. There is no problem with organic vegetables or dairy in the state, but we import our cereals, and this has been hit. There is no cash in ATMs either, said Rai.Operators of trucks that ferry goods from Siliguri to Sikkim called an indefinite bandh on June 30 to protest the alleged attack on Sikkim-bound trucks by anti-Gorkhaland protesters. Groups of youths protesting the division of Bengal allegedly vandalised two trucks in Dhupguri and New Jalpaiguri, and another in Siliguri carrying milk supply for the Indian Army, on June 30. Tanker associations have also stopped supplying fuel to Sikkim.Very soon, our medical supplies will run out. We are sandwiched between two agitations  for and against Gorkhaland. The West Bengal government needs to pay up, said Rai.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0b40f79855b76bf13cd781,Why Indian farmers are distressed?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/info-nomics/why-indian-farmers-are-distressed/,2017-07-07,"On the eve of Uttar Pradesh (UP) election, Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi promised if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins then farm loan will be waived. BJP won, and the farm loan was waived-off. Sensing a case of political opportunism other states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka  joined the farm loan waiver bandwagon. Farmers usually take loan to grow crops and to buy farm equipment. However, waiving off farm loan does not makes sense economically. The cause of farm distress lies somewhere else. We find reasons for a farmer not realizing the market price has to do with inefficient supply chain management, with farm distress getting augmented because of lower farm size holding and lack of irrigation facilities.Between 2012 and 2015 over 10,000 farmers committed suicide. Globally, India has second largest amount of arable land (next only to USA) but less than 35 per cent of this land comes under irrigation. Fluctuation in Indias agricultural output is due to supply-side shocks resulting from inadequate rainfall. Investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification, rain water harvesting, and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures. Additionally, other factors such as lack of reforms to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power resulting from small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities are also important.If various state governments can addresses these issues it will be beneficial for the farmers than waiving-off farm loan.In India, not only percapita agricultural income is low, and but at times it is not possible to sustain this low income. Also, agricultural output fluctuates more than the outputs of the industrial and services sectors. Official output data shows that during the period between 1991-1992 and 2013-2014, the coefficient of variation for agricultural output is 191.34, in comparison to 50.48 for industry, and 22.03 for services sector. This has led to unequal income distribution in India with rural-urban wage gap at 45 per cent in comparison to around 10 per cent for China and Indonesia. Some 850 million people still live in rural India. India has around 260 million people living in poverty and 80 per cent of them live in the countryside. Increasing and sustaining farm income is important if India wants to reduce poverty.Majority of farming(65 per cent) is rain-dependent. Volatile rainfall patterns lead to lower farm income. The median annual wage for a farmer in India is around US $290 which is barely two months minimum wage in Mumbai  the commercial capital of India. Because of lack of proper irrigation facilities, and weather insurance schemes, farmers typically get stuck to growing low-value crops such as rice and wheat, although there is an ever increasing demand for high-value stuffs such as fruits, and vegetables.Inefficient supply chain management equally contributes to farm distress.In India, if farmers are to sell their produce, they have two options. First is to sell directly to the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in government outlets such as Food Corporation of India (FCI). MSP is the minimum price for a product established by the government and supported by payments to producers in the event of the market price falling below the specified minimum. The second option is to take their produce to the nearby government-designated mandi (market)where in front of state officers they can auction produce to the brokers. Mandis are the markets in smaller towns and cities to which farmers from nearby villages bring their agricultural produce to sell. There are around 7700 government designated mandis spread across India.Typically, MSP is higher than the market price, and one would assume that farmers gain every time the government announces the MSP. However, farmers are seldom able to sell their produce at the MSP. Every village does not have government outlets. FCI has a minimum presence in other major rice and wheat producing states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa. Compared to all-India average of 7340 farmers suicide committed between 1995 and 2010, only West Bengal has higher suicides numbering 19331 between 1995 and 2010. The corresponding figures for Assam, Bihar, and Orissa are 3566, 1235, and 4460, respectively. And, even if there is a FCI outlet, the government may not procure if the farmers bring their produce before/after the dates of procurement. The farmers are at whim of local traders and are forced to sell their produce in the informal market.In India, as much as 83 per cent of the farmers are smallholders, with less than 1 hectare of landholding. These marginal farmers do not have access to cold storage, and have no option but to sell their produce to the middlemen or traders. It is impossible for them to get a space in the state storage facilities without any political connection, and also because the smaller farmers do not have wherewithal to book crate in warehouses. Lack of reforms in the APMC Act prevents these small farmers to sell directly to supermarkets, exporters, and agro-processors. This prevent contract farming which otherwise can entail better price realization for these farmers.Rather than waiving-off farm loans there is a need to rise above party-politics and ensure reforms in the APMC Act. According to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report move to waive-off farm loan is likely to cost various state exchequers a whopping $40 billion (around 2% of Indias GDP).Timely procurement through MSP and training for increasing agricultural productivity will also help. Indias neighbor China produces more wheat and rice in spite of having lesser area of land cultivated in comparison to India. Finally, instead of spending on blanket subsidies (favoring the big farmers), investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification,rain water harvesting and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures."
5a0662fd9855b76bf13c5f47,MGNREGA wages less than minimum farm wages in 15 states: Panel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mgnrega-wages-less-than-minimum-farm-wages-in-15-states-panel-4743412/,2017-07-09,"Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image) Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image)THE COMMITTEE for revision of wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarentee Act (MGNREGA) has found that minimum agricultural wages are higher than MGNREGA wages in 15 states. An upward revision in MGNREGA wages is estimated to require a Rs 4,500 crore increase in its budget.Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month.As per data being examined by the committee, the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers are significantly higher than MGNREGA wages in Karnataka, Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The other states where MGNREGA wages fail to match up are Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the minimum wages are marginally higher than MGNREGA wages.In the 15 states where MGNREGA wages are lower, we tried revising it to bring it on par with the minimum agricultural wages paid by the respective states. Where MGNREGA wages are on par or higher, we decided to protect it as it is. If a revision is done as per this formula, it is estimated that a Rs 4,500 crore addition to the existing MGNREGA budget would be needed, said an official from the Ministry of Rural Development.The Indian Express had earlier reported that despite official claims of this years MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore being the highest ever, the wage revision, at 2.7 per cent, was the lowest ever. It meant a per day, per person wage hike of merely Re 1 in some states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Rs 2-Rs 3 in several others.This was because the finance ministry, on account of financial implications, rejected the recommendations of the S Mahendra Dev committee, which had proposed to bring MGNREGA wages on par with minimum wages paid to unskilled agricultural workers in the states. The expert panel had said that the Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the current consumption pattern of rural households, should be the basis for revising MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL), which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983.The basket of goods for calculating CPI-AL comprises mainly food items. With the implementation of the National Food Security Act, rice and wheat is available for as cheap as Rs 2-3 per kg. CPI(Rural) gives lower weightage to food items, and hence, is found to be a better indicator of wage increase, said a ministry official.The Nagesh Singh panel has found that based on the second recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, if the existing MGNREGA wages are revised as per CPI(Rural), it would mean another Rs 600 crore increase in the budget.CPI(R) should be used to revise the wages every year instead of CPI(AL), as the former is more representative of the current rural consumption basket. Also, wage revision should take place every six months, in keeping with the practice for other trades and occupation, said Ankita Aggarwal from the peoples organisation, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha. Aggarwal said that with such low wages and delays in payments, MGNREGA fails to provide the livelihood security for which it was enacted.Jharkhand Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma had recently written a strongly-worded letter to the Ministry of Rural Development protesting against the growing divergence between the states minimum wage, which is currently Rs 224 per day, and MGNREGA wages of just Rs 168 per day after the wage hike.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a06f9279855b76bf13c6ffd,Three square meals for Rs 34: Here is why prisoners risk assault to seek better food,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/three-square-meals-for-rs-34-here-is-why-prisoners-risk-assault-to-seek-better-food-4746559/,2017-07-11,"Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22. Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22.ACCORDING to many of her former cellmates, it was Manjula Shetyes complaint about a shortage of eggs and paav that cost the 35-year-old inmate her life inside the Byculla Womens Prison. On June 23, the 45-year-old convict serving the final few months of her sentence died after an assault allegedly by jail staff following a scuffle over food rations.For most, its hard to imagine staking life and personal safety for two eggs, but former prison inmates do not find it surprising at all that Shetye picked a grave fight over food. In a place where dal is referred to as pathar ke sanam for the substantial number of stones found wading in it, and rock hard rotis are surreptitiously used by prisoners as fuel to light up small kitchen fires called hundis to spice up their notoriously low quality and bland diet, the longing for decent food afflicts almost every prisoner.Every day you should stand outside the prison gates and monitor the garbage that is strewn out. Almost 75 per cent of the garbage would comprise of rotis and rice that get thrown away because they are unpalatable, says Wahid Shaikh, a former undertrial who spent over eight years inside various jails in the city. Clearly, access to good food is a distant dream for the 29,567 prisoners lodged in Maharashtras jails. Data shows the Indian state spends as little as Rs 52.42 on every prisoner per day to arrange the three square meals prescribed in the diet charts of prison manuals. In 2015, Maharashtra spent Rs 34.22 per prisoner per day, the third lowest in the country. Only Goa (Rs 32.83) and Delhi (Rs 31.31) fared worse.In fact, Maharashtra has historically spent smaller sums on prisoners food than the national average. In 2000, the Indian average was around Rs 13.43 compared to Maharashtras spending of Rs 10.33 per day. Prisoners are served three times a day. They get breakfast at 7 am, lunch at 9 am and dinner by 3 pm. The food is prepared by a revolving team of 25 prisoners who work in two shifts rolling out nearly 18,000 chappatis in one day.As per the law, the food is supposed to be prepared under hygienic conditions under strict supervision of a committee headed by the jail superintendent, but the conditions do not meet even basic hygienic requirements in reality. If you see the place where food is cooked, I promise you will not touch that food again. From rats to insects, almost everything can be found in the kitchen as well as the food. The workers who cook have been allotted a small room in the kitchen where they relieve themselves. Imagine your food being prepared where people piss and defecate, says Shaikh.Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22. This mismatch led the Bombay High Court to take the Maharashtra government to task in 2017, directing it to appoint a three-member committee in each district to monitor prison food.Not much has changed since the HCs observations. Irfan Shaikh, a former convict who completed his sentence in 2017, says food inside a prison is a powerful reminder of a prisoners humanity and the person he used to be when outside. The retributive system of our prisons ensures that a prisoner does not have access to any worldly pleasures. Even food is cooked in such a way that it does not taste like food, it merely serves the nutritional purpose, he says. Only, the nutrition levels in Maharashtras jail are shocking too.In prison, a prisoners diet crashes significantly, lowering their immunity and intake of micronutrients. Stress levels are high. The latent TB bacteria in the body gets active. In a day, an infected prisoner may cough 50 to 100 times. The bacteria in droplets remains suspended in air in an enclosed area infecting other prisoners if the cell is poorly ventilated, says Dr Lalitkumar Anande, senior medical officer at Sewri TB hospital. According to him, even jail staff is at the risk of developing TB infection due to the poor living conditions.Data analysed by The Indian Express showed that prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in Mumbai prisons is eight times higher, at an average 14 per 1,000 population, than in general population, which stands at 1.67 per 1,000 people. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), which provides free TB treatment to patients, provided DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course) treatment to 24 TB prisoners in 2013, which increased to 26 in 2014 and 35 in 2015 at the Arthur Road prison. Apart from living conditions, nutrition levels are directly to blame for the high TB incidence in Mumbais prisons.The Model Prison Manual drafted by the Union Ministry for Home Affairs prescribes that a male prisoner should have an intake of 2,320 to 2,730 kilo calorie (kcal) per day. For female prisoners, it is stipulated to be between 1,900 and 2,830 kcal/day. Prison administration being a federal subject, every state has the right to decide on its food menu, provided it adheres to the nutritional requirements laid down by the prison manual. While prison manuals specify the exact weightage of pulses and vegetables that a prisoner should get, the quality of food served leaves a lot to be desired.The food in prison parlance is called bhatta. It is watery and tasteless. There have been times where I have seen prisoners break down in frustration after having to eat those meals day after day, says a former convicted prisoner who spent time in various jails in Maharashtra. Food accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the total money spent on prisoners in India. This also makes it one of the major expense heads, which is susceptible when officials decide to cut corners.The only way that prisoners could have access to better food was through jail canteens. Every prisoner is allowed to receive a sum of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,200 per month from family, which he or she could spend in the jail canteen. But this facility was shut down in Maharashtra around 2008. Prisoners cant buy food from the canteen any longer. The only time prisoners have access to outside food is during festival days where there is a provision of canteens selling food.Prisoners also access food through the home cooked meal that certain prisoners are allowed to have on the directions of a court. Earlier, under the provisions of home cooked food, huge food containers would be slipped in by rich inmates to feed dozens of fellow inmates. Certain jails have now laid down rules that say an individual cant get more than 850 grams of home cooked food per day inside the prison.Incidentally, barring Northeast and Southern states, besides West Bengal and Jammu & Kashmir, non-vegetarian food is not given free to prisoners in any other state. Certain states have a provision of allowing certain prisoners to access non-vegetarian food from jail canteens on limited days in a year. The administration believes prisoners are sub human and do not have right to enjoy even basic facilities. My experience in prison was that whenever prisoners got access to decent food on certain special days, the entire day passed peacefully without any incident. It does not take much for a caged prisoner to go crazy. However, the days people had access to decent food even the looniest among us would be normal, recalls Shaikh.As a direct consequence of poor nutrition, health problems are routine occurrences for prisoners. A recent survey of 24 sub-jails in Maharashtra by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) observed that prisoners are not medically examined at the time of admission and there are no regular medical check-ups.In Byculla jail, where the women inmates rioted to demand better food and living conditions following Shetyes death last month, almost all inmates suffer from skin infections. The two other most common ailments among the women inmates are TB and HIV. Skin diseases are contagious in nature. In jail, as hygiene conditions are poor, this spreads rapidly as they use the common toilets and in some cases even share their soap and towels. Almost all the inmates complain of this, says a senior official.A former medical officer who was attached with the Arthur Road prison in 2016 says 300 prisoners visit the prison out-patient department on an average every day. Of these, one-third would have skin infections. Most prisoners have rashes on their body for a range of reasons. Prisoners share the same bedsheets, do not wash their clothes often and share soap bars, he says.According to him, fungal infection, measles and herpes were most common. There was usually a shortage of anti-fungal cream and tablets for skin infections. Since treatment usually got delayed, the infection would spread to other body parts, says the former medical officer. With overcrowding and skin infections common, the medical officer says, prisoners need a skin specialist for regular consultation in jails. This is not a life threatening disease. So, jail authority would not send prisoners to hospital for merely skin consultation. What we need is a regular consultant in the prison itself, he adds.According to the CHRI report, Conditions in the sub-jails are extremely unhygienic due to the lack of proper cleaning facilities, which exacerbates health challenges inside prisons. The cells are cleaned by inmates, who lack the necessary supply of phenol and water.(With Rashmi Rajput)For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Local religious leaders also arrived at the scene. The children were kept in the waiting room at the station while we questioned the adults. We served them biryani and dal rice in the afternoon for lunch, an officer with the railway police said.Leaders of religious groups later handed out biscuit packets and water bottles for the children while CWC members spoke to them.It only by 7 p.m. that their story was verified. After checking their documents, including Aadhaar cards and IDs issued by the madrasas, the children and their instructors were allowed to leave, an officer said. Local leaders from the community arranged buses for their transport.Most of the children hail from West Bengal, Bihar and Assam, but study in madrasas in the State. They had gone to their home towns for Ramzan."

5a146da39855b76bf13e439d,For a few good men,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170720/jsp/opinion/story_162762.jsp,2017-07-20,"On my way to Basirhat, a couple of weeks after communal disturbances had been reported from this area in the North 24 Parganas, I noticed the landscape changing after the train - the Sealdah-Hasnabad local - had crossed Bahira Kalibari. The fields with standing crops - rice and, usually, vegetables - brick kilns, the occasional mango orchard and solitary scarecrows gave way to large water bodies that resembled bils. As the train approached Harua Road - Baduria is a 20-minute drive from here - I felt the atmosphere inside the compartment change ever so slightly. Most people got off, at Lebutala and Bhasila, before my destination, Harua Road, arrived. Those who remained were silent. I noticed one man poring over an old copy of a local newspaper (Jugasankha), which carried reports of clashes in a bold font. After getting off, I stopped for tea at a stall on the platform. Broken glass bottles had been stacked in a corner of the shop. On enquiring what the matter was, I was told that some people had vandalized the stall the morning protests broke out against a deeply offensive post on Facebook. I had travelled to Baduria to meet someone who had not lit the flames but had attempted to douse them. Mohammad Kamruzzaman is the secretary of the All Bengal Minority Youth Federation, an organization that works in the fields of education and employment. The work done by the ABMYF has given Kamruzzaman some leverage among the residents of Harua, Baduria, Deganga and Swarupnagar. His influence in these localities had turned Kamruzzaman into the local administration's right-hand man when disturbances had spread in Basirhat. Kamruzzaman and I got talking inside the educational institution that he has set up for needy students. A soft-spoken man, Kamruzzaman appeared to be an atypical community leader. He is equally concerned about such welfare measures as doles for imams as well as the poor representation of Muslims in education and employment, asymmetries, which, in his opinion, have created the conditions for the growing orthodoxy in thought among some segments of Muslim society. While describing his experience during the unrest - he had travelled extensively in Basirhat, requesting irate mobs to lift blockades - Kamruzzaman made an important admission. In places like Berachampa and Hamadama, where he succeeded in reasoning with the protesters - there were also occasions when the mob refused to listen to his pleas - he had talked of the need to preserve the honour of the grameen samaj, prioritizing the dignity of the rural community over religious identity, in order to secure a truce. Kamruzzaman's actions had been heroic. But I had other queries of him: what, for instance, are his views on the alleged radicalization of Muslims, the rationale cited by sectarian forces when intimidating minorities often with targeted, vicious assault? Political attempts, old and new, at radicalizing the majority community are a part of the public discourse. But it has been alleged that secular-minded citizens are diffident when it comes to addressing a similar contagion among Muslims. One of the reasons behind my visit to Baduria was to find out how a Muslim would respond to this supposed anomaly. Kamruzzaman agreed that radicalized elements exist among minorities, as is the case with any religious formation. But it is telling that he had to remind me of the obvious: that the radicals constitute the fringe. However, what allows the fringe to resemble the centre during conflagrations, in Kamruzzaman's opinion, is administrative laxity. The police's eagerness to rely on community leaders like him to defuse the crisis in Basirhat is a case in point. The absence of neutral but effective intervention on the part of the Trinamul administration opened the government up to charges of appeasement during the crises in Dholahat, Hazinagar/Halisahar, Dhulagarh and, more recently, in Raiganj where adivasi organizations indulged in arson. But the more serious issue in this context, Kamruzzaman insisted, was the failure to create a durable civil leadership among Muslims. The blame for this should be shared by India's political class - the Congress, the Left parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the least sympathetic of the political formations - that has been content with exercising control over minorities through the agency of the clergy or elected leaders who are indistinguishable from ordained functionaries. Kamruzzaman cited one more reason to explain organized as well as spontaneous violence, Basirhat being an example of the latter kind of disruption. The taste of power, however fleeting, as a means of retribution against an adversary, real or imagined, can be a decisive incentive for the underprivileged. Kamruzzaman is acutely aware of the risk of the falsification of the narrative of radicalism among minorities. This, we agreed, is the sinister trap that has been laid by political Hindutva. The snare works along these lines: provoke vulnerable segments among minorities to retaliate in areas where they have the numerical advantage through incitement, and then use it as evidence to legitimize a broader, brutal counter-mobilization movement against an entire community that has been demonized through sustained propaganda. But there is a way of breaking out of the trap. Kamruzzaman believes it lies in education. As proof, he introduced me to M.D. Irfan Habib, a 22-year-old with a wisp of a stubble, who is pursuing a higher degree in mathematics from Jadavpur University. Irfan talked spiritedly of his unshakeable faith in the scientific temper that helps him question everything, from the diktats of the ruling party to religious edicts. India's liberal constituency has its own entrapment to fight against. Its supposed hesitation to discuss the threat of radicalization in a small segment among minorities could be the result of a well-founded anxiety - that the spin doctors of the Far Right would co-opt such scrutiny to bolster the ongoing process of polarization. But the layered character and chronology of the violence in Basirhat, and elsewhere, must be talked about in the public domain, if only to expose the bigotry of Hindutva. Cancer, as we all know, spreads in silence."

(File | PTI)DARJEELING: Clashes between the police and Gorkhaland supporters today resulted in injuries to several persons on both sides at Jaigoan in Alipurduar district, bordering Bhutan.The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and the other hill parties took out a rally at Jaigaon on the 46th day of an indefinite strike called by the GJM in the hills.According to the police, clashes broke out between the securitymen and the Gorkhaland supporters after the participants in the rally, carrying kukris (Gorkha knives), hurled stones and petrol bombs at the police personnel.The police tried to convince the GJM supporters to refrain from attacking, but the agitators remained defiant and broke the first two barricades. They kept hurling stones at the police, who then resorted to using water cannons and firing tear gas shells, besides using batons to disperse the crowd.At this, the protesters turned violent and set a few vehicles, including those of the police, afire.Several police personnel and Gorkhaland supporters were injured in the clashes, the police said.The GJM claimed that the police resorted to indiscriminate firing. The police, however, denied the allegation.Similar processions were taken out at Kalchini.GJM supporters took out rallies at the Chowkbazar area of the hills, carrying black flags as a mark of protest against police action on Gorkhaland supporters.Shouting slogans against the West Bengal government, they demanded an immediate intervention by the Centre.Gorkhaland supporters, armed with knives, swords and kukris, had tried to forcibly enter Siliguri yesterday, demanding that the town be included into the separate state of Gorkhaland.In the Naxalbari area of Darjeeling, the locals took out a rally against the GJM and their demand for Gorkhaland and set tyres on fire as a mark of protest against the ongoing agitation in the hills.In the Sukna area of the hills, which is close to Siliguri, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state took out an anti-GJM rally.The GJM and the other hill parties held an 'Anna Dan' (rice donation) rally during the day as a mark of protest against vehicles, carrying food supplies to the hills, being set ablaze in Siliguri.Each participant in the rally carried a handful of rice and other grains and donated it in a box, which will be handed over to the district administration and, in turn, will be sent to the West Bengal secretariat as a mark of protest.The police and security forces patrolled the streets of the hills and kept a tight vigil at all the entry and exit routes.Barring the medicine shops, all other business establishments, restaurants, hotels, schools and colleges remained closed.The workers of the GJM and various NGOs of the hills were seen distributing food among the people as the food supply has been severely hit due to the ongoing shutdown."
5a0da5479855b76bf13d0775,When silver ‘grows’ in paddy fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/when-silver-grows-in-paddy-fields/article19437952.ece,2017-08-06,"The rice is put to the test in the field.Special ArrangementIt is a rice variety with a silver touch, literally. Garib-sal, one of 505 types of rice plants tested by scientists, is capable of absorbing silver found naturally in soil and accumulating it in the grain to unusually high levels of 15 mg per kg.The rice was able to accumulate high quantities of silver even when the soil contained only about 0.15 mg per kg.The unusual accumulation of silver in the grain and other parts of the plant, researchers say, throws open the possibility of commercial extraction of the metal through farming.The maximum concentration of silver in the plant is in the grains. Silver accumulation is largely in the bran of the rice grain, and once polished, the silver in the grain is reduced significantly.Polishing grain is crucialIt is not, however, for consumption as food. We do not advocate consumption of the unpolished rice as staple food. If the rice is polished very well then it may not lead to silver toxicity, says Prof. T. Pradeep from the Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, who authored the research.Silver is not known to accumulate in the reproductive tissues of any cereal, and in agricultural crops the amount of silver that gets accumulated is less than 1 mg per kg of dry weight of the plant.Researchers at IIT Madras stumbled upon the rice variety while screening for different metal ions in the 505 rice varieties. Only nine showed high silver accumulation, with Garib-sal the highest.The rice varieties are maintained by Dr. Debal Deb, head, Centre of Interdisciplinary Studies, Kolkata, as part of rice variety conservation efforts. Garib-sal used to be grown by farmers in Purulia, West Bengal. The researchers tested Garib-sals ability to accumulate silver even when grown in soils with very low silver concentration. Even when the soil contains only about 0.01 mg of silver per kg, the rice plant was able to concentrate 0.20 mg of silver per kg in the grains.The rice variety has the ability to accumulate silver about 100 times more than any other rice, says Prof. T. Pradeep. The variety was cultivated in the farm for three successive years in soil containing about 0.15 mg per kg and the uptake and accumulation of the noble metal was nearly the same.Garib-sal accumulated 50 times more silver than another type in control tests."

With the Centre turning back to the statehood demand, the Mamata Banerjee administration has also continued with total isolation of the hills by cutting off Internet.IN PICTURES: Gorkhaland protests in DarjeelingLPG cylinder prices have touched high of Rs1,800 per cylinder and availability of food in markets have touched new low. Food supplies from the plains have been stopped by Bengali organisations of Siliguri, allegedly supported by the police.Though GJM has often distributed eatables to residents of tea gardens where cultivation does not take place, it has never been sufficient.However, one word has kept the indefinite strike going is indigenous knowledge.The indigenous knowledge orally passed down through generations has allowed the consumerism-struck residents of the two hill districts to fall back to their roots.This indigenous knowledge has enabled the residents to scourge the correct locations in the forests for shoots and roots and cultivate indigenous varieties of crop after supplies from the plains stopped. The indefinite strike has also led to increased cooperation between people -- including age-old barter system -- which had faded away as consumerism crept in.""Many of us had started to depend on rice from the plains and stopped cultivating our locally-grown indigenous varieties. Now, many farmers in our village and neighbouring villages are cultivating maize and local varieties of rice and are also fetching bamboo shoots and wild mushrooms from the forests. Many are also preparing fermented soyabean, a must with every meal that was earlier available in the markets, at their homes,"" said Man Bahadur of Yokprintam village, 25 km from Kalimpong town.The soil of this part of the Himalayas also supports cultivation of a variety of vegetables including potatoes, ladies finger, brinjals, tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd among others.With currency notes rendered useless in the wake of the complete shutdown, availability of farm workers has also gone down the abyss, which has also forced people to work together at each other's farmlands.""It seems we have returned to the traditional way of cultivation that our forefathers followed when society was egalitarian. Farm workers are not available due to the strike. So, people nowadays work together in rotation at one person's farm in the village. The next day, they will all work at someone else's land. After work, all the farm workers eat at the residence of the person on whose land they worked. Nobody is small or big in this work. This has brought us closer,"" said Ramesh Rai of Samalbong village in Kalimpong district.Besides this commune-type work, villagers are also sharing their meat. ""Just today, a big chicken was slaughtered at my house. While we kept 1 kilogram, we gave the rest to our neighbours. They would do the same when they slaughter their chickens,"" said Suren Tamang of Seokbhir Khani village of Kalimpong district.However, one crop that has taken a beating due to the strike is ginger. ""While 40 kg of ginger costed Rs 6,000 last year, it has reduced to only Rs 800 per 40 kg due to the strike,"" said Mangal Tamang of Takling village, equidistant from both Darjeeling and Kalimpong towns."
5a0f2ee29855b76bf13d6ee9,Notes of a native son: Hansda S Shekhar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/notes-of-a-native-son-hansda-s-shekhar/articleshow/60027329.cms,2017-08-12,"One of India's best young writers, and good friend of Goa, is fighting a cultural battle with significant implications for the rest of the country. On August 4, an irate crowd targeted the brilliant author Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar in his home city of Pakur, in Jharkhand. Accusing him of being ""the shaitan of Santhal society"", they burned an effigy of the doctor (he works at a government health centre) and winner of the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar Award. The purported offence is ""pornographic writing"" which ""showed serious lack of sensitivity towards the tribal people of India."" But what is really at stake is the question of who has the right to speak for or represent a culture.Shekhar is a startling and unique talent. There is literally no one else like him. Just 34 years old, he writes in an engaging style from and about a cultural universe otherwise entirely absent from Indian letters  the tribal firmament in rapidly changing, contemporary India. It's never fair to burden limitlessly talented young writers with comparisons, but here it is impossible to ignore deeply resonant similitude with the African-American pioneer James Baldwin. Notably, that correlation was first highlighted in Goa, when Shekhar launched his book of short stories, 'The Adivasi Will Not Dance' at the Goa Arts and Literature Festival 2015, at the hands of eminent Konkani writer, Damodar Mauzo.One of the best stories in that collection is being used to manufacture outrage against its author. 'November is the Month of Migrations' is stark and unforgettable, just three pages describing the season when ""Santhal men, women and children walk down from their villages in the hills"" to board trains to West Bengal, where ""they will plant rice and other crops in farms owned by the zamindars"".Trailing along is Talamai Kisku, 20, who is beckoned by a railway police jawan. ""Talamai debates if she should follow, and decides to. He is offering food, after all, and she is hungry."" When he asks, ""Will you do some work for me?"" Talamai knows what work he is talking about. He uses her, saying ""Saali, you Santhal women are made for this only."" But ""She just lies  passive, unthinking, unblinking  as cold as the paved ground...as still as an inert earthen bowl into which a dark cloud empties itself."" Finally, the jawan ""gives Talamai two pieces of cold bread pakora and a fifty-rupee note and walks away. She re-ties her saya and lungi, stuffs the note into her blouse, eats both the bread pakoras, and walks back to her group"".It is a masterly feat to condense and communicate such intense pathos and horror in a few unadorned lines. The scale of Shekhar's achievement is directly akin to all-time great Sadaat Hasan Manto, whose shorter-than-short stories remain the most searing evocations of Partition in 1947. 'November is the Month of Migrations' acutely recalls 'Khol Do (Open It)', where Manto writes about Sirajuddin, desperately searching for his abducted daughter, after a nightmare escape to Lahore. ""A succession of images raced through his mind. Attack... fire... escape... railway station...night...Sakina."" He finds her nigh-unconscious in a hospital. ""The doctor looked at the prostrate body and felt for the pulse. Then he said to the old man, ""Open It"" [meaning the nearby window]. The young woman on the stretcher moved slightly. Her hands groped for the cord which kept her salwar tied around her waist. With painful slowness, she unfastened it, pulled the garment down and opened her thighs.""Shekhar's critics aren't bothered about the obvious literary merit of his work. They are incensed about other things. The author told me via e-mail, ""This is tribal cultural politics. This is the politics of region, script, identity... a very layered and complicated issue. All I can say is those who hate my books without even reading them, will hate them no matter what."" But this turf battle is markedly like what plays out in other parts of India, including Goa. Some Santhals support the tribal-created Ol-Chiki script, and maintain Sarna (their animist faith). But converts to Christianity back the Roman script. Shekhar thoroughly confounds those stereotypes.But why shouldn't that be the case? Why should a few individuals determine what is suitably or insufficiently Santhal, or Goan, or Indian? In this regard, the recently departed poet and scholar Eunice de Souza complained, ""My blood boils when I hear an Indian talking about ""Indian culture"". This is a primitive impulse, finding something coherent and limited and saying, ""This is Indian culture"", and everybody else is excluded."" It should be noted she was a sincere admirer of 'The Adivasi will not Dance', calling it ""a fine book of stories."" This most discerning of critics wrote, ""I'm not interested in the ethnicity of writers, just whether they have something to say that deepens one's understanding of the world. Shekhar does just that...'The Adivasi Will Not Dance' is a remarkable achievement.""The writer is a photographer and a widely published columnist. Views are personal"

5a12a4149855b76bf13e10ed,The disease that just won’t go away,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-disease-that-just-wont-go-away/article19520832.ece,2017-08-19,"At 17, Rohim Sarkar weighs as much as the average 11-year-old. When shirtless, each of the seven pairs of bones that make up his upper ribcage is visible from five feet away. An attending doctor at the Habibpur block hospital in Malda, West Bengal feels his spleen and the verdict is clear: VL, he declares, followed by two other colleagues jotting the verdict and leading the boy aside for a confirmatory dipstick test, a detailed set of photographs, a skin biopsy and a recommendation that he immediately begin treatment.Sarkar presented symptoms considered typical of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), or kala-azar, a disease that is endemic to a contiguous blob of districts spanning West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Caused by the Leishmania donovani parasite, harboured by an insect called the sandfly, the Habibpur block, barely 30 km from Bangladesh, is considered particularly vulnerable to kala-azar outbreaks.A parasitic diseaseKala-azar is a parasitic disease that is confined to humans, meaning that unlike, say, bird flu, there is no other animal that harbours the infection in Asia. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent in 119 districts in four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal), India itself accounts for half the global burden of the disease. If untreated, kala-azar can kill within two years of the onset of the ailment, though the availability of a range of drugs for almost a century has meant that less than 1 in 1,000 now succumb to the disease. According to numbers from the Union Health Ministry, 2016 was the first year that no kala-azar death was reported in India. Experts, however, note that like malaria and several other vector-borne diseases in India, the government only considers lab-confirmed and officially registered deaths and therefore, frequently underestimates both caseload and mortality.Historically, a 20-day treatment schedule with sodium stibogluconate (SSb) injection and the spraying of the malarial insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethan (DDT) in houses and surroundings were the only weapons against the disease.When DDT was used as part of the malaria eradication programme, very few cases of kala-azar were reported. When the use of DDT was stopped a few years later, there was an increase in the number of kala-azar cases.Over a period of time, resistance to the only drug (SSb injection) led to frequent outbreaks and fatalities and the Union Health Ministry, which had committed to eliminating kala-azar by 2010, revised it to 2015. Bangladesh, India and Nepal committed to eliminate the disease from the region, where elimination (as opposed to eradication) is defined as no more than one case per 10,000 population at the upazila level in Bangladesh, sub-district (block PHC) level in India and district level in Bhutan and Nepal.Since 2003, Indias National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is in charge of coordinating with endemic States to eliminate the disease. With funds from a World Bank-supported project (2008-2013), the NVBDCP now funds consultants at State and district level and Kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS) at the States blocks (or clusters of village panchayats) to conduct active surveillance. That means local village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs) are entrusted with constantly visiting houses and looking for patients who may present symptoms of the disease and alert health authorities.Several new medical advances have aided the fight against kala-azar. A rapid diagnostic test, called rK39 can  with a pinprick of blood  indicate the presence of the parasite. With SSb injection on the decline, there are now two mainline drugs, miltefosine  originally conceived as an anti-cancer drug and taken orally  and liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), a drug that once needed to be injected at regular intervals over four weeks but now only requires a single shot. These, besides an array of genetic tests that have obviated the need for painful jabs to the spleen and liver to confirm the presence of parasites, and global and national political commitment in terms of funding research and drug dispensation, has meant that kala-azar may be on the verge of being stamped out. However the 2015 elimination target was missed and postponed to September 2017, again a deadline that wont be met. This, in spite of the number of kala-azar patients plummeting from 36,000 in 2005 to 2,969 in 2017, according to Central government figures.At the campSarkar is one of 57 residents whove made it to the Habibpur hospital as part of biannual medical camps organised as part of the active surveillance process. About 160 were expected but a bus strike has thwarted attendance. West Bengal, like the other endemic States, was to have eliminated kala-azar in 2015, but is set to miss the deadline this year too despite the number of patients in the State coming down from 2,700 in 2005 to less than 50 as of this July.Among the camp attendees, seated on the rows of wooden benches that made up the capacious common hall of the hospital, Sarkar was the only one who presented the typical symptoms  the emaciation, anaemia and signs of a puffed spleen  that have helped doctors quickly ferret out kala-azar cases for almost a century. More than Sarkar, however, what worried the visiting doctors were 20 outwardly healthy occupants of those benches. Most were once kala-azar patients and, as the doctors who screened them found, are stricken in various degrees by a mixture of blotches and ulcers on their hands, legs, backs and, sometimes, on their faces.Painless and never known to trigger the fevers and pains typical of parasitical diseases, the blemished skin is the only sign of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It isnt the kind of disease that prompts villagers of Habibpur block, who besides kala-azar also live under the constant threat of malaria and tuberculosis, to skip farm work or forego a days earnings from manual labour, to line up outside hospitals. One of the patients with PKDL told me that the only reason he wanted treatment was because he was looking to get married, says Dr. Mitali Chatterjee, a medical doctor and researcher at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGME&R), Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital, Kolkata, which is known informally as the PG hospital.PKDL results from the parasites left over from a kala-azar infection that couldnt be slain by the chemical cocktails used to treat kala-azar. Though harmless, the pigmented skin can provide harbour, says Chatterjee, to the parasites and they can make their way onto other sandflies. Like the anopheles mosquito, the sandfly needs human blood to nourish their larvae and in the process can pass on parasites to new people and trigger a kala-azar infection. Roughly a tenth of those with a history of kala-azar will go on to develop PKDL and, potentially, seed a fresh outbreak. The precise reason for this isnt known yet. In the 1970s or early 80s, VL [kala-azar] had almost disappeared and then there was suddenly an epidemic, says Srija Moulik, a research scholar at IPGME&R, it was later traced back to a single case of PKDL. Theres a paper on that.Case and cure filesThe earliest empirical evidence for a link between PKDL as a silent agent provocateur for kala-azar outbreaks and DDT sprays came in the 1990s from C.P. Thakur, a physician and now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP. He reported an unusual trend in kala-azar cases in Bihar. Between 1970 and 1989, 530 individuals were confirmed with PKDL at the Patna Medical College (PMC), with the number of cases rocketing from two in 1970 to 59 in 1989. This was in contrast to no cases of this disease being reported at the PMC from 1958-1970. In the period 1977-1990, there were 3,01,076 cases of kala-azar reported in Bihar alone, with a mortality rate of over 2% (compared with 31,074 cases and a mortality rate below 0.4% for the rest of India). It seems possible, that once DDT spraying stopped, the re-establishment of large sandfly populations and infection of these vectors, largely as a result of them feeding on cases of PKDL, provoked the resurgence of kala-azar, Thakur and co-author K. Kumar reported in the June 1992 edition of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology .Even though this link between kala-azar and PKDL was hinted at since 1922, it wasnt until 2005 that the World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan (who together account for 90% of kala-azar cases) began concerted efforts to eliminate PKDL, as part of kala-azar elimination strategies.In a round-up of the countrys progress in dealing with the disease, at a conference in Bengaluru earlier this year, Chatterjee showed a slide illustrating that in spite of the rapid dive in kala-azar cases across endemic States, PKDL cases in Bihar, which bears 70% of Indias kala-azar burden, had risen to 500 from nil in 2013; from 300 in 2013 to 900 in 2017 in Jharkhand and 50 to 250 in West Bengal, in the same period. To Chatterjee, however, the rise in cases indicates States increased efforts to find kala-azar patients and hidden PKDL cases becoming manifest.At the IPGME&R, one of the nodal research medical labs in Kolkata thats part of the kala-azar surveillance-detection-and-analysis network, scientists are finding out through DNA analysis that the leishmaniasis parasite is an extremely resilient entity and can be dormant in the body and seed infections even after as many as five years.The group of mostly-women scientists, who are trying to cleave apart the mysteries of the parasite, are located a five-minute walk away from a modest building that once hosted the laboratory of Sir Ronald Ross, the India-born British Nobel Laureate who established that mosquitoes were responsible for transmitting malaria. Ross was also the one who christened the kala-azar parasite as Leishmania donovani , after the scientist duo that discovered them.Over the days spent peering through blood samples and skin biopsies from medical camps such as at Malda, Moulik points to yet another possible chink in the governments artillery to weed out kala-azar. The single injection of LAmB, which is now used to treat kala-azar, dramatically reduces the number of parasites in the blood and can cure the infection. However, when PKDL patients were subjected to the same medicine (targeting the same parasite), it didnt completely clear the parasite load. On the other hand, prior to LAmB, the treatment of choice for kala-azar was miltefosin, which is an oral pill taken over 12 weeks. It usually brought about nausea and other discomfort because of which several patients would quit treatment midway. However Moulik points to data in the lab that shows miltefosin did a superior job in flushing out the parasites from PKDL patients. There is a catch though. The ultra-sensitive probes that Moulik employs can spot parasites only if there are at least 10 of them in a microgram of DNA. It is quite possible that a patient might be well and disease-free for a few years but have a miniscule amount of parasites that will multiply at an opportune time in, say, five years, and then radiate the vicious cycle of outbreaks and epidemics that has undermined anti-kala-azar programmes through the years. I believe that if parasite loads go down to 10, the bodys immune system should ideally stave off infection but this is indeed the million-dollar question: How long till we are sure that the parasite loads never increase enough to pose a threat? says Moulik.The ground realitiesThe Habibpur hospital, from where IPGME&R gets a significant number of patient samples, is as large as a single-screen movie hall with X-ray machines, photocopiers, beds and a handful of trained nurses. To get to it, one must cross a stream of stagnant water that, according to local residents, swells up during the monsoon. Within several areas of the hospital, debris is piled up. There is a mossy pool of garbage alongside a water cooler that is inaccessible to the most flexible of gymnasts.The block medical officer is a busy man who must, alongside coordinating a kala-azar camp, dragoon the same set of field workers to fan out into the villages looking for tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy patients. Since 2015, when the government authorities woke up to the urgency of eliminating PKDL, patients are being given financial incentives. All those who complete the course of treatment will get Rs. 2,500 (and the medicines made available through the WHO network) and the village field staff, consisting of ASHAs and KTSs, stand to get Rs. 500 for every such patient. If financial incentives are given, then we get patients, says a doctor who has been part of several field camps, but almost never has a district medical officer accompanied us. They are supposed to.English Mohanpur, an inexplicably-named village a few km away from the hospital, is a slushy hamlet between rice fields. Several tribal communities populate its interiors and Koel, an ASHA worker, says some of the tuberculosis and kala-azar patients also battle alcoholism. Few houses have concrete roofs and fewer still comply with the government directive to spray the houses with the insecticide synthetic pyrethroid, the replacement for DDT. These sprays are needed at regular intervals and need a thorough application in every room including the kitchen. The problem is that the spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell, says Chatterjee. There is also a cluster effect. Families stay very close together and one infected person can spread it to the others.Sripad Mandal, 42, a daily-wage labourer and village resident, was bedridden for three months because of kala-azar. He says he visited the block hospital and was given a course of medicine but that didnt work. He wasnt given a second round of medicine at the hospital and finally had to get himself admitted to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. He now claims to be well. His disease, however, manifested before the government announced financial incentives for completing the treatment. This is the disease of the poorest of the poor. Unless socio-economic conditions are improved and better sanitation is available, I dont see just medicines and drugs completely eradicating kala-azar, says Chatterjee.The problem is that the pyrethroid insecticide spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell.Dr. Mitali Chatterjee,Doctor and researcher, Kolkata"

(AFP)Guwahati, Aug. 27: The flood situation in Assam improved substantially today though over 1.6 lakh people are still suffering across six districts, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said in its daily flood report. Over 2.03 lakh people were affected by the latest wave of floods in Dhemaji, Barpeta, Chirang, Morigaon, Nagaon and Karbi Anglong districts till yesterday. According to the report, Morigaon is the worst affected with more than 92,000 people affected, followed by Nagaon, where 54,500 have been hit by the deluge. Currently, 343 villages are under water and nearly 25,000 hectares of cropland inundated, the report said. The authorities are running 91 relief camps and distribution centres in four districts, where 24,557 people have taken shelter. The third wave of floods has so far claimed the lives of 73 people. The total number of persons killed in flood-related incidents in the state is 157 this year, including eight in Guwahati. The Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat district, the Katakhal at Matizuri in Hailakandi district and the Kushiara in Karimganj town are flowing above the danger level. The spouse wing of the Tezpur branch of Indian Medical Association today distributed phenyl, bleaching powder, mosquito coils, biscuits, fresh water, sanitary napkins and rice to the flood-affected people at Gammiri Molabasti in Sonitpur district. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti today distributed paddy saplings for 30 bighas among flood-affected farmers in Golaghat. Track repair The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) officials yesterday said it would take at least another six days to resume normal train movement between parts of north Bengal, the Northeast and rest of the country. ""Restoration work of the track is going on in two sections between Sudhani and Telta stations and between Kumedpur and Khurial stations. Considering the progress of work, it seems that only one track will be ready in both these stretches. It would take some more days to restore the second track,"" an official said. Sudhani, Telta and Khurial are located in Bihar while Kumedpur is in Bengal's Malda district. All these stations come under the principal route that connects major parts of north Bengal and the Northeast, with Calcutta and rest of the country. Between Sudhani and Telta, the Mahananda had swept away soil from under the tracks near a rail bridge and left a stretch of 60 metres of both tracks hanging on August 11. On the other hand, a bridge between Khurial and Kumedpur was also washed away by the Mahananda. In both sites, railways have taken up repair and restoration. In the damaged site between Sudhani and Telta, the army is also helping the railways. ""If at least one track is restored, we will only run goods trains, that too, in limited numbers, on Tuesday from 4pm onwards. If the track is found fit to resume train operations, there is a plan to start running passenger trains from September 1 morning,"" an NFR source said. Earlier, the railways had cancelled trains, which run from parts of north Bengal and the Northeast to different destinations of the country, till Monday. On Friday, a fresh notice was issued which mentions that as many as 70 long-distance trains have been cancelled till September 31. Once the track is ready NFR authorities are planning to resume services of some trains immediately, including the Rajdhani Express, Awadh Assam Express, North East Express, Kamrup Express and Uttarbanga Express. Ever since train connectivity was suspended, people travelling to north Bengal districts like Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar and the Northeast, or vice-versa, have to arrive in Malda or Raiganj in Bengal, till which trains are running. From there, they need to take buses to reach Dalkhola, from where special trains are running to Guwahati and Dibrugarh. Otherwise, they need to travel to Siliguri by road and then take buses to move in onward direction."

Companies and traders were bullish about sugarcane and cotton , which have seen an increase in acreage by 9% and 18%, respectively, this year.Floods in parts of Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and weak rainfall in south India have hit crops. Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

Earlier, the State had to take permission from the Centre to procure essential commodities whose prices had risen beyond the reach of the common man.At present, when prices fluctuate, the State Food and Civil Supplies Department demands a subsidised price list from the Centre and puts up a proposal for procurement with the State government. But this process takes a long time, and until then the crisis usually has already hit a peak. With a decentralised policy for procurement, we will save a lot of time, said an official.Last year, the government had decided to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell it to State fair-price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India from the procurement chain. But the move was made possible by switching to the Centres scheme of decentralised procurement of food grain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and the Public Distribution System (PDS).The government has already started buying sugar, meant for distribution through PDS every month, through a live centralised e-auction conducted through the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX), an online commodity exchange.The auction had received great response and cut out the role of middlemen; it showed us that independent procurement can be done in a fair and transparent way, said a former secretary of the Food and Civil Supplies Department.West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala have adopted decentralised policies. Data shows that due to the decentralised process, there has been an increase in procurement of grains in these States."

Their success story has inspired several others in the nearby villages. Now, around 80 to 90 quintals of mudhi are being produced every month.Some farmers even cultivate rice to meet the demand for mudhi. Price of mudhi per bag has been increased from `140 to `150, said Anup Kumar Behera, who has been volunteering to monitor the SHGs operation. He said the rural market is consuming approximately 60 per cent of the produce while the rest are exported to other towns and States.MMA secretary Kabita Behera said the cooperative has been following several strategies for strengthening its market linkage. Apart from selling it in the weekly market, the bloated rice is being exported to West Bengal, Jharkhand, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Mumbai, she added.With the support of the district administration and NGOs, they displayed the famous Baripada mudhi during State and National level exhibitions and trade festivals. Though the SHG is running with a small workshop at Sangrami Mahila Mandal, it is has no adequate space to cater to the needs of their business. Earlier, they had urged a former collector to provide a government building for smooth functioning of the association. But so far, no action has been taken in this regard."

Das and his father will provide a vital service during the Durga Puja, which is incomplete without the almost continuous and hypnotic beats of huge drums, better known as dhaks.The drummers, or dhakis, are struggling to earn money during the five-day festivities in the capital. Das and his father are among the 200-odd drummers who have arrived here from tiny villages in West Bengal districts of Malda, Murshidabad, Midnapore and Birbhum. They are struggling financially as the floods last month destroyed their rice crop and fields.Playing dhaks at various pandals in the capital could help these part-time drummers recoup financially. Train services in north Bengal were severely affected by the floods since August and this forced the dhakis to hire buses to travel to Delhi this year, spending an exorbitant amount of money on travel. ""My father and my younger brother too came to Delhi to earn more. We need money badly,"" reveals Gokul, a resident of Egra in Midnapore.With people struggling to cope with the aftermath of devastating floods, many drummers could not even decorate their dhaks with the distinct feather frills that give the Bengal drums their unique look. ""There are no more feathers available and we are completing some of our work here by replacing feathers (usually dropped by Siberian cranes during winter season) with pieces of plastic. It has been really bad for us these days, some of our drums were also damaged due to the floods,"" says Malda resident Rabi Das, who is waiting on a footpath outside the New Delhi Kali Bari for a Durga Puja organiser to offer him a contract. Perhaps, this is the last time Rabi will play the dhaak during Durga Puja as he plans to sell his instrument to meet his expenses.The floods also forced some of the dhakis to cut trees growing on their land to make new drums. They usually save Rs 5,000 through the year for travel and stay in Delhi. ""We are staying at the New Delhi Kali Bari to save on expenses this time,"" says Ranjit Das , who has been hired for Chittaranjan Park B-block Durga Puja. He and his fellow drummers will earn Rs 12,00015,000 for five days.The traditional musicians are struggling as younger people are not keen on following a poorly paid career and competition from recorded music is eating into their income. ""Playing the dhak needs a lot of energy and also calls for a lot of movement and dancing, which most people do not wish to pursue. This is a dying profession, which even my children would not pursue until there is some incentive,"" says Prashanto Das, resident of Bolpur in Birbhum district. ""We've agreed to pay them more due to their plight. This is afestival of happiness, we don't want them to go back with gloom,"" said Swapan Ganguly , from the New Delhi Kali Bari Durgotsav Committee."

They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

Outdoor illumination is not only crucial in making a town safe and functional after dark, it also indicates celebration,"" he says.The neighborhood, especially Broad Street, the thoroughfare leading to the stadium, has suddenly transformed into a vivid landscape, ignited by lighting fixtures. Everything -from the rice lights spiraling the tridants and the spotlights flashing atop trees to the newly-installed lamp posts -has given a visual upgrade to Salt Lake.The luminosity extends to the boulevards, that have been recently built, and the renovated older ones.

5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

A total of 69 species of butterflies belonging to 54 genera and five families were recorded from the study area. Family Nymphalidae was the most dominant among the five families with 22 species, followed by Lycaenidae, comprising of 19 species, the paper titled A study of butterfly diversity in Singur says.Five of the species found in Singur are rare and to be protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They include species like the Tree Flitter, Striped Albatross, Pea Blue, Common Indian Crow and Danaid Eggfly. The other interesting species found here include the Zebra Blue, the Common Banded Peacock and the Indian Skipper.The paper, authored by researchers Pritam K. Dey, Arajush Payra and Krishnendu Mondal, was published in June 2017 in the environmental journal e- planet . The study was carried out from March 2015 to November 2016, and most butterflies were observed between 8 a.m. and noon.Detailed study in futureThe presence of 69 species of butterflies in Singur points out that the butterfly diversity of the region is high. This is a preliminary study. More detailed studies in future can bring out more species. What is striking about Singur is that the area is not only rich in butterfly diversity but also in the diversity of frogs and birds, Mr. Dey said.Researchers found butterflies in the rice and vegetable fields of the area, as well as in bushes and shrubs along railway lines and National Highways.No forested landSingur has no forested land and the area is known for rice, potato and vegetable cultivation.Mr. Dey said that more intensive studies on different ecological parameters that can help access diversity of Singurs fauna are being planned.The presence of so many species of butterflies has provided a great deal of joy to the farmers who had waged a long battle against the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) led West Bengal government against the acquisition of 997 acres of agricultural land for Tata Motors Nano car plant in Singur.While our struggle was aimed at the return of the land acquired for the proposed car plant, we are happy that it has helped the environment of Singur. There would have not so many butterflies had the car plant been operational, said Mahabdeb Das, a farmer who was at the forefront of the land acquisition struggle. He was pleasantly surprised to learn about the butterfly diversity of the region.On August 30, 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the Left Front governments acquisition of 997 acres of land for the car plant in Singur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee returned the acquired land to farmers on September 14, 2016."

The sources of these primary pollutants are power plants, vehicles, industries, and bio-mass burning.With a projected rise in man-made pollution including surface ozone, researchers said the findings are important since a decrease in crop yield in India, which is the second populous country, will have a serious impact on its food security and economic growth.Wheat and rice are important crops for India since they form a staple diet, said professor Shyam Lal, principal investigator, PRL. Photosynthesis takes place during the day. When ozone molecules, which are generated in the presence of sunlight, get into the plant cells, the plant gets affected and can get damaged.Previous studies have calculated the annual loss of wheat crop in the range of 5% to 30%, and between 2.1% and 16 % for rice yields. However, these high estimates were based on either limited observations  restricted to some states only  or regional and global chemistry transport models.Ozone is a very new phenomenon in India now, and ozone levels are rising. The findings are important, as we now know from different sources of the impact of surface ozone on vegetation and crops, in addition to health. This means that pollution is ultimately reaching food security, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, who was not involved in the study. Ozone reduction strategies have to become an important policy focus now.The present study, drawn from data on surface ozone recorded at 17 locations across India, has found that general pattern of ozone variability shows higher ozone in AprilMay, lower in August and again increasing in October November.This is because high pollution levels and strong sunlight especially between March and May results in high levels of surface ozone damaging crops. Low surface ozone levels recorded during winter months when pollution levels are high but sunlight is low will either not damage crops or the loss is less.Though there is a permissible human exposure level for surface ozone set by the Central Pollution Control Board, there are no safe levels prescribed for plants.For the study, researchers used two internationally adopted methods to assess the exposure of crops to surface ozone  average ozone levels for seven hours during the day for three-month cropping period and second, accumulated ozone levels that exceed 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) over the same period.[S2] In the present study, exposure to wheat in the north and west-central regions of India crossed the average surface ozone 40 ppbv threshold between January and March. The North Indian region includes Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, while west-central regions comprise Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Average ozone levels during the wheat crop duration of three months were highest in the west/central region at about 47 ppbv followed by north India at about 41 ppbv. The corresponding accumulated ozone levels recorded in the west was 16,300 ppbv*hr and it was about 7,200 ppbv*hr in the north. However, a major part of the wheat crop is grown in north India only.The damage to rice though lower was also pronounced in northern and western-central parts of the country. The seasonal average ozone levels in the north and west-central were 33 ppbv and 27 ppbv  and the corresponding accumulated ozone levels in both these regions were 4730 ppbv*hr and 3400 ppbv*hr.Researchers said as compared to wheat, crop loss for rice is less because surface ozone levels are lower as the main harvesting period is soon after the summer monsoon. Also average surface ozone levels are lower in the eastern and southern regions of India where large quantity of rice is grown.India has two cropping seasons  Kharif and Rabi. Sowing for rice, a kharif crop, takes place between June and July, and its harvested from September to October. Wheat is a rabi crop that is sown between November and December, and harvested from February to April.North India logged the highest annual loss of about 9 MT of wheat. For rice, the maximum loss of about 2.6 MT every year was recorded from the countrys eastern region of Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Assam, and Jharkhand.With pollution levels set to rise further including levels of surface ozone, international studies have predicted higher losses for wheat and rice for India by 2030.Ozone is a very reactive gas, and while it is very harmful for health it also has a huge impact on vegetation. Ozone will increase if emissions of gases from combustion of sources such as vehicles and industries increase. If you have to control ozone, then need to control emissions from nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, said Roychowdhury.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that wheat, 73% of which is cultivated in north India alone, should be sown as early as possible starting November so that it is grown in the period when ozone is relatively lower.Wheat and rice cultivars, which have resistance to ozone damage, need to be developed. We would like to suggest policy makers to work out plans to reduce air pollution, particularly in the northern India. This will take care not only of the losses of the crops but also health of the public, read the study.."

So was the distribution of sweet rice (pongal) and free food.No untoward incidents were reported thanks to the Madras high court Madurai bench order turning down the organisers' request to allow hired vehicles to the memorial. Police had been on their toes apprehending trouble if the court allowed hired vehicles.Thousands of people from across the state as well as from other states including Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal arrived on about 2,000 vehicles and government buses arranged by the Tamil Nadu state transport corporation to the Thevar memorial. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami , deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and ministerial colleagues, opposition leader M K Stalin , leaders of other political parties and communal outfits paid their respects. As is the custom, all leaders garlanded the Thevar statue at Goripalayam in Madurai before proceeding to Pasumpon.A majority of the visitors came along with family members to pray before the Thevar. R Surya Moorthy (45), who belongs to the Mudukulatur community and works in the state electricity department, was accompanied by his three children who had their heads tonsured to fulfil their vow. ""We are strong believers of Thevar. He is like a god to us. I have been attending the Thevar guru puja since my childhood,"" he said.The three-day celebrations which started on Friday last has been by and large peaceful except for tearing of banners put up by the ruling AIADMK, allegedly by supporters of sidelined AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran. There was also a tussle between police personnel on one side and supporters of Dhinakaran and Moovendar Munnetra Kazhagam's Sridhar Vandaiyar on the other."

During the auspicious month of Kartika, the soaring vegetable prices has hit the common man hard. During Kartika, most people avoid non-vegetarian food owing to religious beliefs.According to reports, the cheapest vegetable available in the market is ivy gourd (kunduri), which is priced at Rs 26 per kg. Brinjal and ladies finger cost Rs 50 and Rs 60 per kg, respectively. While beans come at a price of Rs 70 per kg, tomato is priced at Rs 60 per kg. Potato, the most popular vegetable, is being sold at Rs 16 per kg, thereby eating into the budget of the common man.The prices of vegetables are so high that I am contemplating to sell the rice, which I get at Rs 1 per kg, for my daily needs, said Prafulla Malik, a BPL villager of Gopabandhupur in the district. For him, selling the BPL rice is the only option as his daily earning is not enough to buy vegetable for his six-member family. Similar is the plight of several below poverty line families who are feeling the pinch of high vegetable price.For middle class families, non-vegetarian food has become a cheaper option. But we cannot afford to have non-vegetarian food daily, said Kathia Jena of Rajpur.The worst-hit are vegetarian hotels of the district. Dipu Nayak, owner of a vegetarian hotel, said, For the last few days, I am incurring a loss of Rs 500 on a daily basis. Now, I feel compelled to include non-vegetarian food in the menu to retain my customers.According to local traders, the vegetable market here depends on neighbouring States such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Due to hike in prices of vegetables there, the market here has been affected, they said.The demand for vegetables has increased in the wake of marriage season and this is another reason for the price hike, said Valu Khanaa, a vegetable vendor. Sources in the Regulated Market Committee said vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh are sold in Bhadrak town daily. The sales double during marriage season.Sources said vegetable farming is being hardly given any importance in the district with over 95 per cent of vegetables being imported from other States. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bhadrak, Tankadhar Behera said due to lack of storage and irrigation facilities, farmers show little interest in vegetable farming."

But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?An exaggeration in the press has lit a fire under khichdi, which is being promoted by the government as a Brand India food (whatever that means) that is valued all over the country. This weekend, a celebrity chef will promote the brand by cooking up 800 kg of khichdi in a single pan at India Gate, in an attempt for a Guinness Book record. His weighty creation will be distributed to diplomats, to sit uneasily on their kitchen counters alongside the tagliatelle and the sashimi or whatever, according to nationality. In British diplomatic kitchens, it could also go eye to eye with its estranged relation, kedgeree, a colonial breakfast dish chiefly featuring smoked haddock, often eaten cold, thereby transgressing three khichdi taboos.But when was the last time you went in search of a nice khichdi? It is the Brand India food only by government diktat. Had the choice been left to the masses, biryani (mutton, chicken or veg with lurid pink sauce, according to taste) would have won hands down. Like khichdi, biryani has a nationwide footprint. The clincher is that one clearly recalls when one last went looking for a biryani, and firmly resolves to do it again. As soon as possible.But then, even commentators with deep experience of biryani have spoken up for khichdi. In the 14th century, Ibn Batuta wrote of a kishri made of rice and moong dal. The Mughals were not averse to it, either, and Abul Fazl recorded seven variations on the theme. The dish is politically salad bowl-like, in the sense that every region has its own variant, from the khichuri of West Bengal to the pongal of Tamil Nadu.

5a1518099855b76bf13eaeb2,Branding the humble Khichdi cooks up mishmash of a debate,http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2017/nov/05/branding-the-humble-khichdi-cooks-up-mishmash-of-a-debate-1692210.html,2017-11-05,"New Delhi: Its not often that a common mans food becomes fodder for debate on social media and the Internet. But thats exactly what the humble khichdi has done these past few days.A day after union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal christened khichdi as the Brand India Food on November 1, it began topping Twitter trends and became a much-searched word on the Internet, according to Google Trends. Heated debates started on the elevated status summarily thrust on the dish as well as the point of doing so.But as this khichdi was cooking, The Sunday Standard was left wondering whether an over-ambitious attempt had been made to define India, a land of over 1.3 billion people with widely varying taste buds, by a single dish.Harsimrats announcement set off a flurry of heated debates, unending speculation and conflicting opinions over the culinary identity of India and the unilateral attempt to define its food by one dish. Regardless, khichdi basked in new-found glory as the Prime Minister inaugurated World Food India on November 3, a three-day event aimed at attracting $10 billion in investment.Alongside, naysayers had a field day lambasting the minister for her announcement while supporters acknowledged the importance of making the dish a brand ambassador. In the last few days, khichdi has possibly been spoken of more than it has been eaten.While I enjoy khichdi, to make it a Brand India dish is an overestimation. It is a certainly a comfort food, but not Indias favourite comfort food. Such generalizations are inaccurate and take away from our pluralistic essence, said Gaurav Pathan, a rice mill worker whose factory is on the outskirts of Delhi, near Sonipat.Social media, meanwhile, went on overdrive. Khichdi to be national dish. Why? Is the nation ill? said one. Do I have to stand up when I eat khichdi now that it is a national dish? was another. Why khichdi? I would want aloo methi to finally get its due, said yet another.But between wit and humour lies a deeper narrative of how fundamentally undemocratic such decisions are. Raju Mohapatra, a diamond sorter in Karol Bagh, said, I dont understand how one person in power suddenly gets up and starts deciding things on behalf of the country. Was there a poll, a study done to conclude that khichdi is the most-liked comfort food?Piyush Jain, chef at Molecule restaurant, said that if khichdi was popular, so were biryani, pulao, chicken curry and dal tadka. So, to say that khichdi is the only dish that can represent Indias food tradition is incorrect, he said.Two days after elevating the khichdi from a sick mans food to a national delicacy, Harsimrat said her intention was to replace the curry with khichdi as the quintessential Indian dish.But isnt replacing one dish by another fatuous? In a few years, khichdi will become the new curry. Will we once again think of something new? asked Santosh Kumar, a sales representative with an electronics company.He is exasperated at the remark that khichdi is a neutraliser. I lived in Telangana for 13 years where I was working at a light manufacturing company. There, I was introduced to the regions famous kheema khichdi. Its a rich rice dish made with basmati rice, lentils, meat and chicken stock. Are these ingredients affordable to the poor?It is important to understand that the dish doesnt remain in its humble form in every region, and therefore, cannot be the staple. Besides, has everyone forgotten that dal, a main component of khichdi, is often out of the reach of the poor? asked Kumar.Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who has been curating Food Street, an experience zone within World Food India 2017, begged to differ. Khichdi has been celebrated and relished for years in India. From khichuri in West Bengal to Ven Pongal in Kerala, khichdi has united India in geographical expanse with its flavour and recipes through dynasties.It is definitely one of the most loved dishes in India and the world record only aims at making it popular on an international level. Therefore, its declaration as the Brand India food is fair, he said.Indias distinctness has always been its diversity. Flavours from the North, South, East and West have all contributed to create its globally loved cuisine. So, was it inappropriate to grant a single dish such exalted status?"

It also provides comfort to customers about the authenticity of that product, National Intellectual Property Organisation president T.C. James said."
5a5333b09855b770e037e1fd,Demonetisation and Tughlaq Modi,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/641638/demonetisation-tughlaq-modi.html,2017-11-08,"DH News Service, Bengaluru, Nov 8 2017, 19:40 ISTGauri Lankesh, the Kannada journalist gunned down on September 5, had responded to the note ban with a special edition of her weekly magazine and this editorial. PM Modi demonetised Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8, 2016.Narendra Modi has revealed his Tughlaq face. Claiming to wage war against black money, he has gone to war against the middle class and the poor, who constitute a majority. By demonetising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes, he has mocked them as cheats and dubbed as thugs people without a morsel to eat. This special edition looks at many aspects of his demonetisation madness.Bizarre stories made the rounds on social media last week. Some claimed the new Rs 2,000 note would have a nano chip to enable the government to monitor how the money was being spent. The income tax authorities, or so the stories said, would use satellites to locate and raid those hoarding new notes. The stories claimed the notes could be tracked even if they were buried 120 metres below the earth. Zee News in Hindi and a Kannada channel zealously put out imaginary stories. One of the anchors was bouncing up and down in delight like the pontiff of the Pejawar math. The woman presenter who seconds him went to the extent of proclaiming the note featured a picture of the Mars mission to indicate how satellites would keep an eye on the currency.The stories spread like wildfire. Last week, when I boarded a train to Hubballi, all my fellow passengers were talking about the chip. Taken aback at their naivete, I said, Its all a lie. Theres no such chip in the note. Two middle-aged men, sceptical about me, said the news had appeared on TV. Not everything that appears on TV is true, I said. They countered me: they had heard such notes were already in circulation in the US. Who told you? There are no such notes anywhere in the world, I said. What is the use of demonetisation then? one of them asked. Give it some thought, I said. A young man on a top berth butted in: You know what use it is? Big industrialists have borrowed money and are not paying back their loans. The banks have no money. That's why they are out to make people deposit their money. And people are taking their old notes to the banks, afraid they will turn out worthless otherwise.You mean this wont solve the black money problem? one of the men said. It will take care of fake currency for a while. But its extent isnt big. Within months, they will start making counterfeits of the new notes. The corrupt keep their wealth in jewellery and property, not cash. Only a small amount gets demonetised. In any case, we will never get, as Modi had promised, Rs 15 lakh in each of our bank accounts, I said.Oh, we thought Modi was on to something big. Looks like he has just put his hands into our pockets, a man said, sighing.The State Bank of India has just written off loans it had advanced to 63 companies. Know how much they owed? A whopping Rs 7,016 crore. This includes the Rs 1,201 crore owed by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. It isnt difficult to guess on whose side Modi is: the affluent who borrowed for their fancies and whose loans he has waived or the millions of hard-working people standing in long bank queues to deposit money they have earned.Modi has not been able to bring black money stashed away abroad. He hasnt even been able to name the secret account holders. His election promise of Rs 15 lakh in each citizens account remains a pipe dream. Even if we put up with such scams, how can we look on as he snatches away the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class?An elderly man waiting to take out money for his daily expenses has died. And how did a BJP vice-president respond to it? Big deal. People die even in ration shop queues.When it dawned on Modi that a majority was frustrated with his insane actions, he didnt say, Please bear with me. I will fix the problem in a few days. Instead, he said, Im doing all this for the nation. People who have ruled us for 70 years are conspiring against me. No one in his party told him, But sir, when did these people, struggling to withdraw their own money, ever rule in these 70 years? How can they conspire against you?The middle class and people in the media, who had hailed demonetisation as Modis masterstroke, now see the machinations behind it. They are aware the new note holds no magic. It cant banish black money, and Modis eccentricities are causing them misery.Modi continues to say we must put up with all this in the interest of the nation, but the problem wont go away anytime soon. Common people will have to scrape and scrounge for cash at least for four months. Business has been affected badly. With no customers, fisherfolk and traders in West Bengal are in the doldrums. In Punjab, farmers have no cash to buy seeds. If they dont sow now, the prices of rice and wheat will go up soon. No money in hand, nothing to eat either is the fate of millions. All this thanks to Modi.The BJP is feeling the heat of the peoples anger. Party president Amit Shah has instructed MPs to put up flex boards praising Modis surgical strike against black money. They usually follow his instructions to the letter, but this time they arent paying him any heed. Except for an MP in Gujarat, no one has put up laudatory flex hoardings.Even people in Gujarat have turned against Modi. Assembly elections are coming up. Expecting praise, party workers holding pamphlets went towards citizens standing in a bank queue. They received blows instead!Allies such as the Akali Dal in Punjab and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are also turning their back on the BJP. Quite a few BJP leaders are openly criticising Modis actions in the presence of the media, though they are unwilling to speak on record. Even Modi is coming to know of the attrition he has generated. That is why he comes across as so fidgety on his tours.About 25 people have died across the country because of demonetisation. In Uttar Pradesh, a couple with old notes was turned away from a hospital and their daughter died as a consequence. A woman in Gujarat with old notes couldnt feed her two children; she hanged herself.In Kanpur, a young man had been trying for months to sell his property. On November 8, he finally received Rs 70 lakh in advance. When he heard of demonetisation the next morning, he suffered a heart attack and died. A woman in Telangana, who had sold her land for her husbands medical treatment and her daughters wedding, was told the cash was worthless. She committed suicide. In Udupi, a man standing in a long queue, waiting for his bank to open, died of a heart attack.Not one of these was a thug. Not one of them was an Adani, Ambani, Tata or Birla. They were honest middle-class people, farmers, homemakers, all earning their livelihood from honest toil. They ended up as victims of Modis grandiose war against black money. He is responsible for their deaths.In fact, Modi has launched no surgical strike against black money. What he has done is push helpless people to death. What better can we expect from Modis Tughlaq dispensation?[Excerpted from The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, edited by Chandan Gowda, and published by DC Books and Navayana, Delhi.Chandan Gowda says, The book brings together select political and cultural writings of the courageous activist-journalist.

Photo: HTKolkata: Rosogolla, the syrup-soaked spongy ball that has served as a gastronomic identity marker for the Bengali community for almost 150 years, just got recognition for its uniqueness.The Union ministry of commerce and industry on Tuesday recognised Banglar Rosogolla, the iconic sweet, as deserving of protection under geographical indication (GI), ignoring competing claims about its origin from neighbouring Odisha.Earlier this year, two exotic varieties of rice produced in small quantitiesTulaipanji and Govindabhogalso received similar protection under GI as unique products of West Bengal, but this went largely unnoticed. But the success with the ubiquitous rosogolla, at least 20 million pieces of which are produced every day, was sweet news, said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. It triggered celebrations in Kolkata.The recognition does not necessarily end the debate on the origins of the coveted sweet. Whereas a confectioner from Kolkata, Nabin Chandra Das, is known to be the inventor of rosogolla, people of Odisha have claimed that a variant of the sweet was offered to the deity at Puris Jagannath temple from much earlier.The GI recognition was widely seen as a victory over Odishas claim, but what the intellectual property authorities have recognised is the uniqueness of Banglar Rosogolla for its melt-in-the-mouth smoothness, spongy texture and the lightness of the sugar syrup in which it is dipped.Smooth and delicate feel in the mouth are the basic characteristics of Banglar Rosogolla, the state had said in its petition seeking GI protection. Hardness of Banglar Rosogolla is experimentally proven to be much lower than samples collected from other states, and the sugar concentration of the syrup is maintained at 30-40%, making it lighter than variants from other states.Though the states application for GI protection of Banglar Rosogolla was based on various physical and chemical parameters of the sweet, which are claimed to be consistent, sweetmeat makers actually go by their instinct, said Sumit Sundar Ghosh, director, Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar Pvt. Ltd, a fabled confectioner established in 1907.I am not sure the uniqueness can be maintained if people stopped to rely on their intuition and started to measure the ingredients or if production were to be mechanised, he added. At the same time, his firm was one of the early birds to start its own dairy farm to maintain product consistency. The quality of milk is paramount, determined by the fodder and the process of collection, he said.Back in 1994, the sweet maker from north Kolkata started to invest in its dairy farm. It now sprawls 100 acres, and produces 2,000-2,500 litres of milk a day, said Nitai Chandra Ghosh, Sumit Sundar Ghoshs father and a fifth generation confectioner. The farm has its own refrigerated trucks to carry the milk to Kolkata from Durgapur, 180 km away.Our rosogollas are made entirely out of the milk that we produce, he said. We still buy small quantities of milk but only to produce other sweets, which, for instance, need milk with higher fat content.Curding of milk to derive cottage cheese, or chhanathe main ingredient of rosogollastarted in eastern India under the influence of the Europeans, said Mani Shankar Mukherji, an author and historian. In 1868, confectioner Das invented the rosogolla in its current form capping several years of experiment after being thrown out of his ancestral business of sugar refining, said a scion of the family, Dhiman Das, also a director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd.Nabin Chandra Das built his business on the strength of the rosogolla, whose popularity spread beyond the neighbourhood of his store in north Kolkata from the 1870s. K.C. Das helped spread the sweet outside Kolkata by creating a long-life variant sold in cans from 1930. Now there are 16 K.C. Das stores in Bengaluru, compared with only five in Kolkata, said Dhiman Das."

While the intelligentsia stood mute witness when people of West Bengal and Odisha made a mountain of a sweet last week, there were sane voices dubbing it a useless fight.""It is 'Banglar rasogolla', and not rasogolla, which has been GI-tagged in favour of a West Bengal government agency. Odisha, which never filed its objections before the Geographical Indications (GI) registry in the first place, can apply for its own unique Odishara rasogolla,"" said advocate and IPR attorney P Sanjai Gandhi, who wrote to the Odisha chief minister about the option.So, why so much fuss about GI and is it worth the fight? India is full of unique agricultural, handicraft, handloom and food items  both natural and manufactured  which are worthy of being given a special status. This would enable people making or growing the products to exploit them commercially. The very objective of GI tagging is to identify unique characteristics of a product, trace its territorial significance and give it a statutory protection, so that no bogus goods flood the market and tarnish the reputation of centuries.Tamil Nadu is home to 22 GI-tagged products which includes Kancheepuram silk, said Sanjai Gandhi, who applied and got the recognition for the handloom product. Pointing out that GI tag is not for 'silk' per se, he said arni silk and Salem white silk too got their own GI tagging. Rasogolla, therefore, could take the 'silk route' to avoid confrontation and peaceful co-existence.Of course, the issue of GI-tagging basmati rice is now mired in a massive litigation before the GI Registry and courts because a few districts of Madhya Pradesh were not considered. It could mean a big loss to Madhya Pradesh, unless it is either clubbed with other Basmati-growing areas of central India, or it manages to have its own GI-tagged Basmati brand.Real threats to the nation's artistic, cultural and culinary legacy may come from other nations. A brewing conflict between India and Bangladesh over GI tag for 'khadi' is a fine example. While Chennai-based Intellectual Property Rights Attorneys Association (IPRAA) has sought GI status for khadi, on behalf of all 29 states in India, Bangladesh has also submitted a similar application.IPRAA has now written to Bangladesh to withdraw its application because khadi is a quintessential handloom legacy of India. ""Instead of quibbling among ourselves, we must be alert to stave off threats from across the border,"" said Sanjai Gandhi, president of IPRAA, adding that the Indian government has done little to prevent exploitation and false claim over 'khadar' in foreign countries. Even Basmati is being branded by private parties and marketed in many countries, but India has not yet filed formal revocation applications in those countries to prevent their misuse.Ideally, India should be sitting on hundreds of GI tags for its products by now. But the total GI-tagged products in the country are only about 200. While Karnataka leads the bunch with 34 GI products, it is followed by Maharashtra (26) and Odisha (23). The fourth slot is jointly held by Tamil Nadu and Kerala, with 22 GI products each. There will be a dramatic increase in Tamil Nadu's tally in coming months, as it has filed applications for 29 different products. They are pending before the GI registry, and products that are likely to get GI-tagged by middle of next year include Manamadurai ghatam (mud pot-drum), Tuticorin macarons, Kovilpatti groundnut mittai and rice garland of Thanjavur.GI is a crown of thorn, too. Once an association or society earns it, judiciously exploiting it even while guarding it against misuse is tough. Darjeeling tea and its authorised users are examples. Users of the brand are alert against misuse and they have filed revocation petitions in several countries to safeguard the uniqueness of the tea. It has had a telling effect on the fortunes of tea-growers of Darjeeling, as they alone are reaping the benefits of their product.That is the idea. GI regime is designed to help genuine makers of products go laughing all the way to the bank, without compromising on the quality of the product. GI holds out no empty threat to violators. In case of GI infringement or false claim, there is a fine of Rs50,000 to Rs2 lakh, and jail term from six months to three years."
5b27f1b69855b720524c2bf5,GI Jane and the conquest of rasogollas,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/gi-jane-and-the-conquest-of-rasogollas-190543?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-03,"Prasun ChaudhuriBELONGINGS: (From top) The madur of Midnapore awaits its GI tag; rasogollas being preparedin a Calcutta shop; PIC: SUBHENDU CHAKIThe nondescript five-storey building in Calcutta's satellite town of Salt Lake is buzzing with excitement. It is 10am, and the third and fourth floors that house the offices of the Patent Information Centre (PIC) of the West Bengal State Science & Technology Council, are ringing with celebrations. Only minutes ago, application number 533 at the Geographical Indications Registry of the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks, Chennai, has had a significant status update. It has moved from ""Examination"" to ""Registered"". Put simply, West Bengal's rasogolla has got itself the geographical indication (GI) tag.There is a queue of media professionals outside scientist and patent expert Mahuya Hom Chowdhury's office. She and her team have laboured for the past two years for the tag.What does she make of all talk of Bengal trumping Odisha? The bespectacled scientist's voice is a bit hoarse from all the talking, but she is patient, only too willing to explain the implications of the recent development. She says, ""A GI tag is nothing to fight over. It's a mark of assurance of authenticity and original source of a product. The ultimate goal is to tap the market potential for these products."" And though she doesn't support the Bengal versus Odisha rant, she believes media coverage helped raise awareness about geographical indication. ""The next step is to use the tag for quality enhancement of a product and market it properly to improve income of weavers, artisans or sweet-makers.""It's not just the rasogolla. From mangoes to sweetmeats, rice to saris and handicraft items, more than a dozen products from Bengal have been granted a GI tag since Hom Choudhury assumed charge of the PIC. The government employee refuses to be photographed, alone or with her team - permissions have to be in place. She stresses, however, that the Trinamul government supported the team all the way in this patent endeavour. Several NGOs have also worked closely to bring about the GI revolution in the state.""When I joined the patent office in 1999, GI and patent culture was yet to develop across the country,"" says Hom Choudhury. To learn more about the art of patent drafting and GI filing, she decided to be a patent attorney. ""I learnt the intricacies (of patenting). I also understood the importance of protecting our traditional heritage as well as recognising the intellectual property of our grassroots innovators. Bengal has a huge repository of heritage products that need to be protected,"" she adds.It so happened that Odisha didn't apply for a GI for the rasogolla. But when it comes to the overall GI score, the two states are on equal footing with a score of 15 registered GIs each.According to Hom Choudhury, filing an application for a GI or patent is an art. ""You need to know both the scientific and legal aspects of a product. Also, one needs to collect a whole lot of data from the producers,"" adds Paromita Sen, a junior scientist who works at the PIC.Dhiman Das is director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd. His great-great-grandfather is said to have invented the rasogolla in 1868. He says, ""Applying for GI is not an easy job. You need to furnish a whole lot of historical documents, make a detailed presentation. We produced the document, which was efficiently presented by Dr Hom Choudhury and her team.""Adds Jagannath Ghosh, the Calcutta-based secretary of Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, the association of sweetmakers of Bengal, ""We provided several sets of samples from different sweet shops for chemical analysis following the advice of scientists at PIC. All of it was meticulously collated and presented by them.""A GI application needs to be filed to the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks. A consultative group on the product for which a GI tag has been sought meets to discuss the merits of it. If the panel is satisfied with the information, the application is advertised in the Geographical Indications Journal. This is an opportunity for all - individuals, organisations, states - to counter it. And the permitted time period is four months. After that, the product automatically gets a GI tag. A certificate from the GI Registry follows.The application in case of Banglar Rasogolla was filed in September 2015.There was no culture of patenting in India for a long while. Although Bengal had a rich legacy of intellectual property, scientists didn't want to profit from their research. That is why Jagadis Chandra Bose never filed a patent for the radio he invented. But Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi developed, demonstrated and marketed the wireless telegraph and got worldwide recognition.In the mid-1990s, India became a member of the World Trade Organization and the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights came into effect. Scientists slowly woke up to the importance of patenting their inventions. Also, with the introduction of new trade practices, the protection of trade names and trademarks used for food products of a particular geography came into practice. Sparkling wine of a particular area in France was recognised with a GI tag, after a prolonged and bitter legal battle between France and the US. There was a similar scuffle over Basmati between India, US and Pakistan.Hom Chowdhury was aware of these debates and discussions when she began her career in the patent office. At the time she had just completed her PhD in Food Technology from Jadavpur University. ""She'd been an extremely bright student here,"" says Professor Utpal Roy Choudhuri from the department of Food Technology and Biochemical Engineering. ""Her thesis was on extruded fish protein or utilisation of fish waste,"" he adds. Hom Chowdhury also went on to patent her invention, extruded snacks from waste food material. If that sounds complicated, she is not willing to elaborate further. ""I have plans to market the invention sometime in future. This will help create wealth out of food wastes,"" is all that she says.Hom Choudhury's basics in Food Technology helped her hone her skills as a patent specialist in the field. Before the rasogolla victory, she got the GI for Joynagarer Moa - prepared from date palm jaggery and puffed rice - Mihidana and Sitabhog from Burdwan. Two more sweetmeats - Sarpuria and Sarbhaja from Krishnagar - are expected to get the tag soon.Saikat Datta, general manager, District Industries Centre, Burdwan, worked with Hom Choudhury's team for patent applications for Mihidana and Sitabhog. ""We encouraged the manufacturers in Burdwan to form an association and follow a standardised process of manufacturing. Then we helped them apply for the GI tag,"" he says. They'd even gone to the GI registry office in Chennai to understand the procedure of application.But the first GI tags associated with her team have to do with three mango varieties - Laxmanbhog, Himsagar and Fazli. This was followed by tags for traditional textiles, especially saris - Santipur, Baluchari and Dhaniakhali.In the field of agriculture, the PIC team is now focussing on varieties of indigenous rice that are becoming extinct as more and more farmers are gravitating towards high-yielding seeds. The first GI tags on agricultural products in the state were gained for two rice varieties - Gobindobhog and Tulaipanji. Prof. Mrityunjay Ghosh of the department of Agronomy, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani, says, ""We organised the scientific and historical documents and PIC scientists offered their legal expertise. They co-ordinated with the GI Registry office at Chennai.""Handicrafts is another area of focus for Hom Choudhury and her team. GI applications for five items - including Chhau dance masks from Purulia, madurs (grass mats) and patachitras (scroll paintings) from East Midnapore - have been submitted. ""The PIC team researched the legacy of these traditional crafts. We gave them information on the current status and details of craft hubs and practitioners,"" says Niloy Basu, the general manager of Banglanatok.com, a social enterprise that promotes indigenous craft and culture.Says Hom Choudhury, ""So far, so good. GI tag is just the beginning of a process to tap the immense potential of our treasures and improve quality. Now we need to go ahead to the next step in a more structured way to make things suitable for the international market."""

How green is the green here, in faraway Tamil Nadu, for the migrant labourers?On the occasion of International Migrants Day, to commemorate the Universal Declaration of Migrants Rights that was adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly of United Nations in 2000, a few migrant workers in the construction, hotel and spinning mill industries in Madurai district shared their experiences with Express.Nithesh (23), who is a cook in a hotel, said, I belong to a remote village in West Bengal and have been working here for the past three years. Nearly 100 people from our village came here looking for work. We are all illiterate and could not find jobs in our home States.How did they land up here in Madurai? We can cook Chinese items that seem to be in great demand in the hotels in Madurai. There are agents who brought us here. In fact, in every village, there are agents who offer us work outside our home base. They promise to get us jobs that will get us Rs 15,000 a month. Of course, the salary would vary, depending on the work. The agent will receive the salary and deduct 50 per cent as his commission. The arrangement may vary from agent to agent. Basically, there is no connection between the hotel employer and us, said Nithesh.About the working conditions, Nitesh said, From morning till the hotel is closed, we need to remain standing. Every day, I go to home with severe leg pain. I get a maximum of Rs 10,000 as monthly salary. I send Rs 8000 to my parents every month. I use the remaining amount for my expenses in the temple city.Accommodation is usually provided by the employer, continued Nithesh. Those working in the same hotel usually stay in one house together. We are given one months leave every year and we go to our native place. Those who work as cleaners and servers get very poor salaries, around Rs 3,000 a month. We dont get other benefits like Provident Fund, bonus and insurance. Though we have problems of language, discrimination, and poor working conditions, we take the job since it is helping our families get three meals a day.Lakshmi (18), a spinning mill worker in Madurai district, said, I come from a small village in Bihar. I am the first of five daughters. My father was an agriculture daily wage labourer. I dont have mother. About a year back, my father met with an accident and could not continue working. I took over earning for the family. I could not find any decent job in our village as I am uneducated. Nearly 80 girls in the 15 to 23 age group came here to work.I came with them. For the past eight months, I have been working here. The company has given us accommodation within the premises. They provide ration rice and some grocery, but they are not of good quality. There is no specific working time. We have to report to work whenever the supervisor calls us. Every month, we get Rs 3,000 as salary. We send Rs 2,000 home. We do not know the exact salary that we get and whether and how much the agents take.Sharma (35), a construction worker, had a similar tale to share. About 1000 workers from Uttar Pradesh came here with our families. We used to stay in a hut near the construction site. There were just no basic facilities. We do all sorts of work. If the employer paid the local labourer Rs 500 a day, we would get only Rs 400. Out of this around Rs 150 would go as commission to the agent, he narrated.Speaking to Express, K L Kumar, President, Madurai District Hotels Association, said, The agents supply labourers from the other states. They are in charge of everything. Nearly 10,000 migrant workers are employed in various positions in Madurai district hotels. We ask for their identity proof and share their details with the local police.We do not pay any commission to the agent. We hand over the salaries to the agents. Workers give a share to them. Depending on the nature of the work we pay the workers.But there are some other issues. Some mischief making, taking small amounts of cash from the cash counter and so on. If it happens, we approach the agent who arranges for a replacement. The agent takes care even when a worker goes on leave and we need a temporary replacement, explained Kumar."
5a53a4e99855b770e0381bbf,Arsenic poisoning is spreading. We need drastic steps to tackle it,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/arsenic-poisoning-is-spreading-we-need-drastic-steps-to-tackle-it/story-j9UyOujE9izHfaTWvVy9fP.html,2017-12-27,"In a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the Union ministry of water resources said 239 million people across 153 districts in 21 states drink water that contains high levels of arsenic.Thats around a fifth of the countrys population, and by any standards, thats an appalling statistic.The actual number could be higher. India pegs arsenic concentrations above 50 parts per billion as harmful; in the US, it is 10 parts per billion. Arsenic is one of the 10 chemicals classified as a public health concern by the World Health Organization; it slowly poisons the body, potentially causing skin lesions, damage to the peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal ailments, diabetes, renal (kidney) failure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At least half the people who were known to be at risk of arsenic contamination live in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh and India (across the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh).Groundwater contamination, Indias hidden crisisThe number of habitations affected by arsenic in India has increased from 3,728 in 2012-13 to 7,535 in 2015-16. This is because of the overuse of groundwater for irrigation and drinking. Arsenic previously occurred in a harmless insoluble conjugate with iron called arsenopyrite. Overuse has split this compound, contaminating groundwater with a soluble ionic form of arsenic. Over-exploitation of groundwater started in India in the 1970s when millions of tube wells were installed in the Ganga delta to prevent diarrhoea from surface water sources such as tanks, ponds and open wells. Today, India has over 30 million groundwater extraction points.Groundwater is also used for irrigation. This means arsenic poisoning affects not just the people of the area but also those who consume the produce of the affected region. In food, rice has the highest sensitivity to arsenic followed by vegetables. In most arsenic-affected states rice is the staple.Despite the crisis, groundwater contamination , either by arsenic or other pollutants such as fluorides, does not get the attention it deserves, especially when compared to surface water contamination because the latter is visible. Moreover, there is no law yet to check groundwater withdrawal.This severe environmental-health crisis has to be contained quickly before it can expand. Along with periodic testing of water in affected areas and individualised testing of each hand pump or tubewell (marking it as safe/unsafe), it is important to encourage people to opt for low-cost, local solutions such as rainwater harvesting that can ensure clean drinking water. States such as Bihar have set up filtration units but the maintenance of filters has always been a problem.This needs to be addressed. Additionally, governments have to curb the use of groundwater and keep a strict control on agricultural and industrial effluents that pollute aquifers that recharge groundwater."
