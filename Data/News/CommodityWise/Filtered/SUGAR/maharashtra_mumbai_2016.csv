58f1773da3d24b245e59a74b,Bappa’s new year gift for children of dead farmers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Bappas-new-year-gift-for-children-of-dead-farmers/articleshow/50403759.cms,2016-01-01,"This resolution will bring back the smiles in homes where tragedy once struck. The law and judiciary department has issued a government resolution (GR) stating that the Siddhivinayak Temple will fund the education of children of farmers who committed suicide after failing to deal with natural disasters like drought and heavy rainfall that damaged their yields.""We have received the GR and we have already sent a copy to all district collectors asking them to send the details of such farmers and their children,"" said Sanjeev Patil, chief executive officer of the Siddhivinayak Temple Trust. He added that the temple authorities had decided to fund the education of these children till graduation. ""Our committee is in the process of working out the criteria. Education of the children will be funded from the date that the GR has been issued,"" said Patil, adding that the cut-off year has not yet been decided.To begin with, the temple trust has set aside Rs 1 crore for the scheme that will be popularized as 'Siddhivinayak Scholarship Scheme'. The annual proceeds collected by the temple add up to Rs 65 crore. The temple currently implements several schemes like subsidized dialysis, donations for medical procedures etc. ""Farmer suicides have been a concern for the state since long. We had floated the idea of doing something for the education of the farmer's children and that is when this plan came about,"" said Patil, adding that the temple trust approached the government with the plan. After studying the possibilities, the GR was issued.Farm activist Kishore Tiwari, who is the president of Shetkari Sawalambhan Mission said that it is a good initiative by the temple trust. ""However, there are lakhs of farmers who are unable to fund the education of their children as they cannot afford it. Such farmers should be helped by the trust so that they don't take the drastic decision of ending their lives,"" said Tiwari, adding over 96 lakh farmer families have been affected due to drought in Maharashtra. Since 1997, Maharashtra has recorded 70,000 farmer suicides.In 2014, Maharashtra recorded 1981 farmer suicides and 1,296 cases in 2013. The arid region of Marathwada recorded 438 cases till June, accounting for 34 per cent of the total cases. The north Maharashtra belt has recorded 158 cases. The sugar bowl of western Maharashtra accounted for 32 cases while the Konkan region has reported only one case so far this year.However, only 55 per cent of the suicides recorded by the revenue department so far have been declared eligible for compensation. To be considered an ""eligible suicide"", the land has to be in the victim's name and there should be evidence of indebtedness. The government claims only these cases are linked to agrarian distress."

(Express Photo) Gyanba Pandurang at his farm in Baramati taluka. (Express Photo)Gyanba Pandurag Dhavan (62), who owns five acres of land in Baramati taluka of Pune district, has grown only sugarcane for the last 30 years.Like other residents of Malegaon Colony village in Baramati taluka, cane has been the staple crop thanks to assured returns and lower input costs. But this may well be the last cane season for Dhavan, as the farmer now says it is no longer financially viable. The local mills have defaulted and there is no assurance of water for the next season, he says,For farmers across the state, sugarcane has offered assured returns in the form of a Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP). Sugar mills across the state are bound by the Sugarcane Control Act, 1966, to pay FRP to the growers. Any violations attract penal action against the mills. Thanks to the political patronage given to the cane crop and to mills, it has remained a favoured crop. Baramati, the home town of former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, has also seen rapid expansion of cane cultivation as well as mushrooming of sugar mills. Thats also because farmers here never had to reckon with the problem of water, thanks to an extensive network of canals in this belt.However, as Dhavan puts it, there are now challenges with mills defaulting on payments and with worsening water scarcity. Dhavan had send around 90 tonnes of cane to the local Malegaon Cooperative Sugar Mill last year but is yet to receive the full payment. We were paid Rs 2,200 per tonne as the first installment, but the full payment is yet to reach us, he says. Dhavan had taken a bank loan of Rs 5 lakh and is now finding himself stretched to repay it. Agriculture is our only source of income but that is not feasible now, he says.Share This Article Related Article Bitter Truth: Early summer heat dries up recovery hopes for sugar in MaharashtraBitter Truth: Early summer heat dries up recovery hopes for sugar in Maharashtra Sugarcane: Average fair and remunerative price clocks four-year highSugarcane: Average fair and remunerative price clocks four-year high From bitter to sweet: Behtar din for sugarcane growers, finallyFrom bitter to sweet: Behtar din for sugarcane growers, finally Relief to sugar sector, no purchase tax next seasonRelief to sugar sector, no purchase tax next season Tackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling caneTackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling cane Failing farmers put all eggs in cane basketIn Baramati, water scarcity is a growing issue as parts of the state suffer one of its worst ever spells of drought. According to Dhavan, it has been three months since the canals passing by his fields had any water. I lost around 2 acres of cane due to lack of water. The dams are empty and there would be no water for the next season also, he says.For growing an acre of cane, Dhavan said he has to invest close to Rs 50,000. I have left my fields lie fallow and didnt plant cane for the upcoming year. We have planned to divert to gram instead as it has low water requirement. If that happens, it will be first time in three decades that Dhavans fields will not see a sugarcane crop.Asked if he would go back to cultivating cane later, Dhavan had says: Cane is the only crop which has assured returns. However, it is not viable any more. If the rains are good and there is good availability of water, maybe I would cultivate cane later on..For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Similarly, future prices for May and July 2016 closed at Rs 3,226 and 3,300 per tonne.Both prices and volume of sugar on the NCEDX market over the last few days have seen a high, but it has done little to change the fortunes of sugar mills in Maharashtra.Millers say the majority of trading that has pushed the prices of the commodity up is due to activity of traders who are now offloading the stock which they had purchased at lower prices earlier this year.On Wednesday, future price of Sugar for March 2016 trading at the NCDEX market closed at Rs 3,150 per tonne. Similarly, future prices for May and July 2016 closed at Rs 3,226 and 3,300 per tonne.It might be recalled that sugar prices in the market has been fluctuating with July prices having gone down to Rs 1,900 per tonne. Over the last few months, sugar price has been speculative with prices coming up in the last few months.Volume-wise, December saw trading of over 8 lakh tonnes of sugar valued at Rs 2422.21 crore. Sugar trading on NCDEX platform has been steadily increasing over the last few months. November saw trading of more than 5 lakh tonnes of sugar worth over Rs 1,525 crore while in October, around 7 lakh tonnes of sugar was traded valued at Rs 1,933.72 crore. Since July last year, the NCDEX exchange has seen trading of 35 lakh tonnes of sugar with valuation of Rs 9,318.41 crore.While the sugar market remains bullish, millers say it has failed to affect them in any manner.Last season, Maharashtra saw a record production of sugar at 105.06 lakh tonnes. This season, it is expected the sugar production of the state would touch 85 lakh tonnes due to drought and other factors.Failure of millers to pay the sugar cane growers the fair and remunerative price (FRP) meant the present crushing season started with cane arrears of over Rs 1,000 crore.Although the crushing season of 2015-16 has started with full force, as many as 51 mills have been issued notices by the sugar commissioner to clear dues of over Rs 300 crore, failing which their crushing licenses would be cancelled.The state produces 37 per cent of the total sugar produced in the country.Shivajirao Nagawade, chairman of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said the trading over the last few months have been dominated by traders. Taking advantage of the lower prices in July-August, traders had purchased the commodity and they are playing up the market now, he said.In most cases, he said, the sugar being traded was still in the mill godowns. The higher prices have failed to affect the mills. There is no lifting of sugar in the market, he said.Tenders floated by mills, he said, hardly had any takers as of now. All the trading happening now is speculative and it is making its effect on the market, he said.On an average, Maharashtra witnesses trading of around 6-7 lakh tonnes of sugar which has remained unchanged.Similarly, Madan Bhosale, chairman of the Satara-based KisanVeer Cooperative Sugar Factory, said the present trading is of the previous season with traders playing with the sentiments of the market.There is no mechanism to control such speculative trading in the markets, he said.It might be recalled speculative activities in case of pulses had also caused an artificial price rise in the market this year. Yogesh Pande, spokesperson of the Swambhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said speculative activities in the market were controlled by just a handful of traders on the commodity exchanges. Sugar will rise the pulse rate of the government in coming days if there is no intervention, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

58f11775a3d24b245e595c68,"UP highest producer of ethanol, beats Maharashtra",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/UP-highest-producer-of-ethanol-beats-Maharashtra/articleshow/50460418.cms,2016-01-06,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is here to 'drive' the country, quite literally. India's most populous state has pipped Maharashtra to become India's largest producer of ethanol for blending with petrol.According to a recent data of Union petroleum ministry, in 2015, UP produced 56 crore litres of ethanol against Maharashtra's 52 crores litres. The two states together accounted for nearly 67% of country's total ethanol production of around 161 crore litres a year. They are followed by Karanataka (25 cr litres), Andhra (8.5 cr litre), Gujarat (8 cr litres) and Tamil Nadu (7.6 cr litres).The surge in ethanol production in the state was driven largely by UP's sugar industry. Data shows distilleries in sugar mills, like the one in Saharanpur and Basti, contributed maximum by producing around 4 crore litres each. Likewise, the Muzaffarnagar sugar mill and Mawana sugar mill produced 3.6 crore litre and 2.8 crore litres, respectively.UP has 61 distilleries, out of which 36 are attached to sugar mills. Not surprisingly, all 36 mills chipped in for ethanol production.Of the total 56 crore litres of ethanol production, UP is expected to use 30 crore litre for its own consumption, leaving rest to be exported to Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Industry sources said an increase in ethanol production was largely a fallout of a sharp plunge in prices of raw sugar last year.Industry sources said millers gradually started diverting cane juice for production of the 'clean fuel' that fetched them relatively higher profit. Petroleum companies, which lift ethanol from distilleries, paid them at the rate of Rs 48.5 per litre . This was sufficiently higher than prices of sugar which kept falling following a glut.This got another boost earlier this year when Centre decided to waive off excise duty on ethanol for the financial year 2015-16. An excise duty of 14% is charged on per litre of ethanol.The industry, however, has been complaining of procedural difficulties and delays in obtaining permits/no-objection certificate from the excise department. ""This delays the movement of ethanol, which in turn results in depriving the state exchequer of its legitimate revenue,"" said a miller.When contacted, UP cane commissioner Ajay Kumar Singh said there has been a demand for more administrative convenience by the industry. ""The state government is looking into it,'' he said, while speaking to TOI. Singh said the ethanol was certainly a big sector that needs to be looked into.Centre in August had decided to boost ethanol production by making 10% blending with petrol mandatory in its efforts to resolve the sugar imbroglio. UP government too is reported to have been mulling to adopt a concept wherein part of cane juice may be diverted for production of ethanol."

Belagavi city, which has common boundaries with Goa and Maharashtra, is being developed on the lines of a second capital of the State. It is connected by the railways, national highways and air. It is rich with a vast pool of educated and skilled human talent, with two government universities and one in the private sector offering undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in engineering, medicine and business management.Although Belagavi is regarded as the best among the tier two cities in the State, the pace of progress has not been as expected due to the slow pace of infrastructure developments, which was fundamental to attract large investments. A major problem that has been discouraging industrial growth is the shortage of good quality and uninterrupted power supply, the lifeline for growth in both the agriculture sector and industry.Ongoing developments include major roads that have been taken up for widening, construction of railway over-bridge and proposed flyover aimed at decongesting vehicular traffic in the city. The government has approved 24 x 7 drinking water supply project for all the 58 wards in the Belagavi City Corporation limits and the city is competing to be among the first 20 cities to be developed under the Smart City project of the Union government.An inland container depot at Desur, about 18 km from the city, a Government Tool Room Centre to provide technical cues and training, 13 industrial areas, a foundry cluster, hydraulics and automobile body building industries, a SEZ in aerospace engineering near Hattargi form an established infrastructure facility in the district."

Though I dont share your partys Hindutva ideology, I am your admirer. In you, the state has got a youthful, studious chief minister with a clean image and transparent sincerity. People of Maharashtra want you to succeed. But succeed in what?I have a small wish list of two.Vidarbha and Marathwada regions in Maharashtra, with nearly 45 million population, deserve your highest attention. Farmers suicides  largest in the world, Naxalism and tribal unrest, child malnutrition and mortality, water scarcity and drought in these regions are manifestations of the underlying imbalance in political power and economic development of five decades. You have openly stated your commitment to undo this injustice. How?A Constitutional amendment, Article 371(2), protects the welfare of Vidarbha and Marathwada. Under this, the governor of Maharashtra appointed in 2011 the high-level Kelkar Committee to suggest solutions for the problem of imbalance in regional development in the state. You, as the leader of all party MLAs from Vidarbha, made an impressive and convincing presentation before the committee. It is still fresh in my memory.The Kelkar Committee has recommended several deep structural and financial reforms. These include devolution of administrative and financial power to the regions, a fund allocation formula to correct the development deficit in Vidarbha and Marathwada, measures to encourage the growth of industry and agriculture in these two regions, solutions to the problem of water scarcity and the irrigation deficit, creation of new districts and talukas with a tribal majority, and implementation of the PESA Act empowering the tribal villages.Your government has a singular opportunity to solve multiple problems in one stroke. Lead the state in implementing these recommendations. Even the Shiv Sena, hopefully, will not oppose them because this might be the only way to avoid the otherwise inevitable division of the state.Another problem is insidiously eroding Maharashtras main capital  the human capital. The state population is known for its intelligence, culture and enlightenment. However, it is celebrating the New Year with a week drowned in alcohol. People annually drink liquor worth Rs 50,000 crore. The state is unofficially governed by an alcohol empire which has permeated the political power in villages and towns, in the sugar industry, in political parties and finally made even the state government dependent on the revenue earned from liquor. In a recent debate on Zee TV, your excise minister replied to me that this year he hoped to collect Rs 21,000 crore from the sale of alcoholic drinks. No government should be proud of this dubious achievement.The Global Burden of Disease study counts alcohol among the top four causes of diseases. Women are insecure if men are drunk (remember the Nirbhaya episode). The youth has started drinking at the age of 15 years.I am sure you do not want the state to go the Punjab way. I hope the voices of women from different parts of the state  Chandrapur, Yavatmal, Buldhana, Ahmednagar, Satara, Kolhapur  loudly protesting against liquor are reaching you. What should you do about this corrosive problem?The World Health Assembly has resolved in 2009 that the member countries should institute policies and measures to reduce the harm caused by alcohol. France, Italy and Russia have introduced the measures and reduced consumption. Recently in India, the states of Kerala and Bihar have announced a decision to introduce prohibition. What will the enlightened state of Maharashtra do?I suggest that Maharashtra should adopt a policy which protects the long-term welfare, health and development of the people. Adopt a policy of incremental reduction in liquor availability and consumption in the state. Twenty percent reduction per year will give everybody the required time to adjust.Moreover, the three districts  Wardha, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur  where the government has already introduced prohibition should see an effective implementation. You have already approved such a plan for Gadchiroli district. I congratulate you for that.In the end, a personal request. Do take care of your own health. You are young, but your inhuman time schedule and excruciating pressures worry me. Maharashtra needs you for a longer innings.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
5935a7107be9e061bdcfed29,"A postcard from Ajit Ranade: Happy New Year, CM Fadnavis",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/a-postcard-happy-new-year-cm-fadnavis/,2016-01-07,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (Source: Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar) Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (Source: Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar)By Ajit RanadeDear Mr Fadnavis,Maharashtra is a study in contrasts. It is a rich state, yet beset by poverty. Industrial, yet plagued by agriculture woes. Has plenty of power capacity, yet has large-scale power cuts. Gets heavy downpour on the Konkan belt, yet is highly drought-prone. It is the highest contributor to national GDP and 15 per cent of industrial output. It is near the top of the charts in per capita income. But in poverty statistics, it is not even in the top ten. It has excellent connectivity, with all-weather pucca roads connecting 99 per cent of its villages and towns. But intra-regional disparity is huge. The per capita income in Gadhchiroli district is only one-fourth of that in the Mumbai region. Maharashtra is one of the most urbanised states in the country, and its cities are a magnet for intra- and inter-state migration. But its cities are not sufficiently empowered to build their own infrastructure or fund their activities. The Local Body Tax legislated to replace age-old, inefficient, corruption-prone octroi has been suspended. The state does have a healthy record in decentralised governance, but it simply isnt enough for its mammoth size. The urban-rural divide is so extreme that if you take only rural areas, the Human Development Index puts it in the bottom five among major states. Ten of its 36 districts figure among the 100 most backward districts of India.The industrial production of the state is also highly concentrated, with just three districts accounting for almost 50 per cent of the total for the state. Even the rain gods shower their blessings unequally. The coastal Konkan region receives on average 400 cm of rains, but just 100 km to the east, the rain shadow region of Sahyadri receives barely 70 cm. The state as a whole is mostly drought-prone, with a maximum irrigation potential of barely 20 per cent. Two crops illustrate the problems plaguing agriculture in Maharashtra: cotton associated with farmers suicides; and sugarcane, which is grown on 3 per cent of the land, consumes 60 per cent of the irrigation water, and is bought by mostly financially sick sugar mills.The public finances of the state are also in a worrisome state. The state debt at about Rs 3 lakh crore is growing faster than its nominal GDP. More than half of the annual state budget goes to pay salaries and pensions. Capital expenditure has to often be curtailed, affecting development and infrastructure.Against this backdrop, the development priorities before the state are self-evident. Firstly, to complete small and big irrigation projects. Implement the Shirpur pattern in all districts. This is an amazingly successful and simple method of raising the water table. Secondly, focus on state finances. Can we think of selling Sicom, and other state-owned entities? How about raising water and carbon taxes? Congestion tax? Thirdly, the development of Marathwada and Vidarbha region is an imperative. The Kelkar Committee has a blueprint that can be used. In particular, the cotton belt should also house the entire textile value chain, which will need investment and technical skill building. Fourthly, a big infrastructure push for Mumbai, to make it an international financial centre. This calls for speedy completion of the cross-harbour bridge to Nhava Sheva, more progress on Dharavi, and public transportation. Fifth, for industrial growth and employment, a hard look at all the Special Economic Zones (most not functioning), and vacant plots in MIDC zones (can state repossess and re-sell?). The state scored big in winning over Foxconn, General Motors and Posco. But more needs to be done. Even services sectors like health, education, retail and tourism have great employment potential. Sixth is crop diversification, to wean farmers away from water-guzzling sugarcane. The development mantra for the state is: more crop per drop, more output per megawatt, and more employment per investment dollar.Maharashtra enjoyed a pre-eminent place in the past, but has been slipping in recent years. It still can boast of one of the best work cultures, skills catchment and growth potential among various states. It is time for the state to reclaim the top spot.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo) At the recent RSS conclave. (Express Photo)The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is now determined to make inroads into western Maharashtra, which has always remained the traditional bastion of the Congress-NCP in the state. The sugar belt of the state wields 72 Assembly seats, out of the total 288.Last week, the RSS made a big bang with 1.57 lakh swayamsevaks marching on the 450-acre land in Marunji village in the Hinjewadi outskirts of Pune.RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat addressed the mammoth gathering, imparting lessons on unity in diversity and evoking principles of cultural nationalism and integral humanism. The stress on samrasta equality and inclusivity was specially emphasised on the day.The Congress and the NCP leaders believe it would be a wake-up call for the Opposition as the RSS stronghold in western Maharashtra would culminate in BJP reaping the electoral dividends ahead. Both Congress and NCP leaders are to convene a meeting to discuss the possible ramifications of the RSS conclave and draw up a strategy to counter it effectively after January 15.Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The big question we would ask people is, do they want to subscribe to secular or communal politics in Maharashtra? Yet, Congress-NCP leaders admit, if the RSS gains foothold, it would be a challenge to their socio-economic politics.At the outset, RSS leaders termed the conclave as part of their ongoing programme. But an insider associated with the RSS and BJP revealed, It was a well-calculated exercise undertaken by the RSS to penetrate into the Congress-NCP bastion in western Maharashtra.The RSS conclave helped the organisation attract swayamsevaks from 6,700 villages out of a total 9,600 villages in the region. RSS coordinator Sarang Wable said, The purpose of the meet was to project the RSS positively to the people.Notwithstanding the RSSs decision to underplay the larger agenda, sources in the BJP revealed, The gathering of RSS in the backdrop of a magnificent stage carved as Chhatrapati Shivajis Raigad Fort and theme titled as Shiv Shakti holds special social and political significance.The objective is to ensure greater acceptance of RSS amongst the OBC and Maratha community, which dominates politics in the western Maharashtra belt. It is also perceived as part of the social engineering of forward and backward communities in RSS.The meticulous planning of the RSS also reflects as it chose the venue, which has evolved as the IT hub of Maharashtra drawing huge floating professional and the tech-savvy generation next across the state.An event manager admitted, For the first time, RSS made use of IT in planning the entire event. From enrollment of candidates to reaching out ganvesh (uniform), all details were available online.A senior BJP leader associated with the planning informed, Ever since its inception in 1925, RSS has never succeeded in making deep inroads in western Maharashtra. The Congress-NCP with their cooperative movement had always retained complete hold on the masses across Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur and Ahmednagar. The cooperative movement with huge socio-economics helped them to reign the politics of Maharashtra.A sources revealed, RSS, which has also made inroads in the rest of Maharashtra with social works through 178 organisations has never been able to gain foothold in western Maharashtra.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

This will be done to study the impact laughing has on health.This would be perhaps the first such initiative in Western Maharashtra where more than 250 laughter clubs have been operating for long.Hasyayog Parivar president Dilip Shah said that the initiative will help medical practitioners keep track of an individual's health and study how the members' health responds after joining the laughter club.""People say they experience positive changes in their health after joining laughter clubs; however, this should be recorded. So we are starting health cards for members. The card will have details about the member and their health history. For instance, the card will record if the member has diabetes and sugar levels. We will keep track of every member on a quarterly basis. Within a year, we can come to the conclusion whether there has been any improvement in health,"" Shah told TOI after the first congregation of laughter clubs in Kolhapur on Sunday.According to him, members often complain about diabetes, blood pressure and joint-related disorders. ""The study will be scientific as we will appoint a panel of doctors to monitor the progress. Many laughter clubs in Kolhapur have at least one medical practitioner as a member. The cards will be prepared at the earliest,"" he added.More than 350 members of different clubs participated in Sunday's meet which saw programmes such as lectures on laughter therapy, experience sharing and felicitations of members.

With the sugar industry in turmoil, both the farmers as well as the mills are highly disappointed.After a high-level meeting at the Secretariat on Monday, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced that the State has fixed the SAP at Rs. 2,850 a tonne, which is Rs. 550 a tonne more than the statutory Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,300 set by the Central government.The SAP includes Rs. 100 per tonne as cost for transporting sugar.With the subsidies given for irrigation to small and medium farmers, the State was ranked first in sugar production, she said in an official release hoping that the governments decision would bring happiness to the cane farmers.Sugarcane farmers have been asking the government to fix SAP for the past three months since the start of the crushing season. For the last two years, the State had fixed the SAP at Rs. 2,650 per tonne.Farmers disappointedMeanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association has expressed disappointment stating that they were expecting Rs. 4,000 per tonne.For the past two years, there was no increase in SAP. This year, they have made it up by giving Rs. 200 more per tonne. In real terms, this is not an increase at all, said D. Ravindran, association general secretary. Private mills have not paid SAP for the past two years amounting to Rs. 600 crore, he said wondering if they would give it this year. Moreover, the area of cultivation and actual production of sugarcane has gone down over the past three years, he said.In a statement, South Indian Sugar Mills Association (Tamil Nadu) secretary S. Chellappa said that paying any higher price over FRP would be beyond the means of sugar mills. Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing State in the country, has gone for 80:20 formula for payment of FRP, and mills in Karnataka were paying FRP in instalments during the current season, he said.VAT on sugar sales, restrictions on ethanol production and supply, un-remunerative tariff for power exports and steep fall in sugar prices have taken a toll on the financial health of sugar mills. Most of the mills have gone for debt restructuring, and accumulated losses over the past two seasons have led to a liquidity crunch.The SISMA requested the State to remove VAT on sugar sales and the cap on ethanol production and revise power tariff so that mills would have the ability to pay the FRP. The State should consider direct subsidy to farmers to bridge the gap between the SAP and the ability of the mills to pay the same, he demanded."

On Tuesday, Sharma suspended crushing licences of mills managed by two senior Congress leaders in Ahmednagar district  Leader of Opposition Radhakrushna Vikhe Patil and former revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.Non-payment of fair and remunerative price (FRP) to cane growers for last season had snowballed into a major issue in the state at the start of the crushing season. On Monday, Sharma had suspended crushing licences of 12 mills for failure to clear FRP for the last crushing season and 51 mills were issued notices on December 22. Sharmas action follows mills not clearing FRP. The total quantum of uncleared FRP for the last season, as of December 31, is around Rs 200 crore. Suspension of crushing licence leads to imposition of fines to the tune of Rs 500 per tonne of cane crushed. The mills are supposed to deposit the amount with the government treasury. In case mills fail to comply with directions they would be debarred from applying or obtaining crushing licence in the subsequent year.Meanwhile, millers said they will explore legal options against the sugar commissioners orders. On Tuesday, officials from the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation tried to meet Cooperative Minister Chandrakant Patil to discuss the matter. Shivajirao Nagavade Patil, president of the federation, said millers have decided to contest the suspension of licence either by moving court or appealing before the cooperation minister.Suspension of licence is just an act of bravado and will not do anything for farmers in reality. It would have been more prudent if the commissioner had taken action after sugar production was completed, he said.Patil said the millers will try to meet the minister again on Wednesday to try to come up with a solution. As of Tuesday, 169 mills are in operation in the state, which includes 94 cooperative mills and 75 private mills. The total cane crushed this year is 392.07 lakh tonnes.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

They want Rs. 3,600 a tonne. However, a section of growers are happy that the State Government had announced the SAP without succumbing to the pressure tactics of sugar mills.The Centre had fixed the Fair and Remunerative Price for cane procured during the 2015-16 season at Rs. 2,300 a tonne. The State Government declared an incentive of Rs. 550 including transportation charges of Rs. 100 a tonne, for a total State Advised price of Rs. 2,850.Though all public sector and most of the cooperative sector sugar mills had paid money for suppliers last year, private mills had piled up arrears on incentive to farmers for the cane supplied over the past two years. It is close to Rs. 950 crore. Under these circumstances, the Chief Minister has announced the SAP. We wonder whether the growers will get any benefit. We look up to her to ensure that, says president of the Pettaivaithalai Cane Growers Association, Tiruchi, K. Anbalagan.Adverse market conditions have forced the sugar mills to default on payment to suppliers. Though the SAP announcement is welcome, only removal of Value Added Tax on sugar and reduction of VAT on its by products will help mills turn profitable and facilitate payment to farmers. The Chief Minister must help growers in asking the mills to pay the current dues and arrears in one go for the growers to really benefit from her decision, according to the State technical secretary, Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations, G. Ajeethan of Namakkal.Claiming that the cost of cultivation has gone up and the SAP did not meet the demands of growers, general secretary of the Federation of Farmers Associations in Delta Districts Arupathy P. Kalyanam opines that the thrust of the State Government must be on ensuring that the private sugar mills and some cooperative mills that have defaulted on payments pay the arrears to the growers in one settlement. The State Government must have declared Rs. 3,600 per tonne for the sugarcane purchased from farmers, he adds.Inquiries in the sugar industry circles indicated that there was a concerted attempt to delay the SAP announcement and even if it were to be done a hiked incentive was sought to be avoided. Ms. Jayalalithaa announced a hiked SAP perhaps with an eye on the Assembly elections, they aver.Sugar mills want the State Government to waive the five per cent VAT on sugar besides reducing the VAT tariff of 14.5 per cent for molasses and 30 per cent for ethanol. That move will enable the mills to pay the arrears and dues to cane growers, they claim.Now, their imports from Maharashtra and Karnataka are cheaper crippling the mills here. Also, the TANGEDCO is yet to pay amount for the power purchased from sugar mills with co generation facility."

This year, however, community groups have reworked their schedule. The Punjabi Culture and Welfare Association of Navi Mumbai completed its celebration on January 2. ""Traditionally, Lohri is held to honour newborn sons. What we did instead was to felicitate girl children born this past year at our 'Lohri Kudian Di'. It was touching to see parents of newborn female infants carry them onto the stage to wide applause from patriarchal Sikhs,"" said president Kamal Sharma.Over in Thane, the Global Punjabi Association has dropped celebrations in favour of a worthy cause. ""We visited malnourished tribals in Jawhar and Mokhada and distributed a large consignment of rice, wheat, sugar and edible oil to the villagers. We chose to do charity at Lohri rather than host a two-hour party,"" said president Raaman Khurana.Meanwhile at Pongal, the Kanchi Mutt is performing the Shree Shukta and Lakshmi Narayana homam in Mahalaxmi temple on Friday.

So while elsewhere its limousines and Monets, crystal bathtubs and furs that are branded as luxuries, Bihar has gone and done the same to its samosa. Message: eating a samosa here is equal to living life king size.In addition to samosas and kachoris, there will also be a luxury tax on the pricier saris and mithais. As also mosquito repellents! In this vision of things, aam admi and aurat are the sturdy folk who live with all sorts of bed bugs, fleas, flies, mosquitoes; mommies putting their babies to bed with the lullaby, Itchy itchy scratchy scratchy, ooh I got one down my backy. But the deracinated uber rich, they go shoo, shoo with their shiny, fancy mosquito repellents.Nitish sarkar could be asking for the luxury tax because it is getting worried about the consequences of its sin tax. Prohibition is coming to Bihar, creating gaping holes in the state exchequers pocket that have to be patched up willy-nilly. Some have a rosier spin on the matter. If Biharis can no longer drown their sorrows in liquor, the sarkar wants to make sure they dont go do their drowning in cooking oil, sugar and triglycerides.Practitioners of jugaad have started brainstorming how to outwit the new rule of the new sarkar. Four-cornered famosas are a foolproof idea. Also, on the premise that no aloo may mean no luxury tax, theres brisk business in recipes for Irani samosas, Chinese samosas and chocolate samosas. Or try beetroot, cabbage, chokha, chicken, keema for fillings  the possibilities are endless.Nevertheless, Nitish sarkars move complicates the love lives of those Romeos whose favourite pickup line used to be, Jab tak rahega samose mein aloo, tera rahunga o meri shalu. (A second favourite is, You are the chutney to my samosa.) Instead of rote romance, they will have to script something original now. Like the Patna durbar has done.Moreover, this is just the kind of innovative idea that spreads like wildfire in India. Shiv Sena may already be planning to hit the streets demanding similarly elite status for vada pav in Mumbai. How about a luxury tax on momos in Darjeeling? Or khandvi in Gujarat, gushtaba in Kashmir? And definitely vindaloo in Goa, its to die for. Didnt they say two things are certain in life  death and taxes?On top of news of increased crime, now theres fear of licence raj running amok as Bihar stalks everyone buying samosa and kaju katli. Return of goonda raj, you say. No, only an occasion to impose a luxury tax on law and order, Nitish sarkar could well say. Mining for more ideas, it will sooner or later discover how Peter the Great taxed Russians for sporting a beard. Or how 14th century England taxed all adults simply for being alive.Biharis may well become thinner now, but its doubtful state coffers will get any fatter."

The sector which was reeling under the impact of sliding prices and bulging stocks is being slowly nursed back to health with steps taken by the government bearing fruit for farmers and millers. The revival in prices has also helped.Millers were bleeding due to crashing sugar prices and increasing cane arrears of farmers last April. But with prices improving - almost coming close to the production cost - and the industry aggressively offloading excess stock due to government measures, a crisis seems to have been averted. Cane arrears for 2014-15 sugar season has declined to only Rs 2,712 crore from Rs 21,000 crore in April.According to the apex body of sugar millers, ISMA, the all India average ex-mill price this year is Rs 29.50 per kg against last year's price of Rs 24.92. The production cost has remained around Rs 31. ""The increase in ex-mill prices has happened in the past three-four months. The difference between production cost and ex-mill price is somewhere close than what was prevalent in July 2014. This is a very positive sentiment and we expect the same to continue during 2016-17 sugar season. If this continues for three-four years the industry will revive in a big way,"" said ISMA secretary general Avinash Verma.Sources in the food ministry said that the main reason behind the ex-mill price increasing is the estimated reduction in production of the sweetener both in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to adverse weather conditions. They said after a long time the likely production and domestic consumption will match. ""We expect the total production and consumption to be to be around 260 lakh tonne. The main reason behind the crisis has been the excess production. For example, the total production last year was 283 tonne against total consumption of 255 tonne,"" one of the officials said.Industry sources said that another year of bumper production of sugarcane looks unlikely which will push the market sentiment and improve prices further. ""But there is no question of country facing any shortage of sugar as we still have huge stocks. The opening balance this year was about 91 lakh tonne,"" Verma said.Officials said the private players have also stepped up their exports since government set the minimum indicative quota target for the industry to ship out 40 lakh tonne. They added the food ministry in its order has specified that non-compliance of this will be treated as a violation of government order.ISMA sources said that last year only 11.06 lakh tonne was exported by the industry and 5 lakh tonne of this was exported under the incentive provided to ship out raw sugar. But only in the past three months 5.76 lakh tonne has been exported and as per estimates this is likely to cross 25 lakh tonne during this year.""Government has taken several steps including the incentives for export of sugar well in advance before the crushing started,"" industry sources said. Some of these measures include extending financial assistance in the form of soft loan, fixed remunerative price for and waived off excise duty on ethanol supplied under Ethanol Blending Program (EBP) and the recent decision of providing production subsidy to sugar mills to offset cost of cane and facilitate timely payment of cane price dues."

Though foot injuries are most common, even injuries to the back and shoulders cannot be ruled out.Dr Rajesh Badiyani, orthopaedic surgeon, said joint problem among runners are most common in joints that bear weights, such as the hips, knee and ankles.""If someone suffers an injury, then that person should opt for a compression bandage or splints to stabilize the affected area. An elevation of the limbs to reduce swelling also helps,"" he said.He added that an appropriate intake of vitamin D, calcium and iron is important to maintain the strength of the bones. ""In an adverse condition, it is ideal to rest and ferment the area with ice. If the injury is severe, then the runner should slowly return to activity after several weeks of healing and stretching exercises,"" he said.Kanchan Patwardhan, clinical nutritionist, said that stocking up on carbs is ideal since they convert into glycogen and our body uses glycogen while running. ""Ideally, the carbs should come from wholegrain cereals, dry fruits, potatoes and sweet potatoes and beet roots. Muscles tend to weaken over time and proteins together with carbs help repair and rebuild muscles,"" she said.To avoid cramps, she suggested vitamin E and B and eating a sizeable quantity of antioxidants. ""This helps not just in boosting one's immunity but in fighting free radicals as well,"" Kanchan added.Both agree that staying hydrated is the key to complete the distance without any worry. They advise runners to drink adequate liquids to balance electrolyte levels. One should avoid adding excessive sugar to these drinks. ""Just drink enough water to stay well hydrated,"" Kanchan said."

The government is expected to make an announcement before January 26, according to Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.The move to flex-fuels will decrease pollution and encourage a diversion in the sugar industrys output away from sugar and towards ethanol, Mr. Gadkari said at the annual meeting of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) last month in New Delhi.Biofuel production would help farmers by supporting the diversification of agriculture into energy, power and bio-plastics, Mr. Gadkari said.Implications for auto industryA policy on flex-fuel vehicles is likely to affect the automotive industry in several ways. Flex-fuels are widely used in several countries, famously Brazil and the United States, where they are available at the pump; examples include E10, E15, E85, the number reflecting the proportion of ethanol.The technology for the engines that can take these fuels is certainly not new but making the engines available in India (Mr. Gadkari said he had asked Volkswagen to come up with a flex-fuel engine) will take the greater part of a year at least. It requires modifications along the supply chain and calibrating the engine for Indian conditions.Additionally, such a policy will give manufacturers who are already in flex-fuel markets an advantage over indigenous producers, according to industry expert V. Sumantran, Chairman of Celeris Technologies. Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Hyundai are among those who have a presence in Brazil and manufacture flex fuel cars.This begs the question: how viable is running existing petrol engines on blended fuels? While a regular vehicle not especially made for biofuels could run on these fuels for a few years, this is not a feasible strategy in the medium to long-term for several reasons.One of the reasons is that ethanol, unlike petrol, is prone to oxidation and this can cause gum-like sediments to accumulate in various engine parts. Ethanol also reacts with other materials in the car, such as rubber, and this causes degradation, according to Mr. Sumantran.Consequently, if flex fuels are to be rolled out, engines will have to be built for them  and this will mean an additional variant for manufacturers production plants.For companies [car manufacturers], it is the variety that kills them. Adding an additional line of engine variants is not cheap. All this accumulates as internal costs within the company and they do not like doing this unless they are forced or required to do it, Mr. Sumantran told The Hindu . Additional manufacturing costs are likely to be passed on in some measure to customers.Impacts on other industriesAt present, the most obvious and reliable source of bio-ethanol in India is sugarcane. The worlds second largest sugar market, India produces some Rs.800 billion of sugar and supports approximately 40 million people.Ethanol is produced from cane molasses, a by-product of the sugar production process. The governments current Ethanol Blending Policy mandates five per cent blending of ethanol with petrol, though in reality the average ethanol blending achieved has been just two per cent. The government wishes to achieve 10 per cent blending.A new flex-fuel policy will mean a diversion in the production process to support the production of ethanol rather than sugar. The government is keen to increase the ethanol component in this mix partly because the sugar industry has an excess supply problem and consequently sugar prices are depressed. Mills are mired in debt to cane farmers.An industry paper by McKinsey & Company suggests that 5 million MT (metric tonnes) of excess sugar could be exported or diverted to ethanol production.If a flex-fuel policy comes into effect, the additional ethanol demand will likely exceed what can be produced by diverting resources from sugar.However, according to Abinash Verma, Director General of ISMA, this demand does not necessarily have to be met via additional acreage under sugarcane. Some of it can come from sources other than molasses, such as cellulosic ethanol, made from bagasse or sugarcane tops, and some can come from improved farming practices or planting higher-yielding varieties of cane.Such differences in productivity are already evident across the country; Tamil Nadu yields 100 tonnes of sugar per hectare of cane, while Uttar Pradesh and Bihar yield 50-55 tonnes per hectare, Mr. Verma told The Hindu.Even if a ten per cent increase in sugarcane yield happens, this would produce 3 million tonnes extra of sugar or 2 billion litres of ethanol, Mr. Verma said, adding that this quantity of ethanol was equivalent to 7-8 per cent of Indias total petrol consumption. India imports more than 80 per cent of its crude oil so this will mean significant reductions in the oil bill.Social and environmental impactsFlex-fuel cars, and biofuels in general, are promoted because they are cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. However, their ability to generate more energy than is used in their production is in question.Additionally, an increase in bio-ethanol production has also raised concerns about food security, farmers livelihoods and the environment, including water usage.The National Policy on Biofuels (2009) , which directs the nations overall approach to biofuels, says these fuels will be produced using non-food feedstock (source materials) on wastelands, thereby allowing India to stay clear of the traditional food versus energy security debate that other countries have had to deal with.This claim is a hard-sell for some, such as P. Sainath, founder of the Peoples Archive of Rural India and an expert on famine and hunger. He does not believe these claims, saying there are no conclusive studies that can say categorically that food crop lands have not been encroached on in the past.Memories of Indias infamous and unsuccessful experiment with jatropha  a plant used to produce bio-diesel and promoted by the government across the country, are still fresh. The purported ability of the weed to grow on wastelands and its drought-resistant properties were not reflected in the ground realties of its commercial cultivation and the programme was not successful.Water shortages too are a problem, especially when it comes to sugarcane. Maharashtra for one just does not have enough water, with the Marathwada region already in the middle of a drought, Mr. Sainath said.Sugarcane is the largest water-guzzler we have, he said, adding that sugarcane farms constitute 6 per cent of land use but consume 70 per cent of the irrigation water in the State.Well-considered policy neededIt seems that a clear and well-considered policy, based on a considered approach that learns from past experience and does not lose sight of overarching objectives is needed, no matter where you stand on the flex-fuel debate.There is no sincerity in developing alternative fuels. This is just a magic bullet approach, Mr. Sainath says.Sugar mill operators would benefit from a clear and well-thought-out policy too. Considering whether oil marketing companies have enough storage capacity for ethanol, and reforming tax structures so transport of ethanol across State boundaries was not prohibitively expensive, are among the issues that needed to be considered, according to Mr. Verma.Investments have to be made to install special dispensing units at petrol pumps across the country and such investments should follow demand for the product, which comes after a clear policy has been articulated, Mr. Verma said.The policy ought to be carefully considered and aligned with the countrys overall objectives in the sector, according to Mr. Sumantran, who supports a larger scale shift towards biofuels as a national policy provided no food production is diverted.I think like a lot of our policy today, a serious matter like expansion of the use of bio-fuels as a national policy requires very careful consideration and planning to be successful, Mr. Sumantran said. For instance, he questions the utility of using more than 85 per cent ethanol in a blend, saying Brazil has stopped the practice for good reasons, and a technical and economic case study has to first be made. Automobile manufacturers also need to be given adequate lead time to comply with a new policy, Mr. Sumantran said, adding, In our hurry to appear to do things, we need to avoid hasty steps that will hurt the progress we wish to make.At present, themost obvious and reliable source ofbio-ethanol in Indiais sugarcane"

While 17 were subsequently discharged after primary treatment, one runner named Amitava Sen continued to remain admitted at Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital with low sugar levels, dehydration and low blood pressure.The runners requiring x-ray or intensive support were rushed to city hospitals such as Bombay, Saifee, Cumballa Hill and Jaslok. Few were wheeled in unconscious and others suffered from vomiting. None of the runners is serious though, said Dr Nilesh Gautam, head of preventive cardiology at Asian Heart Institute, which had organised two medical camps for marathon runners. Over 4,000 runners were treated at these medical camps during the course of the run.With runners complaining of delayed medical response last year, the organisers set up 11 medical stations throughout the route and seven mobile vehicles with doctors this year. Additionally, 12 ambulances were stationed at different points. A team of 100 doctors and 200 nurses and physiotherapists monitored runners or anyone who collapsed along the route.At Bombay Hospital, a runner named Kshitij Mule (38) was rushed in a state of unconsciousness after he collapsed while running on the track. I do not remember what happened after I fell. The run made me dizzy, he said. He was administered IV fluids.According to an on-duty casualty medical officer, two runners named Sanjay Jarande (22) and DP Yuvraj (35) were admitted in the ICU for observation for a brief duration. Both of them were suffering from giddiness. We administered IV fluid to both, he said.Yuvraj suffered a bout of vomiting, acidity and weakness.

The company has also increased its R&D spend by 40% over last five years to catch up with its chief Indra Nooyi's diktat of focusing on better-and-good-for-you products. D Shivakumar, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo India, has been at the helm of the Indian arm of the US food and beverage major for two years. Here, he talks to TOI about the company's game plan for 2016.You know the health and wellness journey that PepsiCo is on. Indra Nooyi's vision for the company has classified products into categories such as good for you, better for you and fun for you. Tropicana, a top-end health and wellness brand, will be an extremely important part of our portfolio going forward. We locally source nearly 65% of what we sell here in terms of fruit juices. Therefore, it's a very important element of the value chain of the agriculture market. Fruits and vegetables are an important part of the agenda for the government going forward. And Tropicana will play an important role in executing that.We have just launched mosambi juice, which is a great innovation. This is the first branded mosambi juice in the market. The most widely-consumed drink in India is mosambi with 18% market share followed by lime juice (nimbu paani). We are competing with a housewife who prepares mosambi juice and a vendor selling it on the street. The focus on Tropicana is to build a whole range of these type of drinks, to really get fruit juice to be a part of the diet of an Indian family. Earlier, we didn't have enough citrus processing facilities in India. We have now established that with a partner in Maharashtra. The focus is to Indianize as many products as possible such as orange juice. Later, an extension programme should be a part of our larger programme like we have done with potato.We are testing a product called Revive in Tamil Nadu with low sugar levels. We have reduced a lot of fat content in products such as Lays. In line with PepsiCo's global direction, India will produce a range of healthier products as we go forward. For our snacks and beverage portfolio, we have a clear five-year plan. At the same time, most categories have become premiumised. So, how do you premiumise the range? We launched Lays Maxx last year at a premium. Nimbooz Masala Soda at a premium. I think localisation and premiumisation are going hand in hand in food and drinks. We launched Kurkure Butter Masti, Slice Alphonso. Indians are definitely wanting higher quality products. There is always a value point in the market but this trend is definitely being seen in almost every category.They want healthy with taste. The average Indian family is about four people now. Earlier, it was 5.5. So, if you have two kids in the family, their palates tend to decide what comes into the house. So that's the reason Indian households tend to go for a combination of tasty and healthy and not healthy alone. Even in oats, our masala variants are driving the category.We only have a product approval process in India. Worldwide they have an ingredient approval process. The FSSAI is working with the industry to find out the best way to go about it. So the industry is united about having an ingredient approval process as opposed to product approval. Ashish Bahuguna has been receptive to our suggestions and I am sure he will do the best thing possible."

Singh, who has been visiting the villages where the scheme has begun in full swing, said at a speech in Mumbai University that he has already conveyed his concerns to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.I think it is a significant project for its focus on the community coming together. I have heard that in some places the Yojana is being handled by contractors. Even if there are contractors appointed, it needs to have strong community control for transparent running, Singh told The Indian Express.He also said that the budget allocated to the scheme is quite less. The scheme, advocated as a flagship programme by the CM, has been initiated in 6,200 villages so far. The government has contributed Rs 1,000 crore for its first phase, with an additional Rs 400 crore having come from community funds and CSR.Singh, who was in the city for the Reframing the Environment: Resources, Risk and Resistance in Neoliberal India seminar organised by the Department of Sociology, Mumbai University, also said that the states water situation is staring at a disaster.The states rain pattern has no relation with its crop pattern. Marathwada, which receives 200-300mm rainfall, has over 15 sugar factories and it seems that nothing is being done about it. Since independence, many agriculture ministers have come from the state with 40 per cent of the dams in the country built here. Yet, the most number of farmer suicides also are from the same state. How can this be called development, he said in his plenary speech on Thursday.Singh, who is known for reviving the age-old practice of rain water storage tanks or johads, has helped revive rivers in the arid state of Rajasthan. Also known as the waterman of India, Singh has been traveling across 17 countries in the past year to raise awareness about water rights.Commenting on COP21, he said that dialogue between the countries has become a green business. The focus has become climate mitigation while the focus needs to be climate adaptation where each country finds ways to adapt in ways possible against climate change, he said.On the debate about environment vs development when expanding infrastructure in a city like Mumbai, Singh said that the model at play in Mumbai will not survive for long.

They were paying around Rs. 1,500 per tonne, he added.The governments had done very little to exert pressure on sugar factories to clear dues of sugarcane growers.In Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts, the combined dues for 2014-15 and 2015-16 from sugar factories stood at Rs. 132 crore.The Bhima riverbed is fast drying up, says State sugarcane growers' association"

He urged all secretaries whose departments have extensive public dealing, to set up a system for top-level monitoring of grievances immediately.Among the significant projects reviewed were the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and the Jal Marg Vikas Project from Allahabad to Haldia. He also reviewed the progress of the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana and implementation of the National Old Age Pension Scheme.The cabinet secretary also made a presentation on the works of each of ministries like Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Civil Supplies, Water Resources and Fertilisers. The idea was that the five ministries should know the works done by each other.The presentation on fFertiliser Ministry included reviving fertiliser plants, including the one in Gorakhpur. In the presentation on Agriculture Ministry, emphasis was laid on the prime minister's scheme for irrigation."

However, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told The Hindu on Wednesday that there was no reason for concern.Whatever location we finalise will be in consultation with experts, he said, adding that safety protocols will be followed. It is too early to jump to conclusions, he said.Acquiring plateausEnvironmentalists, though, fear the worst and point to his recent announcements. On Monday, the CM had held a meeting with Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, announcing Indias biggest green refinery  a joint venture with the Bharat Petroleum, the Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited on the Vijaydurg plateau in north Sindhudurg district by acquiring over 15,000 hectares of land.To the north of this proposed project lies the Madban plateau, which is being acquired to set up the 9,900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project (JNPP).Recently, French firm EDF acquired Areva (another French company), the nuclear firm that was originally slated to provide technology for this project.The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) has reportedly signed an MoU with EDF to build nuclear reactors here. While work on the project has been stopped for the last few years due to pendency of certain techno-commercial agreements, there are no roadblocks to this project.Debate lost for translationIn addition to these projects, the Ambolgad beach in Ratnagiri has been earmarked for the construction of a multi-purpose port. According to the projects Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report, it is proposed to have both forward and backward integration by developing jetty-based industries such as a bauxite benefication plant, a steel plant and gas or coal-based thermal power plant, sugar refineries, a container hub and tank farms directly or through joint ventures and acquisitions.Last week, a prescheduled environmental public hearing for the project was cancelled and postponed as the EIA report was available only in English; villages that will be potentially affected have demanded a draft in Marathi.Drawing local ireAnalysing individual projects for their adverse impact on the environment wont do any good. An integrated approach is needed for projects coming up in ecologically-sensitive area like Konkan, said renowned ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who had headed the Centre-appointed committee that studied the impact of projects, including dams, on the Western Ghats."

The contracts are all through Myanmar and from there its just being taken up country.The smuggling of agricultural products along Chinas borders with Vietnam and Myanmar has long been a problem.Chinas sugar industry has urged the government to tackle resurgence in smuggling across the countrys southern borders, after huge volumes of cheap sugar were estimated to have illegally entered the country in recent months.Mr Sawhney also said domestic sugar production would reach 26 million tonnes in the 2015/2016 season, which runs from October to September, and would probably see the same figure for the coming 2016/2017 season.India produced 28.3 million tonnes in the 2014/2015 season. It is too early to tell but most likely there will no decrease and no increase, Mr Sawhney said.Uttar Pradesh will most likely compensate for the drop in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The first back-to-back drought in nearly three decades has hit cane plantation in Indias key producing states Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.One Indian official previously estimated that the drop in plantings for the 2016/17 season means that acreage could fall by about a third after a faltering monsoon damaged thousands of hectares of cane in the worlds second-biggest producer.Mr Sawhney said India would meet its target of blending five per cent ethanol in all gasoline sold this sugar year for the first time and surpass it.We can cross five per cent ethanol blending.Oil companies have never met the current five per cent blending target as ethanol derived from molasses, the thick syrup produced by boiling down sugarcane juice in sugar refining, costs more than gasoline without including taxes.

The summer months could still be distant, but the water situation in Maharashtra, particularly in Marathwada, has already hit a worrisome low.The demand for tankers has shot up and the State is staring at an acute water shortage for the third consecutive year, worse than even 2015. In Marathwada, the water level in dams has dropped to 8%. And the Water Supply and Sanitation Department has recorded a five-fold rise compared to 2015 in the number of water tankers supplied to provide water in villages and hamlets.The water storage situation is dismal, said Babanrao Lonikar, Minister for Water Supply and Sanitation.While we have ensured that the available water is stored for drinking purpose only, a number of measures such as Jalyukta Shiwar are in progress to ensure groundwater level increases in drought affected areas.Mr Lonikar also announced a new rural water supply scheme, which will be presented in the State cabinet next week. The CM and Finance Minister have agreed to allocate Rs 600 crore for this new scheme, which will be aimed at recharging ground water and improving present water storage.The water situation in other parts of the State such as North Maharashtra, Amaravati and Nagpur division is also bad. The current storage level in dams in these divisions is 31%, 35% and 37% respectively.Pradeep Purandare, ex-associate professor at Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI), told The Hindu that the situation is only lending itself to a brisk business opportunity for tanker owners and bottled water industries. Private tankers charge anything ranging between Rs 500 and Rs 1,200. There are absolutely no regulations on bottled water industry. We have even asked the Chief Minister to publish a white paper on this industry as it is controlled by local politicians and rich landlords, he said.According to him, cities such as Latur, Udagir and Osmanabad are already suffering due to water shortage. Mr Purandare, a well-known researcher in water issues, said the government must also immediately ban use of water for water intensive crops such as sugarcane. Meanwhile, Mr Lonikar informed that the government has also issued clear directives to sugar mills to ensure drip irrigation in the sugarcane farms."

The survey dew sharp criticism from activists who claimed that the day-long survey had grossly under-reported the numbers. This compelled the state to conduct the survey for the second time in October. However, this time again, it was marred by controversies, forcing the government to go for another round. Finally, the third survey was held between January 15 to 31 which reported just about 10,000 out-of-school children.Deepak Nagargoje, an activist from Beed, said, ""The latest survey finding about 10,000 out-of-school children in the state is nothing but a joke. The survey has been marred by controversies since it started last year. And even after three attempts, the government has failed to give us a realistic picture.""The 2011 Census indicated that 4.96 lakh children in the state were working as labourers. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan report in 2014 reported 1.85 lakh out-of-school children. The Tata Institute of Social Sciences reported 38,000 students living on streets in Mumbai alone in 2014. The number of children working at construction sites was reported at 31,000 in Maharashtra while children of sugar cane and brick kiln workers together came to three lakh in the state.""All these figures reported by the government departments and non-governmental organisations are mind-boggling. There is major mistake in the survey,"" Nagargoje added.Heramb Kulkarni, an education activist, said there could be many more out-of-school children who were not covered in the survey. ""Government has framed policies for every issue in the education sector but hasn't ensured proper implementation of the same. There's lack of awareness as well as co-ordination among different departments of the government. Many local authorities, who are the first point of contact in case of any problems with the implementation of RTE, are still not aware of all the guidelines.""The RTE Act, 2009 mandates that all children aged between 6 and 14 years should be enrolled in schools, show regular attendance and get a formal education. The state's survey was prompted by this mandate and the need to find out the actual number of out-of-school children.Kulkarni said there was lack of awareness among general public about their right to education."

The exercise begins with identifying those who have gone in search of work and the means to get them to vote on the polling day falling on February 13.The ruling party TRS is not leaving any stone unturned in its effort to get people to vote for their candidate. Jadav Vithal Naik, sarpancah of Kangti village is one among the number of grassroots leaders who have been entrusted the job of identifying the migrant labour, where they are located currently and influencing them to come to their respective villages to cast their vote.Vithal Naik has been trying to contact them over phone or in person by sending someone to request them to come on February 13 to their native village and cast their vote. Those migrated were being offered even transport charges as well as a gesture.He says that about 100 families have migrated in the past two months to Kamareddy in Nizamabad, while some have gone to work in sugar factories located in Karnataka and Maharashtra in addition to Hyderabad where they are found to be employed in some labour jobs.Similar conditions are prevailing at many villages. We are trying to bring as many as possible on the day of polling and efforts are on. We are not sure how many would come for polling, Mr. Vithal Naik told The Hindu.It was estimated that more than 20,000 voters have migrated from the constituency for various works including cutting sugarcane. The has cited two reasons for the exodus. One is for cutting sugarcane which is a seasonal job and is routine around this time of the year and secondly it is the serious drought condition which is pushing people out of their villages in search of jobs.TransportationEfforts are being put not only by the TRS, but also by the opposition Congress and Telugu Desam Party. However, being led by Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao the TRS has been moving aggressively in this regard and it was stated that even transport vehicles would be arranged a day before the polling as well as the polling day to bring the migrant voters to their native villages.One more worry haunting the political parties is that of Pandari Maha Padayatra to begin in the next few days. There would be scores of people from every village participating in the yatra and would return only after the day of polling.Elections are being held following the demise of Congress MLA P.

Around 17 per cent said it was a hereditary condition they were suffering from, while 10 per cent of them believed it was due to lack of exercise and 5 per cent gave stress as a reason.The companys claims data also reiterated the same, showing that close to 25 per cent of the companys health claims came from this age group, Bajaj Allianz said. The survey also said most young professionals depend solely on employer-provided medical insurance and do not have a personal health insurance cover.Of the 75 per cent respondents who were health-insured, 60 per cent relied solely on employer-provided group cover.Among those who did not have health insurance, 46 per cent felt it was an expensive instrument and 22 per cent felt they were too young to invest in such a cover.Suresh Sugathan, Head (Health Insurance), Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said, Employer-provided medical policies are tailor-made plans for an organisation and are customised according to the benefits that the management wants to extend to its employees.At all times, the employer-provided cover might not meet your individual health insurance requirements in terms of coverage, number of dependents or family definition as well as your state of health, and might have certain limitations, he added.40% were plagued by chronic body pain (muscle spasms, jointpain, backache)"

Their siren red and vibrant green colours are so riveting that I find it impossible to walk past strawberries on sale. Yes I know. There really is nothing new to write about strawberries. They are so well-loved that we have pretty much figured out every possible way to savour their beautiful berryness.But I have been ordering strawberries by the kilo from Love Thy Farmer, a local initiative that delivers quality fruit from farms around Mumbai to your doorstep. And I cant think of anything else.Its hard to believe the kilos of strawberries I am going through. When I was a child, strawberries were an expensive indulgence. We never really got to just eat them whole as is. They would always be blended into milkshake or chopped into a fruit custard so everyone got a share. Thats probably why I cannot get enough of them even now.The last time I spent a strawberry season totally obsessed was years ago when I spent the most idyllic strawberry season of my life in North India. We were living in Chandigarh and often drove up to Dehradun through roads flanked by strawberry farms. Strawberries hadnt gained the popularity they now have in the area, yet and one could easily buy a kilo or more at a mere Rs15. I bought kilos and kilos worth and tried them in every way possible.There really is no best way to savour strawberries, its more a matter of mood. The fact that they pair well with so many things makes them even more versatile. And at just 45 calories for every 150 gm there is no healthier way to sin. (Although accompaniments will add calories).But dont mind me, dip whole in molten chocolate, slice into sweetened cream, macerate with sugar and mint and serve as is or over ice cream, better yet spoon into a glass of champagne! These days, strawberries are a favourite breakfast brightener in our home; sliced over pancakes or waffles, chopped into cereal or quickly zapped into a compote to enjoy over bread pancakes or even to stuff crpes . Simply sprinkle with sugar and zap it in the microwave (this also works well with citrus fruit like oranges and grapefruit). A dusting of cinnamon while still warm and a drizzle of wine prior to cooking and you are ready to party!Strawberry reds glamorise anything. Salads for one. For a vinegar that injects the addictive flavours of strawberry into salads, just place cleaned, hulled berries into a wide-mouthed bottle, cover with champagne vinegar and forget for a few weeks; then decant into another bottle and enjoy! Of course strawberries lend themselves best to sweet accents. The easiest, quickest thing you can do with strawberries is drizzle a sauce over them. Caramel works well in a pinch, but try hung yoghurt, or a chilli or pepper-laced balsamic.But my all time favourite way with strawberries is to macerate them with pepper vodka. Quarter a whole lot of the berries, sprinkle over with a little sugar, douse with a generous measure of pepper vodka, mix well, mashing a little as you go, and chill. Enjoy as is, or make a simple but stunning dessert by layering with whipped cream or thick custard. Spoon into individual shot glasses or do a large bowl. Some like this with a bit of chocolate flakes or chocolate sauce drizzled over.I also freeze this mixture to enjoy long after the season is over, as an impromptu sorbet in the summer. But when, I am having my strawberries with chocolate I want the combination uncluttered. For that just, simply pile oodles of washed berries onto a large platter with a bowl of hot chocolate sauce to dip in; you can get fancy and try milk, white and bitter chocolate sauces too.The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That"

Both were produced before the MCOCA court in Nashik, which remanded them in seven-day police custody, said public prosecutor Ajay Misar. The suspects will be produced before the court again on February 9.He said investigations are on for the last few days. At present, the suspects' links with the scam are being established and the government needs some time to gather data and interpret it, he added.The food and civil supply department had on January 25, 2015 unearthed misappropriation of nearly 3,000 metric tonnes of foodgrains and sugar worth Rs 5.06 crore meant for the beneficiaries in Surgana tehsil that was allegedly sold in the open market.It was alleged that the good grains from the Food Corporation of India that should have gone to Surgana taluka between July 2014 and September 2014 had not reached the destination and instead siphoned off by the transport contractor in connivance with the supply officials and godown keepers.Jain and Shevale have been accused of diverting some 2,400 tonnes of foodgrains and selling it in the open market.Police officials said a cartel of traders and foodgrain suppliers was working in Nashik and Mumbai and the cops already had inputs about the diversion. They were waiting for some solid evidences to move ahead.According to the police, Jain and Shewale had earlier issued demand drafts worth Rs 3.25 crore in the names of three firms which were allegedly owned by the same person. This raised suspicion among the police that the accused might be involved in fraudulent dealings. Accordingly, the Nashik police repeatedly summoned the suspects for questioning, but failed to turn up. When the suspects were in Nashik on Wednesday, the police immediately arrested them after gathering sufficient evidence against them.Though the diversion of foodgrains could not take place without the support of government officers in the PDS, the police have not taken any names so far.Since the last three years, the state government has been trying hard to bring reforms in PDS to avoid diversion of foodgrains from fair price shops to the open market. Plans such as installing GPS on the vehicles, streamlining them from godowns to the fair price shops and mobile-based tracking system have received stiff opposition from the lobby of PDS officials, foodgrain suppliers and transporters."

The first conference to identify and address various issues of air pollution was held in the city on Saturday at Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (Yashada).""Ten cities in Maharashtra will have an action plan for improving the air quality. In the first phase, we have taken Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur. We will be holding conferences in Mumbai and Nagpur also,"" said P Anbalagan, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.""Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) will together design the action plan. The terms of reference will be finalized by the next week and by mid-March, we expect the action plan,"" said Anbalagan.The plan will consist of short- and long-term goals. ""The short-term goals will be for three months. After this, we will do an impact assessment. The long-term goals will actually impact the pollution in these cities. We will be moving towards strict implementation with stringent punishment for defaulters,"" said Anbalagan.Divisional commissioner S Chockalingam, who was present at the conference, suggested various measures like introducing environment cess and improving public transport by opening it up to the private sector. ""We have been taking up the issues of pollution and traffic on priority and have been holding monthly meetings with chiefs of all major stakeholders. Asphalt coating of side margins of roads can bring down dust, but it will pose a challenge to water percolation. The burning of sugar stalks also lets out particle matter. Improvement in public transport is very essential and there should be competition between public and private buses to ensure best service.""He wondered why can't environment tax be levied on all vehicles sold. ""The money collected can be used to financing metro or public transport. Colleges should close their gates to polluting vehicles and students should be encouraged to use either public transport or electric vehicles. There is a need to prepare an action plan and stick to its implementation,"" he added.Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, Neeri, spoke about the odd-even formula applied in New Delhi. ""In Delhi, it is asked if there was any decrease in pollution. According to our studies, there was a 30% decrease in the petrol and diesel consumption. It means much less fuel was burnt, which automatically means less emission. Even the toxic pollutants like sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) reduced by 18%. As far as particulate matter is concerned, it increases or decreases according to the wind and other factors,"" he said, adding that the authorities had already done a lot of monitoring and would have to use this data to actually do something.Rajeev Jadhav, the commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, recommended improving low cost public transport to reduce vehicular emission."

The earlier estimates put the amount needed at Rs60,000 crore, but a little bit of innovative planning has helped bring it down to Rs20,000 crore,"" said Gadkari. The Clean Ganga mission is a flagship programme of the BJP government.Gadkari was addressing the concluding function of Innovators Industries Entrepreneurs Facilitators and Academia (IIEFA) organized by RSS arm Vijnana Bharati. The aim of this three-day seminar at VNIT campus was to bring industries and research agencies together on a platform.Gadkari said the problem areas along the river's path were identified. It was found that a host of industries, like tanneries, oil refineries, sugar mills, distilleries and paper mills, were located along the river, which were causing a lot of pollution. ""We have come up with a proposal to use the polluted water in Ganga by the industries. This will not only make commercial sense but also help keep the river clean,"" he said.Gadkari said he has approached the ministry of petroleum, power and railways. The Mathura refinery needs 40 million litre pre day of water (MLD). It has agreed to draw polluted water from Ganga. In the same way, the ministry of power has also agreed to use such water for the 13 power plants located in the area. The power plants need 750 MLD of water. This will help suck out the polluted water from the river, he said.He said the ministry of railways has also been approached with a similar idea to use the polluted water for cleaning rail coaches. Sugar mills and tanneries along the river's flow have also been offered interest free loans to recycle and use the water.NMC to extract methane from sewageNitin Gadkari said a meeting was held at NMC with an expert from the US, Dr Rao, on the civic body's project to extract methane and carbon dioxide from sewage water. The expert has already done this successfully at Warna in West Maharashtra. The methane generated out of the process can be used for making bio CNG for running buses. Almost 100 buses can run on this bio fuel in the city, he said."

The CID said that this money was siphoned off from the corporation and diverted to the bank accounts of Hubtown and Comran Realty. However, the sale agreement of the plot showed an amount of just Rs 40 crore. The police is now investigating where the remaining Rs 66 crore disappeared.Shah made Dhumbre, a civil engineer, and Contractor, a company secretary, directors in Comran Realty. In 2014, he made Kadam additional director of the firm. Kadam was arrested in August 2015.""Kadam registered three cooperative societies and transferred huge amounts into them.

Senior officials in commissionerate said the government may seize and auction the sugar stock of such mills.The start of the present sugarcane crushing season saw Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis chair a meeting of mill owners and growers about payment of the FRP. While the cane-growers, led by Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana, had demanded the FRP in one installment, mill owners wanted to pay in three installments. After the meeting, it was decided that for the current season, FRP would be paid in two installment in the 80:20 formula.Payment trends so far show that most of the mills have adhered to the formula, but have deferred the payment. As of January 31, the total payment due to cane growers was around Rs 9,060 crore. As per the 80:20 formula, the payment due calculates to Rs 7,248 crore.

5904ea987be9e04154dfdb02,What the ponkh?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/what-the-phonk/,2016-02-15,"It is a lazy winter morning in Mumbai and finally for what it is worth, there is a nip in the air and the urge to have frequent cups of garam-garam chai. I am sitting all toasty and warm in my favorite recliner when the doorbell rings and a friend sashays in, radiating bonhomie and good cheer. I have just come from Surat and look what I have for you, she exults. Diamonds? I breathe hopefully. No silly, she giggles, waving a bejeweled hand towards a box she is carrying. Its ponkh!Ponkh? I squeak.Spoiler alert: for those of you who are hardcore carnivores, there is no meat in this story!What she has got back from her recent soujourn to Surat is a Gujarati delicacy called ponkh which is the local name given to tender jowar seeds or white millets. During a brief period in the winter months, the jowar grain is juicy and very tender and the seeds are just right to be harvested and eaten roasted. It is generally picked from fields and cooked there and then, with parties thrown to celebrate this young edible seed.My friends box reveals a bunch of packets neatly packed together: the green jowar seeds, three types of sev (fried gram flour noodles) and tiny sugar granules also known as sakkar-danna. The three sevs spread out in front of me are variously colored: a yellow one which is mildly spicy, a tomato-flavored red one, and the brown one which is hot and spicy and enticingly called limbu-mari (lime and pepper). The three flavors of the sev and their sharpness offset the slightly bland and sweetish taste of the ponkh. And I guess the sakkar-danas are provided to counteract the smoke-in -the-ears spiciness of the limbu-mari. Ponkh is sometimes eaten raw and sometimes slightly roasted and Gujaratis often wash it down with glasses of chhaas or lassi. My friend informs me that die-hard lovers of this delicacy even attend ponkh picnics in Surat.In Maharashtra, ponkh is known as hurda. As a child, I remember my mother talking about the hurda parties she used to attend on her visits to her hometown of Amalner, Maharashtra. During the season, the local farmers would throw a party in the middle of the fields where the young tender jowar was being roasted and eaten directly when it was still hot and tender. To accompany the hurda, the farmers wives would provide jaggery (gud), shengdana-lassun chutney (groundnut-garlic chutney), dry khobra chutney (dry coconut chutney), wangya chi bhaji (a brinjal preparation)and taak (butter milk).So now I am sitting with this big fat packet of ponkh and after diligently mixing the three sevs and a bit of the sugar granules with the green seeds, I carefully plate it on a salad dish and serve it to the family. Unfortunately, it does not set anyone on fire. The husband grimaces, the foodie wrinkles his nose and I stoically plod through the helping I have served myself. The next day, I decide to spice up the ponkh by serving it as a bhel. I add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, rock salt, a dash of chaat masala, and a few drops of lemon juice. On top, I add the rainbow colored sev, and serve it in the evening as an appetizer before dinner. The foodie son looks at it and exclaims, That thing again!My cook, the Garwahli genius, comes in from the kitchen to see what the fuss is all about. He takes a look at the ponkh offering, tastes it and then saunters off to the kitchen with something suspiciously sounding like Not on my table wafting on the breeze. With sarson ka saag and makke di roti on the menu, the poor ponkh is not getting its day under the sun in our house.Desperate to finish the huge mound of ponkh sitting forlornly in my kitchen, I call a few Gujarati friends and ask if they would want ponkh. Chokkas! Tarat mukaljo! (Of course, send at once) is the ardent response. And now, just as I am sitting back with a contented sigh that the ponkh has finally gone to places where it is being appreciated, my friend calls and asks how I liked the ponkh. Loved it, I squawk and cross my fingers for lying. Great, she chirps happily. Next year I will send you three kilos, and hangs up."

The SAP per tonne in Tamil Nadu was Rs. 650 during 2014-15 and was Rs. 550 during the current crushing season.There is a provision for the revenue authorities to issue notices and stall production of the mills if they fail to pay up the dues beyond permissible time, but there is no clarity as to whether the leverage could be exercised for failure on the part of the mills to settle SAP.This was due to an apparently contradictory stand on SAP taken by the Central Government. The Price Policy for Sugarcane released during 2014-15 by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) states that high SAP without commensurate increase in sugarcane productivity would make the Indian sugar sector globally uncompetitive.Stating that such a situation would lead to large excess stocks at home, and high cane arrears, bringing uncertainty and instability in sugar sector, and ultimately its fall, the CACP report advocated immediate adoption of the hybrid formula for pricing of sugarcane, which is composed of revenue sharing principle dovetailed with some Minimum FRP (MFRP).The revenue sharing principle will be to distribute the total revenue generated in the cane-sugar value chain from sugar and its first stage by-products (molasses, bagasse and press mud) produced from a quintal of sugarcane, between farmers and millers in the ratio of their relative costs (70:30) incurred in producing sugarcane and converting that sugarcane into sugar and by-products. If the value of by-products is loaded on the value of sugar, then this ratio comes to 75:25.UncertaintyGiven the uncertainty about future sugar prices, this revenue sharing principle needs to be combined with MFRP so that farmers are ensured of a minimum price. Adoption of this transparent and scientific hybrid formula as the basis of pricing of sugarcane will bring greater stability and rationality in the sugar sector. This, in turn, would attract fresh investments with new technology and take it to higher levels of efficiency and growth. Thus, the SAP needs to be phased out as it has lost its relevance,"" the report states.This being the case, farmers wonder why the SAP announcements are made if the State Government is not serious about securing the dues.ImpactThe impact of the downturn in sugar industry was perceptible in Tamil Nadu since the State accounts for one-tenth of sugar production in the country. Tamil Nadu ranks fourth in terms of sugarcane production with 10.8 per cent, after Uttar Pradesh (36.5 percent), Maharashtra 22 and Karnataka 10.9.Sugarcane farmers say a solution is possible to the present crisis if the mills are forthcoming about sharing revenue from the by-products."

In some cases, the lease period needs to be extended before the lease expires.The governments amendment, in laymans terms, means that land from the second category can now easily be transferred to the first, giving the occupant complete ownership.This is in favour of the users. At a time when we are talking about increasing investment in industrial sector, we need to amend laws in business friendly manner. Now people do not need to visit government offices to renew lease agreement. They can own it now, said Manu Kumar Srivastava, Principle Secretary, Revenue Department.While the amendment was pending with the government for the last many years, a number of suggestions including bringing lease rates closer to market rates instead of transferring ownership were also pending with the government.The state has clarified that details such as transfer fee, terms and conditions and process will be finalised in the act that will come up in the budget session.Land held by the occupants can now be movedto full ownership category"

Even though trade routes and harbours played a pivotal role in the beginning, when industrialisation was norm of the day, the Second World War really promoted industrial development supported by discriminating protection which flourished cotton textiles, sugar and iron and steel industries.As India also grew with the global industrial revolution, which already finished three phases, getting onto fourth wave, the country is gearing up to be a part of it by focussing on infrastructure-supported industrialisation, which is reflected in the emergence of industrial corridors, where various nodes and industrial hubs, and smart cities are planned. The UPA governments National Strategy for Manufacturing prepared in 2006 and the current NDA governments Make in India campaign support corridors. India started its journey on industrial corridors with the establishment of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) in 2005. It enhanced the industrialisation process between two cities, and various nodes were also established for further development of towns. Besides private city Lavasa near Pune and 24 new cities, the 1,500 km-long DMIC goes along with the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor.So what exactly is an industrial corridor? Besides allocating a package of infrastructure spending to a specific geographical area, industrial corridors help in flourishing industrial development by creating manufacturing clusters and ancillary industries. Besides smart cities, these corridors will be well-connected by road, rail, air or sea.Interacting with Deccan Herald, Grant Thornton India Partner Vikram Bapat said industrial corridors will help in the next wave of industrialisation, as they will ring-fence fertile agricultural land for industrial use, and thus benefit both sectors. By enabling the growth of ancillary units, these industrial corridors will reduce freight and transportation costs. Once GST is rolled out, it will rationalise the supply chain and bring in optimal tax structure, he said. Bapat also pointed out that the industrial corridors will help attract talent in large numbers and achieve 100 million job target easily.Manufacturing-led industrialisationManufacturing is the keg pin of industrialisation as the society is moving towards massive consumerism supported by growing disposable income. India imported $300 billion of capital and consumer goods last year, and if 80 per cent of it is produced from India, it will create massive job opportunities and investment. The corridors will become catalysts in this journey.Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said Indias manufacturing sectors contribution to GDP is only 17 per cent and the government plans to take it 25 per cent in the current year. Cisco India & SAARC Sales MD Purushottam Kaushik said, The industrial corridors planned by the government will not only link smart cities, but will also be the main driver of the pledge to Make In India by ensuring seamless connectivity for industrial growth.Chandan Mitra, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce, and entrusted with the task of preparing a report for expediting projects, told Deccan Herald that the industrial corridor will lure investment and accentuate industrialisation of India. The industrial corridors are coming up along with the freight corridors, which will also connect ports, and will help in the transportation of capital goods, he said. Besides land acquisition and infrastructure development, the panel will look into all issues concerning the corridors financial aspects.Policy frameworkIndias first industrial corridor DMIC got Rs 17,500 crore grant from the Centre and $4.5 billion from the Japanese government for the first phase, which started in 2011. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) holds a 26 per cent stake in DMICDC. But the institutional framework for the formation of node/city-level SPVs for corridors are yet to come up.According to Bapat, there is a need for a separate strategy to incentivise corridor projects to bring in more investment . One idea could be to institutionalise the corridors and create single-window agencies that can cut through inter-state issues and help businesses to set up seamlessly, he said. On the role of central and state governments, he said the model for administering corridors should be like that of National Highways.Rumours are rife that the government plans to approve a proposal to establish a National Industrial Corridor Authority (NICA) for implementing corridor projects in the current Budget.Corridors plannedBesides DMIC, the government plans the development of Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC), Bengaluru- Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC), Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC), Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and Chennai-Kolkata Industrial Corridor. DMIC is one of the worlds largest infrastructure projects and is expected to fetch $90 billion investment. Six states, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, have formed SPVs for the development of DMICs nodes.DMIC Chief Executive Alkesh K Sharma said that they are in the final stages of completing the pre-PPP process, which includes forming SPVs and creating the basic infrastructure like transportation, water treatment, sewage treatment, among others. This work will be completed in the next 4-5 months and by August, we feel we will be able to invite anchor investors to set up their businesses there, he said. In the North East, the government mulls a similar mega infrastructure project  requiring a basic investment of Rs 11,000 crore (not including land and power)  which will link the states of the region with each other and to multiple border points.Multilateral agencies like Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), JBIC (which are supporting DMIC and CBIC) and the Asian Development Bank (which has completed a conceptual development plan for VCIC) have evinced interest in investing these projects. On the CBIC, the nodal agency JICA has completed the master plan, and three nodes have been identified. ADB has completed a conceptual development plan report on VCIC and two nodes have been identified for master planning. The AKIC feasibility study is under progress.OpportunitiesCiscos Kaushik said the Make In India and industrial corridor projects hold tremendous value for the company. The latest report from Sustainability Outlook pegs the smart city market in India at $45-$50 billion over the next five years. We are working with the government on information and communication technology for the smart cities proposed under the DMIC. These include Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat, Shendra-Bidkin Mega Industrial Park in Maharashtra, Manesar Bawal Investment Region in Haryana and Khushkhera Bhiwadi Neemrana Investment Region in Rajasthan, he said.Indo-German Chamber of Commerce Director General Bernhard Steinruecke said that German companies are not looking at large investment in the corridor but only parts of that. We have been looking at Mumbai-Bengaluru corridor and looking at its feasibility study. I came to know that there is a competition between the UK and Germany in this project, he said.Scope for IndustrialisationIndia imported $300 billion of capital and consumer goods last year, and if 80 per cent of it is produced from India, it will create massive job opportunities and investment. The corridors will become catalyst in this journey.But to make the corridors successful, we have to be part of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which will be shaped by a fresh wave of innovation in areas such as smart robotics, materials that are lighter and tougher, and a manufacturing process built around 3D printing and analytics.Here we have to come up with new technologies, new products, new brands and enter new markets so that Make in India will become a grand success. Even though we have entrepreneurs who have performed well, we need strategic alliances with countries like the US, Britain, Germany, Japan, Korea and Taiwan to emulate and correct ourselves to go ahead.DIPP secretary Amitabh Kant said, Industrial corridors will help in many layers of manufacturing, from Industry 4.0 to labour intensive manufacturing, which will bring largescale investment, employment opportunity, productivity gains, said Kant.Massive investment in industrial corridor will pave the way for large human displacement and destruction of fertile agricultural land. According to economist Joseph Schumpeters Creative Destruction Theory, an entrepreneurs introduction of radical innovation into the system will bring in creative destruction of economic value and it will really force sustained long-term economic growth. Let us believe Schumpeter and industrial corridors will help Indias efforts to lead the world in the fourth wave of industrial revolution."

The Maharashtra government has given its green signal to export more sugar, and the prices are likely to go up by Rs 4 to 5.The government on Monday announced that cooperative sugar mills would be allowed to export 10 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of sugar, a move to ensure cash flow and help the mills pay fair and remunerative price (FRP) to sugarcane farmers. Sugar mills have been communicating to the government their inability to pay FRP to farmers citing paucity of funds.As it is, the sugar rates have increased from Rs 19 to 29. Following the decision, it is likely that prices will increase by Rs 4 to 5. However, consumers must understand that this is to ensure cash to farmers, said Cooperation Minister Chandrakant Patil.Mr Patil said the only way to check inflation is to sell sugar through the Public Distribution System (PDS). If people are ready to stand in queue to save two or three rupees, then we will think of selling it through PDS, he said, asking people to be considerate of the farmers condition, who are not getting FRP for their produce.The decision was taken at a meeting at the YB Chavan Centre, in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, former Agriculture Minister and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Ministers Pankaja Munde, Chandrakant Patil, and representatives of cooperative sugar mills.As per the Centres policy on sugar export, the country will be exporting approximately 40 lakh MT of sugar, of which 14 lakh MT will be Maharashtras contribution. Until now, only 3.98 lakh MT of sugar have been exported.Those sugar mills not complying with the order will not get exemption in purchase tax. However, drought-prone areas such Marathwada can be exempted, said Mr Patil.Brazil is one of the biggest exporters of sugar in the world. However, Brazils season is to begin two months later. We want to take the lead as we have enough storage available, he said.Among other benefits, sugar mills are exempt from purchase tax for 10 years, as they also generate electricity. The Centre pays around 10 per cent interest on the soft loans the mills take for one year, and the States pay the interest for the next four years. These benefits will be withdrawn if sugar is not exported."

Predominantly an investment destination for mineral-based industries due its rich mineral reserves, the eastern state has now started attracting companies from sectors including gems and jewellery, electronics, renewable energy and textile and apparel.The reasons are many: the state has moved up to the seventh position among Indian states in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business ranking. What has also helped is policy consistency under Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, supply of affordable but trained workforce, and the fact that Bhubaneswar recently topped the Smart Cities contest.At the recently-concluded Make in India Week held in Mumbai, the state government, for the first time, signed a number of memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with companies from non-mineral sectors, said top government officials. The government received investment proposals worth approximately Rs 71,000 crore, of which over Rs 18,000 crore was from non-mineral companies. These include a large sugar refinery and a fertilizer plant. A large diamond trading and jewellery manufacturing company has also committed to invest over Rs 1,000 crore in setting up a huge facility at Deras, near Bhubaneswar.We cannot disclose the name but it is one of Indias biggest players with global operations. Besides, we have received several proposals from companies which are into food processing, defence and apparel manufacturing to invest, Debi Prashad Mishra, Industry Minister, Odisha, told The Hindu.Chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi added, We have received proposals from companies into renewable energy. The diamond and jewellery company wants to set up base in Odisha as we have no shortage of skilled manpower. We have created a land bank of one lakh acres to cater to industrial needs.Thousands of people working in the diamond polishing and jewellery-making units in Surat are from Odisha, and they are keen to return to their home towns. This is one of the reasons gem & jewellery players are willing to shift part of their manufacturing to Odisha.ITC, which has never invested in Odisha, has committed Rs 800 crore in a food processing unit, a five-star hotel in Bhubaneswar and in social forestry.Since the cost of production in Western India is higher, lot many companies from non-mineral sectors are planning to set up base in Odisha in search of affordable work force. This is for the first time that we are witnessing this trend. It is heartening, said principal secretary, Industries, Sanjeev Chopra.Maggit, a UK-based company, has decided to set up a defence manufacturing unit at the Tata Steel SEZ at Gopalpur. The 3,000-acre SEZ is set to attract many companies from India and abroad.A Chinese delegation has shown interest in setting up an excusive industrial park for Chinese companies in Odisha.Officials said the states economic reform agenda is attracting companies to invest. It has introduced the eBiz portal, which covers 14 G2B (government to business) services with a common application form and an integrated payment gateway. This portal, a first of its kind in India, eliminates all physical interfaces for investment-related services.For a hassle-free business environment, the state has also introduced an online portal called Common Inspection Framework and is formulating a start-up policy for entrepreneurs.State is now 7th among states in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business rankings"

Across the country, the total sugar for export too is low, not exceeding 5.6 lakh metric tonnes.The state government on Monday directed sugar mills to release their export quota as per guidelines or forego special incentives awarded by the Centre and the state, including waiver on purchase tax on sugarcane. The incentives include soft loans with low interest rate for co-generation and tax exemption on purchase of sugarcane by mills.The emphasis on export of sugar is to ensure the domestic market doesnt crash. At the same time, the remuneration from export of sugar would help the sugar mills to sustain and also extend better Fair Price Remuneration to the cane-growing farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said.Of the total sugar export of 40 lakh metric tonnes, Maharashtra has to provide 14 lakh metric tonnes. So far, state sugar mills have released only 3.80 lakh metric tonnes for export. Across the country, the total sugar for export too is low, not exceeding 5.6 lakh metric tonnes.Every sugar mill is expected to release 12 per cent of its average three years production for export. The export is linked with the concessions given by the Centre and the state to the sugar sector to make it more robust due to uncertainty in the global and domestic markets.NCP president Sharad Pawar, who attended the meeting, said, The 12 per cent of the current production of sugar should be considered instead of taking an average of the last three years.Former energy and finance minister Dilip Walse-Patil recommended restructuring of loans to help the sugar mills and also farmers. However, considering the crisis in Maharashtra due to acute water scarcity for the fourth consecutive year, the state government is considering not to enforce the decision on incentive waiver on sugar mills operating in these regions.The chief ministers primary concern is to ensure farmers get better remunaration. Sugar mills too stand to gain.The sugar production for 2015-16 is estimated to drop by 25 per cent. It was 89 lakh metric tonnes the previous year.The production drop is essentially due to drought, which has led to huge crop damages and also discouraged farmers from taking up cane cultivation in a big way.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

""If excess sugar is not exported, the prices will fall and farmers will have to bear losses,"" said cooperative minister Chandrakant Patil.""Last year, the state produced 105 lakh metric tonne sugar and of that 14 lakh metric tonne remained unsold. This year, about 85 lakh metric tonne sugar is expected to be produced in the state. However, prices will fall if the current stock is not exported and it will hurt the farmers,"" said Patil, adding that the export will benefit farmers as in Brazil, sugar season is yet to begin.Justifying the rising retail price, Patil said, ""Retail price may go up by about Rs 3 per kg, which should not affect people much. But this small hike will bring much relief for farmers.""He said that sugar production was 25% less compared to last year and is likely to come down by 50% next year. ""Sugar cost may reach Rs 50 per kg as sugarcane production will go down due to drought,"" said the cooperative minister.On Monday, a meeting was held at the YB Chavan Centre and attended by CM Devendra Fadnavis, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, cooperative minister Patil, guardian minister of Beed Pankaja Munde, opposition leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and sugar factory society members.Munde pointed out that Marathwada and Vidarbha sugar factories must be exempted from the export compulsion as they are already facing losses.

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is also pushing for sugar export despite the international market being sluggish. Factories have said such lower rate of export would not benefit them.In a meeting held in Mumbai on Monday, Fadnavis again stressed export of sugar. He said if sugar is not exported, then there will be surplus stock in the domestic market which will lead to fall in prices. This will eventually result in sugar factories and farmers incurring losses.""The Union government has asked every factory to export 12% sugar of its last three years' average production. But the decision would affect the sugar factories in Marathwada as their production has drastically dropped in the current year. The average sugar production figure is higher and if Marathwada factories export as per the quota, the remaining sugar stock will be very low. Sale of such low stock in the open market would not able to recover a factory's running cost,"" said state rural development minister Pankaja Munde.Sanjeev Babar, managing director of Federation of Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd, said, ""The current sugar export price is Rs 2,300 per tonne and no factory is keen on exporting at such lower rates. The rates should be at least Rs 2,600 per tonne. Moreover, the state government is also not supporting sugar factories in terms of soft loans. It is true that we can export sugar till September this year, but we have to make payment to the farmers and factory employees.""""Ethanol is a key by-product of sugarcane and its current market rate is Rs 48 per litre. It is a good rate but orders worth Rs 38 crore litres have been issued. The payment for these orders is made after the entire delivery. The factories not having distilleries would not benefit from it. Same is the case with co-gen projects because power purchase rates are good and it would benefit only factories having such plants. Most of the plants are in Western Maharashtra. Hence, these factories can afford to export sugar at lower rates,"" he said.""Sugar production has gone up in the last three years in the state. The unsold sugar stock has piled up and put pressure on the factories. The central and the state government provide some financial assistance to the factories, but it has limited reach. Had the government increased its assistance, the factories would have been able to sell sugar in the market. The major buyers of sugar, beverage and confectionery makers, have already purchased their stock. Hence, there is little scope of the local market looking up,"" he added."

The factory had not made payment to farmers for 2013-14 and 2014-15. So, the factory's application for annual crushing licence was rejected for the current year, but it still went ahead and started crushing.The factory was in trouble two weeks ago also, when the Sangli city development committee had filed a complaint with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board about the ash released from its co-generation plant.

58ff75af7be9e04136165f30,'Change in variety could boost sugar cane production',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/531076/change-variety-could-boost-sugar.html,2016-02-25,"Mysuru, Feb 26, 2016, DHNS: 22:58 IST2-day meet of sugarcane research and development workers beginsDirector of Sugar Breeding Institute (SBI), Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, Bakshi Ram on Thursday suggested sugar cane growers to opt for different varieties of the crop to achieve high yield and better returns.Addressing the gathering, during the inauguration of the two-day 20th meeting of Sugarcane Research and Development Workers of Southern Karnataka, organised by Bharat Ratna Sir M Visvesvaraya Sugarcane Research Institute, Mandya at Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) here, Ram cited the example of Uttar Pradesh, that has given a wake up call mainly to two States  Karnataka and Maharashtra in sugar cane cultivation.Ram said, Uttar Pradesh has revolutionised sugar cane cultivation by opting for changed variety named CO 0238 and has achieved 13 per cent sugar recovery. So, the same variety of crop is being cultivated in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha too.Switch to new varietyRam felt that in the case of Karnataka, barring minor variations due to climatic factors, there is not much change in the scenario. The reason being, no variety change ever since the existing variety (CO 62175) was introduced in the year 1962. The area of cultivation is more than 60 per cent and its time to switch over to a new variety to improve the yield and also sugar recovery, he said.Effective management of soil health and also measures to check pests are other factors that would help in better cultivation of sugar cane, Ram added.R B Khandagave from S Nijalingappa Sugar Institute, Belagavi advised to take a cue from Australia, where the thrust is on technology and adoption of minimal recommendations in managing fertility of the soil. Khandagave said, to ensure better margins in sugar cane farming, two priorities should be followed  judicious use of soil and water and bringing down the production cost. In the case of soil and water management, Australia would be a better model by incorporating technologies, while solar pumpsets would help reduce production cost.Director, Research, University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru, T Sheshadri blamed impartial adoption of technologies in the realm as the major reason for problems plaguing sugar cane farmers. The farmers have failed to fully explore the potential. As a result, there is no change in the extent of production in the last five years, that can be recorded at 450 tonnes per hectare.Sheshadri pointed out, usage of local seeds, deterioration in soil health, non-adoption of organic manure, green manure and inter-cropping system and also failure in management of trash and poor drainage system, especially in low-lying areas, are among the causes that have resulted in farmers incurring loss in sugar cane cultivation.MCC Commissioner C G Betsurmath released the compendium on sugar cane cultivation in the region."

In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

Whoever demanding electricity connection, will get it within the stipulated time. To ensure that the decision is being implemented, we are bringing a policy of assigning one lineman for each gram panchayat. The lineman would shoulder the responsibility of fulfilling the need of that particular village,"" Bawankule said while inaugurating a sub-station at Koregaon in Walwa taluka of Sangli district on Thursday.Around 70,000 linemen work with the Maharashtra state electricity distribution company. The government is planning to set up a panel of 10 to 12 workers for a set of three villages, he said.Bawankule said he has started a state-wide tour to study the issues related to his ministry. ""I have learned that Sangli requires Rs 140 crore to provide electricity to 8,000 agriculture consumers and 10,000 domestic consumers. The funds will be provided soon. As per the state policy, we are separating domestic feeders from the agriculture feeders at 400 places in Sangli at a cost of Rs 50 crore. This will help the company provide 24x7 electricity in the rural areas,"" he said.The government has increased the purchase cost of power generated by sugar factories by 10%, the minister said. He appealed to the local people to set up a biomass plant with the help of the power department and the government.Referring to reports that as many as 1,500 people were electrocuted in the state in 2015, the minister said the responsibility of safe electricity lies with the electricity companies. ""I have asked the companies not to entertain illegalities in their operations. There were cases in which a wireman assigning his deputy on his own. That is not allowed. I have also asked the employees of above 50 years of age to take voluntary retirement if they are incapable of doing repair works on electricity poles. We will allow their kin to join the company,"" he said."

And, under the impact of Hudhud in 2014-15, the stocks fell to 21 lakh lumps, and the total arrivals for the year were only 27 lakh lumps.By the end of this February, the arrivals stand at 19 lakh, one lakh more than last year, according to market sources.But the market suffered a setback with only four lakh lumps in last March as against the normal eight to nine lakh.Drought in MaharashtraHowever, with timely rain this year and no other affecting factor that could cause any disturbance, we expect the arrivals to pick up, says noted trader Korukonda Butchiraju of Anakapalle.A major factor that is influencing building the inventory is the poor state of sugarcane crop in Maharashtra with less sowing area owing to drought conditions, he says. As a result, the price of sugar has shot up by about Rs.1,000 a quintal compared to last year.With proportionate increase in jaggery price too, the medium to top quality that is generally in the range of Rs.2,300 to Rs.2,600 is expected to go up to Rs.3,000 to Rs.3,300.But building up stocks of 1,500 truck loads last year, traders incurred loss and initially it appeared that they would bring down the inventory to 1,000 to 1,200 truck-loads this year. But in view of the sugar situation and prospect of rise in prices, the stocks may finally surpass 1,500 truck-loads, Mr. Butchiraju analyses.The jaggery season at Anakapalle, with a turnover of Rs.125 crore, starts from October-November and stock arrivals begin in January peaking between February and April. Traders offload the stocks from June/July."

But what helped Mohammed's quick diagnosis was his extremely low birth weight of 1.76 kg.Paediatric intensivist Dr Javed Ahmed, who examined the baby when he was rushed from a local nursing home to Surya Hospital in Santacruz, said, ""When child is born with low weight, doctors conduct a series of tests. His sugars were abnormally high, suggesting an infection."" But a series of tests done at Surya Hospital pointed to neonatal diabetes.The hospital sent his samples to Exeter Hospital in the UK for a definite diagnosis. ""But we found that the child didn't have the common mutations that lead to neonatal diagnosis,"" said paediatric endocrinologist Dr Sudha Rao. So far, he hasn't tested positive for four of the 17 mutations that Exeter Hospital offers. ""In the last 15 years, I have seen five to six cases of neonatal diabetes. This child is unique because he wasn't really premature,"" she added.Unfortunately for the child and parents, the tests established that he couldn't be given simple insulin tablets, but would need shots.""We have taught the mother to give him the injections, but it is emotionally taxing and they have found a neighbourhood doctor for the purpose,"" said Dr Rao. Shabina takes her tiny tot to the doctor twice daily for the shots.Chennai-based diabetologist Dr V Mohan said his hospital now has a registry of 200 children with neonatal diabetes. ""We offer a panel test of 25 genetic mutations that cause neonatal diabetes,"" he said, adding that increasing awareness about the condition has led to children being diagnosed within a a few days or weeks of birth.Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which high blood sugar levels are high over a prolonged period. Permanent neonatal diabetes, which refers to the onset of diabetes before the age of six months with persistence through life, is a rare disorder occurring in one in 0.2-0.5 million live births.Significant advances in elucidating the genetic basis of neonatal diabetes have been made since the initial description in 1995.Dr Rao, who is also attached to Wadia Hospital in Parel, said that neonatal diabetes has emerged as an independent entity in the last decade. ""As children with high sugars don't grow well, it's important to get their blood sugars within control. However, as children can't follow a diet or timings, it takes a while to decide on their insulin dosage,"" she said.As for Mohammed, his insulin shots have now been fixed at two a day."

Express files .Water availability in dams/rivers and crop pattern in drought-prone districts across Maharashtra will be mapped to make course corrections in water supply. Express filesThe state government will conduct a water audit to formulate a comprehensive policy to plug misuse of water by the private sector in districts reeling under a drinking water crisis. Water availability in dams/rivers and crop pattern in drought-prone districts across Maharashtra will be mapped to make course corrections in water supply. Strict water audit in 14 drought-hit districts is on the cards.The government will bring in stringent rules to make drip irrigation mandatory for all water intensive crops, including sugarcane. Acknowledging that drinking water has to be given highest priority, a restructuring of lifting of water from dams by the sugar mills using barrages specially in critical districts like Latur, Osmanabad, Beed, Solapur is being done. At present, there are 202 cooperative sugar mills apart from 64 private mills. Drip irrigation is expected to increase yield and prevent wastage of water from dams and rivers availed by sugar mills.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis asserted, Apart from jalyukta shivar project to generate higher water storing capacity, effective management of water is more significant. At the drought review meeting, he said, Whether it is through wider use of drip irrigation for all water intensive crops or plugging misuse of water which is drawn for cane but leaves the villagers thirsty, the government will come out with a comprehensive plan.While the government acknowledges that they will not enforce any ban on any crop, it cannot allow exploitation of water for cultivation of sugarcane without water budget.Statistics revealed by the department of water resources and agriculture indicate 70 percent sugar mills violate rules and lift huge quantity of water from dams and rivers. The switch to drip irrigation will have to be made stringent.Minister of State for Water Conservation Vijay Shivtare, representing the Shiv Sena argued, At Latur, water supply is once in 21 days. Even during monsoon water supply is once in eight to ten days. Yet, there are several sugar mills prospering with highest production of cane and sugar.He said, At Latur, sugar mills directly lift water from Manjara river and dam to their fullest capacity. As a result, it leads to shortage of water for drinking purposes. He said, Today, Latur with 5 lakh population is demanding Rs 700 crore for bringing water to city from Ujjani dam. There is no water shortage in Manjara dam and river. We have to set our priorities and plan for public at large and not serve only sugar mills interest. We have to first store water for drinking purpose and then use the rest for sugar cane.But exactly the opposite is happening in Latur.All district collectors have been asked to work out a plan on the water audit along with restricting its use for domestic, agriculture and industry. All drought districts have several sugar mills. Solapur tops with 32 mills.Fadnavis said at the internal meeting, While government is pursuing the policy and projects to make the state self reliant in water, it cannot overlook the immediate concerns of people. Moreover, a drought-free Maharashtra in 2019 will require scientific water management.Based on geographical conditions in every district, the ministry of agriculture is evolving multi-crops with shorter cycle to facilitate quick returns with less water utility. Osmanabad district which receives an average rain less than 450 mm, has started looking at lucrative crops/ horticulture farming to replace cane cultivation. Instead of 12-14 months cycle for sugar cane, farmers in small groups are experimenting with horticulture which is equally remunerative.As district collector Prashant Narnavre said,  If the returns are high, farmers are willing to experiment with new crops specially in rain shadow areas.Taking up the centres special drive to promote pulses and oilseeds, the state government wants farmers to avail schemes to the optimum. Both pulses and oilseeds require lesser water compared to cane.The processing of one kg sugar, from cultivation to crushing, requires 3,500 litres of water. However, unlike pulses and oilseeds, cane growing is less risky as it ensures assured returns and can sustain a gap of 15 to 20 days without water.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

It means a total ban on allowing digging of new wells in the drought-hit villages.In Solapur, district collector Tukaram Mundhe has evolved a new model to beat the drought. To begin with, he has declared 12,000 water structures including rig wells, tube wells and ponds for solely drinking water purpose for the public. It is almost double compared to 6,400 acquired last year.The decision comes with a rider that none of these water structures would be allowed for commercial activities or even agriculture beyond one km. In every village, the gram panchayat and local bodies are being roped in to ensure strict implementation.At the drought review meeting held at Latur, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has urged district collectors to evolve plans for the next four months to sustain water and fodder supply across villages reeling under drought. Along with supply of water and fodder, simultaneous plans to proactively check further water depletion and recharging water to raise water tables should become compulsory.Sinking underground water tables need to be tackled with the highest priority, Fadnavis had said.Mundhe said, We are planning a two-pronged strategy keeping in mind the next four months till June. We are making provisions for water with the existing infrastructure which can take care of drinking water shortage. Maintaining that tankers would be deployed only in places where absolutely essential, he indicated that wasteful expenditure which does not help villages would be ended.In Solapur, almost 700 villages out of 1,144 face water scarcity. At present, there are not more than 10 tankers in the district. In Solapur, which houses 32 sugar mills in Maharashtra, district officials have often invited the wrath of politicians in the past, who see the drought as a business opportunity through water tanker supply to remote villages.The state government statistics for the last 14 years show that Rs 4,000 crore were spent on water supply and fodder during droughts. Yet, there were complaints of irregular water supply. While plugging loopholes in the system, district officials have now decided to opt for case-to-case study of the villages and provide solutions for specific requirements.Mundhe said, At present, we have provisions to sustain drinking water and fodder till June, except in a few patches where we might see problems in May.District officials are hopeful that there would not be any shortage of fodder in the district which has 11 lakh big and small animals. Sugarcane which has remained uncrushed after February, 2016, would work as fodder for the animals.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Sugar cooperatives have sought help of politicians saying they will go bankrupt if forced to pay with the latter assuring them they won't have to clear their tax dues.""The NDA government cannot do anything as a case filed by sugar factories of Maharashtra in the matter is pending in the Supreme Court. The government should enact a law exempting cooperatives of tax. Unless this is done, notices would continue to be issued,"" Gujarat State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited chairman Mansingh Patel said.The I-T department considers any price for sugarcane given by sugar factories to farmers above the fair remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the government as taxable. Sugar cooperatives have been paying higher price for sugarcane and distributing all the income to its member farmers for some years now. When the I-T department demanded tax on the additional price by issuing them notices for the first time in 2014, the sugar cooperatives were taken by surprise.""Confusion prevails as there is no clarification from the Central government on the amount paid above FRP. Industry wants it should be considered as expenditure and not trade surplus because the amount was being paid to sugarcane suppliers. We hope the Central government will understand this in the correct perspective and cancel these notices,"" Kamrej sugar factory chairman Kantibhai V Patel said.The market is looking up after 2015 slump in sugar industry.

(Arul Horizon) Maharashtra has been assigned the highest export quota of 14 lakh metric tonnes. (Arul Horizon)The central governments decision last year to impose a compulsory export quota for mills would have a double whammy effect on them, say millers.Apart from a loss of approximately Rs 400 per quintal of sugar exported that they could incur, mills in Maharashtra would also fail to benefit from a rise in sugar prices in the domestic market in the months to come.In order to sustain the price of sugar in the domestic market, the Centre had taken a decision to fix an export quota for mills across the country, based on the last three years average production. Maharashtra was assigned the highest such quota of 14 lakh metric tonnes, followed by mills in Uttar Pradesh and other states.Since Uttar Pradesh is a landlocked state where millers have to bear huge costs to transport their export consignment through ports in Mumbai and elsewhere, mills there were allowed a trade-off for sake of equalisation. As per this, UP mills could buy sugar equal to their export quota at existing domestic market prices from millers in Maharashtra, who in turn would export the same volume along with their own fixed quota.As international sugar prices have been lower than the domestic prices, it results in a loss of Rs 200-400 per quintal for exporting millers. But the bigger question, especially for millers in Marathwada and Solapur, is that due to the drought, production has been less this season as compared to last three years.The matter was raised before the chief minister last week by the millers, especially from the Solapur and Marathwada regions, who are expecting a decision from the government to lower their export quotas.Till the end of February this year, around 12 lakh tonnes of sugar has been exported out of the country, of which mills in Maharashtra have exported close to 6 lakh tonnes. Around3 lakh tonnes of the exported sugar was from their own quota while the rest was a result of the trade-off with mills in UP.However, industry insiders from Kolhapur pointed out how this scheme would affect millers in the state, both in the short and long term. The 2016-17 crushing season for Maharashtra is supposed to be bleak with a reduction in cane area. As the mills from Maharashtra are exporting both their own as well as the trade-off quota for UP mills, they would not be able to encash on the domestic market where prices are expected to rise well, said a prominent miller from Kolhapur. Data from the NCDEX index shows prices of sugar in July are expected to be above Rs 3,400 per quinital with October prices promising to touch Rs 3,500 per quintal.The recent report on sugar production prepared by the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) shows that barring Maharashtra, all other states have registered slight increase in their sugar production figures. As of February 29, Maharashtra produced 70.40 lakh tonnes of sugar while last year on the same day, ie February 28, 2015, the state had produced 74.74 lakh tonnes of sugar.Uttar Pradesh has seen production of 53.65 lakh tonnes of sugar till the end of February while last year, it had produced 49.59 lakh tonnes of sugar till February-end. While the cane outlook for Maharashtra for the season 2016-17 is bleak, the same for Uttar Pradesh is good, with the state expecting a good crop.B B Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA), said millers had been assured by the chief minister that they would be allowed to export based on the present days quota only. Export would help in keeping the domestic prices up, he said.However, the official notification about the reduction of the export quota is yet to be issued.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Express photo Punjabs Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa speaks on states fiscal health, static tax revenue, fat salaries bill, liabilities and outstanding bills before tabling of the budget. Express photoAs you are ready with the annual budget, how do you see states fiscal health?We have successfully improved our fiscal situation. We have managed our fiscal deficit within the recommended limit of 3 per cent as per the fiscal consolidation roadmap laid out by the 13th Finance Commission. We have achieved this target with 2.97 per cent deficit. Similarly, the states debt should be less than 38.7 per cent of the GSDP in 2014-15 and though the debt now stands at Rs 1.24 lakh crore, it is 32.27 per cent of the GSDP. Next year, the debt will be 31.34 per cent of the GSDP.How many times did the state go in overdraft this fiscal?I do not remember it off hand. But it was much lesser times compared to last.What is your biggest concern?The tax revenue. It has not grown as it should have. This affects the cash flow. Otherwise, the situation is stable. Coming year would be better.Are you planning to introduce any new taxes?Next years budget proposal is a secret document. It is the privilege of the Assembly to learn about any new proposals before anyone else.Who is to be blamed for the static tax revenue?The global economic slowdown. collections on account of stamp duty on registration of property have come down from Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore due to slump in real estate market. Also, the revenue generated through registration of new vehicles has also come down as lesser new vehicles were purchased by people in the state.What about poor growth of VAT?The minuscule growth in VAT collections is not unique to Punjab. It is a pan India phenomenon. I have had discussions with finance ministers of states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat and similar trend exists in those states as well. The silver lining is that we have not recorded a negative growth in VAT.You present a rosy picture about the fiscal health. Why are states properties being mortgaged?Not a single property was mortgaged this year. Two years ago, PUDA mortgaged properties to generate funds. We have already returned half of the loans generated against these.What about the pending bills?We have pending bills worth Rs 2,000 crore. But considering that we have already paid bills worth Rs 40,000 crore this year, an amount of Rs 2,000 crore is minuscule. Each year, during March, we are in a capacity of clearing bills worth Rs 4-5,000 crore. Hence, these bills would be cleared as we come to a close. Last year, we had unexpected expenditures including sugar subsidy and Rs 300 crore worth compensation to farmers.You have always frowned upon the fat salaries bill. What burns a hole in the states pocket?We have a fat salaries bill amounting to Rs 28,000 crore. It is a cause for concern for us. The bill has been growing by 10-15 per cent every year in the last five years. The implementation of pay commission reports, arrears and installments of DA really burn a hole in our pocket.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Now the man who jumped parties and loyalties with ease is charged in a Rs 800 cr scam, and has real-estate and business interests worth crores. Shubhangi Khapre, Zeeshan Shaikh and Atikh Rashid on Chhagan BhujbalSometime in the fifties, at an inter-college competition, a young man had gone up on stage to deliver a power-packed performance in a one-act play. The winner that day was Chhagan Bhujbal, a student of Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute College in Matunga, Mumbai, and the runner-up was Amjad Khan (of later-day Sholay fame).Those who know Bhujbal, the 69-year-old NCP leader who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 14 for alleged corruption during his stint as PWD Minister in two terms of the Congress-NCP government of 2004 to 2014, say thats one skill that has stayed with him  theatrics. All he needed was a stage and in his four-decade political career, he had several  first with the Shiv Sena, followed by the Congress and then the NCP.Former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Chhagan Bhujbal (in black coat). Archive/Express Photo Former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Chhagan Bhujbal (in black coat). Archive/Express PhotoMuch before this rise and fall was a story, one as unexceptional as any. Young Bhujbal and his siblings grew up in the narrow lanes of Bagwanpura in Nashik, where his family lived cheek by jowl with several Muslim households. His parents died early and the family moved to Mumbai when Bhujbal was two. My siblings and I were raised by my mothers aunt Jankibai (whom he called grandmother). She was a feisty lady, Bhujbal had recalled in an earlier interview. Jankibais husband was a policeman and the family struggled to make ends meet.Those were tough days. Bhujbal would later often talk about a family function in his childhood home in Nashik, where he had to dilute the curry with water because he feared there wouldnt be enough to go around. The story goes that in Mazagaon, Chhagan and his elder brother Magan would trudge from their one-room chawl in Anjirwadi to the Byculla vegetable market every morning where members of the Mali community (the OBC community of gardeners to which the family belonged) would pool money and help the brothers buy vegetables.The two brothers and their aunt would then sell the vegetables outside their Mazagaon home. The Bhujbals later managed to secure a 35 sq ft vending spot for themselves at the Byculla vegetable market. The bond that Bhujbal shared with his elder brother during those years of struggle is one of the reasons why he took his nephew, Magans son Sameer, under his wings after his brothers death in the early 80s. Sameer is now in judicial custody in the money laundering case that the ED has filed against Bhujbal and his relatives. The ED is probing alleged kickbacks received by the Bhujbal family for favouring contractors in construction of the Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi and the Kalina Central Library in Mumbai.Chhagan Bhujbal and Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express Photo Chhagan Bhujbal and Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express PhotoBhujbal, the man who borrowed money to sell vegetables, would later come to be known as the strongman from Nashik who combined opportunism with calculated risks to further both his politics and business. As a senior NCP leader says, Bhujbal struck a perfect balance between his politics and business. But it appears he took some wrong decisions and entrusted his nephew Sameer with his business. He should have exercised caution and ensured good advisers around him when in power.The man, his empireThe sprawling campus of the Mumbai Educational Trust (MET) in Bandra stands as testimony to Bhujbals business acumen. The campus, spread across prime real-estate, came up in 1989 and offers multiple courses such as business management, engineering and pharmacy and even has a rishikul for children. The Trust also runs Bhujbal Knowledge City, an educational hub with four colleges in Nashik.Chhagan Bhujbal during a 2012 NCP state meeting in Mumbai. Archive/Express Photo/Prashant Nadkar Chhagan Bhujbal during a 2012 NCP state meeting in Mumbai. Archive/Express Photo/Prashant NadkarUnlike politicians who own sugar mills and district banks, I decided to invest in education. Those accusing me of charging high fees should know that I have to pay electricity bills of Rs 25 to 30 lakh a month, Bhujbal once said.But in 2013, Bhujbal had a fallout with his chartered accountant Sunil Karve, with whom he had set up MET. Karve had accused Bhujbals family of misappropriating funds from the Trust.Over the years, Bhujbal acquired prime land in Nashik and Lonavala, among other places. The Bhujbals family home in Nashik, inside the sprawling Bhujbal Farms, underwent a major revamp in 2012-14 when Bhujbal was PWD minister.Its a huge mansion and is situated in the heart of the 5-acre Bhujbal Farms, which has a swimming pool, a tennis court, library, home theatre and a mini auditorium. The mansion is known to have imported furniture and expensive artefacts. It was built in phases over two years. The family moved here in May-June 2014, says a Nashik-based journalist with a Marathi newspaper. He says very few people among those who have access to Bhujbal Farms  and there arent too many  can go to the mansion.Former Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, Vamrao Mahadhik, Chhagan Bhujbal, Promod Navalkar and Manohar Joshi.

Only family members and very close aides can go to the bungalow, says a former aide of the Bhujbals. Bhujbal Farms is enclosed within a 7-foot-high compound wall and a dense growth of Ashoka and bamboo plantation within these walls block out any view of the mansion from outside.About 15 km away, at Shilapur village on the Nashik-Aurangabad Road, stands Armstrong Energy Pvt Ltd, a biomass power plant owned by Bhujbals son Pankaj and nephew Sameer. The name Armstrong is a translation of Bhujbal.The plant, which was supposed to have generated 6 MW electricity, has been dysfunctional since it was set up in 2009. A guard at the entrance claims repair works are on inside and says he is under instruction not to allow anyone to enter.Chhagan Bhujbal, former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Archive/Express Photo Chhagan Bhujbal, former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Archive/Express PhotoTrucks would sometimes bring in bagasse from sugar factories. But the plant has hardly functioned  if it was open for a day, it would remain closed for two, says a tea stall owner outside the gate. Officials at the Nashik District Co-operative Bank says the firm had defaulted on a Rs 11-crore loan. It hasnt paid back a single penny. Since Bhujbal enjoyed a lot of clout, nobody uttered a word. The firm again applied for a Rs 20-crore loan. But by this time, the state had appointed an administrator for the bank as it had run into huge losses and the bank rejected the loan straightaway, an official of the bank says on condition of anonymity.According to a complaint filed by Anjali Damania of the Aam Aadmi Party with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), the contract for furnishing Maharashtra Sadan was given to Armstrong Energy and another company owned by the family. Not so far from the biogas plant is Jai Electronics, formerly owned by actress Amisha Patels father Jai Patel. After this firm reportedly defaulted on a Rs 11.75 crore loan from Canara Bank, it was bought by Armstrong Energy a few years ago. At the entrance gate, which remains shut, is an Armstrong banner.The Bhujbals own several other properties in Nashik  besides Bhujbal Knowledge City, they own Armstrong Water Purifier, Chandrai Bungalow, Ganesh Bungalow, an eight-acre agricultural plot, among others. Laxman Savji, a BJP leader from Nashik, blames Bhujbal for making the politics of Nashik money-oriented. All this has happened in the last 10-12 years. Now it has became impossible for a common political worker to fight elections. Before Bhujbal came to Nashik, he had been a mayor of Mumbai. People hoped he would bring in change, but during his reign, only money and muscle ruled, he says.Chhagan Bhujbal with Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express Photo Chhagan Bhujbal with Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express PhotoIn Nashik, there are several stories of his alleged high-handedness. In 2009, then Nashik police commissioner V D Mishra reportedly attempted to extern four politicians with known criminal records, including one Kailas Mudaliar, who is said to be close to Bhujbal, but the act allegedly led to Mishra being transferred. It was only after Nashik residents took out protest marches that the suspension was revoked.His critics also accuse him of treating Nashik as his fiefdom, having ensured an Assembly ticket for his son (Pankaj is MLA from Nandgaon) and a parliamentary ticket for his nephew (Sameer was elected Nashik MP in the 2009 elections), while keeping Yeola (from where he is MLA) for himself.Despite several attempts by The Sunday Express to contact Pankaj Bhujbal, who is also named in the ED case, for this story, he remained unavailable for comment. Over the years, Bhujbals real-estate interests spread beyond Mumbai and Nashik too. In June 2015, after cases were registered against Bhujbal over the Maharashtra Sadan scam, the Maharashtra ACB raided his property in Achvan village, 15 km from the hill station town of Lonavala.According to ACB officials, the estate, which oversees a valley, is spread over 65 acres and has a six-bedroom bungalow replete with rare artefacts. The estate also has a pond and a stream with a barrage over it.Villagers say the family bought the property and bungalow around eight years ago. As long as he (Bhujbal) was in power, he used to come here, especially during festivals. The family would always be here around New Year. But no one has come here since last years raid, says a villager.The politicianNobody is questioning his politics or leadership, says BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, whose complaint to the ACB in 2012 brought out the Maharashtra Sadan scam. There are serious corruption cases which have been established and he is facing the consequences. But if he has done something wrong, the law will apply to him as to any other citizen, he says. As a diploma student of engineering in Matunga, Bhujbal had attended a Bal Thackeray rally at Shivaji Park, where he was so mesmerised by the Sena chiefs oratory that he decided to join the Shiv Sena. With his bombastic and aggressive style, Bhujbal was a natural fit in the party.NCP chief Sharad Pawar with party leader Chhagan Bhujbal during a meeting with party workers of Thane district in Mumbai. PTI Photo NCP chief Sharad Pawar with party leader Chhagan Bhujbal during a meeting with party workers of Thane district in Mumbai. PTI PhotoIn 1973, Thackeray helped him become a BMC corporator. Bhujbal would later go on to become mayor twice. In 1985, he became Shiv Sena MLA from Mazagaon, which he represented for two terms. But soon, things started souring for Bhujbal within the Sena, especially with the rise of the soft-spoken and tactful Manohar Joshi. In 1991, at the peak of the Mandal agitation, Bhujbal decided to quit the Sena, saying the party was against OBC reservation. He had by then fashioned himself as an OBC politician, but those who know him have always maintained that the real reason he left the party was because he felt sidelined. After the 1990 Assembly elections, when the Sena-BJP alliance won 85 seats, Bhujbal thought he would be named leader of Opposition. Instead, Thackeray chose Manohar Joshi.After he quit the Sena, Bhujbal joined the Congress led by Sharad Pawar. He reportedly spent 10 days in a safehouse in Nagpur to ensure he was not attacked by the Sena.When Pawar left the Congress to float the NCP in 1999, Bhujbal followed the Maratha leader. The same year, the Shiv Sena lost power and the Congress-NCP government came to power. Bhujbal was made Deputy CM and also handled the Home portfolio. As Home Minister, he did the unthinkable, moving against his mentor Thackeray. In August 2000, he cleared the arrest of Thackeray over his inflammatory writings in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana. It was a technical arrest and Thackeray was released on bail a few hours later, but the damage had been done and the Thackerays declared war. It took about 15 years for the two to patch up.Inside Bhujbal Farm: The 5 acre premise houses several bungalows  with a recently added palace and an office is on Agra Road, Nashik.

In 2003, he had to resign over his alleged role in the fake revenue stamp case, popularly called the Telgi scam. Though he subsequently received a clean chit from the investigating agencies, he sat out for the rest of the governments term. But when the Congress-NCP came back to power in 2004, Bhujbal was made PWD minister. For someone who had been Deputy CM before, that was a letdown but it was a key portfolio. One that has returned to haunt him in the form of the Maharashtra Sadan case.High net-worth: ASSETS ATTACHED* The ED has attached a 97,000-square-metre Navi Mumbai property worth Rs 160 crore belonging to the Bhujbal family in the name of Devisha Infrastructure.

58f545567be9e01a3579d160,Rs 1.3k crore for water charges unpaid,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/Rs-13k-crore-for-water-charges-unpaid/articleshow/51476959.cms,2016-03-20,"Aurangabad: The latest state economic survey reveals that dues of Rs 1,344 crore towards water charges are pending for the water supply to irrigation and non-irrigation purposes in Maharashtra till 2014-15.The state economic survey for 2015-16 shows that the amount to be recovered for non-agriculture purposes is Rs 695 crore and around Rs 648 crore for irrigation purposes. Farmers and water users' associations formed by irrigators are the water consumers for irrigation purposes and industries and domestic consumers are charged for water consumtion for non-irrigation purposes.Water expert Pradeep Purandare said technical issues such as absence of adequate staff with the water resources department, unavailability of proper records and lack of enabling rules have affected the recovery of dues towards water charges.""The Maharashtra Irrigation Act, 1976 does not have the necessary implementation rules almost four decades after its enactment. The records related to consumption of water are not properly maintained and updated in some cases,"" he said.The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) is the competent authority to decide water charges for irrigation and non-irrigation use. ""Water tariff collected from the users goes to the general treasury, while funds for operation and management of irrigation schemes come from the state budget. There is no structural link, whatsoever, between these two,"" claimed Purandare, adding that a section of farmers refuse to pay water tariff.Senior government officials said the recovery of dues towards water charges is a complex issue. C A Birajadar, executive director of the Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, said several pending disputes related to use of water in irrigation and non-irrigation category have caused an increase in the recovery amount over the years.""In the past, farmers had to pay 50% charges for using water from their wells. The practice was ended some years back and dues to be charged towards the past use are yet to be recovered. In irrigation sector, there are cases of penalties to be recovered from farmers and water users association for not ensuring proper storages during the discharge,"" he said.Many disputes involving industries regarding quantity of water released has also added considerably to the mounting dues. ""In non-irrigation category, sugar factories are a major consumer of water. As per rules, these mills have to send prior requisition for water and pay for minimum 90% of reserved amount. Sugar factories refuse to pay if the water required is less than the reserved amount,"" Birajadar said.Percentage of recovery of water dues from farmers cultivating rain-fed agricultural land is very less. In general, farmers need to pay for water usage after harvesting particular crop. They use water in advance, but later dilly-dally on payment, Birajdar said.Shrikant Umrikar, spokesperson of farmers group Shetkari Sanghatana, said the entire system has loopholes and gaps and therefore farmers cannot be blamed in isolation.""The WRD has to ensure transparency and accountability in its functioning regarding water supply to irrigation and non-irrigation sectors. If it happens, all stakeholders, including farmers will have a win-win situation,"" he said.Ashish Garde, president, Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture, said operational business are generally not the defaulters when it comes to paying water bills. The MIDC severs water supply if the bills are not paid within stipulated time and therefore running business cannot afford to be defaulter. It may be that the defunct units or sick units have failed to pay water bills, he said.Garde added that disputes related to quantity of used water do not drag for long and are usually settled within a couple of months.Usually, civic bodies fail to recover the water charges in time from the citizens. This also adds to the water charges due with the water resources department."

While Easter eggs, sugar bunnies and a festive Easter lunch mark the celebrations of the season, many also introspect the spiritual side of the season.Spiritually, the community looks at life from a different perspective during these forty days. Each season, the church urges its flock to reflect on an aspect important to one's life.Father Louis Kajar, parish priest of Divya Kripa Church in Kharghar, said that they emphasized on the virtue of being humble this year.

Seated in 'B' Block, in front of Sachin Tendulkar's box, was Mohammed Bashir, clad in a robe that announced: "" Jis desh mein Ganga behti hai, wahan meri biwi hain (The country where the Ganga flows, that's where my wife is)."" Hanging from one arm of his attire was a cape in the Pakistan colours with Shahid Afridi's face. The other arm bore the Tricolour with Dhoni's face. In his eyeball-grabbing bilateral attire, the tall and bearded Bashir was an unqualified hit with fellow fans, many of whom hounded him for selfies. ""This (the attire) happened after the Asia Cup final,"" said the 59-year-old Pakistani based in Chicago. ""I have had two heart attacks and six stents implanted. Still, I came all the way. Who knows if I will be around for the next World Cup?"" Bashir might trust Virat Kohli more than Shahid Afridi if he had to choose someone to bat for his life, but was quick to defend Captain Boom Boom against the backlash back home over his comment that he receives more love in India than in Pakistan. ""Those who are criticising him (for the comment) have never come to India. India mein mohabbat hai (India has an abundance of love). Once you have rosogolla in Calcutta, korma and firni at Karim's in Delhi and biryani in Hyderabad, you wouldn't care about blood sugar levels!"" he declared. Bashir travels to Mohali next for Pakistan's remaining matches and then to Delhi and Mumbai for the semi-finals, but he will be back in Calcutta for the final. ""India will be the champion. I know it,"" he said, pointing to the ""mini cup"" in his hands with the words ""India T20 World Cup Champion 2016"" inscribed on it. Ashok Chakraborty had arrived at Eden straight from Nabadwip, leaving behind Dol Utsab preparations back home. A Kohli fan, he had painted himself blue and glued pictures of the Indian players on his bare chest. He carried with him a foot-high trophy made of thermocol. ""I want to see the T20 World Cup again in (M.S.) Dhoni's hands,"" he said. Sikha Kedia came with one cheek painted in green-and-white and fast bowler Mohammad Amir's name. On the other cheek were the words ""WIN India"" in saffron, green and white. ""I love the way he (Amir) has been bowling since he came back from a ban,"" said Sikha, a doctor. ""I wish he had got a few more wickets, but I am delighted that India won."" Deja vu & dasher Twenty-nine years ago, Salim Malik had hijacked victory from certain defeat with 72 from 36 balls. On a smoggy afternoon in 2004, Salman Butt played the same role in another ODI, hitting a century that took the game away from Sourav Ganguly's India. Many inside the packed Eden Gardens had that sinking feeling again on Saturday night when Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina were out off consecutive balls. ""Match ta era throw kore dichchhe, ekmatro parley Virat banchate parey (They are throwing away the match, only Virat can save us),"" declared a middle-aged spectator in the upper tier of the clubhouse. An hour later, India had won the match and he the bragging rights. ""Did I not tell you that Virat is the new Sachin or even better in a crunch situation?"" SOS to Sania Afridi had just been caught in the deep by Kohli when Shoaib slammed a six over midwicket, followed by back-to-back boundaries in the next over to balance the equation. "" Jamaibabu ki korchhen? Sania ke dakte bol (Ask Sania to call him back)!"" quipped a teenager, referring to the Pakistan all-rounder's tennis star wife Sania Mirza. As if on cue, a ""Sania, Sania"" chant started from the gallery and reverberated through the ground. Sania may not have responded to the SOS but Eden's wish was granted after Shoaib had faced just five more balls."

""Every year, around 10 lakh sugarcane labourers and nearly equal amount of construction workers seasonally migrate from Marathwada. Current estimates indicate that such seasonal migration has touched a whopping 50 lakh this year and is likely to increase in the coming days,"" he said.He said the large-scale migration is primarily going to affect employment in agricultural and allied businesses. ""A dearth of labours was felt by farmers during the rabi harvest season. Marathwada has around 100 cotton mills that were struggling to get raw cotton and labour due to the drought-like situation. Similarly, construction houses from the region are not finding labour they used to get in the past as many of them have already migrated,"" he claimed.Fringe areas in Pune, Nashik and Thane districts have been identified as possible areas where a major chunk of migrant population has shifted.Sharing her observations about drought-like situation in Marathwada, Parineeta Dandekar, associate coordinator with the advocacy group South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said industries from the region were also finding it difficult to engage unskilled and semi-skilled labourers.""Industries have not only been struggling to get water, but also labourers. The employment scenario in general is grim as there are no takers for some category of jobs. Sugar industry is one of the affected areas. Parts of Marathwada have sugarcane growing belts and these were not getting labourers to harvest as easily as in past due,"" she said.Subhash Lomte of advocacy group Marathwada Pani Hakka Sangharsh Samiti said consecutive years of deficient-monsoon has resulted into drastic surge in seasonal migration. ""People are leaving their homes in search of water and livelihood. Such migration is going to have adverse impact on local economies as net production is going to come down,"" he said.Veteran economist and former member of Maharashtra State Planning Board H M Desarda said population shift would have adverse effect including worsening of issues arising out of urbanisation.""The government measures such as MNREGA and PDS should arrest the large-scale migration. Effective implementation of these schemes should take place along with other relief measures to help affected people stay back,"" he said.The state government has declared almost all villages in Marathwada as scarcity-hit, with an unprecedented number of tankers supplying drinking water in the eight districts of the region."

We confirmed the same with Sameer when we brought him for questioning last week. Neither of them was able to provide satisfactory explanations as to how the funds required for the purchase of the mill were raised, said another officer.The agency has alleged that the illegal gratification and bribe money collected by the Bhujbal family in kickbacks during the senior NCP leaders tenure as Public Works Department Minister was used in the form of share application money by two companies, Parvesh Constructions Private Ltd and Armstrong Energy Private Ltd.The funds were subsequently laundered and channelled to Armstrong Infrastructure and thereafter invested in the Girna Sugar Mill, said sources.The sugar mill, which had been shut since 1995, was acquired by Armstrong Infrastructure through auction proceedings from the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) for over Rs.27.82 crore in 2013. Farmers and activists in the area had at the time alleged that the mill was undervalued before being sold to the Bhujbals.Apart from a bank loan of Rs.10 crore, the remaining amount was paid allegedly using funds received from Armstrong Energy Private Ltd and Parvesh Construction Private Ltd.This rendered Girna Sugar Mill a tainted asset. Therefore, the property has been attached, pending confirmation from the adjudicating authority, the official said."

Instead paint someone's life by choosing a colour based on their birth sign. According to city-based astrologers, colours have their own significance in different birth signs. For instance, pink and cream bring positivity in the life of Taureans and pale shades like off-white and cream calm the jostled nerves of Arians. For Sagittarians, red gives them a high energy.""Colour therapy is a recognized stream of medicine in which the patient suffering from a colour deficiency is advised to gain that colour balance in his system. Holi is the best occasion for natural treatment which ancient Indian scientists designed in consonance with nature. You can select your own colour on Holi and apply on others if you know the birth sign to have the best vibration of nature as well as friendship. Organic dry colours must be used instead of wet,"" said Madan Gupta Spatu, an astrologer.On this day, the scene of 'Holika burning to ashes' is enacted every year to mark the victory of good over evil. Holika was a demon who tried to kill Prahlad, the son of King Hiranyakashyap. The king had won over the kingdom of earth and was very egoistic. His son was a devotee of Lord Vishnu which he did not like and asked his sister to kill Prahlad. However, when she tried to kill him, she was burned to ashes.Holi comes on the conjunction of changing season coupled with religious backgrounds. This is why a day prior to Holi, Holika Dahan is performed where people gather around fire as burning of wood with several herbs purifies the atmosphere and makes it germs and virus-free.Time for Holika Dahan | 4:55pm to 5:31pmAries | Red, pale shades like off-white and cream calm jostled nerves of Arians.

""We have conducted a vote with a raising of the hands. Out of 18,000 members, 700-800 members were present for the SGM. The meeting happened in the most transparent way,"" said Darekar. Only 25 members are required to make quorum, so Wednesday's turn-out showed a large uptick of interest in the bank's activities. Darekar added, ""If any member has doubts or queries we have formed a committee compromising five members that they can approach for information.""This effort to build in transparency about the massive write-off on the bank's non-performing assets could be seen as too little, too late, after the confidential report exclusively accessed by this paper, by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) stated in no uncertain terms, ""The methods of operations of the bank cannot be construed as not detrimental to the interest of present or future depositors."" Sixty per cent of these depositors are housing societies, which, will indirectly be paying for the write-off.Vivekanand Gupta, Advocate Secretary BJP Mumbai has called today's bank decision illegal. Gupta said, ""Public money is being siphoned off by those very people who were its custodian. There is huge corruption in Mumbai Bank and thus I had filed FIR with EOW on 27 March 2015, investigation is in progress and i have been following the matter. The loan to sugar factories was illegal and outside the jurisdiction of Mumbai Bank.""Mumbai Bank is the main financing agency of all affiliated co-operative societies in Mumbai district.Most of its current 19 directors are politicians, including Shiv Sena MLA Sunil Raut, BJP leaders Shivaji Nalavade and Kavita Deshmukh, Congress' Sandeep Ghanvat, and NCP's Jijaba Pawar and Siddharth Kamble, which is why the proposal has been perceived as a as a waiver for politicians by politicians.The bank claims that by passing this proposal, it will be cleansed of its non-performing assets (NPAs) and can begin with a clean slate.However, as the October 2015 the NABARD report has noted, writing off loans in the past has not decreased the bank's bad debt. ""During the 2013-14, the principal amount written off for 35 societies amounted to Rs 158.09 lakh and Interest amount written off was Rs 1616.70 lakh. Further, during the year 2014-15 the written off amount for 87 defaulting societies was Rs 1253.65 lakh under principal and interest Rs 1042.73 lakh as interest.""Also, there were discrepancies in the formula used for declaring NPAs, which has yielded undue benefits to various fraudulent entities. ""[The formula] in the software was wrong in respect of bogus housing loans sanctioned and frauds in gold loan and also shortfall amount after auctioning the gold,"" the report stated.Borrowing for house or house repair spiralled up dramatically - a the end of March 2013 it stood at Rs12,603 lakh and in two years, it had more than doubled to Rs 27275 lakh. While some are legitimate, the NABARD report found at least 41instances where these housing loans were fake (29 cases in Kurla, 3 in Vikhroli East and 9 in Bhandup West) even though it hadn't been able to undertake a review of all the branches.Wednesday's vote also lets 91 individual defaulters, with over Rs 58 lakh in debts off the hook.Two urban cooperative banks also no longer have to account for their borrowings of over Rs 2,53 cr.Sources from Deputy Registrar of Mumbai District Cooperative office told Mumbai Mirror, ""By next week we are initiating action on the NABARD report."""

A series of exhibitions and events on the community's culture and tradition are currently being held across the city on the occasion of Navroz and will continue till May 29. Organised by the ministries of minority affairs and culture, the initiative comes on the heels of the Jiyo Parsi program, which was launched in 2013 by the government to address the problem of the community's dwindling population.""Homai Vyarawalla (India's first woman photojournalist) used to be asked, yeh Parsi kya cheez hai? Now, so many years later we're trying to explain kya cheez hai"", said Shernaz Cama, academic, cultural conservationist and one of the moving spirits behind the initiative.The most ambitious of these exhibitions-The Everlasting Flame: Zoroastrianism in History and Imagination-is being held at the National Museum in collaboration with SOAS, the British Library and the National Museum of Iran.The exhibition provides a chronological account of the birth of Zoroastrianism, the contact between Jewish and Iranian communities, how it influenced Judaism and later Christianity and Islam. There are also sections on the Silk Road trade and the splendours of imperial Iran.Prayer fragments in the Avestan script, excerpts from religious texts, an enamelled reliquary casket from Limoges, a delicate griffin bird carved in bone, a faded mural of warrior Rustam spearing an enemy, among others are on display.A more accessible show, Threads of Continuity, on the living culture of the Parsis has been organised by the Parzor Foundation and will feature performances and events till May.""The kusti (the 72-thread sacred girdle) is an unbroken tradition from the Bronze Age till now. It is woven on the same loom then and now, in Iran, India and elsewhere,"" said Cama. ""That's the kind of continuity we wanted to bring alive.""Although the anecdote about Parsis promising to blend into India like sugar in milk is apocryphal, this show details that happy accommodation in Gujarat, Mumbai, and the Deccan. There are glimpses of the diaspora and influential Parsis from the Tatas to Homi Bhabha to Sam Manekshaw, as well as imposing portraits, knick-knacks like candelabras and tinkling music boxes.""For 18 years, we have documented the philosophy and faith, the multicultural amalgam that Parsis are in India,"" said Cama.Meanwhile, the National Gallery of Modern Art is hosting a twin show titled Painted Encounters-Parsi Traders and the Community, and No Parsi is an Island, curated by Nancy Adajania and Ranjit Hoskote. These shows trace the works of 14 Parsi artists, who worked in film, theatre, poetry, classical dance and crafts, over the past 150 years.""We wanted to breach the notions of canon, temporality, style and period. We were more interested in the 'worlding' of Parsis,"" said Hoskote.From 19th century oil paintings, dance sketches and photographs by Shiavax Chavda, Piloo Pochkhanawala's sculptures and Gieve Patel's canvases, the exhibitions show how Parsis shaped themselves to colonial modernity, nationalism, Indian modernism and global culture."

Most policies and administrative decisions in cooperation sector are still influenced by leaders from western Maharashtra.In a major development last week, eight BJP leaders including MLA Suresh Halwankar, were successfully elected as directors of Sahyadri Cooperative Sugar Factory, which is set to commence sugarcane crushing in a couple of years. With this, BJP has officially made a foray into the sector dominated by the Congress and NCP.Halwankar said, ""Current way of running sugar mills is not very honest. Radhanagari tehsil of Kolhapur produces huge sugarcane, hence we decided to support the Sahyadri Sugar Factory, which will not only crush sugarcane but it will also offer better returns to farmers. The board will soon submit a proposal for financial assistance so that its construction can be started.""The BJP, largely known for its urban presence, was struggling to break the Congress-NCP stronghold over the rural cooperative sector in the region. Though some prominent BJP leaders from Vidarbha and Marathwada have control over cooperative factories, the party had not been able to gain access to the cooperative sugar factories in Kolhapur.Senior BJP leader and minister for public works Chandrakant Patil said, ""The party has some leaders who are active in cooperation movement but mostly in urban cooperative societies such as scheduled urban banks. The reach of these banks was the urban population. We were trying hard to find a foothold in rural area, where controlling a credit society or bank carries a lot of value.""Patil was in touch with senior NCP leader Annasaheb Navane, who in last some years was disappointed with the Sharad Pawar-led party's negligence towards his demand for the Sahyadri Sugar Mills proposal. Patil saw an opportunity in winning over the senior leader, who could secure the BJP an entry into the cooperative sector. Navane was ZP chairman but failed to get all approvals for his party. After his death last year, his son Balasaheb approached BJP leaders for support.Patil held several rounds of discussions to arrive at a conclusion in which Balasaheb decided to appoint eight BJP leaders to be directors of his 21-member factory. It includes MLA Suresh Halvankar, Atul Joshi, Nathaji Patil, Hemant Kolekar, Deepak Shirgaonkar, Dileep Chougule, Popat Durge and Balasaheb Patil.The win of eight BJP leaders is considered significant for the party that has been keen on developing the cooperative sector leadership, which plays a crucial part in state politics.Prakash Pawar, head of department of political science at Shivaji University, Kolhapur said, ""The leaders in freedom fight got natural advantage to become political leader. At village level, they would call the shots and joined the Congress. In last four decades, leaders like Gopinath Munde and Uttamrao Patil contributed to BJP to make it more acceptable. We should not forget that Munde initiated formation of unions of sugarcane harvesters to control their exploitation from sugar mill management, which was chiefly controlled by Congress leaders. Munde subsequently toed the same line and formed his own sugarcane mill in Beed district.""Other BJP such as Nitin Gadkari, Eknath Khadse, Vinod Tawde and Raosaheb Danve followed the same line but all these leaders are from Vidarbha and Marathwada."

Due to the lay-off, 306 families have lost their livelihood. Recalling the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos promise on multiple forums to take over the factory, and subsequent constitution of a committee to make suggestions to run the factory in cooperative mode, the Left parties accused the government of lay-off even before the report saw the light of the day. Sugarcane farmers from the surrounding villages are selling their produce in Maharashtra, the press release said, and demanded that they should be given an assurance of local purchase."

He was delivering a lecture on Education for Development organised by the T.A. Pai Management Institute (TAPMI), here.Mr. Gadkari said that there was no dearth of resources in the country, but there was a lack of vision. More than technology and research, a vision is essential. A leadership with vision could create miracles, he said. Conversion of knowledge into wealth involves everyone. The people in the country are competent. But they should get the opportunity. More research and technological competence is required to reduce the cost and improve quality, he said.Emphasising on reducing pollution, Mr. Gadkari said that there was a huge potential for bio-diesel and bio-CNG. If methane from waste water is converted into bio-CNG, it would be possible to run at least 50,000 buses. The plan of my ministry is to run 100 buses on bio-CNG. It will be cost effective, he said.Stating that the sugar industry in the country was facing problems, he said that at present ethanol was being made from molasses from sugar factories. We are adding five per cent ethanol in petrol. We are soon going to run 50 buses entirely on ethanol in Nagpur (Maharashtra). It will be possible to run cars and trucks on ethanol. Ethanol is a bio-fuel which will also help farmers in rural areas, he said.Mr. Gadkari said his ministry would start road works worth Rs. 2,00,000 crore before May 26 and would take up works worth Rs. 3,00,000 crore next year. The Minister said that his ministry has taken a decision to increase the length of National Highways from the existing 96,000 km to 2 lakh km. Already, 1.55 lakh km of road had been declared as NHs, he said.His ministry was giving importance to developing inland waterways in 111 rivers across the country because it was cost effective compared to other modes of transport, Mr. Gadkari said."

The ED has further contended in its case that the money received in complaints was routed through companies owned by the family and invested in a real estate venture in Navi Mumbai, which never took off.The ED arrested Sameer on February 2 this year and the senior Mr Bhujbal on March 14. Both are in judicial custody.According to ED officials, the charge sheet, which is over 11,000 pages, was filed in a special PMLA court on Wednesday and contains details about the transactions between various companies involved, the money trail, and statements from numerous witnesses connected to the case.Apart from the Bhujbals, the ED has also named corporations such as DB Realty, Balwa Group, Neelkamal Realtors & Builders Pvt. Ltd., Neelkamal Central Apartment LLP, and Kakade Infrastructure, as well as individuals like Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, and Sanjay Kakade. The firms mentioned in the charge sheet had bid for the contract during Mr Bhujbals tenure as Public Works Department minister, and he allegedly received kickbacks from them.Assets worth Rs 131.86 crore have been provisionally attached, an ED official told The Hindu . The attached assets include flats, a bungalow, fixed deposits, land, a building, and a sugar factory.The ED, in its charge sheet, has contended that the money received by the Bhujbals was routed to Kolkata and back, after which it was invested in commercial properties in Maharashtra, including a 25-acre plot in the Rohinjan village in Navi Mumbai, which was bought by Devisha Infrastructure, owned jointly by Pankaj and Sameer, in 2009. A multi-storey residential project called Hex World was announced on the piece of land, and Devisha Infrastructure accepted over Rs 44 crore from more than 2,300 people as payment for advance booking for flats in the proposed residential society. However, the project never took off, and the Navi Mumbai police, based on a recommendation by the Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau, subsequently registered an FIR against Pankaj, Sameer, and other officials of the company.The EDs investigation is based on a report submitted by the ACB, which was ordered by the Bombay High Court to constitute a Special Investigating Team to look into allegations made by a Public Interest Litigation filed against Mr Bhujbal. The ACB, too, registered a separate FIR in the matter and filed a charge sheet, indicting Chhagan for misusing his official position to award the contracts to a firm of his choice.The ED has recorded statements from several people, including independent parties who helped to launder the money before it was invested in Maharashtra. Officials confirmed that the money passed through three to four levels before being routed back to the state. Further inquiries into the money trail and the assets generated out of the proceeds of the crime are in progress. If required, supplementary charge sheets will be filed.""The investigation into the other case pertaining to the construction of the Central library in Kalina is still in progress,"" the official added."
5b2e32f79855b7245313f93d,Mumbai-Chennai Train Travel Costs Same as 1 Kg Paneer,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/at-rs-300-mumbai-chennai-by-train-costs-same-as-1-kg-of-paneer/story-Jv5CbthGm94e6R2PfogU6I.html,2016-03-31,"Just how affordable is train travel in India?The Railway Board  the apex body of the state-owned transporter  has answered that question in a rather compelling manner.Sample this: The price of a train journey in the general class from Delhi to Chandigarh is a mere Rs 95  the cost of toothpaste of 140 grams. The Mumbai to Chennai distance in the same category of travel can be covered for Rs 300  the price of one kilogram of paneer. For Rs 20  less than the price of a kilogram of sugar  one can complete a train journey from Lucknow to Kanpur.If the top rail bureaucracy has taken the effort to put together such facts in an official note, the reasons are understandable: While direct and indirect hikes in passenger fares for the AC classes have intermittently come, fares for the unreserved, general class have remained unchanged in the last decade.Losses in passenger earnings, meanwhile, have mounted and were placed at an enormous Rs 30,000 crore in the last fiscal year.In a presentation made to railways minister Suresh Prabhu recently, officials put across this point in a straightforward manner: The political resistance to the idea of raising fares for general class passengers must finally and decisively be overcome.Ninety five percent of passengers travelling on the network of the Indian Railways are general class travelers.The option of hiking fares in higher classes no longer exists, as fares for these categories is already high and passenger volumes in these categories have been falling on account of competition from roads and airlines. However, even a marginal increase in fares for the general class will bring in big revenues for the railways, a senior ministry official said.Former railway board member Subodh Jain views the option of raising fares for general class passengers as a flawed and misplaced idea.General class passengers are those that constitute the nations economic activity, while also generating maximum revenues for the railways by way of passenger earnings. They travel in inhuman conditions with no onboard catering or toilet facilities. Burdening such passengers with fare hikes would be criminal, Jain said.With the current NDA dispensation  as with the earlier UPA government  the subject of general class fares have been a red herring of sorts.Shortly after the NDA assumed power, Prabhus predecessor and then railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda announced a 14.2% hike in passenger fares across the board, but promptly rolled it back for general class travellers in the Mumbai suburban system at the insistence of the Shiv Sena.During UPA-II, Trinamool Congress chief and persuaded then prime minister Manmohan Singh to remove her nominee Dinesh Trivedi as the railways minister after he announced a hike in all classes of fares. Fares for the general class were subsequently rolled back.The clamour for a hike in passenger fares for the general class as a measure of hauling the state-owned transporter out from its current state of financial crunch has once again started to resonate in the corridors of the Rail Bhawan.Rail finances have been in the red in past years, given the mounting graph of the operating ratio (paisa spent against every rupee earned by the transporter).Prabhus position has been that the fare hike option should be exercised as the last resort, as he has instructed the bureaucrats in his ministry to work out innovative strategies to cut losses and generate additional revenues.In a paper submitted to Prabhu, the Railway Board members argue that train fares are not only approximately one-fourth the price of a bus fare but were as ridiculously low as a price of a geometry box in some cases.According to a comparative fare chart prepared by the officials, the bus fare to travel the 278-kilometer distance from Lucknow to Gorakhpur is Rs. 394, while the train fare in the general class is priced at Rs. 95 - the price of one kilogram of detergent powder. The Kolkata-Chennai General Class fare of Rs. 360/- is equivalent to the cost of one kilogram of tea leaf."

A supplementary charge sheet may be filed in the future over the Kalina housing scam, in which the Bhujbals allegedly cheated prospective flat buyers of Rs 44 crore. Bhujbal and Sameer have been arrested by the ED and are currently in judicial custody.A high-ranking ED officer said, Chhagan Bhujbal is the main accused as he was a powerful minister in the Maharashtra government. This would not have been possible without him.An ED source said the charge sheet, which runs into thousands of pages, contains evidence in form of bank-statement analyses, statements of employees of the Mumbai Educational Trust that implicate Bhujbal, an income tax report on the financial health of companies promoted by the Bhujbals, and reports of the Registrars of Companies (ROC).The source added that government employees booked in the case have not been named as accused yet as there is no direct evidence that they were involved in money-laundering. They (government employees) have not been named yet but it does not mean that they have been given a clean chit. Investigations are still in progress and we are collecting evidence, the source said.The charge sheet provides a detailed account of how the Bhujbals allegedly laundered money through a maze of Kolkata-based companies. We have incorporated statements of the Kolkata-based operators, who have also been accused in the case, the source added.HT was the first to report that the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had found that several firms in Kolkata, said to have invested in companies allegedly promoted by the Bhujbals and their associates, were bogus and may have been used for money laundering.The EDs charge sheet alleges that the accused netted Rs 870 crore from the crimes. Assets worth Rs 131.86 crore have been provisionally attached by ED. The attached assets include flats, bungalows, fixed deposits, land, buildings and a sugar factory, said an ED officer."

That's the city that gave the State two chief ministers, and one of them ruled for eight years.""You hear this a lot these days in Aurangabad. It's an argument that could work for a separate Marathwada state - ""Look, even powerful leaders could get nothing for their own constituencies, because of the domination of leaders from western Maharashtra."" But it's mostly made by those against a separate state, as a comment on the spinelessness of the region's leadership, a factor seen to be responsible for its backwardness.Marathwada has had at least six prominent leaders: S B Chavan, Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan as CMs; a deputy CM - Gopinath Munde, and a union home minister in Shivraj Patil. If they could do nothing to get their share of the state's resources, would the powerful western Maharashtra leaders let a small state dependent on their resources survive?Can the idea of a separate state be thrown like a pebble in a lake, hoping that ripples would be created?That's exactly what's happened over the fortnight since former state advocate general Shrihari Aney approved of the idea of a separate Marathwada at a function in Jalna. Aney had to resign given the ferocious reactions from all parties, but the ripples created by his statement are still disturbing the seemingly calm waters of Marathwada.They haven't become waves though, and may not for a long time.Aney's statement is being discussed only in intellectual and political circles. Among the people, the idea of a separate state is not just incomprehensible, it's condemnable.

For there's no question that Aney's statement had the backing of the BJP. For one, Aney is known to be chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' close associate. Then, as soon as Aney had made this statement, in Latur, BJP MP Sunil Gaekwad's followers led by Shivaji Narhare went all the way to Delhi to convince Narendra Modi about it.Significantly, Aney also has the support of the BJP's mentor. A day after his statement, senior RSS ideologue M G Vaidya stated that the RSS had always conceived of Maharashtra as four states, and had divided its units in Maharashtra accordingly.The RSS has no base in Marathwada; and though the BJP won 15 seats here in the Assembly polls, it's the Shiv Sena, which won 11, that has popular support. Chandrakant Khaire, fourth-time MP from Aurangabad, dared Aney to enter Marathwada. ""Our leader Balasaheb gave us the slogan 'Jai Maharashtra','' he told Mirror. ""In Parliament too, everyone greets me with those two words. This is Chhatrapati Shivaji's Maharashtra. I want to ask the RSS: you talk of Akhand Bharat, but want to divide Maharashtra?""The Congress was practically wiped out in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, but both the seats it managed to retain were from Marathwada. ""We will never allow this,"" said former CM Ashok Chavan, Nanded MP, whose father S B Chavan is universally respected as having been the only leader to have done something for the region. ""Our struggle was never for a separate state; it was always to join Maharashtra.""The ""struggle"" that everyone talks about refers to the Hyderabad Mukti Sangram, the movement against the rule of the Nizam, a struggle that's unique to this part of Maharashtra. Marathwada was part of the Nizam's domain, and when he resisted joining India after Independence, the majority of his subjects revolted. It wasn't just his feudal, autocratic rule that people were fed up of. A major reason for anger, says Prof Jaidev Dole, columnist and professor of media studies, was the ban on Marathi.The Nizam let loose the armed communal force called the Razakars on those opposing him. Khaire is 63, and he remembers his mother telling him how the Razakars burnt down houses in her village. Such stories are the stuff of legend in Marathwada, the way stories about going to jail during the Quit India movement are the stuff of legend in the rest of India.And when liberation came in 1948, after the Indian Army defeated the Razakars, the freedom to speak and write in their mother tongue was one of its most cherished fruits for the people of the region.It was but natural then for the majority Marathi-speaking people in Marathwada to join the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, and become part of the new Maharashtra state in 1960. The Vidarbha region joined Maharashtra with some conditions. But Marathwada put no conditions. Its leaders, the tallest of whom was the Gandhian Govindbhai Shroff, felt they were joining their own people, recalled Suryaprakash Dhoot, general secretary of the Latur unit of the Marathwada Janata Vikas Parishad, founded by Shroff. ""We were like a bride who returns to her parents' home, full of affection and secure she'd be welcomed,"" is how Prof Sharad Adwant, general secretary of the Parishad puts it.Given this very recent history, what was the BJP thinking by floating the idea of a separate Marathwada for which, Aney suggested, the people ought to struggle? It's likely the BJP had forgotten all about the region's own freedom struggle, because the RSS had played no part in it.Different reasons are being assigned to Aney's remarks. Aney himself, like his father and grandfather, is known to be a supporter of a separate Vidarbha. His remark is seen as a bid to provide a stronger base for the creation of a separate Vidarbha. ""When two regions are seeking to break away, it's always easier to allow one to do so,"" says CPI district secretary Ram Baheti. ""It's easier to get your demand by tagging someone else with you; it's a classic bargaining tactic.""A separate Vidarbha was part of the BJP's election manifesto, and given the way the BJP has taken away to Nagpur key institutions allotted to Aurangabad, most people in Marathwada see a separate Vidarbha with a fully equipped capital  Nagpur  being created just before the next Assembly elections.Vidarbha's CM would of course be Devendra Fadnavis. What about the BJP's key ally's opposition to the idea? ""The BJP knows the Shiv Sena is dead set against any division of Maharashtra. Yet, the fact that it let Aney float the idea shows that it wants to cut Shiv Sena to size,"" says Subhash Lomte of the Maharashtra Labour Union. Aam Aadmi Party's Aurangabad candidate, Lomte is now with Yogendra Yadav's Swaraj Abhiyan.With other parties ambivalent about a separate Vidarbha, the Sena will end up as the only party opposing it, and will be routed from there during the next assembly election, says Lomte. ""The BJP has killed many birds with one stone.""While Ashok Chavan ascribed the statement to a ""realization by the BJP that it can't handle Maharashtra, and its eagerness to dominate one section of it, ie Vidarbha"", Khaire foresaw this as a precursor to the creation of a separate Mumbai.There is yet another possible reason for Aney's statement. Right now, the region's drought-hit are clamouring for ""pani, kaam, pagaar (salaries) aur ration"", four things mentioned as a priority by villagers in Turkabad near Aurangabad. In Ambejogai, Manav Lok, an NGO working in the field of watershed development, has also helped villagers organise themselves around MNREGA. And across the region, the press is exposing the lapses of the government in handling the drought.What better way to divert the attention of the angry masses than by letting forth a red herring of a separate state, asks Baheti. While the masses have certainly not been diverted, the intelligentsia are discussing the idea seriously. Ironically, the drought has given the discussion a sharper edge. Both those in favour of and against the idea use the same arguments  the discrimination faced by the region ever since it joined Maharashtra.Prof Sharad Adwant lists the areas of discrimination: Denial of its share of water from the state's dams, specially the Jayakwadi Dam built by S B Chavan specifically for dry Marathwada, by the building of smaller dams further upstream by the leaders of Western Maharashtra; denial of a second railway line  the existing one was built by the Nizam  and not even accepting the simple demand of making Aurangabad part of the Central instead of the South Central Railway; the lackadaisical functioning of the Statutory Development Boards  only the Marathwada Board has no head; the refusal to hand over the huge backlog of funds for the region's development, the diversion of funds meant for Marathwada to other regions; the stoppage since CM Prithviraj Chavan's tenure of the practice of having an annual meeting of the cabinet in Aurangabad; the diversion of major institutions from Aurangabad to Nagpur and Chandrapurin the last two years.To get their rights, Marathwada's citizens, including the Parishad, have had to go to court, with their own government opposing them. The well-known economist H M Desarda has just filed a PIL on the state government's insufficient and unscientific measures to tackle the drought, specially its much-touted Jalyukt Shivar. Water expert Pradeep Purandare's PIL on proper implementation of Maharashtra's Water Resources Act resulted in the court ordering an inquiry into all irrigation projects approved between 2007 and 2013.""The demand for a separate state is the people's cry of frustration,"" says Adwant, who says the Parishad is committed to the vision of its founder, Govindbhai Shroff - a developed Marathwada within Maharashtra. For Marathwada's development, Shroff and leaders such as Shantaram Pandere, who has worked among agricultural labour for years, waged prolonged agitations.""Like others go for an annual pilgrimage, we would go to jail,"" recalls Pandere. ""Not too many political parties joined us.""But in an embarrassment for the Parishad, its president, advocate Pradeep Deshmukh, wants a separate state, free from domination by western Maharashtra.Where are the resources, asks former Statutory Board member Vijay Diwan. Be it agriculture, industry or human development, Marathwada lags way behind even Vidarbha. ""Curtail farming, make the new state an IT hub,"" replies Deshmukh.But where's the popular demand for a separate state? Today, it's restricted to a few rootless individuals. Can they build a mass movement that would include Dalits, 14 per cent of the region's population, and Muslims, constituting 25 per cent?While some Dalit intellectuals such as Prof Bhimrao Bhosale of Dr Ambedkar University, a BJP member, cite Dr Ambedkar's advocacy of small states and a separate 'central Maharashtra', the mass of Dalits here continue to be at the receiving end of Maratha violence, just as they were during the 16-year-long Namantar agitation to rename Marathwada University after Dr Ambedkar. Like elsewhere in Maharashtra, Marathas dominate Marathwada.As for Muslims, they are indifferent. The only MLA from the MIM, Imtiyaz Jaleel describes a separate Marathwada as an ""unhealthy baby that won't solve the people's problems."" Hamid Khan of the Movement for Peace and Justice felt a small state could open the doors to corporate takeover of public resources.Muslims here are still smarting from the numerous arrests of their youngsters on terror charges. The latest humiliation was a Muslim policeman being forced to say 'Jai Shivaji' in Latur. Whether under the Congress or the BJP, Muslims know they won't get equal treatment.Marathwada's leaders have changed the region's traditional cultivation patterns and set up sugar factories and distilleries that consume most of its scarce water. Vilasrao Deshmukh's family owns five sugar factories just outside parched Latur; the Mundes own three, as well as a distillery that has received notice for polluting the villages around it. Twenty new sugar factories came up in 2012-13, a drought year, and in 2014-15, another drought year, the region saw record production of sugar from its 70 factories.Theoretically, a smaller state could see better representation of its minorities and better management of its resources. But this potential of a smaller state would only be fulfilled by a mass movement with democratically elected leaders. ""Today's politicians and bureaucrats are out of touch with the bottom half of the population,"" points out Desarda. ""A new state under their leadership would make no difference."""

He was 74.The last rites on Monday are scheduled to take place at the Ankush Nagar cooperative sugar mill, which he had founded.Tope had a political career of about five decades, and left his mark in the fields of politics, cooperative sector and education. Known for being a close confidante of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, he first suffered a heart attack in Delhi while being an MP in the year 1995, following which he was operated at a London-based hospital.He made his first mark in politics in the year 1972 after he bagged a Congress ticket and won the legislative assembly seat and it also marked the beginning of his association with Sharad Pawar. Soon, in the year 1972, he formed the Matsyodari Education Society and started following the development pattern followed by Pawar in his region.Ankushrao soon started focusing on different sectors and managed to bag the chairmanship of Jalna District Cooperative Central Bank, Jalna District Central Cooperative Bank. He had also brought the first elected ZP of Jalna under his own wings.Further increasing his grip on the cooperative sector in the region, Tope laid the foundation of the Samarth Cooperative Sugar Factory in the year 1981.It was in the year 1999 that his son Rajesh was given the ticket and this is Rajesh's fourth term as an MLA from the constituency. The Topes were amongst the first to side by Sharad Pawar when he parted from Congress and formed his own party NCP."

Pramod Karnad, managing director of MSC Bank, said this was the eighth time the bank had raised valuation of sugar since October.Increased valuation and increase in margin allow mills to have more money to pay cane growers.Sugar prices on NCDEx platform has been bullish with prices hovering above the Rs 3,500 mark. The future prices of July, October shows that the price of the commodity can cross the Rs 3,700 mark easily. Also in the international market the price has been on the rise.The increase in price of sugar failed to help millers clear dues to growers. As of March-end, cane worth Rs 15,000 crore has been crushed in the state with millers paying Rs 12,000 crore towards payment of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP).Although the state stares at a backlog of Rs 3,000 crore, officers of the sugar commissioner say last month was better in payment as most mills have adhered to the 80-20 formula for payment of FRP. Officers say that around 12 mills have unpaid dues worth Rs 200 crore carried forward from the crushing season of 2014-15.As of Tuesday, 144 of the 177 mills that had gone for crushing have closed down for the season leaving only 33 operational.The state has seen 727.24 lakh metric tonnes of cane being crushed and 819.54 lakh quintals of sugar being produced.Increase in sugar prices has also seen Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghathana upping the ante for more payment for growers.MP Raju Shetti of the Sanghathana on Sunday held a rally in Kolhapur and asked for higher payment to cane growers. Also there are talks of implementation of the Rangarajan Committees profit sharing formula along with quick payment of balance money to growers.However, mills appear to be pessimistic towards any such move with Shivajirao Nagavade Patil, chairman of the Maharashtra State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories, talking about serious financial crisis being faced by millers. From April onwards, mills will have to pay installments towards excise subvention and soft loan of the Central government. While cumulatively both loans would translate into a financial burden of Rs 2-3 crores, the volatility in sugar prices has made business unstable,he said.Patil said over the last few days sugar prices have again dipped both in national and international markets.Only if sugar prices remain stable at Rs 3,600 per tonne would sugar mills be financially viable, he said.According to him, the problems of millers would be more acute given the bleak outlook of the crushing season 2016-17.Solapur, Ahmednagar and major portions of Pune and Marathwada will face a huge dearth of cane. Mills will find it difficult to go for crushing, he said. In view of the present situation the Federation has asked the central government to reschedule the payment of loans.We have asked for time from the chief minister to discuss the matter and we would be meeting him again, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

He said the necessary permission from the Railways had been obtained to carry water.He was replying to a question raised by Latur city MLA Amit Deshmukh. Around 50,000 villagers have migrated from Latur. The government must announce interest waiver to industries which had to be closed down due to water scarcity and steps must be taken to control the water tanker rates, said Mr. Deshmukh.Section 144 has been invoked in Latur to avoid riots over water as all sources have dried up. The city is allegedly getting water once in 20 days.The Revenue Minister, however, refuted the allegations of migration, and said the government is committed to supplying water to the people. Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil alleged that government officials were misleading the Minister by providing false information.Had the water in the Manjra dam been saved instead of being used for the Manjara sugar factory, Latur city would not have suffered to such an extreme level, said Mr. Khadse. He referred to former Chief Minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh for not being able to solve the water problem despite being the Minister for 21 years and CM for eight years.The Opposition accused the government of playing politics over drought. Mr. Deshmukh, who is the elder son of the deceased Minister, said the allegations against the Manjara sugar factory were completely baseless since it used water only after obtaining government permission.NCP leader Jayant Patil too objected to the Ministers reply, claiming it was an attempt to divert attention from the problem. The government was warned of the water scarcity. Instead of politicising the issue, the government should use at least 10 trains to supply water to Latur.Former CM Prithviraj Chavan said the government was delivering speech, not results.It is such a pity that the government is still blaming the previous governments, especially at a time when it has enough time to tackle the problem.Section 144 invoked in the city to avoid riots over water as all sources have dried up, says Minister"

I thought it was merely a little weakness that I experienced from time to time, he told the doctor who diagnosed his medical condition. The results for Parul Pandey, just 24 years old, were even more shocking. The blood pressure monitor pegged her status at 97/64.Of the 317-odd civic staffers who visited the medical camp on Thursday, 38 were found suffering from hypertension and unusual blood pressure while 41 staffers suffer from a blood sugar problem.However, of the 38 stressed-out staffers, 15 were diagnosed with the medical condition for the first time. Similarly, of the 41 diabetics identified, 23 were ignorant about their condition or had only just developed the lifestyle disease.While the staffers found to be suffering anxiety bouts and high blood pressure were over 35 years of age, the low blood pressure patients were found to be relatively younger. Two more staffers who complained about incessant coughing bouts were also directed for further medical examination to confirm whether they suffer from tuberculosis.Even amongst those already diabetic, one civic employee was pulled out of imminent medical emergency and directed to seek specialised medical attention after he registered a 506 blood sugar count, which is astronomically high, with 150 being in the normal range for adults.While low BP could also be caused by heredity, it is slowly becoming a lifestyle disease. What is worrying is that a small fraction of the BMC staffers (317) took advantage of the medical camp that we organised on the occasion of the International Health Day today. Had more staffers taken advantage of the camp the figures may have been more alarming, a senior BMC doctor who headed the camp told The Hindu on condition of anonymity.Two more staffers were required to provide blood samples that have been sent for laboratory tests for malaria, the results being expected on Saturday.Stress has become a way of life in almost all professions. We need to more actively pursue yoga and other de-stressing programmes for government employees if we are interested in their health and well being. We have provided medicines for two days to the 79 who were identified with medical aberrations, the doctor said.Of the 38 stressed staffers, 15 were diagnosed with the medical condition for the first time"

From Gudi Padwa (for Maharashtrians) to Poila Boishak (for Bengalis) and Vishu (for the Malayali community), each one is celebrated in its unique style. From feasts to cultural activities, the list is endless.Thapna, which means staphana (installation) in Hindi, is the New Year as per the Rajasthani and Haryanvi calendar. Homas (yagnas) are held at home and people greet each other by saying 'Nuvan baras ri badhaiyan'. Mouth-watering dishes like dal baati churma, variety of spicy kachoris, boondi raita, ghevar and rabdi are laid out for the guests who visit their homes on this day.Gudi Padwa is celebrated in Mumbai and other parts of the state with much pomp. A bright yellow, orange or green cloth is tied to the tip of a long bamboo with sugar crystals, neem leaves, twigs of mango leaves and a garland of marigold flower. A silver or copper pot, known as the Gudi, is placed in an inverted position over it. 'Gudi padvychya hardik shubhechya' is how Maharashtrians greet each other on this day. Colourful rallies are held on the streets with traditional performances that include lezim with dhol and tasha. Women bikers are seen in traditional finery parading with saffron flags on this day. Typical Maharashtrian delicacies are prepared in households.Ugadi translates to 'the beginning of a new age'. Andhraites and Kannadigas start their preparations almost a week prior to the festival. Apart from buying new clothes, jewellery and other accessories, homes are cleaned. On this day, Andhraites make 'Ugadi Pacchadi' (a special dish), which is known as 'Bevu Bella' in Karnataka.

Jaggery demand generally picks up around Ugadi, the Telugu New Year, with it being one of the main ingredients in the Ugadi pacchadi and the traditional sweets.Sriramanavami that comes a week later further drives the demand with widespread use of jaggery for the sweet syrup ""Panakam,"" a mixture of water and jaggery.Traders benefit""Demand picked up from parts of the State, mainly Guntur and Krishna Districts and upcountry markets in March. As a result, the lowest variety sharply rose from Rs.230 for 10 kgs to Rs.250. Deluxe variety is up from Rs.275 to Rs.340,"" says a prominent trader Korukonda Butchiraju of Anakapalle, one of the largest jaggery markets in the country.Traders who had built up stocks expecting a rise in the price following drought conditions and failure of crop in Maharashtra are laughing all the way to the bank.Arrivals till month-endUntil the demand picked up, about two-thirds of the stock used to comprise the inventory. But after the price spike, about 80 per cent of arrivals are going to the upcountry market and only the remaining is going to building the stock. With an estimated turnover of Rs.130 crore, the transactions in the market cover about 50,000 tonnes of jaggery.The arrival of stock lasts till the end of April. In the neighbouring Berhampore, medium variety of jaggery is selling at a staggering Rs.345 with stock not being abundantly available from other markets. With Sriramanavami approaching, the demand is likely to go up further.Crop failureOne of the main reasons for sharp rise in the demand is said to be crop failure in Maharashtra following acute drought conditions. Now jaggery sells at around Rs.54 a kg and sugar is far behind at Rs.38 in local stores. Market watchers say even sugar price has gone up of late."

If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued.People are dying  and you want to maintain cricket pitches, asked an over-excited TV anchor. But not as morally excited as the learned justices of the Bombay High Court who opined, as quoted in the media, that this entire thing of the utilisation of water for IPL matches needs to be thought over. The court also apparently asked the BCCI counsel whether cricket matches were more important than people or preserving water. An important question.Watch Video: Discussing The IPL Water ControversyThe first response to this question, especially by immoral thinking economists as well as those with a modicum of common sense, is to ask a related question  what alternative use is there for water, and what is its price? In the desert, water is worth a lot; and it is also worth a considerable amount in drought-prone areas. An average person consumes 150 litres of water per day or 54,000 litres per year. Assume that a sixth of the population of Maharashtra (around 20 million) has no access to any water for half a year  that is, Maharashtra needs to supply (transport) to the drought areas 540 billion litres of water. The IPL matches in Maharashtra are estimated to use six million litres of water for watering the grounds. But that is an estimate of a corrupt capitalist (and therefore, dishonest) BCCI  so let us double the stated amount. So the honourable justices, and the oh-so-moral NGO Loksatta Movement that brought the PIL against IPL, and our learned TV tripping (as in TRP) anchors believe that saving .002 per cent of water will alleviate the water misery of 20 million people. It is not for nothing that my column is called No Proof Required  moving the IPL will only provide water for 400 people for half a year.The Financial Express editorial, IPL vs Sugarcane (April 8) illustrates the utter stupidity of the position that fewer cricket matches in Maharashtra will solve the water shortage problem. If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued. In particular, look at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. Maharashtra encourages the growing of sugarcane: In 2014-15, the estimated sugar output from Maharashtra was 10 billion kgs. Each kg of sugar uses 2,000 litres of water. In other words, the total water used for sugarcane cropping in the state was 20 trillion litres. You do the math. As the FE editorial hints, the savings from not having the IPL matches are not even a minuscule fraction of the water used by the sugarcane growers in Maharashtra. By creating a moral song and dance about the IPL, the immoral elite only proves to the world that it is intellectually dead.Neither drought nor poverty is new to Maharashtra. First and foremost, the responsibility of delivering the much-needed water to all its citizens (and not just the wealthy) lies with the state administration. What was the BJP in Maharashtra, in particular Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, doing for the past two years? Of course, doing nothing except banning beef and moralising about the need to say Bharat Mata ki Jai everywhere. What could have Fadnavis done? And, given that he has not done it, what can he do now? Basic water needs of humans (150 litres a day) can easily be transported to the drought-hit areas on a daily basis and expenses paid from all the taxes collected by the state. Then what is the problem? And why hasnt this solution been offered, and used as yet?The (non) agricultural policy of the Centre has distorted the food market for decades. The Punjab economy is in a mess because of too much rice production in the state. The Maharashtra economy is in a mess because of the production of too much sugarcane. According to the counsel for the trendsetting Loksatta Movement, the BCCI and the IPL have the means and resources to shift matches out of Maharashtra but the state government does not have the means, and/or the political desire, to transport water to its poor drought-hit citizens?The IPL-versus-water controversy raises a lot of non-sequitur issues, especially the contention that morality has anything to do with it. The need of the hour is to conserve water, and herewith some people who should be honoured for suggesting (moral) rules for water conservation. The top prize goes to Moralist # 1, Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, who has recently banned the sale and consumption of all alcohol (except foreign-made liquor) in Bihar. Note how far-sighted and water-saving this policy is. No beer will be sold, so less toilet water needed for flushing beer-induced piss.Moralist # 2 award goes to the ever- thoughtful and far-sighted Pahlaj Nihalani, the man in charge of the Central Board of Film Certification of India. Sensitive to the IPL-versus-drought conflict, he recently gave a U/A rating to The Jungle Book, a remake of a childrens film. The U/A rating means that children below the age of 12 have to be accompanied by an adult. His reason for the U/A rating (and I am not making this up) was that the 3D effects were too scary for children sitting alone. Note how very subtly Nihalani is helping the water cause. Fewer children screaming means less water is needed to calm them down afterwards, and this saved water can be directed to the Maharashtra farmers via the BCCI headquarters and the Bombay High Court, both of which are located in Mumbai.Herewith are some other Nitish-Nihalani (NN, which can also stand for No and No) type sensible policies to help lessen the need for water, and help farmers and ordinary people in the drought-hit areas of Maharashtra (and elsewhere):Recommended Policy # 1: Stop asking people to say Bharat Mata ki Jai. Think about it  500 million people not saying Bharat Mata ki Jai on a daily basis will save enough water, through reduced thirst, to flood Latur.Recommended Policy # 2 (which is not only recommended but practised in Fadnavis-land): Maharashtrians were asked to have a muted Holi celebration to save water. Of course, if Holi were not a Hindu festival, Holi would have been banned.Recommended Policy # 3: Fadnavis could help the poor citizens of his state, and improve governance if he removed the ban on the slaughter of old cows (above 16 years of age). Water consumption will go down. Although, as a Supreme Court (2005) judgment noted, doing so would mean that manure production will also go down  this was the primary reason why the honourable court banned the killing of all cows.Some questions remain: Why did the honourable court not throw out the morally juvenile petition of Loksatta? And why the argument that the IPL should pay for drought relief? What sense does that make? It is as sensible as placing an environmental tax on the purchase of cricket bats because trees have been felled.

58f58db17be9e01a357a30ff,Scent of Ajmal's success lingers in home town Hojai,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/Scent-of-Ajmals-success-lingers-in-home-town-Hojai/articleshow/51750801.cms,2016-04-09,"Hojai (Nagaon): On the sprawling courtyard of a madrassa in Alinagar, about 3 km from Hojai town in central Assam's Nagaon district, students wearing spotless white kurta-pyajamas play basketball. They break their game only when visitors enter the courtyard to greetings of 'As-salamu alaykum'.There are 45 students in this madrassa and the evening game is part of their curriculum which is centred around memorizing the Koran. Beneath the daily grind of the madrassa, however, are buried more than 100 years of history. The madrassa is part of the legends surrounding this Muslim-dominated town which has thrived on the perfume trade.Any mention of Hojai's perfumes would be incomplete without reference to the legendary Haji Ajmal Ali and his five sons. Four of them, including perfume baron and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal, were born in the madrassa itself. The fifth was born in Mumbai.The Ajmals' connection with the madrassa doesn't end here. At one corner of its courtyard is a tiny, tin-roofed hut where Ajmal Ali first started his perfume distillery in the 1950s. From this humble beginning, the entrepreneur, and later his sons, would go on to float the Ajmal Group of Companies in over 10 countries.It's no surprise then that the Ajmal family continues to inspire respect and awe among residents of Hojai, and those of Alinagar in particular. Tales of the Ajmals' philanthropy abound and have achieved the status of myths. ""They are very naek (righteous people). Their names inspire respect,"" says 60-year-old Haji Abul Kalam, who introduces himself as the Ajmals' neighbour.The third of Ajmal Ali's sons, Badruddin, 66, is no longer in the family business, but concentrates solely on running and expanding AIUDF and a host of charitable and education trusts established by the family.Since the birth of AIUDF in 2005, Badruddin's party has showed Assam's 34.22% Muslim population a political alternative to Congress. The party has significant presence in Muslim-dominated constituencies which were hitherto Congress strongholds. An MP from Dhubri Lok Sabha constituency, he won 10 seats in 2006 and 18 in the 2011 assembly elections. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, he won three seats.A Fazil-e-Deoband (which is equivalent to a master's degree in Islamic theology and Arabic) from Darul Uloom Deoband, Badruddin juggles politics and social work deftly. ""Charity is inherent in the Ajmal family. Badruddin bhai's grandfather used to look out for people,"" says Faizul Haque, Badruddin's schoolmate in Hojai.A member of the shura (advisory board) of Darul Uloom Deoband, Badruddin's image as a maulana helps him garner support, especially among Bengali-speaking Muslims who form the bulk of the state's Muslim population. Badruddin, too, works the combination to his advantage, delivering slogans and duwas (blessings) at his rallies. Villagers lining up with water-filled bottles for his duwas is a common sight at AIUDF ralliesBadruddin is a one-man army for AIUDF. From mobilizing resources to leading the election campaign, his is the last word. This election, which will see him contest from South Salmara seat in Dhubri, is no different.After popping pills, mostly for blood sugar and pressure, Badruddin takes a chopper to visit far-flung places in Assam. ""I eat what I get along the way,"" he smiles. ""That's why AIUDF has emerged as a force this polls,"" he adds. ""Every day, I attend six to seven rallies across the state and go to sleep at 3am. I wake up at 5. After Fazr prayer, I sleep for another hour. After that, I start my daily chores,"" says the man behind AIUDF."

On October 8, he had written to the Chief Ministers of all States, including Maharashtra, specifying the immediate measures needed to be taken to alleviate the sufferings of the rural population.In his four-page letter, Mr Yadav had suggested that the Maharashtra government officially declare drought to prise open the funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund, take emergency measures to tackle the water crisis, implement the rural employment guarantee scheme and the State Employment Guarantee Scheme, restructure agri-loans, enhance ratio under the PDS, and compensate farmer for crop losses.On September 30, 2015, the monsoon ended, and it was clear on October 1 that Marathawada would face another drought. Had the government acted upon our suggestions, things would not have reached such severity, Mr. Yadva said, releasing his letter.In the letter, Mr. Yadav had suggested to the government to stop any diversion of water for non-essential purposes. He had suggested temporary ban on supply of water for water-intensive sugarcane crops, ban reopening of sugar factories, regulating drawing of water by bottling plants, stopping unauthorised diversion of water for industries.It is a crime against humanity to supply water to sugarcane crops when there is acute drinking water shortage. Activists have repeatedly pointed out how sugar factories are sucking out water in the Marathawada region, but yet in Latur, water was supplied to sugarcane farming, he said.I had suggested a temporary ban on water supply for sugarcane crop and sugar factories"

The compensation due after her crop in Mangrul village was scorched by the drought. But after ten trips to the bank and multiple visits to the gram panchayat, Surekha Mane had had enough. On March 28, the 55-year-old widow stood outside the district collector's office and poured kerosene on herself.The suicide attempt was an eerie parallel to the tragic case of the farmer, Madhav Kadam, from Marathwada's Nanded district who swallowed poison outside Mantralaya two weeks ago because he received only a portion of the drought aid due to him. Kadam died but Surekha was rescued just before she lit the match. ""I was pursuing the relief cheque for three months. I was totally frustrated,"" said Mane. Some days earlier she had visited the collector's office and handed over a note about her intention to kill herself.The money was finally transferred to her account the evening of her suicide attempt. ""The problem was that her account had become non-operational. There were not enough transactions,"" said Osmanabad collector Prashant Narnaware. We received the relief money from the state in February and most of it has been distributed,"" he added.With drought aid now being distributed by cheque, technical glitches and the lack of bank accounts are proving to be barriers in sending the money to farmers. In February, relief money worth Rs 498 crore was returned to the state. In the arid belt of Marathwada which is experiencing its fourth drought in five years, farmers are on the edge and every bit of relief helps. This is the second consecutive year of drought in which all the 8,522 villages across eight districts have been impacted. Water levels in the region's dams are down to just 4.5%. Officials estimate crop losses over the last year to be as high as 65%.Already this year, as many as 244 farmer suicides have been reported in Marathwada. These account for 21% of the cases reported in 2015.Among the victims was Surekha's husband, who swallowed poison in his field just six months ago, unable to cope with a Rs 2 lakh debt. ""The compensation I received after his death and the Rs 12,444 I got as crop relief has already gone to creditors,"" she said.Officials claim the employment guarantee scheme is offering work to struggling farmers. As many as 1.18 lakh people across Marathwada's eight districts got work a fortnight ago.Yet on the ground, migration is on the rise and farmers are finding it difficult to tap into the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) scheme work. Farmers also say that MNREGA wages are much lower than the market. Also, the wages are not given, which makes it less appealing for casual workers.In Latur's Masurdi village, over 300 residents have migrated to Pune, Mumbai and Bhiwandi in the last few months. ""Earlier around 50 villagers used to migrate each year. Many are working as drivers or hamaals in markets or private companies,"" said Masurdi sarpanch Nana Barde.Yet the region is also witnessing a worrying wave of migrants returning early. Marathwada is known for the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters who travel to western Maharashtra's cane fields for six months each year. ""This year, cane cutters from the village had to travel all the way to Madhya Pradesh to find work and they returned three months early. The crop wasn't enough,"" said contractor Rameshwar Shelke from Osmanabad's Khamaswadi village.It is this crop that water experts in the region blame for exacerbating the water crisis in Marathwada. This historically arid region has 61 sugar factories, and acres of the water-guzzling sugarcane crop.""The water used for one hectare of sugarcane can irrigate over eight hectares of rabi jowar,"" said water expert Pradeep Purandare."

Feasting in the sight of urchins, for instance, or kissing on the street in a nation starved of feasts, love, sex and foreplay. In the same category of vulgarity is the watering of cricket grounds in a state where there is a drought. It deserves lament, perhaps in a sweet mediocre collegiate poem. But to take the matter to court is out of proportion.The pubic interest litigations against the hosting of a cricket tournament in Maharashtra have fanned a moral outrage that is, like many urban moral outrages, a confluence of serious concerns, contempt for a wealthy organisation, pious exaggerations, irrational arguments and personal agendas.The issue before the Bombay High Court was that Maharashtra should not be allowed to host the Indian Premier League matches because cricket grounds consume thousands of litres of water every day in maintenance. The court saved Saturdays inaugural match but asked, probably with anger, Are cricket matches more important than people? Now, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is a despicable private club of industrialists and politicians, but the courts question was hyperbolic. Also, people matter to the board because that is how it makes money.And what exactly is the reasoning of the court? Is not an international-grade cricket ground maintained when there is no tournament underway? If an active cricket ground exists, it would be watered on most days, or it would die. So why this fuss before the tournament? Also, the calls for the cancellation of matches are comical for a simple reason  it is on the days of the matches that the grounds are not heavily watered.Read | Tackling drought is states responsibility, not cricket boardsThe water that is used on an Indian cricket field, according to an official, is about 15,000 to 20,000 litres of non-potable water a day, or less than five tankers. That is as much fresh water that is required to make one kilo of chocolate, according to the data of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a global network.Sunil Gavaskar, whose relationship with the BCCI, it is reported, has collapsed and whose lucrative contract with the board may end, wrote in his column, The issue of drought is one such where many lives are at stake. (True). I am no expert on ground and pitch preparation (True) Nor do I know whether the water that will be saved if the matches are not played can be used to irrigate the lands that have become dry and parched. (It cant be used). He went on to suggest that the matches should be moved out of Maharashtra. It is a small price to pay, for the alternative could well be unnecessary loss of lives of those whose hard work gives us our daily roti and dal.This is a mystifying exaggeration  the suggestion that if matches are held in three cricket grounds in Maharahstra the lives of farmers would be at risk. But it is a popular view.Read | No way we can do this: BCCI official on moving Maharashtra IPL matchesThere is much veneration of farmers in India by those who are not farmers. These are the very people whose greatest fortune was that their grandfathers or fathers ejected their progeny from the agrarian economy. Most farmers in India have small land-holdings and they are doomed. The reason why most Indian farms are land waiting to become real estate.If people really cared about water, all they have to do is adopt a healthy diet  quit eating red meat (just one kilo of mutton requires over 10,000 litres of water to produce, or half the quantity of water required by a cricket ground in a day), quit rice (one kilo of rice needs about 2,500 litres of water, but half of this does re-enter the hydrological system), wheat and sugar (about 1,000 to 1,500 litres for every kilo).Read | Tea without sugar more effective than IPL banThe human body does not require rice and wheat. In fact it does very well without grain. Rice and wheat are the staples of the world because they have been subsidised to be so. The world has promoted an unhealthy diet that takes considerable fresh water to produce. Add to it the evil called sugar, we have a species that sucks out water to eat poorly. The hypocrisy of those who are outraged by the watering of cricket grounds lies in their very paunches.And, if people really care about poor farmers they would fight for a greater role of science. India is unable to experiment with biotech, which includes processes to create drought-resistant crops, because the Donald Trump of science, Vandana Shiv has maligned the technology.It was inevitable that the talk of farmers and drought would bring up the outlandish hypothesis of farmer suicides, first popularised by Shiva and later sustained by other noted activists, like P Sainath, because it aligned with their economic grouses. Let me repeat an assertion this column made earlier while arguing that farmer suicides are primarily a depression story where poverty only plays a role:In a country where most people can be termed farmers, it is not anomalous that most people who kill themselves would be farmers. In fact, what is anomalous is that a huge majority of farmers who commit suicide are male. If both official and activist statistics are considered, it would appear that women in impoverished farming communities are among the least likely Indians to commit suicide. Activists who ascribe social, economic and political reasons for suicides would never be able to explain why. In most nations of the world, including India, the number of men who commit suicide is several times more than the number of women. this pattern is reflected in the gender ratio of farmer suicides.But the idea that farmers commit suicide because of crop failure or loans or that India is not socialistic enough, is a beloved of activists. There is a book waiting to be written here if you are interested and may I suggest a title: P Sainath Loves A Good Farmer Suicide.Manu Joseph is a journalist and the author of the novel, The Illicit Happiness of Other PeopleTwitter: @manujosephsanThe views expressed are personal"

By 2016 end, we will ensure replication of Israels per-drop-more-crop water management model to treat water as essential and economic commodity. Drip irrigation in high water-intensive crops will have to be enforced by one and all, including sugar cane cultivators, he said.Stating that drought could not be dismissed as a rural phenomena, Fadnavis said the state would integrate policies to co-relate water management through linking of rivers, adopting crop patterns adaptable to climate changes and creating urban-rural markets through agro-industries.The government has been facing criticism from various quarters, such as political opponents, courts and water experts, with regard to management of drought in Maharashtra.On the controversy related to holding IPL matches in Maharashtra when the state is reeling under severe water shortage, Fadnavis said, There is no question of providing drinking water to nurture the pitch. If they shift the game outside Maharashtra, I have no problems.The CM said the state was fighting hydrological drought in some parts and agricultural drought in other. If 15,600 villages are reeling under severe water scarcity in Marashtwada , there are 12,000 villages in Vidarbha that are reeling under crop loss despite moderate rains. Almost 25,000 to 27,000 villages, out of the 40,000, are reeling under farm crisis, he said.Reckoning that April and May would be critical as water levels in dams, wells and ponds would go down further, he said, We have made adequate provisions to ensure no body goes hungry or thirsty. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has approved my proposal to deploy regular trains to supply water to drought-hit districts. Moreover, we have adequate food stocks in every drought-hit district. The 14 districts worst hit are being provided with free food grains and 68 lakh people are availing the scheme.Fadnavis said the government had been working on major policy reforms to plug the financially bleeding district cooperative banks on one hand and enhance the irrigation potential, which has remained stagnant at 18 per cent for 15 years, on the other.On the steps undertaken to help the drought-hit, the CM said the government had made Rs 18,000-crore investments the last 15 months, spending on relief and crop loss compensation, crop insurance, ensuring free education to children in schools and professional colleges, and arranging health care.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

They will walk less, and eat more junk, all of which will easily covert them to diabetics, said Dr Mohan, adding India has the second-highest conversion rate from pre-diabetic to diabetics, according to another study.This conversion of pre-diabetics, said Dr Mohan, needs to be halted urgently.Seventy percent of Indians stay in rural areas, where even a marginal increase in diabetes would drive up incidence rate of diabetes in India.According to recent estimates by the World Health Organisation, 8% of Indias population is diabetic, and 2% of all deaths could be attributed to the lifestyle disease.Dr Shahshank Joshi, an endocrinologist in Mumbai said variation in the food consumed says a lot about the likelihood of developing diabetes.There are geographical variations in the prevalence of diabetes, as the food consumed in the north is different from the south. The protein-carbohydrate ratio differs in every region, he said.But its not all bad news for the pre-diabetics. Losing weight, walking at least 30 minutes a day and improving diets can help prevent the disease, doctors said.The ICMR study is mapping the prevalence of diabetes across the country. So far, Tamil Nadu tops the list in prevalence, with 13.7% diabetics living in the state that has just 6% of the countrys population.Data from 15 states is being analysed, with the states in the north-east showing lower prevalence when compared to Bihar and Jharkhand.Doctors privy to the data said even rural pockets of Jharkhand is showing a high prevalence of diabetes, indicative of the urbanisation and the subsequent changes in lifestyle and food habits."

Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur are the three venues in Maharashtra scheduled to hold the IPL matches.Maharashtra -- home to Rising Pune Supergiants and Mumbai Indians -- was to host 13 games after April 30, including the final in Mumbai.""Organising the IPL is a gigantic work. It's not easy. All preparations had been done, completed. Now shifting the matches will be a problem,"" Shukla told 'India Today'.""So far, we have not got the written order, after we get that, we will work out an alternative plan. We always respect the court. We need to talk to other franchises. Out of 19 matches in Maharashtra, 13 have to be moved out, we will have to work it out,"" he added.The BCCI had offered to contribute to Chief Minister's drought relief fund besides supplying water to the drought-affected areas. Shukla said the Board could not have done anything more than that.""The key problem is water for farmers, which we are trying to find a solution to. We were willing to give water, contribute to the CM's fund. Now shifting matches will be a problem,"" Shukla said.""If matches are to be shifted, where will they be moved, how will they be moved, all these issues are involved. And this comes after nobody raised an issue about the 24 World Twenty20 matches that were held recently,"" he said.""Nobody raised these issues for six months. Whatever was required, we were willing to do. In fact, I would like to point out that a lot many other sports and cultural events are going on in Maharashtra, which also use water and they should also help,"" he added.Shukla said even the sugar factories and golf courses should be pulled up for their water usage.""Not only sugar factories, construction should also be stopped. All golf courses, they require huge amount of water, nothing is being done against these golf courses,"" he said.Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia, who was among the first to advocate shifting of matches, said he is glad that sensitivities of the drought-affected people in Maharashtra are being respected.""Maharashtra has been under drought.

Photo: PTIThe Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) whether it was willing to contribute to the Chief Ministers drought relief fund and was ready to shift the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches out of Pune.A Division Bench of Justices V.M. Kanade and M.S. Karnik also asked the Board how many days it used 40 lakh litres of water and whether it was willing to supply water to villages facing scarcity.The court was hearing a public interest litigation plea filed by the NGO, Loksatta Movement, pointing out that at a time when Maharashtra was reeling under the worst drought, 60 lakh litres of water were being wasted for maintaining cricket pitches to conduct IPL matches.Senior counsel Rafiq Dada, appearing for the BCCI, said the Board had requested the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) to provide sewage water which, after treatment, could be used for 17 matches of IPL in Mumbai and Pune. Mr. Dada said Kings XI Punjab, a franchise of IPL, was willing to shift three of its matches out of Vidarbha to Mohali.Senior advocate Vineet Naik, on behalf of the Maharashtra Cricket Association, said the association could get the water from the RWITC transported from Mumbai to Pune. The judges asked whether the RWITC would give an undertaking to provide the treated sewage water for the matches.Acting Advocate-General Rohit Deo said they had initiated a preliminary inquiry into the source of water. Advocate Suresh Pakhle, representing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said the water in borewells and wells in the city was non-potable. The court then asked whether the water could be treated and made potable.The HC said a sample could be taken for chemical testing. The Bench said once the potability level of water was found, the court could consider giving a direction. Listing out water policy measures to a question, the AG said Maharashtra had a two-fold solution  long-term and short-term. The government had asked Marathwada farmers to use drip irrigation for sugar factories as it would reduce 50% of water consumption. The water policy was in place. The first priority was to use it for domestic, hygiene and sanitation purposes, and the second was agriculture."

(Source: isro.gov.in) Space Applications Centre Director Tapan Misra. (Source: isro.gov.in)Stating that there is no paucity of innovation in India, Tapan Misra, the director of Space Applications Centre  an arm of ISRO  said that the countrys space agency has been helping the government in keeping the prices of agri-commodities in check through advanced predictions using satellite imagery.You would be seeing that the prices of potatoes or onions do not rise as much as they once used to. There was a time when their prices used to rise 500 percent and governments used to fall. The reason is that we do predictions based on satellite imaging and give production estimates to the government, said Misra while addressing an award ceremony of Gujarat Innovation Society (GIS) where Ela Bhatt, the founder of SEWA, Ahmedabad was awarded along with 14 other innovators.So if they know that the sugarcane production in UP and Maharashtra is going to be low, the government gets time to book sugar from Brazil. That is the reason why the prices of sugar have been between Rs 20-40 per kilogram during the last 10 years. The prices are lower than the inflation rates, he added.We (ISRO) has given the country so many communication satellites. Through the television programmes aired through these satellites we make the country laugh and also make them cry; fights in family happen and they stop as well. We do not give importance to this, but only when we do something like a Mars mission then ISROs contribution is acknowledged, Misra said while stressing on the innovations done by scientists at this institution.The senior ISRO scientist said that Indians do not respect the fact that a lot of innovations happen in the country with frugal finance. He narrated how SAC was planning to buy a special kind of CNC machine from Germany, but got the same made through a local company in Rajkot. If we had bought from Germany, it would have costed us Rs 12 crore, and we only paid Rs 1.5 crore to the local company. We ended up saving a lot of money, Misra said about a decision that was made a couple of months back.The chief guest of the event Dr C Muralikrishna Kumar from Niti Aayog said the NDA government under the Atal Innovation Mission will begin work on the establishing 500 tinkering labs in schools across the country in the next one month. We will set up a challenge where schools will compete to set up these laboratories that will boost the spirit of innovation among school children.Meanwhile, the GIS awards that were given out during the event included Ela Bhatt, founder of SEWA.

Maharashtra is now suffering its third drought in the last four years, with monsoons having failed in both 2014 and 2015, and with the 2016 summer beginning arid and burning hot. With this tragedy as context, the Bombay High Court has ruled that all Indian Premier League matches scheduled in Maharashtra after April 30 -- 13 of them - should be accommodated elsewhere because pitches need water. One estimate suggests that the originally scheduled 20 matches would have used six million litres of water. The court has said that this would not be a solution, but the move could be the beginning of palliation. There is a symbolic force in the court's decision, a call to arms against the drought. For apart from the great financial loss this move would cause, there is also the damage to the IPL's brand value, for its reach is international. Besides, cricket is part of Maharashtra's soil: Sachin Tendulkar is a dazzling star in a firmament that is crowded with heroes, whether they be Sunil Gavaskar or Vijay Merchant or Polly Umrigar. Symbolic gestures, however, are not solutions. The problem in Maharashtra is longstanding, and this does not refer to the drought alone. One of the state's major cash crops is sugarcane, for the growth of which Maharashtra's conditions were always unsuitable. Apart from anything else, growing the crop and crushing it after harvest for the sugar industry demand enormous amounts of water, which has never been overflowing in the state. As it is, 80 per cent of it is grown in areas where water is scarce anyway. To compare it to the IPL wastage, one estimate says that more than 1,500 litres of water are used to produce one kilogram of sugar, that is, from growth of the plant to sugar production. So if 2.5 million people, or 20 per cent of Mumbai's population, have one teaspoon of sugar in their tea a day, that is nearly 10,000 kg of sugar, that has cost 15 million litres of water. Rather more than the IPL pitches. Since this situation has taken years to develop, it is amazing that no policy regarding water use and governance has evolved. Neither has there been any effort to engage, on a broader scale, experts, researchers and water specialists to work out how water can be sourced and preserved to sustain life and livelihoods for the long term in a water-scarce state. Ambition without vision is dangerous."

At every corner, make shift stalls have been set up selling fresh fruit juices, fresh lime coolers, sugar cane juice, aerated colas and fresh fruit. This is the season when these sellers garner maximum business and with the heat destined to worsen until the rains arrive. These remain a popular sight all over the satellite city.With temperatures rising by the day people opt for lighter meals, often having their fill with a plate of sliced fruit and a juice. While fresh fruit juices top the list, ice-cold lemonade, sugarcane juice, lassi and chaas are also popular choices. And of course there are the branded colas and fruit juices, but nothing beats the heat like street food. A limbu paani seller in Vashi sells close to 300 glasses a day, on weekends almost 500. ""This is the season and people are always looking for something to quench their thirst,"" he said.Not to be left behind are the sugarcane vendors and their unusual contraption for extracting the juice. At Rs 10 a glass this is the best quencher, and you will find them at almost every street corner in Navi Mumbai. ""Usually we buy the sugarcane in bulk from the wholesale market twice a week, but during this season, we need to make that trip almost every day since stock gets over,"" said Savita Gawde, a seller from Nerul.""Fruit plates are the best bet during this season,"" said college student Deepak Jagtiani. Affordable and fresh, he feels they are easy on the wallet and more importantly they fill you up. Although he says college canteens introduce summer specials on their canteen menus, the temptation to eat from the street is hard to resist.At signals bottled water is sold at Rs 10 a bottle by street urchins. Although branded, many motorists are skeptical about the source of the water. ""It is tempting, but I am not sure if the water is purified as it should be. I would prefer buying water from a store,"" said a motorist Pravin Gandhi."

About 30 lakh people in Solapur city and district are dependent on water from Ujani dam for drinking and agriculture. ""Mula and Mutha rivers carry sewage from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The confluence of these rivers meets Bhima river, which comes towards Ujani dam. Along its way, MIDC, sugar mills and other villages release waste into Bhima.

""Because of their lethargy and apathy, we have to suffer. Serious health issues have cropped up,because of this polluted water,"" she said.The Mula and Mutha rivers are among 302 polluted river stretches in the country identified by the Central Pollution Control Board. Both have untreated domestic wastewater released into them due to inadequate sewage treatment, fewer pumping stations, sewage treatment capacity as well as open defecation on the river banks.The Solapur Municipal Corporation has three plants to treat Ujani water, but these are far from 100% efficient. plants are far from 100 percent treatment of Ujani water. ""In rural Solapur, there are no water treatment plants. Ujani water reaches some districts through canals and lift irrigation schemes and people drink untreated water,"" journalist Suryakant Asabe said.Residents of Solapur have demanded that the state government must take strict action against Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).State environment minister Ramdas Kadam recently told the state assembly that the government has registered a case against PMC commissioner for not taking action against those who are polluting Bhima river. ""In the next five years, the government plans to set up a river purification plant worth Rs 990 crore to revive Bhima.

He also admitted that PMC and PCMC have not set up enough sewage treatment plants to treat sewage generated by the cities.This reply, however, has not satisfied Solapur residents, who want Puneites to pay for polluting their drinking water. Solapur people are not ready to buy any explanation. ""Pune city is using the maximum water from dams. Citizens are polluting our drinking water. It is the responsibility of Pune and the state government to give us clean water,"" local businessman Arvind K Shinde said.Kavita Kadam, a homemaker, said, ""The government is providing water to Latur by sending a train.

The project would also focus on laying 113.6km of sewer lines and renovation and rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations.

Internationally, practitioners have accepted guidelines put forth by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups which advise testing of fasting blood sugar and vein blood test at the first and second hour after giving the woman 75gm of oral glucose. If any of these values are higher than normal - more than 92mg/dL at fasting, 180mg/DL at the first hour or 153mg/DL at the second hour - the woman is declared a diabetic.In 2014, the Union health ministrydeclared a single-step diagnosis for detection of diabetes in pregnant women as the national guideline, called the Dipsi (Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India) guideline. Developed by a team led by Chennai-based diabetologist Dr V Seshiah, it says woman walking into a clinic for pregnancycheck for the first time be given 75g of oral glucose. If the finger prick test done two hours later shows her sugar levels above 140mg/dL, she should be declared a gestational diabetic. ""We prescribed this after nearly three decades of research. It's suitable for Indian conditions,"" said Dr Seshiah.Now, a study published in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism shows half the number doctors in India follow neither of these guidelines. Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and for future diabetes. In India, anywhere between 3.8% and 21% pregnant women have been diagnosed with diabetes. While prevalence is high in cities like Chennai, Trivandrum, Hyderabad and Mumbai, it is low in rural areas.The survey by diabetologist Dr V Mohan and obstetrician gynaecologist Dr Uma Ram among 3,841 doctors across India found that although 84.9% agreed all women had to be screened for diabetes. But only 67% prescribed it in the first trimester. Though nearly 40% of obstetricians and less than 30% of endocrinologists preferred non-fasting test as per the Indian guidelines, less than 15% of them used the criteria properly.The study also showed that the Indian test has less than 30% sensitivity, a matter of concern. But Dr Seshiah said the Indian protocol was developed keeping in mind some social realities. ""Culturally, pregnant women in India are not allowed to fast and in rural areas, women have to travel a long distance to reach a hospital. It will be impossible for her to come to a hospital without food,"" said Dr Seshiah. ""Asked to come come back to the hospital fasting on another day, nearly 30% of the woman don't come back. There is a good chance of missing diabetes in these women,"" he said.""The single test improves attendance at screening but the technique hasn't been good enough to catch all women. There are false positives,"" said Dr Uma Ram."

In exchange for the plat, all the family has got so far was a cheque of Rs 1 lakh that they claim has not been cashed yet.How did Parvesh Constructions - both Sameer and Pankaj (Bhujbals son) were directors of the firm - get this prime real estate plot in Santacruz? The answer is a classic story of land sharks, middlemen and those in power bending rules to grab realty in Mumbai.The story began unravelling only when both Sameer and Chhagan Bhujbal were arrested, after Claude Fernandes - Franciss son - deposed before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the anti corruption bureau (ACB) against Parvesh Constructions over February and March.When our bungalow was demolished in 2005, we were not even informed. We were kept in the dark when the rights of redevelopment were passed over to Parvesh Constructions, via a middle man, from the original developer we had signed up with. They registered a supplemental agreement that does not bear our signatures. Over the past 10 years, a nine-storey swanky building was constructed where our bungalow stood. The Bhujbals lived in the top six floors, even as we, the rightful owners, ran from pillar to post to get some share of our home, said Doreen Claudes wife.Claude and Doreen, both senior citizens, are the only surviving members of the family in Mumbai. Claude, a consulting engineer, was born and brought up in this family home and was to promised a 958 sq ft independent flat after the redevelopment.He has been waiting for this flat for the past two decades.We met Sameer Bhujbal three or four times, through one of his cronies, but got nothing but empty promises in the last ten years, the couple said.The redevelopment issue is just skims the surface of the problems the family has faced.It was in 1994 that the family, represented by its eldest daughter Sheila Athayde - in whose name the property rights were - signed an agreement with M/s Palm Shelter Estate Development Pvt Ltd (part of the K Raheja Corp), transferring to them the power of attorney to redevelop the property.In total, the family was promised 3,600 sq ft of built-up space, Rs 30 lakh in cash and two flats on of 850 sq ft on tenancy basis in this agreement.This redevelopment, however, did not take place for ten years and the developer allegedly claimed the size of the plot was smaller. The family had got one cheque of Rs 1 lakh from Palm Shelter.Fed up with their plot not being developed, Claudemet and placed trust in a former neighbour and secretary of the Bombay Catholic Cooperative Housing Society, Frederick Noronha of M/s Frest Investment and Leasing Co. Pvt Limited, who promised to assist them in the redevelopment.In his written complaint to the ACB in the current probe, Claude pointed out Noronha took their signatures on several documents but cheated them, got Parvesh Constructions into the picture and made a supplemental agreement between Palm Estate and Parvesh Constructions in 2003.The couple first filed a complaint with the Santacruz police station in 2005, on realising this supplemental agreement did not have their signatures and had been registered without their knowledge. They also sent a complaint to the sub-registrars office and later to the Mumbai crime branch, with copies of the letter to everyone, including the then chief minister.The complaint fell on deaf ears. They have now been instructed by investigating officials to lodge a criminal complaint with the ACB. The ED has already noted preliminary investigations show Bhujbals were living in the building illegally.When HT contacted Pankaj Bhujbal, he said, I dont want to go into details of this, as the matter is in court. But with regards to this property, certain legal processes and permissions were pending so it took time. We had every intention to give the owners their due. Pankaj admitted the family was living in the Solitaire building for some time.The middleman, Fredrick Noronha claimed, They [the Fernandes family] have been making allegations and sending complaint letters, instead they should have just moved court. The agreement they have with Parvesh is legal and binding and the firm has to give them the promised flats.A spokesperson for Palm Shelter Estate Development Pvt Limited, in an email response to a questionnaire sent by Hindustan Times, said: The allegations made against us are mischievous and denied. There were other considerations payable and costs incurred in addition to Rs 1 lakh. Additionally, transfer of development rights to Parvesh Constructions was done at the instance of the owners and their representatives, and documents were executed by owners in favour of Parvesh Constructions.The owners had made the original agreement with this firm for the redevelopment.Amid allegations of amassing a multi-crore empire spanning mines in Indonesia, sugar mills in Nasik and several real estate companies, now former public works minister Chhagan Bhujbal and his family face accusations in a land grab case, which left the real owners, a Catholic family from Santacruz, locked out of their family home and denied of its ownership for more than a decade.For the past three years, Bhujbals family, including his nephew Sameer, was staying in the nine-storey Solitaire building in Santacruz (West), built on a plot that did not belong to them.

For the plot, all the family has got so far is a cheque for Rs 1 lakh that they claim has not been cashed yet.How did Parvesh Constructions  both Sameer and Pankaj (Bhujbals son) were directors of the firm  get this prime real estate plot in Santacruz?The answer is a classic story of land sharks, middlemen and those in power bending rules to grab realty in Mumbai.The story began unravelling only when both Sameer and Chhagan Bhujbal were arrested, after Claude Fernandes  Francis son  deposed before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the anti corruption bureau (ACB) against Parvesh Constructions over February and March.When our bungalow was demolished in 2005, we were not even informed. We were kept in the dark when the rights of redevelopment were passed over to Parvesh Constructions, via a middleman, from the original developer we had signed up with. They registered a supplemental agreement that does not bear our signatures. Over the past 10 years, a nine-storey swanky building was constructed where our bungalow stood. The Bhujbals lived in the top six floors, even as we, the rightful owners, ran from pillar to post to get some share of our home, said Doreen, Claudes wife.Claude and Doreen, both senior citizens, are the only surviving members of the family in Mumbai. Claude, a consulting engineer, was born and brought up in this family home and was promised a 958 sq ft independent flat after the redevelopment.He has been waiting for this flat for the past two decades.We met Sameer Bhujbal three or four times, through one of his cronies, but got nothing but empty promises in the last 10 years, the couple said.The redevelopment issue just skims the surface of the problems the family has faced.It was in 1994 that the family, represented by its eldest daughter Sheila Athayde  in whose name the property rights were  signed an agreement with M/s Palm Shelter Estate Development Pvt Ltd (part of the K Raheja Corp), transferring to them the power of attorney to redevelop the property.In total, the family was promised 3,600 sq ft of built-up space, Rs 30 lakh in cash and two flats on of 850 sq ft on tenancy basis in this agreement.This redevelopment, however, did not take place for 10 years and the developer allegedly claimed the size of the plot was smaller. The family had got one cheque of Rs 1 lakh from Palm Shelter.Fed up with their plot not being developed, Claude met and placed trust in a former neighbour and secretary of the Bombay Catholic Cooperative Housing Society, Frederick Noronha of M/s Frest Investment and Leasing Co. Pvt Limited, who promised to assist them in the redevelopment.In his written complaint to the ACB in the current probe, Claude pointed out Noronha took their signatures on several documents but cheated them, got Parvesh Constructions into the picture and made a supplemental agreement between Palm Estate and Parvesh Constructions in 2003.The couple first filed a complaint with the Santacruz police station in 2005, on realising this supplemental agreement did not have their signatures and had been registered without their knowledge. They also sent a complaint to the sub-registrars office and later to the Mumbai crime branch, with copies of the letter to everyone, including the then chief minister.The complaint fell on deaf ears.They have now been instructed by investigating officials to lodge a criminal complaint with the ACB. The ED has already noted preliminary investigations show the Bhujbals were living in the building illegally.When Hindustan Times contacted Pankaj Bhujbal, he said, I dont want to go into details of this, as the matter is in court. But with regards to this property, certain legal processes and permissions were pending so it took time. We had every intention to give the owners their due. Pankaj admitted the family was living in the Solitaire building for some time.The middleman, Fredrick Noronha claimed, They [the Fernandes family] have been making allegations and sending complaint letters, instead they should have just moved court. The agreement they have with Parvesh is legal and binding and the firm has to give them the promised flats.A spokesperson for Palm Shelter Estate Development Pvt Limited, in an email response to a questionnaire sent by Hindustan Times, said: The allegations made against us are mischievous and denied. There were other considerations payable and costs incurred in addition to Rs 1 lakh. Additionally, transfer of development rights to Parvesh Constructions was done at the instance of the owners and their representatives, and documents were executed by owners in favour of Parvesh Constructions.The owners had made the original agreement with this firm for the redevelopment."

But that has not deterred him from losing 18 kg in three months.The flabby Fadnavis is determinedly following a disciplined metabolic treatment: a mix of medicines to enhance metabolism, a targeted diet as per his body type and activity level, and a weekly two-hour regimen.The results are just becoming conspicuous.From 122 kg when he first consulted a doctor in December, Fadnavis is now going on 104. His target to get that lean-mean look is 88-90 kg. If he keeps at his diet-exercise regimen with the same vigour he has had since February when he started it, he should achieve success in three more months.His doctor, Jayashree Todkar, a metabolic and bariatric surgeon, said, ""His evaluation went on for two months; we learnt his metabolism was flexible and could be enhanced by medical intervention. We started him on the medicines which had a collateral result, in clearing his problem of sugar intolerance.""When Mumbai Mirror contacted Fadnavis, he responded with, ""Sorry, that's too personal.Would not like to speak on that.""His wife Amruta, who inspired him to shed the flab, was happy to talk. ""He had lost weight earlier but gained it again due to work pressure and erratic schedule. After I started my weight loss programme and lost about 5-6 kg, he was inspired,"" said Amruta. She vouched that losing weight increases one's vigour and energy to work.Todkar told Mumbai Mirror that he was simultaneously asked to use a pedometer to gauge his activity level. ""While he has an erratic work schedule involving a lot of travel, it turned out that his activity level was pretty good. He not only goes above the required minimum of 10,000 steps daily, but also walks briskly,"" she explained. She said his weight gain was mainly because the diets he was prescribed earlier had not been helping him; according to sources, he has been one of the biggest names in the business - including Bollywood faves - for shedding weight.Holistic health guru Mickey Mehta was also roped into the regimen. He is training the CM in physical activity, which involves two hours a week of a lot of breathing exercises, agility-and-strength training and sport stretches. ""He gets merely four to five hours of sleep. The breathing exercises help in taking care of the sleep deprivation,"" said Mehta, who is also training Amruta. ""We are aiming to get back his athletic body by end of this year,"" Mehta added.According to Todkar, understanding metabolism is the crux of weight loss. ""Metabolism is a chain of events in the body which needs to be studied closely. It involves understanding the hunger pattern and satiety level and the process of breakdown of energy after consumption. With bad metabolism, the body begins storing things resulting in problems like obesity, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, and all these ailments complicate each other too,"" Todkar said.His diet regimen is as per his palate and nutritional requirements.""Studies have shown that the hunger hormone graph shows elevation thrice in 24 hours. So three healthy meals in a day are enough to be energised and suffice the nutritional requirements of a person,"" said Todkar.Fadnavis now has three meals a day. His regimen has been fluctuating for the past three months but his current chart involves a balance of proteins and fats, minimised carbohydrates and fibre.Since he doesn't have a sweet tooth, he has been allowed the luxury of one cup of tea a day. But Fadnavis prefers sugar-free if he decides to sip on chai. His proteins involve a mix of vegetarian (paneer, lentils) and non-vegetarian (chicken, fish).His carbs come from bhakri, chapati or wholewheat bread. His sources of fibre are green vegetables and low-glycemic fruits like pomegranate, apple, jamun etc. He doesn't have to cheat to have butter or ghee; he is allowed both, though in moderation and not in dollops.""If you see his chart, he is allowed to eat all kinds of food. What is important is how the food is prepared. He is neither allowed outside food nor junk food,"" said Todkar."

Speaking with Sugandha Indulkar, Nale discussed how drought has hit his village, why villagers are so vulnerable, why there is no help  and the IPL:Please tell us about your family.We are seven people, my parents, wife and three little daughters. Farming is our family occupation. Since the last 50 years, we have been farmers in Taluka Phaltan, Satara district. Our village is about 70 km from Satara  our life is entirely dependent on rain as theres no river nearby.Rain water gets stored in wells. Our village draws water from these.What about government water supply?Some public taps used to get water earlier  now, these taps have gone dry.We go without water for eight days at a stretch.Is drought a long-term local problem?In this region, we have monsoon from June to September  this year, there was barely any rain and so, were facing this drought.Our region faced droughts in 1972, 2004 and now in 2016  but this years drought is possibly the worst. People and animals are dying for want of water.Youre in an NCP area  has sugar cultivation been a cause?Big sugar manufacturers have lifted water directly from canals  thats caused water scarcity. There are four sugar companies in Phaltan. All are owned by big politicians.I dont know their names.What difficulties is your family facing?Wed planted pomegranate trees  all of them dried up in the scorching sun. Those trees generated an annual income of about three lakh fifty thousand rupees. So, this year, we have lost our entire income  thats why my elderly father has been forced to take up a job on a nearby construction site.But his daily wages are barely able to feed the family, leave alone get medicines for my ailing mother.The situation is really bad. Peoples crops are destroyed, theres illness, farm animals are dying.We are barely able to make ends meet. I am an arts graduate but had taken a driving job to support my family  i had to give it up to look after farming as my father has to work as a construction labourer.Without tankers, theres no water even for drinking or cooking. Buying water has become a necessity  and in the face of acute shortage of funds, we find this extremely difficult.The whole village is facing the wrath of nature and trying to survive while crops are dying.I am greatly pained when i read about farmers committing suicides  most are over-burdened by debt.Drought just destroys their hopes of repaying.Recently, Maharashtra government sent lakhs of litres as relief  did that help you?No. Most of this water was sent to Latur which is well-connected by the railway.As our village does not have rail access, we could not get any help from the government.How do you manage?We have no option but to buy tanker water. For Rs 1,500 our whole village, about 4,500 people, buys one tanker. This is emptied into the village well. All of us pull water from it.What should the administration do?Firstly, the Dohmbalkawdi dam work which remains unfinished for years needs to be completed on priority  water canals in Phaltan east are connected to this dam and the canal work is also unfinished. That too should be completed urgently.Until two years back, government used to put up animal fodder camps, chara chavanis. In these camps, we could house our farm animals and government fed them and gave them water free of cost  it used to be a great help to poor farmers.The current government has taken no such steps.Do you receive help from NGOs like Naam Foundation?No NGOs have come to our village. They mostly go to Marathwada and Vidarbha.Ours is a remote village. It has a very small vote bank compared to Marathwada.No-one looks at our plight.The IPL will shift to save water  how do you feel?IPL is a sheer waste of water  we dont have water to drink, our animals are dying. In such a scenario, organising IPL here is surely unjust.Most farmers will agree with me that IPL should be shifted out of the state."

Only 117 mills were operating across the country till April 15 of this year, as against 245 mills in the year-ago period.Production in Maharashtra, the country's leading sugar producing state, fell to 8.36 MT of sugar till April 15 of this marketing year from 9.96 MT in the year-ago period.The sugar recovery rate was 11.29 per cent in the state, which crushed less quantity of sugarcane at 7.4 MT this year.Sugar output in Uttar Pradesh, the second biggest producing state, was at 6.77 MT till April 15 of this year, which is almost at last year's level. The sugar recovery rate was higher at 10.6 per cent in the state.In Karnataka, sugar output dropped to 4 MT from 4.58 MT, while the production in Andhra Pradesh also fell marginally to 8,10,000 tonnes in the said period.In Tamil Nadu, the sugar output was higher at 9,25,000 tonnes and the state is expected to manufacture another 4,50,000 tonnes in the remained period of this year.On exports, ISMA said exported were at 1.35 MT the first six months of 2015-16 marketing year, while mills dispatched higher quantity of sugar at 13.3 MT for sale in the domestic market in the same period.On cane arrears, the industry body said it has come down to Rs 13,300 crore so far this year, as against Rs 21,800 crore in the year-ago period.""With the improvement in domestic market, it is expected that cane price payments to the farmers will improve and arrears will come down substantially further in the next few months,"" ISMA added.Sugar production of India, the worlds second-largest producer after Brazil, is estimated to decline to about 26 MT in 2015-16 marketing year (October-September) as against 28.3 MT in the previous year.

58f59c317be9e01a17c9d694,Farmers in arid India share camps with their cattle,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Farmers-in-arid-India-share-camps-with-their-cattle/articleshow/51887956.cms,2016-04-19,"KHILAD: The cattle camp, on a dusty back road lined with thorny babul trees that seem to thrive no matter how weak the rains, is just about impossible to miss.On a recent day, nearly 3,000 impassive animals took shelter from the midday heat under makeshift tents. They munched the 30 pounds or so of hacked-up sugar cane and sorghum stalks they are allotted and lapped up all the water they wanted, a precious gift in this drought-stricken part of the country.After a third consecutive deficient monsoon season, the government of the Beed district has established as a temporary measure 264 of these camps  long a fixture of drought relief efforts in Maharashtra after surveys predicted a shortage of fodder for the animals. But the camps, set up to handle thousands of cattle, have run into an unanticipated problem: The owners of the livestock, who were supposed to drop them off, have instead moved in  cooking utensils, spare cots, water drums and all.The hundreds of farmers packed into the camp do not always enjoy the same comforts as their cattle, which are considered sacred in Hinduism. Slaughtering cows is outlawed in most states, and preserving them is considered essential to avoiding a large-scale catastrophe.The farmers are forced to fend for themselves, cooking their own meals and living in tents surrounded by mounds of fodder, the ground nearby covered with fresh droppings. Nevertheless, they swore they would not return home until the rains came, whenever that might be.""It gets very cold in the winters and in the mornings and evenings,"" said Bhimabai Garje, 65, who moved three months ago from her home in Khilad. ""It's very hot during the day inside the tent. Mosquitoes bite us all night. But we have no choice.""The local authorities are aware of the squalid conditions but say there is not much they can do.""It was not our expectation,"" said Naval Kishore Ram, the senior administrator for the Beed district. ""We run the camp for the animals. If you start providing food for the human beings, the camp will take another form. This will be a camp for human beings. The basic objective will be disturbed.""Last year in Beed, 45 waterless days stretched out grimly in the middle of what was supposed to be its prime rainy season, as drought was widespread in the country. In Marathwada, a region in central Maharashtra that includes Beed and seven other districts, rainfall was 40 percent below the norm.Wells and hand pumps have run dry, and rumors of mass migrations swirl. Politicians clash over how to address the crisis, and experts worry that the emergency relief, including the cattle camps and the tankers that deliver drinking water to villages, will never stem its root causes.The crisis extends well beyond the Beed district. In nearby Latur, the government sent drinking water by train to meet a surging need. Last month, thousands of farmers in Nashik took to the streets to demand, among other things, compensation for lost crops. And on Wednesday, the Bombay High Court banned Indian Premier League cricket matches in the parched state starting in May in the hope of conserving water.Ajay Dandekar, a professor at Shiv Nadar University who has studied the drought, said the conditions in Marathwada had resulted from dual calamities: a chronically arid landscape ravaged further by rising temperatures and El Nino, as well as the diversion of water to western Maharashtra, where most of its industry and thirsty sugar cane crops lie.""The situation is very grave  it's hopeless,"" he said of the arid countryside.Ms. Garje felt the gravity of the situation last winter in Khilad. The cotton and sorghum monsoon crops had failed, and the village well was nearly dry. Tankers brought drinking water, but she worried about her three cattle, three buffalo and an ox that the family had bought, one by one, beginning 25 years ago when crop yields were bountiful.""I saw the cattle of other villages dying,"" she said.So at one January dawn, she and her husband set out for the cattle camp, nearly two miles away, walking across a bridge over a rocky ravine that was once a river, past the sorghum and cotton fields that had yielded so little last year. They foraged for wood to build their tents, and took dried cow dung from the neighbors for their roofs.She now cooks vegetables over an open fire, and returns home twice a month to check in on her son who looks over their fields. But she does not contemplate going back for good.""I love my cattle more than my children,"" she said. ""I want to stay with them. The life of a farmer all depends on cattle.""It is a sentiment echoed by many residents of the camp, mostly men who have shifted with their animals and are visited occasionally by their small children and wives.Babasaheb Garje, 30, also of Khilad but no immediate relation to Bhimabai Garje, said that at the camp, at least, there was drinking water. His wife comes in the morning, helping him feed their cows and bringing food from home, then leaves in the evening.""After she goes, I sit and think what will happen to the animals,"" he said. ""I think about the rainfall and whether it will come this year.""Not all cattle camps are bare-bones: A sprawling establishment in the Beed district village of Palwan supplies meals for the farmers staying there and is trying to address one symptom of their distress  their inability to pay for their children's weddings. The camp organizers are planning a joint marriage ceremony this month for 50 couples of drought-affected farmers, including 14 couples whose families stay in the camp.The program is being financed by the nongovernmental organization that runs the camp. Rajendra Maske, its secretary, is also a member of the Shiv Sangram Party, which stood for state elections with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Camp residents say the government has awarded the contracts for many of the camps to NGOs run by political workers.In a starched cotton shirt and crisp trousers, Maske surveyed the camp with evident satisfaction. He said he hoped the chief minister would come for the marriage ceremony and that at $30,000 for the whole affair, the NGO was sparing no expense.""People have an emotional connection to the camp,"" Maske said.In February, with some postmonsoon crops showing promise, Ram, the Beed administrative official, recommended closing the camps ""for a month or two."" The government agreed, but the outcry from farmers and politicians was swift, and officials relented.Sanjay Malani, the executive editor of a small daily newspaper in Beed, said that the government was caving to political pressure and that the camps were being used as vote banks for political parties.""It's a moneymaking and image-making business,"" Malani said.The relative lavishness of the Palwan camp is atypical, however. The Khalid camp, which is run by the NGO of Vijay Golhar, a BJP member and a former member of the district assembly, appeared more austere.""My father has always been working for the betterment and development of the farmers,"" said his daughter, Ratnaprabha Golhar. She said that the NGO was providing for all the farmers' needs and that any critique of the camp might have come from ""some opposition.""But Suresh Wanve, 34, who tends 20 cows and buffalo with his brother at the camp in Khilad, said he would prefer that farmers receive the money the government is spending on the animals' fodder in cash, so they could buy fodder themselves and stay in their homes.Still, he felt compelled to stay with the animals, whom he likened to the goddess Lakshmi, or the Hindu goddess of wealth. He worries about thieves now that his wife stays alone with their children.""We know all these things,"" he said, ""but we don't have any other options.""Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi."

As many as eight of the region's 11 major dams are at dead storage level. This means that water from the dams cannot flow out but has to be lifted. Last year at this time, the water level in Marathwada's dams was much higher at 11%.""This is the lowest water storage in Marathwada's history but we have sufficient water to last till the monsoon. Dead storage water can be used but has to be pulled out,"" said Aurangabad divisional commissioner Umakant Dangat. ""We also have ground water reserves,"" he added.This is the fourth year of drought in Marathwada in the past five years.Each of its 8,522 villages has been affected for two consecutive years.The state government says it has already instructed local officials to prioritize drinking water. ""We have already cut water supply to industry . The col lectors and divisional commissioner know that the use of water for drinking is the top priority,"" said state water resources minister Girish Mahajan. As many as 2,745 water tankers are being used in the region compared to 939 at this time last year. The government has been sen ding water by train to Latur which faces a severe drinking water crisis. It has also announced a 20% water cut to local breweries and a 10% overall cut to local industry. ""Most sugar factories have finished operations so we have not had to cut water supply for them,"" said Mahajan.Rainfall across the state has been deficient since 2014. The result is that water levels in dams across the state have dipped dramatically .Dams across the state have only 19% water left compared to 32% at this time in 2015. While Marathwada has seen the sharpest decline, dam water levels in north Maha rashtra and western Maharashtra have halved compared to last year.Water levels in western Maharashtra's dams have dropped to 21% from 41% at this time last year.In north Maharashtra, dam water levels have fallen to 16% from 34% last year.In Amravati division, which sees the highest farmer suicides in the state, dam water levels have dropped to 18% from 30% last year.Critics have called for a ban on sugarcane cultivation in the region. Marathwada has as many as 62 sugar factories and over 2 lakh hectares under sugarcane, despite being drought prone. ""For 1 kg of sugar, 2,500 litres of water is used.By growing sugarcane in this region, you are exporting water from a drought-prone area to different states and countries,"" points out water expert Pradeep Purandare."

The panel had pointed out that sugarcane requires a large amount of water to cultivate.Of the 202 sugar mills in Maharashtra, 40 per cent are in Marathwada region. Maharashtra accounts for 32 per cent of the total sugar production in the country.It is virtually not possible to sanction new sugar mills for the next five years in Marathwada region, state Revenue and Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse said.Share This Article Related Article A not-so-sweet propositionA not-so-sweet proposition Maharashtra set to ban sugarcane farming in drought zoneMaharashtra set to ban sugarcane farming in drought zone Upper dams to release water for drought-hit districts; cabinet meet in Sept in MarathwadaUpper dams to release water for drought-hit districts; cabinet meet in Sept in Marathwada Water crisis: Sugar factories blamedWater crisis: Sugar factories blamed Tackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling caneTackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling cane Sugarcane cultivation should be banned in Marathwada: Madhav ChitaleIn another decision meant to save water, the government plans to make drip irrigation compulsory for all sugar mills across the state. Data from the ministry of agriculture shows that only 20-25 per cent sugar mills have implemented drip irrigation. A majority of the sugar mills draw water from dams. But the dilemma for the government, officials said, is that sugarcane growers seek higher subsidy to implement drip irrigation.The government is now seeking the Israel governments expertise and trying to make drip irrigation a less expensive process.There cannot be any justification for allowing so many sugar mills in Marathwada. As a uniform rule, the government should ensure that any district with less than 700 mm rainfall should not be allowed sugarcane cultivation, Chitale had said.Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, too, had suggested that permission to set up sugar mills should not be given in drought-hit regions.Fadnavis also emphasised on a re-look at crop patterns according to soil heath and water availability in each region, to ensure that huge investments put in by farmers are commensurate with the yield.Osmanabad district collector Prashant Narnaware said, In my district, where the average rainfall is less than 450 mm, the Beyond Cane campaign has worked to the farmers advantage. Out of 48,000 hectares, 23,000 hectares will not grow sugarcane. The farmers are going for pulses which require less water, floriculture and horticulture with guidance from the agriculture ministry.WATCH NEWS PLAYLISTFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A couple of days ago, Munde justified water supply to breweries in Aurangabad, shortly after Uddhav Thackeray demanded suspension of water supply to breweries because of the drought.Taking a drought selfie is not the first instance when Rural Development Minister Pankaja Munde has left the BJP-led government in Maharashtra red faced. In the recent past, the ministers stand on several issues were not in accordance with government policies and it included her flip flop on allowing women into the Shani Shinganpur temple in Ahmednagar, her justification of supply of water for breweries and support for sugar mills on the matter of fair price remuneration.Her selfie in drought-hit Latur has invited flak from across the political spectrum including the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena. Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said it showed a Selfie Sarkar. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray defined it as highly insensitive and shameful, during a severe drought.A couple of days ago, Munde justified water supply to breweries in Aurangabad, shortly after Uddhav Thackeray demanded suspension of water supply to breweries because of the drought. Thackeray said priority should be to provide water to people, and not breweries.Munde argued, There is a stipulated quota of water supply for drinking purpose, industries and agriculture. And if water allocated for industries is being utilised, there is nothing wrong.Mundes logic invited flak from Congress, NCP, Sena and BJP. Many wondered if she were aware of ground realities.A Sena cabinet minister said, On one hand the government is getting railways to supply water to Latur. There are 25,000 villages facing drought. And we have Munde talking of water quota. When there is no water, which quota is she referring to?Fadnavis had to clarify, The government will not compromise on drinking water supply. Breweries are not our priority.At the peak of the agitation when women activists were demanding entry into Shanishingnapur temple, Munde had said, Traditional rituals cannot be linked with insult of the female fraternity. Mundes justification was contradictory to sentiments of cabinet colleagues and top leaders across party lines.Fadnavis clarified, Places of worship cannot have gender discrimination. Hindu religion or teachings do not approve discrimination against women. They have equal rights to worship. NCP president Sharad Pawar also vehemently opposed gender discrimination.In the first winter session of the government, when senior minister for Cooperation and Markets Chandrakant Patil threatened to crack the whip on sugar mills for violating norms of fair price remuneration, Munde came out in the state assembly in defense of sugar mills citing multiple problems. The NCP used it to expose the divide within the BJP government.In the recently concluded budget session, Mundes odd remarks questioning the opposition created an uproar. The Congress, NCP had raised a question on controversial chikki scam in which she had been named. Munde, in passing, said, I pity your grasping power. Vikhe-Patil and Jayant Patil were among leaders who termed it inappropriate and highhanded.Earlier, during her visit to water conservation projects, images of personnel holding her footwear as she walked ahead was widely discussed. Later, Munde justified the act.Another issue that often becomes a talking point relates to her name in the chief ministers race.

58fa69cda3d24b44f321cd31,The sugar belt pays the price: no new factories for five years,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-sugar-belt-pays-the-price-no-new-factories-for-five-years/article8492414.ece,2016-04-19,"ew sugar factories will not be allowed to come up in drought-hit Marathwada for the next five years, the state government announced on Monday. It is also mulling to make drip irrigation mandatory for cultivating sugarcane  one of the most water-intensive cash crops.Revenue minister Eknath Khadse on Monday said considering the water scarcity in Marathwada, restrictions must be imposed on unlimited use of water by sugar factories. The government will not give permission to new sugar factories in the region, at least for the next five years, he said, adding permissions in other regions would be given only after taking the availability of water and usage into consideration.Mr Khadse had said during the recently-concluded Assembly budget session the Manjara co-operative sugar mill in Latur, owned by former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs family, had used water for crushing sugarcane despite the water scarcity in the district.He also stressed the need to use methods like drip irrigation for crops such as sugarcane, saying changing the water usage patten was important to stop the indiscriminate use of water. Water cuts to breweries and distilleries in Marathwada are being kept in abeyance as closing a production unit would affect workers but the option hasnt been ruled out, Mr Khadse said.Crop insurance schemeMeanwhile, the state cabinet on Monday announced the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana (PMFBY) in Maharashtra this kharif season.A state level co-ordination committee will be set up with the Chief Secretary as chairman to decide on issues such as notifying crops under the scheme, risk level and setting up an execution mechanism.While the scheme is mandatory for all farmers who avail of loans for cultivation, others can be part of it too.The state and central governments will share the insurance premium equally.Risks covered under the scheme include losses to standing crops due to fire, lightning, hailstorm, cyclone, excessive rain, floods, landslide, drought and disease."

As of March 15, 2016, 325 sugar mills were operating in the States against 473 mills in the year-ago period.Almost 189 sugar mills had already closed their operations out of which 31 were in U.P, 91 in Maharashtra, 36 in Karnataka, 10 in Bihar and the rest in States such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand."
5904b18e7be9e04154dfa914,Munde’s gaffe: Politicians need to see drought as more than a photo opportunity,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/mundes-gaffe-politicians-need-to-see-drought-as-more-than-a-photo-opportunity/,2016-04-20,"Few actions epitomised the insensitivity of the political class towards farmers afflicted by severe drought than water tankers being used to sprinkle the road for Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiahs dust-free ride while visiting drought-hit areas in Bagalkot district. The state has witnessed more than 1,000 farmer suicides between April 2015 and February 2016 and nearly 80% of its taluks have been declared drought-hit. Four cabinet sub-committees were set up last week to take stock of the alarming situation but except Siddaramaiah, no senior minister has even bothered to visit drought-hit areas.Lack of empathy is an equal opportunity affliction, crossing party lines. In neighbouring NDA-ruled Maharashtra, state water conservation minister Pankaja Munde was castigated for clicking selfies while on an official tour, reviewing drought-related work in parched Latur now being supplied by water trains. Munde is also the guardian minister of Latur and Beed, among the worst affected districts. Opposition parties have accused her of not conducting a single review meeting during the previous year despite evidence of a drought-like situation in the region for months.Maharashtras water scarcity is primarily man-made due to lopsided agricultural priorities. Though sugarcane is cultivated in just 4% of total cultivable area, it consumes nearly 70% of irrigation water in the state. Almost all major state politicians, cutting across party lines, own sugar factories. This effectively makes them water barons as well, cornering the states water resources for themselves. Successive governments have neither corrected this grave imbalance, nor have introduced long term measures such as drip irrigation, water conservation, encouraging crops requiring less water, or groundwater rejuvenation projects. Reports suggest that the ever-increasing ambition of politicians has fuelled 20 new sugar factories in dry Marathwada over the last three years, regardless of devastating consequences for the depleting groundwater table.Instead of framing policies to mitigate age-old problems, politicians have often shown their inconsiderate side with uncharitable remarks. In 2013, Maharashtras then deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had mocked water scarcity by offering to urinate in dams  before being forced to issue a public apology. Water resources minister Uma Bharti recently said its pointless to plan for drought in advance. Indias political parties need to get their act together and find solutions to the drought that plagues more than 25% of Indias population  nearly 33 crore people in 256 districts of the country."

He was lodged at the Arthur Road jail, after which he was remanded in judicial custody.We have ordered an inquiry into the incident and are looking into the reasons for his admission to the hospital, said Bipin Kumar Singh, inspector general of prisons.Dr Jagdish Bhawani, medical superintendent of the hospital, said, The reference letter from Dr Rahul Ghule from jail mentions St George Hospital/ Goverment Dental College. We treated him because the physician confirmed he needed admission.Doctors said Bhujbal is in the ICU and is under observation.Hospital sources said Bhujbals blood pressure was high (180/120) when he was admitted.His counsel had earlier told the court he has undergone an angioplasty, suffers from asthma, sleep apnea, has dietary restrictions and his blood sugar levels need to be monitored regularly. Both the ED and the anti-corruption bureau have filed charge sheets in the case.Before the senior leaders arrest, the ED had arrested his nephew Sameer. According to allegations in the case, which is being jointly investigated by the ED and the state anti-corruption bureau, the contract for redevelopment of the state guesthouse in New Delhi, Maharashtra Sadan, was not advertised and the contractor gave the sub-contract to companies owned by the Bhujbal family.A private developer was allowed to carry out the makeover of the Sadan and the Andheri RTO in lieu for FSI for a slum rehabilitation project in Andheri. In the Kalina deal, Bhujbal and five others have been accused of allegedly causing huge losses to the state exchequer by illegally leasing a prime plot at Kalina in Santacruz (East) to a private developer."

The city and state is reeling under a severe water crisis , leading to widespread cuts across all areas. With the issue being uppermost on everyone's minds, citizens, restaurant owners and students are finding ways to conserve water.One of the biggest culprits sits right in your home and office  a leaky faucet or tap that you have been ignoring so far. ""Did you know 40 per cent of water is lost via leakage every day?"" asks city-based water conservationist, Aabid Surti . The 80-year-old Mira Road resident has been repairing taps and plumbing issues in Mumbai for free. He adds, ""Just cutting the quota is a quick solution, but if you plug the leak, you save millions of litres each day. This has been a growing problem as people are too lazy to fix leaking taps. As plumbers charge money per visit and are sometimes not available, this problem goes unattended."" The daily tank overflow in societies is also a major concern. ""As watchmen leave the taps open, there is a huge wastage of water. I wrote to the Municipal Commissioner that we should have two-member flying squads to check for overflows, and fine the guilty parties after issuing a warning,"" he adds.One of the biggest wastages comes from asking for water at restaurants and simply taking a sip or two while leaving the rest. Mumbai citizen Prajakta Samant recently highlighted the need to take action about the half-drunk glass by starting the hashtag movement, 'JitniPyaasUtnaGlass'. Santosh Shetty (General Secretary, Indian Hotel And Restaurant Association) says, ""This is a huge problem and people don't realise it. We have asked waiters and staff not to fill the glass up to the brim, but just a little more than half, each time they serve it. This will help to curtail waste. We will also been putting up posters with messages in restaurants soon.""According to a report, Central and Western Railways have cut down the amount of water used to clean rakes by 50 per cent. Both lines will wash trains after a fortnight, instead of8-10 days.A brouhaha also kicked up recently over watering grounds that would host cricket league matches in Maharashtra. The Bombay High Court came down heavily on the BCCI and cricket associations and apparently asked the cricket body counsel whether ""matches were more important than people or preserving water."" Hence, the court ruled that all matches scheduled in Maharashtra after April 30 must be moved out of the state. This impacts 13 matches, including the final, which was to be held in Mumbai on May 29.Meanwhile, a report talked of how tea without sugar can help save water. A site revealed that Mumbai can save 150 per cent more water by drinking tea without sugar for a day. Agriculture consumes almost 85 per cent of water consumed in India, according to the India Infrastructure Report 2011. And sugar is said to have 15 million litres of water embedded  meaning, it has cost us 15 million litres of water to produce this much sugar. That is said to be 2.5 times the water which would be used in the three cricket match venues in Maharashtra.The Marathwada district in Maharashtra is one of the worst affected areas. As per a news report, the dams in the region are left with just five per cent of water. In drought-hit Latur, which has been battling severe drought for the last three years, there has been a significant rise in cases of kidney stone and urinary tract infection due to consumption of borewell water."

In the past, the focus was on untreated industrial effluents alone.The government is also considering public-private partnerships to raise funds for river cleaning along with mega infra or industrial projects.Overseas companies are ready to give soft loans at lower interest to be repaid over 30-40 years.The draft proposal for new environmental pollution points to an urgency to address the problems of untreated sewage and solid waste, which is playing havoc along the states 720-km coastal stretch.There are 49 polluted river stretches out of a total 302, which are worst polluted.They include Godavari, Tapi, Wardha-Wainganga, Krishna, Panchganga, Koyana, Mula, Mutha and Pravara basins, among others.The study commissioned by the state government shows 45 to 48 per cent rapid urbanisation is integral to the pollution of major river basins, including Godavari and Krishna. The untreated sewage from the cities/towns are routed to the water sources, including rivers.The National River Conservative Plan of the Centre is working on river-cleaning projects across 150 stretches in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Assam and other states.Adopting a two-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution menace, the Ministry of Urban Development, along with local municipal corporations, are working on projects with a 2017 deadline to make the state free of open defecation.The Centre and the states ambitious Smart Cities project too has given impetus on sewage and solid waste management.The state has initiated a step by taking up river cleaning in Chandrabhaga in the pilgrimage town Pandharpur by 2022. However, there is greater pressure to take up Godavari river cleaning from Nashik. Until 2000, we believed the Krishna basin encompassing stretches along Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Solpaur were instrumental in causing pollution because of discharge of untreated water from sugar mills operating in this western Maharashtra belt. Toxic fertilisers would drain into the rivers However, new factors indicate that industrial effluents are just one aspect. There is greater problem in absence of solid waste management, said a source.Acknowledging that there cannot be any compromise on stringent rules for industrial effluents, upgrade of plants has become mandatory.According to an MIDC official, The new units cannot be sanctioned unless they conform to the environment parameters. To curb violations, we have to put in place a more effective monitoring mechanism.Draft Development Control regulations (2014-2034) are expected to be unveiled later this week.

Considering the need of the hour, MARD would be urging the government authorities to implement such a programme to address the problem,"" said Sagar Mundada, president of MARD.""The resident doctors have started a campaign since Saturday in government hospitals. We have been distributing booklets in Hindi and English to address misconceptions prevailing in the society about the disease,"" he said.MARD also carried out a survey among 200 outdoor patients in three government hospitals, which showed that people are still ill-informed about the disease, especially those who from the lower economic and social strata.""As part of the study, the doctors asked several questions to patients to measure their awareness about diabetes. But the patients failed to give correct answer to most questions, which goes to show how ill-informed people are about the disease,"" Mundada said.""For example, when patients were asked if diabetes was only seen among people belonging to the post middle-age group, 146 of the 200 surveyed patients said yes, which is incorrect,"" he said.""According to a study, more than 60% of the respondents think that if no person in a family is diabetic, there are no chances of others getting it. Throwing light on it, the doctors told the patients that although the chances of diabetes are more if it runs in the family, even people without any history can get it,"" the MARD president said.""Last year, the World Health Organization announced that sugar is the new tobacco. Just as tobacco is one of the leading causes of cancer, sugar leads to diabetes. Yet people don't view diabetes seriously. There are reasons to view diabetes as one of the most serious public health problems in India. In terms of prevalence of the disease, India is the second largest in the world. The International Diabetes Federation pegs the number of patients with diabetes in India at 65.1 million, which was 50.8 million in 2010.

Photo: Vivek Bendrehe debate over uninterrupted water supply to breweries in drought-hit regions took another turn. On Wednesday, replying to a query posed by The Hindu , Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, The divisional commissioners are empowered to take stock of the situation and cut the water where required.The issue was raised in the budget session of the legislature, where the Chief Minister had cautiously replied saying the decision needs a detailed study as a number of workers are dependent on breweries for their livelihood.On Monday, Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse indicated that water supply to breweries could be disconnected. He had also said that no new permission for beer factories will be given if the region is facing an acute water shortage.But controversy erupted a week ago, when Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, on a Marathwada tour, demanded a complete ban on water supply to breweries in the region. States Water Resources minister Girish Mahajan too had similar suggestions.This time it was another Bharatiya Janata Party Minister, Pankaja Munde, who opposed the idea, bringing the issue of livelihood of workers and economics.Sensing an opportunity, the opposition targeted Ms Munde over her comments.Nationalist Congress Party spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged that Ms Mundes comments were to protect the business interests of her husband, a director of a company that had a distillery at Shendra MIDC, which receives water from the Jayakwadi dam.The State has already said it woulde not give permission to new sugar factories in Marathwada for the next five years, as they require a huge quantity of water.Earlier on Wednesday, the State government announced its proposal to prepare a scientific environment plan for Maharashtra. Mr Speaking at a programme organised by the State Environment Ministry and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board at World Trade Centre, Mr Fadnavis said, Farmers are committing suicide due to drought. Changes in the environment are having an adverse impact on human lives. Ecology conservation is one of the important tasks and so we have decided to prepare the scientific plan."

Memories from 30 years ago come rushing back as he enters the defunct sugarcane factory which had its first run in 1979. His eyes light up when he sees the central unit, which comprised clanking baskets that once moved at high speed to turn molasses into sugar crystals. There was no sight better than that of millions of tiny shining crystals tumbling out of here, he reminisces.At its peak, the Kada Sahkari Sakhar Karkhana (KSSK), in the drought-hit Ashti taluka of Beed district, produced 3,03,169 tonnes of sugar in 1981-82. From then on, it kept falling, to touch 3,000 tonnes on the last day of production in 2014. The factory shut down because of falling production and rising debts.The KSSK was taken over from Bhimrao Dhonde, BJP legislator from Ashti, by cooperative banks of Aurangabad and was later attached by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation on November 11, 2015, for non-payment of arrears.Nearly 10 sugar factories in Marathwada, of them five in Beed district, have shut down due to bad debts and falling production in the wake of poor monsoon. Of the 76 factories across Maharashtra, 30 have shut shop while production has crashed from about 20 lakh tonnes a couple of years ago to just 3.5 lakh tonnes last year. The debate around sugarcane rages on in Marathwada, more fiercely now with the State governments decision to ban licensing of new factories.This is a welcome move by the government. This crop is not in the interest of farmers in Marathwada even though they have made a good living out of it. I believe that this drought in Marathwada is man-made and sugarcane alone has played a 70-per cent part, Indias waterman and Ramon Magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh told The Hindu .Sugarcane continues to divide the academic discourse as well. Agriculture experts and agro-scientists who blame sugarcane for the current water crisis in Marathwada claim the cash crop guzzles up to three crore litres an acre of water annually. Those in favour, peg this number at 1.5 crore litres with the flow irrigation technique and nearly half of that with micro irrigation methods. Those criticising claim soyabean and chickpea only uses less than 50 lakh litres.I want to ask those who are against sugarcane as to what is the scientific source of their information. A picture is being painted that growing sugarcane is a crime, without appreciating that lives of hundreds of farmers have improved over the years, said B.B. Thombare, chairman of Natural Sugar and Allied Limited at Osmanabad. Having carried out an experiment on a 50-acre plot in Latur between 2007-2008, the mill managed a yield of 110 tonnes of cane an acre with just 7 ft furrow and water utilisation of 1.5 crore litres on an average annually. Unperturbed by the criticism of cane, the farmer in the water-sufficient areas around canals and river basins here still swears by the reliability and dependability of the crop, while those in the parched interiors who have already suffered one or more crop loss sound a note of caution. With enough water from the Godavari basin, my cane yield touched 40 tonnes per acre last year. So far, I havent felt the need for installing drip irrigation, says Sadashiv Ramesh of Georai taluka in Beed. There are those who criticise the preferential treatment sugarcane has received from the government over the years.The flow and sources of water in Marathwada were all tamed and manipulated for the benefit of the powerful sugar lobby over the years, says Tukaram Yelale, producer and exporter of fruits and grapes and chairman of Krishi Vikas Export, Latur.While some farmers swear by the crop, others blame it forthe drought"

The matter came up for hearing before the bench comprising Justice S S Shinde and Justice Sangeetrao Patil on Wednesday.""The court on Wednesday directed the state government to clear its stand within two days on whether it would snap water supply to the industries for 40 days or the HC might pass an order in this regard. The court also asked the government pleader to take instructions from the government,"" said Amarjeetsing Girase, government pleader.In its affidavit, the government on Wednesday pointed out that there are a total of 129 liquor-related industries in the state. Of these, 99 beer, foreign liquor, country liquor manufacturing units and distilleries, sugar factories are functioning. None of these industries were functioning in Jalna, Beed, Parbhani and Hingoli districts of Marathwada.While two distilleries or sugar factories each are functioning in Nanded, Latur and Osmanabad districts, there were 11 units in operation in Aurangabad district. The affidavit also pointed out that maximum such industries are situated in western Maharashtra, including 15 in Solapur, 10 in Ahmednagar, seven in Pune and 13 in Nagpur.While referring to the situation in Jayakwadi dam, the state government said it has made a plan for 105 days to ensure smooth water supply. The administration has communicated that a 20% cut was being implemented in the water supply to the liquor industries and 10% to the general industries.The government stated that the total storage capacity of Jayakwadi dam is 2,909 mm3, while its live storage is 2,171 mm3. The reservoir has dead storage of 738 mm3. At present, the reservoir accounts for 622 mm3 in the dead storage, of which, the administration would use 270 mm3 for the 105 days.Girase also pointed out to the court that 2.5 mm3 of storage was depleting every day from the Jayakwadi reservoir on account of consumption, evaporation and silt. It said that only 0.03% was being used for industrial purposes.Further clarifying on water for industries, Girase said the MIDC Aurangabad lifts 56 million litres of water a day (MLD) from the Jayakwadi reservoir, of which, 22 MLD is used for domestic purposes for villagers and residential colonies in the Waluj industrial area and for supply through tankers to villages. About 34 MLD is being supplied to the industries of which general industries get 29.86 MLD and 4.14 MLD goes to beer and other such units.Divisional commissioner Umakant Dangat and district collector Nidhi Pandey were present in the court on Wednesday."

In order to produce 1 kg of sugar, apart from sugarcane, you require 2500 litres of water. When you consider lakhs of tonnes of sugar produced by these sugar mills and the lakh metric tonnes of produce that is exported...you are actually exporting that much lakh litres of water,"" Desai said.He, however, said though drinking water is of utmost importance, industries too are vital as they generate employment for lakhs of people."

India is the worlds second-largest producer of the sweetener and also the biggest consumer. Cotton production has already dipped 10%, figures for April show.Sugar output has been hit the hardest in Maharashtra and Karnataka, two states worst-affected by drought. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, over 35 million farmers grow cane, making up 7% of the rural population.A 14% deficient monsoon has caused a severe drought in 256 of the countrys 640 districts, or about 40% of the country, stoking a challenging rural distress for the Modi government.The agriculture ministry expects a slightly higher pulses output of 17.33 million tonnes in 2015-16, compared with the previous years 17.15 million tonnes, but it is still short of the 27 million tonnes needed. The gap is mostly met through costly imports, which keep prices high.In February, retail pulses prices rose 37%, in contrast to wholesale prices falling for the 17th month in a row in March. Contradicting the governments projections, Ajay Saraf, an analyst with the firm ComTrade, said: We expect pulses output to be lower than last years.The food ministry had asked states to submit their expected pulses demand. On Thursday, the government decided to distribute 10,000 tonnes to states from a 55-lakh tonne newly-created reserve, anticipating shortages. The government has also asked state authorities to monitor price movements.Estimates of the Indian Sugar Mills Association show output between October last year and April 15 stood at 24.3 million tonne, about 2 million tonne short than the 26.4 million tonne during the previous years corresponding period. ICRA, an investment firm, foresees a steeper sugar shortfall of 10% in 2016, the firm said in a review.In 2015-16, the countrys cotton output stood at 34.1 million bales of cotton (of 170kg each), against 38.2 million bales, according to data from the Cotton Association of India."

He blamed the water crisis in Marathwada on politicians, especially the late Congress leaders Vilasrao Deshmukh and Shivraj Chakurkar for their deliberate emphasis on sugarcane farming in a region unfit for it.Deshmukh had built dams only for his sugarcane fields, he said.Mr. Singh said the BJP governments Jal Yukta Shivar Abhiyan, a drought-mitigation programme, had degenerated into a contractor-politician nexus."

The negative impact of sugar is a critical area to be worked upon and we are sure that with talks about imposing higher taxes on sugar items, we will be able to curb the consumption to a large extent.''Endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi from Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, said sugar intake posed a problem if coupled with inactivity. ""We should encourage our children to take up sports and be less inactive,"" he said.The George institute recently joined several health groups across the world to write to multinational companies to to stop marketing and advertising of the sugar-sweetened beverages to children. Excess sugar intake increases the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, among other diseases. ""Children are the worst affected by these disorders as all marketing and advertising campaigns for sugar-sweetened beverages are targeted on them,"" added Dr Jha.Two studies from India in the last two years have underlined the need to increase taxes levied on sweet-laden foods and drinks. In early 2014, a study in PLOS Medicine journal said India's rising obesity and diabetes epidemics could be tackled by imposing a substantial tax of 20% on sugary soda. ""A 20% tax may avert 4.2% of prevalent overweight and obesity, and reduce diabetes incidence by 2.5%, from 2014 to 2023,"" it said.A study by Delhi-based endocrinologist Dr Anoop Misra in Nutrients journal in 2014 said that 1.8 cans of cola per week among children and adolescents in urban India could result in nearly 1.3 kg of weight gain per child per year."

Early forecasts suggest that sugar production in Maharashtra will drop from 85 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to just around 55-60 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. A decline which ranges from 29% to 35%, officials say. The state's federation of cooperative sugar factories places the decline slightly lower, expecting an output of between 62 lakh and 67 lakh tonnes.The sugarcane planting season stretches from June to February. Typically around 6 lakh hectares of new cane is grown during these months. However, the season of 2015-16 saw a plantation of less than 3 lakh hectares, officials say. A final estimate of the crop area can only be made by June. Besides the new plantation, the old sugarcane stumps also grow out by then. These usually account for 45% of the total crop.""It is premature to estimate the crop area. It will depend on the survival of the ratoon or the cane which grows from old stumps. We are hoping for pre-seasonal showers,"" said state sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma.The steepest decline in cane area has been in the Marathwada region, which was worst hit by the drought. Despite being a historically arid region, Marathwada cultivates as much as 20% of the water-guzzling crop and has 70 sugar factories. The parched district of Solapur in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra also reported a major drop in cane area, besides Pune and Ahmednagar.In 2014-15, which was a drought year, the state saw its highest ever sugar production at 105 lakh tonnes. In 2015-16, it fell to 85 lakh tonnes. Now it is set to plummet even further.Maharashtra has 236 sugar factories, of which 177 functioned this year, officials say. ""Sugar factories will face heavy losses with the fall in cane. Some will face closures and lay-offs,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra cooperative sugar factories federation.The state's sugar factories also owe farmers massive dues worth Rs 3,200 crore. ""The state's factories have paid 80% of farmers' dues, and the rest should be cleared by September,"" Babar said.Critics are increasingly questioning the wisdom of cane cultivation in drought-prone Marathwada and calling for a ban. ""There is a 101% cause-effect between sugarcane cultivation in Marathwada and the drought. The region is part of a deficit river basin and cannot afford to cultivate a water-intensive crop,"" said water expert Pradeep Purandare, former expert member of the Marathwada Development Board.Latur, which is facing its most intense water crisis, cultivates the largest amount of cane in Marathwada. ""It takes 2,500 litres of water to irrigate one kilogram of sugar. On an average, a factory that can crush 2,500 tonnes of cane a day needs 25,00,000 litres of water a day,"" he said. Yet, instead of cutting back on cane, Marathwada has only increased its cane cultivation and sugar factories, adding to the water stress and draining ground water."

Jalyukt Shivar is an independent initiative by the people of Latur through which they are trying to collect funds to widen and de-silt the Manjara River, which provides water to the region.People have already collected Rs 4 crore, and I decided to contribute to it, said the actor, who returned from Latur this morning after visiting the river site and making his contribution.Visited Latur today- saw the extraordinary work done by @JalyuktLatur: many NGOs & locals working under one roof, the actor tweeted, along with some pictures. The donation comes at a time when Latur is reeling under a severe water crisis, and the Railway Ministry in collaboration with the Maharashtra government transported more than 25 lakh litres of water in wagons to the city.

I will first talk to Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and then elaborate on my plan.Of the total 42 ministerial berths, currently there are only 30 ministers in the cabinet. Of the 30, BJP has 20 ministers and the Sena, 10 ministers.There is a scope to fill up 12 berths, of which two will be given to the Shiv Sena and 10 will remain with the BJP. The BJP may include smaller alliance partners supporting the government  such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, the Rashtriya Samaj Party, the RPI and the Shiv Sangram  as part of the 10 and keep the remaining six berths for its own party candidates. Two seats, however, might be kept vacant for future.An overall ministerial performance audit will be undertaken in March 2017 which will weed out non-performers and award those who have done well.Responding to claims by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray that Union ministers from the BJP are paying no heed to the drought situation, Fadnavis said Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Power Minister Piyush Goyal have regularly been in touch with him. The railway minister provided us with the trains for supplying water to drought-hit Latur in record time. The Centre is providing all necessary help.Elaborating on the measures the state government is taking to bring relief in the drought-hit region, the chief minister said that the government is firm on not allowing new sugar mills in Marathwada.

But sugar prices, which were hovering at Rs 30 a kg last October have crossed Rs 40 a kg last week. With Maharashtra, a key sugarcane growing state hit hard by drought, all-India sugarcane output is predicted to fall 10 per cent in 2016, according to a report from credit rating firm ICRA.""Last year was for consumer promotions, with price-offs, bundling, freebies and adding extra weight to packs. But with sugar and even edible oil prices moving upwards, the first step will be to get promotions out of the way, instead of upfront price increases,"" said Varun Berry, MD of biscuits and dairy firm Britannia.""Hidden price increases - which means decreased promotions and offers - will be the first step to mitigate higher commodity costs which directly impact us,"" Parle Products marketing head Mayank Shah said.Despite hedging risks by bulk procurement, companies said the lag effect of sustained increase of sugar prices is likely to kick in by later this quarter.

Singhs refrain was that the Modi government had sanctioned more funds than the previous Congress-led regime.It is a misfortune of Marathwada that 90% of farms do not get water despite the presence of big dams. The dams were built to serve the needs of the sugar mills and farmers did not get any benefits to irrigate their farms, the agriculture minister said.

While other villages in the arid Ahmednagar district are digging borewells even up to 400 feet, the underground water table in Hiware Bazar is so good that the precious commodity is available barely 20 to 40 feet below. Though the village has banned water-guzzling cash crops like sugarcane and banana, farmers here are still far richer than their counterparts in the region. For the record, no family is below the poverty line.Hiware Bazar, now a byword for watershed management and water conservation, had found special mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann ki Baat' programme on Sunday. ""People in this village have done exemplary work,"" Modi had said. Village sarpanch Popatrao Pawar, who has been specially invited by Modi for a cup of tea, said, "" We are glad that our efforts are being recognised."" The road to shaping the village to be self-sufficient has been a long and arduous one. Like any other village in the region, Hiware Bazar used to face a major water crisis each year because of the measly 200-300 mm rainfall it gets. ""We kicked off our water conservation efforts in 1994-95. Various watershed management programmes and water conservation initiatives were started. But we realised that this alone was not going to help. So we decided to choose a cropping pattern,"" Pawar told TOI. The village decided to shun water-intensive crops and opted for vegetables , fruits, flowers and pulses. Dairy development was encouraged. ""We resolved that no borewell would be dug in the village and that every drop of water would be used cautiously. We have a water budget. The villagers meet on December 31 each year, during which a review of the rainfall and available water is taken. We then decide which crops can be grown in the next season. In fact, we decided to take a break from farming this year as there was no rain. The villagers reaped the last kharif crop and have stopped farming for the last four or five months since then,"" he said.Mohan Chattar, a villager, said taking a break from farming did not affect earnings. ""The daily collection of milk in the village is itself about 4,000 litres. Dairy farming brings in good money. There is also enough fodder here,"" he said. The village has a rule that no resident can sell his or her land to an outsider. ""People from other villages migrate in search of jobs, particularly during tough times like these. However, the case is quite the opposite here. Around 40 families have returned to the village from cities over the last few years,"" another villager said.The villagers are not resting on their laurels and are already chalking out a ten-year plan. ""Water scarcity is going to worsen. As part of our ten-year plan, we will opt for growing pulses and oilseed crops and brand them. This will not only boost our earnings but also help save water,"" Pawar said.Pawar is unwilling to blame the poor monsoon for water scarcity. ""It is lack of vision and discipline that brings about scarcity and drought,"" he said. Politics is a strict no-no in Hiware Bazar. ""There is neither politics nor liquor shops in the village. Both intoxicate and destroy development,"" said Chattar."

On both counts the demands for environmental resources along with life support systems of air, water and fertility of the topsoil have exhibited explosive growth. Climate change affects the supply of these resources adversely, creating shortages that some analysts warn are reaching dangerous proportions. Whatever might be the long-term solution, one short-term response would be to preserve, conserve and minimize wastage. Two consecutive bad monsoons, topped by an unusually scorching summer, have brought into focus the problems with the nation's system of managing critical resources. According to news reports, the 91 major reservoirs in the country have only 22 per cent of capacity as against 65 per cent capacity last year during the same time. Water shortages have hit large parts of the country and these hit poor people the most. They expend a large proportion of their daily energy on fetching water. It is not just about dry spells and inadequate rains. Overdrawing groundwater for agriculture as well as modern townships and gated communities, without proper plans for recharging and rain-water harvesting and recycling, has led to a water crisis that grows worse every year. A large part of the water for agriculture runs off to the sea and carries much of the essential nutrients of the topsoil with it. This year for the first time a power plant in West Bengal had to close for 10 days owing to the shortage of water. West Bengal is not considered a water deficit state. The reports from Maharashtra, Telangana, Rajasthan, the National Capital Region, Punjab and Haryana, Odisha and Kerala are of serious concern. There are mounting conflicts among people regarding sharing water. Some basic questions are being raised about water-consuming crops like sugar cane, or water-consuming products like beer and colas. It is the same story all over - a lack of foresight and planning coupled with a firm belief that the free gifts of nature will always be replenished. The crisis will not go away even if monsoons are normal this year. The solution requires preventing waste and using scarce resources wisely. Just making water a marketable commodity will also not suffice. Managing a renewable resource has its other challenges, such as putting in plans for well-managed supply. This is now of the highest priority."

Maharashtra continues to be the dark spot , recording the highest number of farmer suicides . Punjab, which recorded only three farmer sucides in 2014, was second in the list in 2015 as also so far this year. However, MP, which has consistently been recording farmer suicides in varying numbers till 2014 , managed to escape this tragic cycle. The state did not report any suicide in 2015 and during the first three months of this year. Officials credit MP's better agricultural growth, backed by creation of irrigation infrastructure in water-stressed areas, for the turnaround. Water-starved Maharashtra faces the brunt for its failure to adapt to suitable cropping patterns, particularly Marathwada.In response to a Parliament question, the government informed the Lok Sabha that of the 2,115 farmers who committed suicide in 2014, 1,163 were driven by debt, and the remaining by crop loss.In Maharashtra, 857 of 1,207 farmers who committed suicide did so due to debt burden, which lays bare their dependence on local money-lenders due to a non-functional farm credit system in the state and also in other parts of the country.The figures for farmers' suicide were shared on a day Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh alleged that dams were constructed in Maharashtra to serve interests of the sugar industry and not farmers. ""I demand a discussion on Maharashtra drought so that facts can come to light,"" he said in Lok Sabha, blaming the previous Congress-led government in the state for the mess. His allegation triggered a war of words with the opposition blaming the Centre for not doing enough to provide relief to the drought-affected states."
5920843a7be9e04a516a8e80,Govt not releasing sufficient funds to tackle drought: Oppn,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/543013/govt-not-releasing-sufficient-funds.html,2016-04-27,"New Delhi, Apr 26, 2016 (PTI) 18:56 ISTMembers in Rajya Sabha today expressed serious concern over the acute drinking water crisis and rising number of farmers' suicides in 11 drought-hit states including Maharashtra, with the Opposition accusing the government of not releasing adequate funds to these states.Maintaining that drinking water problem has been severe this time, the members asked the government to complete 312 pending irrigation projects across the country in a timely manner to boost water supply for drinking purposes and agriculture.They also asked the government to consider if more funds could be released to drought-hit states, saying the current allocation rate was less than half of what the states had demanded for 2015-16 to tide over the situation.""Right now, 11 states are facing drought-like conditions. Whether in states or at the Centre, where there are different political parties, we must face the situation. We must rise above political lines and face the situation together,"" former Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said during a short debate on drought in the Upper House.Among 11 states, Uttar Pradesh is worst affected followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, he said and emphasised the need to provide immediate relief.While there is no shortage of foodgrains in the country this year, the drinking water crisis is ""serious"", he said.""We have to give full attention to drinking water. Why do we have this problem? We have to think of short and long term policy and serious solutions to address this issue,"" he said, and suggested that the government focus on water conservation and rainwater harvesting to boost groundwater level.He also asked the government to complete 312 pending irrigation projects in India, of which 240 projects are in five states including Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.Urging the Centre to be considerate towards the states facing drought, Pawar said ""every state expects the government at the centre to help them out. In 2015-16, the states made their demand for relief package. Was it met?""""The actual release was less than 50 per cent. I think there should be some improvement (in giving funds),"" he said, and asked the government to ensure that states use relief funds for water conservation.Against the demand of Rs 3,830 crore drought relief fund, Karnataka was sanctioned only Rs 1,540 crore for losses incurred due to drought during the 2015-16 kharif season. Similarly, Chhattisgarh was given Rs 855 crore against Rs 6,093 crore, while Madhya Pradesh was given Rs 1,875 crore against requirement of Rs 4,884 crore, he said.Narrating the severity of drinking water crisis at a village in Nashik, Pawar said people there get one water tanker in 30 days and have to wait 25 days for the next one. One tanker of water meets only 33 per cent of the requirement of this village.""The situation is such that people gherao the tankers and ... Section 144 is imposed to prohibit assembly of more people. People's efforts are just to collect and store water,"" the veteran NCP leader said.Pawar also attacked Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh for his statement yesterday that states like Maharasthra have irrigation to supply water to sugar mills.""I don't know how the Agriculture Minister has come to this conclusion. It is true that sugarcane requires lot of water. ...The minister has impression that all water was used for cane,"" he said while sharing a research report on cultivating sugarcane crop in tropical areas with less water.Stating that the drought situation was ""grave and very serious"", Pawar said, ""in my public life, I have made attempts to mitigate impact of drought when I worked in the state and also at the Centre for 10 years. But the situation that we are witnessing today is more serious, particularly looking at the media reports.""Before the debate commenced, Opposition members including those from Congress and JD(U) took strong objection to the absence of the Agriculture Minister and Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti.""Half of the country's population is facing water crisis. The drought issue is very serious. The concerned minister should be here. It is a very deep crisis,"" JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""We cannot have debate without the minister concerned. You adjourn the House. Let's start the debate when he is here.""Deputy Chairman P J Kurien tried to convince members that the subject was a serious one and the government ""works on a joint responsibility. Even if concerned minister is not here, we can continue the debate.""The debate, however, started after the arrival of the concerned ministers.Initiating the debate, A U Singh Deo (BJD) expressed concern over meagre allocation of funds and the delay in its release to drought-hit states, especially Odisha.He also said there was a huge difference in state's and the Centre's assessment of losses due to drought, because of which states do not get full relief funds.""Total allocation for State Disaster Relief Fund is Rs 61,000 crore for all states. Rs 20,000 crore was estimated loss for kharif season of 2015-16. Where will the money come from? Centre should provide more help,"" Singh Deo said, adding Odisha should not be ignored as it is the poorest state.Blaming the government for not taking serious note of the Met Department's monsoon forecast, he said a new department should be established to look into drought, floods and other natural calamities and take mitigation measures.Expressing concern over the serious drought situation in Maharasthra, Rajani Patil (Cong) said the NDA government should stop blaming the previous regimes for the water crisis.""You have been in the office for two years. It is not proper to shift the responsibility. You give up this attitude fast and show results,"" she said.Patil also demanded more work days under MGNREGA in drought-hit states.Observing how transporation of water tankers to Latur was being politicised, she said ""lotus adorns the tankers carrying water. There is politics in this also. Stop doing this.""To address the water crisis, she sought desilting operations in check-dams, lakes and ponds on an urgent basis and easing norms for speedy implementation of this work.Sharing severe drought crisis in Maharasthra, she said ""I come from Marathwada. We don't call Marathwada now, we call tankerwada."" She also narrated a story of a farmer who committed suicide recently due to lack of funds for his daughter's marriage scheduled today.""We collected funds for his daughter's marriage which happened today. In another taluk, a 10 year-old child who went to fetch water fell into the well and died. This is the plight of Marathwada,"" she said.Sharing the data of rising farmers' suicides in Maharashtra, Patil blamed the Centre and the state government for lack of sensitivity towards people's suffering, saying there were over 2500 farmers' suicides in the state in 2015 and such cases were being reported this year as well.Ajay Sancheti (BJP) said the Ministries of Water Resources, Agriculture, Rural Development should work together and make a long term policy to deal with the issues of drought and floods.Criticising successive governments, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said that India does not have an effective long term policy to deal with such natural calamities and added that the current drought across the country has led to drinking water problems both for the people and the livestock.Observing that the government's efforts in tackling drought were not enough, Sharad Yadav (JD-U) said that government should work on bringing water under the Union list so that disputes relating to rivers can be tackled and effective policies for water conservation evolved.""Water has become a big issue of dispute today and if we do not take adequate steps to check it, the time is not far that we will have a civil war inside the country over water,"" the senior JD(U) leader warned.Rajpal Singh Saini (BSP) said the Centre's work to mitigate drought relief in Bundelkhand was not enough. Farmers are distressed and are forced to commit suicide. In the last few years around 3,023 farmers have committed suicide in Bundelkhand, he added.Raising the controversy over IPL matches in Maharashtra, Saini said such issues bring to fore the stark differences between the lives of the people ""living in India and Bharat"".Tapan Kumar Sen (CPI-M) said the ""deep crisis"" due to drought has impacted around 33 crore people across 11 states in more that 33 districts. Delayed action has further exacerbated the situation of the people and the livestock in the affected areas.Attacking the government over the implementation of the MGNREGA, Sen suggested that the scheme should be properly utilised as it can help alleviate some difficulties of the people. He said urban areas were also severely impacted by the drought situation.Maintaining that the government should work to provide drinking water for the people and cattle, D Raja (CPI) attacked the Centre for failing to anticipate the severity of the drought situation in the country and its preparedness to mitigate the impact.He said the public sector banks have distanced themselves from giving loans to the farmers forcing them to turn towards private moneylenders, which is further affecting their living condition. Raja suggested steps to strengthen MGNREGA, PDS and Food Security scheme to tackle the drought situation.Rajiv Chandrasekhar (Ind) said ""We are a mute spectator to this annual tragedy. We need to move beyond the rhetoric and politics of drought.""He suggested developing short as well as medium to long term policies to tackle drought and create a National Water Management Strategy.Mohd Ali Khan (INC) drew the attention of the House towards the severe drought condition in Telangana, saying it has impacted 370 mandals in the state and attacked the Centre for not giving the full assistance amount as sought by the state government.Basawaraj Patil (BJP) referred to the rising heat wave conditions in the country and said the government should address the issue as heat wave will rise in May and June which may lead to loss of human life. He suggested schemes to save river water that goes into the sea.Chandrapal Singh Yadav (SP) said Bundelkhand was facing severe drought like situation and wanted de-silting of old ponds in the region for water conservation, provision of alternate livelihood for farmers in case of drought and flood and availability of good quality seeds.Bhupender Yadav (BJP) said policies need to be made for conservation of above ground water resources and rejuvenation of underground aquifers.He also suggested that the government make disaster relief norms based on different regions and not for the entire nation as a single entity.Vishambhar Prasad Nishad (SP) said that Bundelkhand has been severely impacted by the drought and the government needs to address the issue at the earliest.Ahmed Patel (Cong) compared the drought situation to cancer which spreads slowly but is fatal. He expressed concern at the prevailing situation and said ICUs were not getting water and fights could break out over water shortage.Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister for his 'Mann ki Baat' radio programme, he said there is need for his government to list the pain of the drought affected people.Emphasising on the need for government to be aware of the grave situation, Patel said the findings of Central Water Commission indicating water crisis were not paid attention to. This issue is something beyond party politics, he added.INLD member Ram Kumar Kashyap said that there were reports that drought had forced people in Maharashtra to marry twice, with one wife looking after family and other fetching water. He emphasised on the importance of planting more trees.Dr Sanjay Singh (Cong) spoke for creating a special ministry which could draw up long term plans and conduct research to deal with global warming and climate change.K C Tyagi (JD-U) sought that loans extended to farmers be waived and said that ""sensibilities have weakened"" as people had the urge to watch IPL at such a time.Balwinder Singh Bhunder (SAD) sought subsidy for farmers to install sprinklers and drip irrigation systems. Vijay Darda (Cong) and Sanjiv Kumar (JMM) also spoke about the problems being faced by people in Maharshtra and Jharkhand. A V Swamy (Ind) also spoke on the subject."

(Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Vishwanath Nagare, a farmer from a village near Lasalgaon, with his stored rabi onion crop. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Its roughly a month since Vishwanath Nagare harvested his rabi onion crop, but he is yet to take it to the market.Prices are now just Rs 800 per quintal. I wont sell until they at least cross Rs 1,000, says this farmer from Sarole Thadi, a village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka just about 18 km Lasalgaon that houses Indias largest wholesale onion market.Last year, Nagare, who grows onion in one out of his total five-acre holding, realised an average rate of Rs 1,300 per quintal. But he could sell only six tonnes, as the crop itself suffered damage from unseasonal rains in March. This time, he has produced 11 tonnes, but prices are lower: If they dont improve soon, I will lose money yet again.There are many farmers like Nagare, who are unable to fathom the wild fluctuation in onion prices over the last year and more. Between April and September, the average modal price  the rate at which the maximum number of trades happen  in Lasalgaon soared from Rs 1,093 to Rs 4,130 per quintal. For a brief period, during the third week of August, they even hit Rs 5,000-5,000/quintal levels. That was, of course, the time when pyaaz was all over the newspapers and TV channels. The price spiral was partly a result of Indias onion output dropping to 189.28 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2014-15, from the preceding years 194.02 lt, and also average monthly exports of over one lt per month during January-July 2015.Share This Article Related Article Demonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangsDemonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangs As onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-insAs onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-ins As onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidyAs onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidy Price crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmersPrice crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmers The Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter storyThe Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter story Onion growers in tearsBut since December  with the arrival of the 2015-16 kharif and late-kharif crops  prices have been on a downward slope, falling below Rs 1,000 per quintal by early February. The new rabi onion crop hitting the market after harvesting during March-May has taken prices even lower; they fell to Rs 600 per quintal levels in mid-March, before recovering a tad thereafter. The resultant distress to farmers is hardly making headlines.What farmers here are unable to comprehend is how prices have crashed, that too in the midst of a drought of the kind Maharashtra is currently seeing. Rabi onion area in the state, in fact, has dipped to around 1,90,000 hectares this year, as against over 3,42,000 hectares in 2014-15. According to Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, the decline would have steeper but for some extra area being sown under the crop in Ahmednagar and Aurangabad. Towards November-end, water from the Gangapur dam in Nashik was released for Marathwada. As this water passed through Ahmednagar and Aurangabad, farmers along the canal uprooted their ratoon sugarcane and planted onion in its place, he points out.The sugar commissionerates data shows a 40 per cent acreage reduction under ratoon cane  which grows from the stubble of the harvested plant crop  this time in Maharashtra. Kashinath Sanap from Baktarpur village of Ahmednagars Kopargaon taluka is among those who decided to divert four acres of his cane area to onion. There was no water to sustain a 12-month ratoon cane crop. So, I went for rabi onion, he says. But he, too, is disappointed that the crop is selling in Kopargaon at below Rs 700 per quintal.Patil believes that the Lasalgaon market is now witnessing a heavy influx of onions from Ahmednagar and Aurangabad  which is also the reason for prices plunging. These farmers, unlike the ones in the traditional onion belt of Nashik, Pune and Dhule, have no facilities for on-field storage. So, they have no option but sell at the earliest, he notes.Farmers in the main onion belt have the capacity to hold back their crop a little longer. But even they, Patil admits, cannot expect prices to go up much, especially with onion acreages in other states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan rising significantly. The Nashik-based National Horticultural Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) has estimated this years rabi onion crop to be 15-20 per cent higher, with overall production for 2015-16 pegged at 203 lt.Rabi onions have longer shelf life and are amenable to storage. NHRDF has projected that around 45 lt of rabi onions would be stored by farmers and traders in the current marketing season due to availability of good quality bulbs. This is more than the 40 lt from last years rain and hail-damaged crop.Farmers in Nashik, Pune and Dhule alone have constructed storage capacities aggregating some 14 lt. Such on-farm structures, typically of 25-30 tonnes capacity and costing a couple of lakhs, have been built through special subsidies from NABARD and the state agriculture department. But farmers hopes of making money from stored onions, this time, have been dashed by crashing prices, for which they largely blame theCentres move to impose minimum export price (MEP) restrictions on onion. During the price surge in August, the MEP was hiked to $700 per tonne, putting a virtual halt on shipments.As domestic prices went into free fall, the MEP was eventually scrapped on December 23. But for farmers, who were harvesting their kharif onions, it was too late.Omprakash Raka, a trader-cum-exporter from Nashik, recalls that till about 6-7 years back, NAFED used to have monthly meetings with all concerned stakeholders to take regular stock of the onion supply position. These interactions allowed informed decisions, including that on MEP, to be taken. But that practice has been replaced by fixing of MEPs in an ad hoc manner, he claims. The main beneficiaries of Indias MEP restrictions have been exporters in China, Egypt and Pakistan. They have all reported good crops this year, even as India is struggling to regain its lost market share from these players.The Centre has now directed NAFED and other state agencies to procure 15,000 tonnes. NAFED is expected to start procurement from April 18, with the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board and others to wade in towards May. This, it is hoped, would help push up realisations above Rs 1,000 per quintal. But unlike last year, the chances of any price spiral seem remote.While that may be good news for urban consumers, for Maharashtras farmers this would translate into yet another cycle of losses. Santosh Gorade from Takli village in Niphad taluka has stored around 6.5 tonnes of his produce in anticipation of higher prices. He sums up the situation best: Temperatures here have already crossed 40 degrees Celsius. If they continue at this level, the bulbs will start rotting, forcing us to go for distress sale. There was no acche din for us last year and we dont see it this season as well.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PHOTO: Arun KulkarniThe former Chief Minister and president of the State-unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) B.S. Yeddyurappa has said that there was no proposal before the Union government to write off crop loans availed by farmers from nationalised banks.Interacting with farmers of the drought-affected Aland taluk at the Jidga Mutt on Thursday, he said that the government was more interested in ensuring remunerative prices for the farm produce and real-time insurance compensation to farmers in the event of crop loss.Mr. Yeddyurappa said the Union government has extended crop loans at 3 per cent interest in nationalised banks.On complaints from farmers that cooperative societies have started the process of recovering crop loans, he said that the Union government has directed the cooperative societies and the banks not to initiate the loan recovery process.Mr. Yeddyurappa said that there should not be any discrimination in fixing of sugarcane price in the State and it should be uniform across the State.He agreed with a farmer who complained that the sugarcane growers in Hyderabad Karnataka region were paid less when compared to their counterparts in the districts of south Karnataka.It is unfortunate that the State government was not in a position to ensure that the State Administered Price of Rs. 2,250 per tonne of sugarcane supplied to the sugar factories was implemented in the State, he said.He also agreed with another farmer and said that the government should divert water from the Bhima to Amarja Dam which has been starved off water due to the construction of barrages in the upstream by Maharashtra. He said this would provide water to a number of villages, Aland town and the Central University of Karnataka campus.Later, Mr Yeddyurappa left for Jewargi to interact with drought-affected farmers.He was accompanied by Bhagwant Khuba, MP, former minister Revu Naik, Amarnath Patil, MLC, Shashil G.

These are villages in which rabi crops (those sown in winter) have been ruined.The government has already said that 28,762 of the states 40,559 villages have been hit by the drought, including 1,053 that grow rabi crops. The addition of the 938 will take the total number of drought-affected villages to 29,700, including 1,991 that grow rabi crops.According to a source in the government, the 938 villages are in Solapur and Ahmednagar districts. Crops that are grown during the monsoon season are called kharif crops while those grown during the winter season (October-March) are called rabi crops.Read: Maha drought: Drinking water situation worsensRevenue minister Eknath Khadse said on Thursday that villages with rabi crops have also been affected by the drought this time, and that based on fresh reports from districts, more villages will be declared drought-affected soon. He, however, did not disclosed exactly how many.The state government also reviewed preparations for the kharif season at a meeting chaired by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday.After the meeting, Khadse said that this year, crops will be sown on around 1.50 lakh hectares of land and that the government expects a total crop production of around 1.62 lakh metric tonnes.The government has started its preparations as the meteorological department has forecast an early monsoon this year.Khadse also reacted to remarks by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who defended the planting of water-guzzling sugarcane despite the drought. Pawar had said on Wednesday that though sugarcane is in the spotlight because of the drought, the crop has sustained and transformed the entire rural economy.Khadse said Pawar must be speaking from experience, but added that in such a situation, planning and water management is a must.No one can deny the fact that if sugar mills in drought-hit Latur, Beed and Osmanabad had used water sparingly, the state government would have had to deploy fewer tankers, Khadse said.Currently, 3,351 villages across Maharashtra have no sources of drinking water and are being supplied water by 4,356 tankers, according to data released by the relief and rehabilitation department last week."

Officials say rivers are the state government's property that makes well digging in the riverbed illegal. The river has water only for a couple of months during the monsoon season.Once the Godavari dries up, villagers start digging temporary wells. Residents say it is inexpensive to dig wells in soft riverbed. A dozen wells have been dug in the river's stretch passing through Samvatsar and more are coming up. Pipelines criss-cross the riverbed as residents use them for their cattle and sugarcane crop.""Our crops are dying and so are the cattle. We have dug hundreds of bore wells inside our village, but there is no water,'' said Sopan Chavan, a resident. ""We are digging wells in the Godavari because there is no other option. Nobody pays any attention to our needs, so we have found our own way to get water.''Chavan pumps water for his sugarcane crop, which dominates the village's economy and politics. Most villages in Ahmednagar face acute water scarcity, but it has had little impact on 22 sugar mills that have crushed sugarcane this year. The high water-consuming crop is ever popular among farmers and politicians.Another resident, Rashid Tamboli, said some officials visited the village a few days back and told them well-digging in the riverbed is illegal. ""But the entire village ganged up and demanded that the government first make water available and then stop us from digging wells.'' Vimlabai Wandle said the water was not potable. ""It is not even safe for cattle, but it is better that they die drinking some water instead of dying without it,'' The water from the river wells stinks.""At least there is some water and that is enough for us. Nobody would like to dig the riverbed, but the drought is forcing us to,"" said farmer Vitthal Parmeshwar. Residents in nearby Lasur have built a well with concrete wall in the Shivna riverbed.

It is estimated that the drought destroyed at least 30% of sugarcane crops, leaving lakhs of farmers in a precarious position.As Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh face major drop in production due to drought, the Karnataka government has also revised its estimates to 30% less than 2015-16 harvest. However, Sugarcane Farmers' Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar says the dip in sugarcane production will be worse.""The drought has been severe this year; 50% of the crops have already been lost. There is no water for the crops to survive,"" he said. According to Shanthakumar, of the 25 lakh borewells drilled by sugarcane farmers, at least five lakh have dried up. And the operational ones are not yielding enough for the water intensive sugarcane crops.While the last three years saw a problem of plenty, with prices of sugar crashing, this year the sugar prices are likely to go up due to shortage. Farmers say sugar prices will touch Rs 45-50 per kg from the present Rs 30-35.""The production has come down by 18%. The next year's production, which is dependent upon this year's crop, will see a possible dip,"" sugar commissioner MK Aiyappa pointed out."

Sugar cane crop grown in state annually guzzles water that could otherwise quench thirst of 100 crore population throughout the year. The overzealous promotion of sugar industry by Pawar is the sole cause of the drought in state which has depleted even groundwater,"" said Desarda.As vice-president of Pune-based 'Dushkal Nivaran, Nirmulan Mandal,' Desarda has toured 20 drought affected districts, eight of them in worst-hit Marathwada and seven in Vidarbha. He said more than natural, the drought was man made driven by wrong policies.Desarda said the drought situation was now much worse than in 1972 when at least groundwater and semblance of sensitivity were available. Now even that has been exhausted for non-essential crops like sugar cane, he said.Desarda is also not much enthused by the water conservation measures like Jalyukta Shivar Yojana being pursued by the current state government. ""Monstrous machines are being used to change course of a river in the name of rejuvenation. All this could lead to geographical disasters as there is no scientific base to the water conservation projects,"" he alleged.

Henceforth, cotton farmers will get similar support and Nandgaopeth textile park would serve as a model,"" said Fadnavis.Raymond is to invest 1400 crore at Nangaonpeth where linen, denim, cotton shirting and garmenting facilities would come, providing at least 8,000 jobs.The factory spread on 200 hectares would come up in phases and the first unit is likely to start operations by March next.""Our government has introduced a policy of value addition of every agro-product so that farmers get good remunerative prices for their produce and unemployed youths of the area get jobs,"" he said and added that his government is developing 10 textile parks in all cotton-producing regions of Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra.Besides this, orange processing units in orange-growing areas and edible oil units in soyabean-producing regions are being set up to bring value addition of the products.He said that such steps would prevent farm-suicide in the region. Amravati will soon be booming textile city and no longer be the suicide capital of farmers,"" said the chief minister. He also inaugurated Siyaram's textile unit in a separate function on Saturday.Fadnavis said the Nandgaonpeth five star MIDC area, spread over about 2,800 kms, was developed 15 years ago. However, it failed to attract a single industrial unit there. ""But our sincere efforts to promote industrial growth has paid off. Today, there is a race among investors to get land here.""Lauding the assurance by Raymond that it will start production by March next year, Fadanvis said Raymond has a unit in Yavatmal and the cotton growers will be greatly benefited by the second unit in Amravati. He hailed the Raymond's holistic approach in setting up a housing complex with an international standard school and the company's proposal to help set up an apparel and fashion zone here.Raymond had agreed to set up its second unit after Yavatmal in Amravati in the month of February early this year during the ""Make in India"" event in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and within a span of two months the bhoomipujan of the project was performed. On the occasion, Gautam Hari Singhania, the CMD of Raymond, said that along with generation of multiple employment opportunities it will contribute substantially to the overall development of the region.Industries minister Subhash Desai said he was happy that Raymond kept pace with the government's fast clearances for the project and started work here in record time.

Now, this is a major change from the past when our developed land along with infrastructure at MIDC had no takers. Today, we have no space at MIDC in this region. The 14 textile parks, complete with manufacturing and apparel units in Vidarbha and Marathwada, have been taken up to provide a robust market for cotton cultivators. The chief minister recalled, The white gold tag associated with cotton cash crop has lost its shine because of the agro-distress in the last two decades. Our textile policies linked to agro-industries will help us take cotton crop to its old glory.Cotton cultivators, often with small land holdings can thrive only if they have an assured market. The government wants to adopt the western Maharashtra model where sugar mills and sugar cane cultivators are inter-linked and inter-dependent.The state government has also decided to promote textile technology in the sector to ensure better production of cotton to help farmers and efficient operations for the manufacturing sector. While inaugurating the Siyaram Silk Mills Golden Fibres Plant, marking commencement of operational activities, the chief minister hoped it would work to the advantage of youths.

Sources said among the leaders who control some of the mills are former deputy CM Ajit Pawar, Vijaysingh Mohite Patil, Shyam Bagal and former MLA of Jan Surajya Shakti Party Vinay Kore. Of the 20 mills, four are run privately , while the others are run on a cooperative basis. Those whose licences have been cancelled are Aadinath, Shri Kurmadas and Shivratna Karkambh mills (all Solapur), Vasantdada Shetkari mill (Sangli), Chopda mill (Jalgaon) and Chhatrapati sugar mill in Pune.Former MLA Vinay Kore's Korevarna mill in Kolhapur district has been fined Rs 66.9 crore for not paying FRP to farmers.Among the other fined are U Gaikwad sugar mill in Kolhapur (Rs 20.4 crore), Manganga in Sangli (Rs 8.6 crore), YashwantKhanapur in Sangli (Rs 8.5 crore) and Shankar in Solapur (Rs 8.9 crore).A senior official said unless they pay the fine and FRP to farmers, the licences of those who have been fined or had their licences suspended will not be renewed for the next year."

The ratio of expenditure on production and income has gone berserk due to this. At the same time sugarcane crushing has suffered due to unavailability of water leading to cut in sugar production. To compensate the losses suffered by the factories, we have asked the government to restructure the loan sanctioned to ensure FRP to farmers, said Sanjeev Babar, Managing Director, Maharashtra State co-op Sugar Factories Federation Limited.On Wesdnesday a delegation of the federation met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis who has agreed to forward their plea to the Centre.The sugar production in the state has been on the decline for the last two years and is expected to be very low next year.In 2014-15, the sugar production was 105 lakh tonne, which came down to 83 lakh tonne. Due to worsening drought the production next year is expected to be only 45-50 lakh tonne.According to Mr Babar, the area under sugarcane cultivation too has reduced by over 3 lakh hectare and is expected to shrink further.Last year the total area under cultivation was 9.27 lakh hectare, which has come down to only 6.30 lakh hectare this year, he said.The current retail price of sugar stands at around Rs 35-40 per kilogram. There will be slight increase, but it wont go beyond Rs 50, Mr Babar added.Commenting on the drought situation and allegations against the sugar industry of indiscriminate use of water for the sugarcane crop, the federation has clarified that it supports the installation of drip irrigation facilities in the fields.According to the members, the state gets Rs 840 crore in the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) through excise duty on sugar. We expect the government to provide 50 per cent subsidy on installation of the facility and rest money can be raised in the form of loan by farmer, said Shivajirao Nagwade, President of the federation.Meanwhile, all sugar factories will be contributing Rs 10 lakh to the state governments drought relief fund. Additionally, Rs 15 lakh will be spent on ensuring water conservation works in the areas adjacent to the factories."

In an interview with The Hindu , he talks about the current water crisis and possible solutions.Your views on the States water crisis?Maharashtra has had a drought either throughout the state or in several regions since 2012, so to some extent, the current water crisis can be tied to the annual recurrence of persistent drought. Like the rest of the country, Maharashtra experiences the bulk of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, so a few failed monsoons can quickly add up. Drought is a natural occurrence, although human-induced climate change might be increasing the variability in rain, resulting in a few years of drought followed by some years of excess rain. Shortage, on the other hand, is entirely a human creation, and is a direct result of mismanagement, priorities and policies.How well has the State managed its water?Maharashtra is the countrys most industrialised state (highest gross state domestic product), has a large agricultural sector, and contains several cities including the power-hungry Mumbai metropolis. All these sectors have water needs. Given the severity of the crisis, it is clear that the state hasnt been able to manage its water. Promoting water-intensive crops like sugarcane doesnt help the state in this regard. Urbanisation of even small towns has meant that small lakes and rivulets that fed those lakes have vanished, making room for more land. Unchecked withdrawal of groundwater has left very little reserve water for use in such situations.How do you suggest the State can manage the crisis?Though virtually impossible, the state needs to rein in the sugar lobbys power and cut off subsidies for sugar production, which receives a large proportion of the irrigated water supply. Reviving small lakes and streams will ensure local water supplies are intact and groundwater remains recharged. Sustained drought not only diminishes surface water availability, but it also slowly and steadily taps out moisture from groundwater. Increasing water prices can also be an option, although the tariff hike by MIDC in 2013 was so unpopular with businesses that it had to be revoked a year later. Long-term measures that impact planning, choices in food and energy production and recognition of the severity of the issue will have more long-lasting effects than banning cricket matches and watering of golf courses and vineyards. Water policing is a very appealing option to many lawmakers and the public, but is not effective.Is desalination an option?Desalination is a very expensive method of generating clean water. One might argue that in times of shortage, the added cost might be worth the benefit of having a reliable supply. Without even including the impacts of desalination on marine life and water quality, it only seems prudent when there is a clear agreement between buyers and sellers. If the state or a local municipal agency is to foot the bill for a new desalination plant, then buyers of that water must be clearly identified and contractually obligated to purchase it at negotiated rates, regardless of the rainfall situation in that year. As examples from countries like Australia have shown, desalination plants built during periods of drought turn into white elephants when rainfall returns to normal levels."

As a matter of fact, i corrected a lot of wrongs prevalent in Mumbais real estate sector.I became quite unpopular because of that.In some cases, vested interests were at play  i didnt clear those files. I didnt allow anyone to get cheap government land or houses.This was part of the party high command policy that discretionary allotments should be reduced.But the party had no policy on rationalists, one was killed under your watch, Congress accused of overlooking intelligence  is targeting rationalists a game all political groups play?Dabholkar was killed when i was CM. I met intelligence agencies. Intelligence pointed towards Sanatan Sanstha  we wrote to the central government to ban Sanatan Sanstha.Central government did not ban Sanatan Sanstha  neither did they refuse to ban it.After two more murders, of Kalburgi and Pansare, reports showed similarities in the bullets fired. One Sanatan Sanstha fellow was arrested.But the investigation appears slow.Government must clarify its stand on banning Sanatan Sanstha now.Speaking of bans, Congress began the cow-slaughter ban  how can it criticise BJP now?I am against the beef ban totally. It deprives people of choice. Imposing religious values of one community on others goes against the principle of a secular state.Mere possession of beef gets you a six-month imprisonment  this is highly draconian. It also scares foreigners visiting India. Foreigners carry dry beef as a routine part of baggage.We also have a cow slaughter law. Its affected the rural economy badly. Farmers dont know what to do with aged cattle as government hasnt provided cow shelters in drought.Evaluate Devendra Fadnaviss drought management  and what are the three things youd do?First, id have repaired all water conservation structures, so maximum waters conserved. Second, id have planned for contingency  what if rains get delayed? Can supplying water to Latur by train be a regular feature? What about Solapur and Beed?Id draw up contingency plans for every district. We must avoid migration also  mass migration will spoil Maharashtras image.Another thing is massive afforestation. Today, entire Marathwada has forest cover of less than 1%. Id have planted five crore trees in Marathwada alone.Governments planning to plant about two crore trees in the whole state  its not enough.But Maharashtras drought is also due to major sugar cultivation  werent your ministers and ally NCP responsible?Sugarcanes been cultivated in Maharashtra over the last six decades.Many sugar factories are owned by political leaders.Congress could not go against its coalition partners completely  but BJP enjoys full freedom. Why arent they able to fix water-related problems?Whats your view on shifting IPL from Maharashtra?By saving eight tankers of water from a cricket ground, will government now send this to far-flung Latur and Osmanabad?Shifting IPLs a knee-jerk reaction  and a huge loss to government coffers.If theres no cricket, ban race courses, golf courses, football pitches, even wedding lawns  all these need water.Is the Centre underestimating drought?Theres a lack of seriousness. Extensive plans must be implemented with dedication.But the Centres planning to spend Rs 1 lakh crore on a bullet train  this is utter foolishness. At this stage, Indias people need irrigation, shelter, healthcare, education  not bullet trains.Such cosmetic developmental projects are unnecessary at present.Why not use that money to complete irrigation?How can the water situation be improved now?Tough decisions are called for. Every major municipal corporation in Maharashtra must install automatic water metres. Malkapur in my constituency has 100% water metres  they are running successfully.Why cant bigger towns have them? Make water metres compulsory for all Maharashtra cities. Have differential water pricing  give free water to very poor people, charge high rates to industries, five star hotels, etc  but everyone must pay for water.Wont this be unpopular?I agree but were on the brink of a severe crisis  water must be used scientifically now."

Not only are they high in water content, they also have a high content of vitamin C.Nutritionists will also tell you that along with being high in vitamins and minerals, they are also low in calories. The black jamuns are known to keep sugar levels down and sellers say the dried and powdered seeds are the perfect remedy for diabetes. The jamuns come from Badlapur and are sold as per their size. While the smaller one are available for Rs 150 a kg, the larger varieties are sold for Rs 350 a kg.On the other hand, the ice apples and love apples are known for their almost zero calorie count. They are the perfect remedy to beat the heat. They come from coastal villages, where the best quality is found. ""These don't have a long shelf life. Most sellers sell small quantities to ensure their freshness,""said Vinayak Bhosle, a seller. The fruit is also delicate to touch, so careful handling is a must.Locals who are familiar with these fruits believe that they are best enjoyed in this month.

Developing drought-tolerant (less water-consuming) GM sugarcane is not an end in itself. We know how difficult it is in India to go for commercial release of any transgenic crop,"" said an ICAR scientist.Citing the recent example of GM mustard, sources claimed that even positive reports based on field trials and bio-safety examinations of the crop could not get this transgenic variety - developed by a Delhi University institution - green signal.But the effects of back-to-back droughts, mounting rural distress and the sheer economic and ecological costs of water-intense crops might make planners keen to develop GM sugarcane. Authorities hope that once the benefits of the new crop become evident, its acceptance will grow.The final call will be that of the central regulator - Genetic Engineering Appraisal Co- mmittee - of the environment ministry. So far, GM brinjal hasn't been allowed commercial release even after the regulator's nod whereas a similar transgenic variety is being cultivated by Bangladesh.But GM sugarcane in water-stressed areas can offer hope in Maharashtra and other parts of India. Already, extreme water shortages have turned the focus on how to use water judiciously with PM Narendra Modi calling for all out efforts to implement drip irrigation on a massive scale.Referring to the urgency, an ICAR scientist said the GM route could be a long-term approach, keeping in mind the global demand scenario and India's role in it, whereas drip irrigation was the need of the hour.The research body, nevertheless, appears to be preparing for the future. ICAR director general Trilochan Mohapatra had last month written to Pawar while apprising him of the work done by ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Coimbatore in the field of GM sugarcane and how it could join hands with VSI, Pune. Pawar is chairman of the board of trustees that manages VSI.Responding to Pawar's letter on the issue, Mohapatra said an MoU was ready to be signed between ICAR and VSI."

The department has zeroed in on 15 mills, raising tax demands of more than Rs 25 crore and cumulative tax demands of more than Rs 1,100 crore.Along with unpaid cane growers, now Income-Tax officers have come knocking at the doors of cooperative sugar mills in the state. The I-T department says 22 cooperative mills owe it more than Rs 1,200 crore in unpaid taxes.Sources said for the last 20 years, I-T officers have been raising the issue of unpaid taxes by mills who have paid over and above the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) to growers. The Income-Tax department feels payments over and above the FRP constitute profit on income and is distributed among the members. Tax demands are raised on such payments, said an industry insider.The department has zeroed in on 15 mills, raising tax demands of more than Rs 25 crore and cumulative tax demands of more than Rs 1,100 crore. Of the 15 mills, three mills have tax demands of more than Rs 100 crore while two have tax demands of over Rs 90 crore.Three mills have unpaid tax demands of more than Rs 70 crore and rest of the mills have unpaid tax demands in the range of Rs 50-20 crore. There are seven mills whose tax demands are between Rs 3 crore and Rs 25 crore.Interestingly, almost 90 per cent of the mills are from the sugar-belt of Western Maharashtra. Most mills are from the districts of Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Pune.Jayprakash Dandegaonkar, vice-president of the Maharashtra Sugar Cooperative Factories Federation, questioned the I-T departments tax demands. Cooperative mills are examples of successful partnerships among farmers. Payment over FRP can hardly be constructed as profit from income, he said.In 2007-08, the cooperative mills had filed a case against the I-T department over the issue. Dandegaonkar said the millers had engaged eminent lawyer Harish Salve to argue their case. However, Salve had to leave for London so through the intervention of former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, we have asked former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram to argue our case. The case will come up before a three-judge bench hopefully soon, he said.Dandegaonkar said the millers led by Pawar had met both the prime minister and the Union finance minister to discuss the issue. If the Supreme Court upholds the decision of the I-T department, then the cooperative mills would be in deep financial distress, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

However, there are financial implications in the way as sugar mills have urged the government to stand guarantor for loans it seeks from banks for investment in drip infrastructure.Notwithstanding the financial hurdles, the Centre and the state are all set to make drip irrigation a compulsion, as part of the long-term drought mitigation policy.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, There is no alternative to drip irrigation for all high water-intensive crops. To begin with, we will have to make drip irrigation mandatory for sugarcane crops.All studies by government on water management recommended that all water-intensive crops/horticulture, including sugarcane, bananas, grapes should be brought under drip irrigation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after a drought meeting with the chief minister, had observed, I have stressed on vitality of increasing water use efficiently through sprinkler and drip irrigation, including in sugarcane cultivation.A senior cabinet minister said, Despite the necessity, we have to adopt flexibility. We will extend subsidies upto 50 to 75 per cent to small and marginal farmers from backward category who switch over to drip irrigation to enable them to sustain the additional expenditure. Sugar mills are not seeking direct subsidies. But they have urged the state government to stand guarantor for bank loans they would seek for investments in drip infrastructure.However, the ministry of finance is not very keen on making immediate commitments. As sources said, Rs 4,000 crore support to farmers for drip irrigation is not viable in the long run.At present, less than 20 per cent of sugarcane growers have adopted drip irrigation. The chief minister indicated that various research institutes and collaborations with Israel can pave the way for adapting a more economical model for drip irrigation in rural Maharashtra. Former minister for cooperation, Harshvarshan Patil, said, I fully support the state governments initiative for making drip irrigation compulsory for sugarcane crops. We have to go for better water management.The results from drip irrigation, compiled by the state government across districts reeling under drought, show that drip irrigation, along with protected farming yielded higher and better crop. The higher expense in drip infrastructure is easily recovered through dividends from higher production.The agriculture department is playing a crucial role to provide logistical and technological support to farmers groups ready to experiment in drought prone districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada.More Related News Tikka crowned Kinnow King for transforming barren landFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

According to recent guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for sugar industries, not more than 200 litres of waste water per tonne of cane crushed should be discharged from an individual sugar mill. However, a purification unit developed by NSI scientists can bring down the water usage to 160 litres per tonne of cane crushed.At present, sugar mills use fresh water for crushing cane and discharge the waste water. NSI experts have suggested two ways: to re-use waste water and save fresh water.NSI director Narendra Mohan said, ""Sugar mills do not monitor the intake and the water discharged. In order to be able to follow the CPCB guidelines, sugar mills will have to install instruments to measure the flow of water. There is water crisis in the country and the underground water table is also depleting. The need is, therefore, to save water. First step towards that would be water management and its recycling. The second step would be water purification and recycling for which we have developed a purification unit and the technique.""He said by doing so, sugar factories would not require fresh water all the time but purify and use recycled water.Talking about Uttar Pradesh which, along with Maharashtra and Karnataka, produces two-thirds of the total sugar produced in the country, Mohan said, ""In UP, 700 lakh tonnes of cane is crushed per annum and using the purification unit and techniques, 49 lakh tonnes of water could be saved which is enough for meeting the water needs of five lakh people for an entire year.""He concluded that sugar factories will incur an expenditure of 35 to 40 paise per litre to purify and recyle waste water otherwise discharged in the drains."
58f5c9747be9e01a357a7536,Alibaug’s secret: A legendary drink with a Jewish connect,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Alibaugs-secret-A-legendary-drink-with-a-Jewish-connect/articleshow/52274241.cms,2016-05-15,"In India, casual multiculturalism constantly reveals itself in odd and unexpected spaces. D Samsons Cold Drinks house on the Mumbai-Alibaug road is one such non-monument to history, which tells the story of Alibaug's amazing connection with Jews and with Israel. With its Mangalore-tiled roof and Marathi signage, this could be any other vada-pav or cold drink stall, if it weren't for the Star of David and pictures of Moses that hang on the wall. This quaint beverage stop, which serves an array of delicious bespoke aerated drinks like ginger-lemon soda, ice-cream soda and masala soda, was founded 80 years ago by a Bene-Israeli Jew, Daniel Samson Digodkar.Like many of his brethren  at one time there was a population of several thousand Jews in this area and a synagogue still stands tall in Alibaug town  his first name, Daniel, attests to the Jewish heritage, while the surname acknowledges his village, Digodi, near Mandwa. This intermingling of names reflects the manner in which the Raigad Jews have comingled Marathi culture with their very particular rituals, dissolving like sugar into water  in this particular case, carbonated water.D Samson's cold drinks, once a favourite among the British collectors, are by now legendary in the area. ""We continue to use the same secret recipes and the same carbonating machine that my uncle started with all of five rupees,"" says his nephew Sydney David, who lives in Mumbai but returns every Sunday to oversee the family business. Most other members of his family have migrated to Israel.For the longest time, the Bene-Israelis of Alibaug ran rice and oil pressing mills. When the Digodkars' mill shut down, Daniel Samson pursued a personal passion  creating flavourful drinks, first with the marble inside the bottle to contain the bubbles, later with sealed caps. When he died, his sister Mary Moses David took over. Her son Sydney is one of the last in the family - indeed in the community  left here today.According to Jewish author and historian Esther David, there are very few written records about the Bene Israel community of Alibaug. ""It is said we were a seafaring tribe who arrived more than 2,000 years ago, after facing persecution in the Greek or Roman empire. The ship happened to wreck at Navgaon in Alibaug district. Seven couples survived and spawned a community that mostly ended up as coconut oil pressers and supari plantation owners. Because they continued to practice Shabbath and took Saturdays off, they became known as 'Shanvar-telis'.""A little over 100 years ago, the community built the Magen Avot Synagogue (which means Shield of the Fathers) in the Alibaug, with the prayer hall facing the west, with eyes on Jerusalem. ""At one point there must have been 50,000-60,000 Bene-Israelis in western Maharashtra. During the British rule, they started moving to neighbouring cities like Pune and Mumbai, but the highest concentration remained in Alibaug,"" says David.Everyone was raised with the belief that they would eventually make it back to the Promised Land. By the 50s and 60s, most people started leaving for Israel, forming a little India in south Israel, where they continued to wear saris and create spice markets, but lived under the aegis of a new state which prided itself on embracing Jewish refugees not just from the Holocaust but from all over the world.One of the last of the Jews left in Alibaug is the elderly Jacob Dandekar, who has served as a chazan or cantor at the Synagogue and is widely referred to as 'Rabbee Dandekar', the Marathi version of Rabbi. The oldest Bene Israel cemetries continue to lie in Alibaug and the Israeli government has built a monument there in memory of the original seven couples who landed there and kept the community alive, says David.As for D Samsons Cold Drinks, it may not be around very long. The family of the current proprietor's is not interested in the business. His son works in a media company in Mumbai and his daughter has joined Israel Airlines and already been through the military training that is a must for all young people. Many have asked for the formula that makes these drinks the ultimate delicious quenchers, but he guards it fiercely - and it may well remain one of Alibaug's many charming and forgotten secrets."

He was addressing the Kisan Cell members and party activists at the Mandya District Congress Committee (MDCC) office here on Sunday.The government has instructed all Deputy Commissioners to supply water to affected areas through tankers, Mr. Miga said.Political mileageMr. Miga has criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, especially former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, for using the issue of farmers suicides and drought for political mileage.Mr. Yeddyurappa is planning to organise the Chaitanya Yatra. Instead of organising such programmes, he should urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to waive the loans of the farmers, taken from the nationalised banks, he said.The Kisan Cell leader also suggested that Mr. Yeddyurappa hold dialogues with Mr. Modi, and the Goa and Maharashtra governments to resolve Mahadayi river water-sharing issue.M.S.

He also announced that NCP would launch a severe agitation from June 5 if the state government failed to declare a loan-waiver for farmers among other relief measures, including adequate arrangements for livestock and financial help to peasant community ahead of the start of kharif season.While sugarcane cultivation has been attributed by experts as one of the key reasons for water-scarcity in Marathwada, Pawar said natural calamity in the form of deficient monsoon should be blamed for drought situation in the region and not the crop itself.""Marathwada has around 50 sugar mills that have been successfully running for more than five decades. The very existence of these mills for such a long period implies that the sugarcane cultivation should not be blamed. The current scarcity is an isolated case that has taken place due to a natural calamity,"" he said.Refuting charges against Marathwada farmers that they consume excess water for cultivation of sugarcane, Pawar said the farmers should be given a subsidy for drip irrigation along with waivers for electricity bills as immediate relief.Pressing for the demand for loan-waivers, the former Union Agriculture Minister came down heavily against the Centre.""The Centre is ready to dole out Rs one lakh crore to banks to address the issue of bad loans, but not keen to release relatively smaller amounts for offering relief to farmers. While on one hand, farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers, on the other hand the government has been adamant on its stand,"" Pawar said.He also criticised the measures announced by the state government to restructure farmers loans as a relief measure. ""The proposed measure is nothing but fooling poor farmers. The farmers will have to pay heavy interests on fresh loans in an accumulated way,"" the NCP chief said.Listing out major demands for the benefit of farmers, Pawar said his party would give both the Centre and the state time till June 5 to act, otherwise party workers would take to the streets.Addressing farmers, he said,""You need to show your might in a democratic and non-violent way. We do not want to politicise the issue of drought, and ready to cooperate with the government.""Recalling the drought of 1972 , Pawar said the then Maharashtra government had shown ""sensitivity and seriousness"" in dealing with the crisis.Families affected due to incidents of farmers suicide from Aurangabad district were offered aid of Rs 15,000 in the presence of Pawar during drought-meet.NCP leaders such as Ajit Pawar, Sunil Tatkare, Jayant Patil, Jaydatt Kshirsagar, Dhananja Munde, Padmsinh Patil, Nawab Malik, Rajesh Tope, Fauziya Khan, Satish Chavan, Bhausaheb Patil Chikatgaokar among others were present on the occasion."

Today, his home is the open ground in Ghatkopar's Bhatwadi. He lives with his wife and two children in a small rectangular patch marked by four sticks. With no roof or walls, it offers no shade against the searing heat. The family's belonging hang from trees, safe from the pigs below.Chavan is among the hundreds of drought refugees who have made their way to Mumbai over the last six months as work and water dried up in their villages. Around 350 families are sheltering at the Bhatwadi maidan. With no toilets, they take a bath in tents pitched with saris. ""I worked at the Jai Shiv Shankar sugar factory in Nanded but it shut down two years ago. My two-acre field had also withered. I had no choice but to leave,"" says Chavan. The rest of his neighbours are less fortunate: they own no land at all.By 8am, groups of migrants empty onto the nearby roads, hoping to be hired as daily labourers. At best, they land odd jobs twice a week, mainly cleaning gutters or carrying loads on construction sites. They make Rs 300-400 a day, more than half of which is spent on food.With farm work at a stand-still, the rural job scheme MNREGA would have been a lifeline for the families. The scheme offers 100 days of work per household in rural India. The Centre even declared it would offer 150 days of employment in drought-affected regions.Yet barely any of these villagers from Nanded have been able to tap into the scheme. ""If we could get work in the village, why would we come here?"" asks Jaipal Rathod, a landless labourer. I have been trying to get a MNREGA job card for years without success,"" he says.Through 2015-16, the state provided 7.63 crore days of work under the scheme, according to the MNREGA website. This was higher than 2014-15 but much lower than the 8.72 crore days of work provided during the drought year of 2012-13.In fact, the state does not come close to the target of 100 days of work per household."

But there are practical difficulties and the government must give financial assistance to implement its plan. Farmers and sugar mills cannot implement drip irrigation on their own,"" chairman of the federation Shivajirao Nagavade told TOI on Monday.He added that the sugar industry is the backbone of the rural economy with thousands of farmers and farm labourers dependent on the crop.""If the government and the experts continue to target sugarcane growing farmers and sugar mills and hold them responsible for the water scarcity, the sugar industry will collapse and farmers will be in distress. Who will be responsible for destroying their livelihoods? Sugarcane is the only crop which guarantees good returns,"" Nagavade added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently chaired a high-level meeting on the drought and scarcity situation in parts of Maharashtra, has told chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to increase water-use efficiency through drip and sprinkler irrigation, stating that drip irrigation in sugarcane increases the quality of sugar.Fadnavis has assured Modi that the state government is working on a plan to ensure that all the sugarcane growing area in Maharashtra comes under drip irrigation in three years.However, the sugar lobby, dominated by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, has been resisting the move and is supported by sugar barons in the BJP and the Shiv Sena.Nagavade said the notion about cane farmers using excess water is wrong. ""Earlier, it was wafa system where the flow was stopped after every few metres to water the cane crop. Now, a majority of farmers use eksari system where water flows from the top to the bottom.""Despite the drought, sugar mills completed their crushing season, this year. As many as 32 sugar mills, the highest in the state, had a successful cane-crushing season.In Latur district, where section 144 of the CrPC was clamped to protect water sources, 12 sugar mills have been defiantly siphoning off huge quantities of water for sugarcane crushing and the state government, which had earlier announced that no mill in the drought zone would be allowed to crush, remained a silent observer owing to pressure from the sugar lobby.Latur-based water expert Atul Deulgaonkar said it is a complicated matter. ""Even in the drought-affected areas of Marathwada, thousands of farmers are dependent on sugarcane as it is the only crop which gives them assured returns. The government must have a plan before taking any hasty steps while shifting cane cultivation to drip irrigation,"" he said ."

But in the years since, sugarcane farmers have used political connections and legal challenges  which also buy time  to delay and thwart the MWRRAs plans for equitable water distribution. Sugarcane farmers have also pleaded financial inability to switch to drip irrigation, despite repeated orders by the MWRRA.For example, in October 2015 the MWRRA ordered the release of 10 tmc water from Punes water reservoirs to the Ujani dam in Solapur. This was challenged before the Bombay High Court, which stayed the order and also directed MWRRA member (technical) Suresh Sodal to step down, due to conflict of interest. The MWRRA, asked to review its October ruling, passed a second order that only reiterated its earlier order. But by then water levels in the reservoirs showed a 30 per cent depletion. A senior government official told The Hindu , The water was diverted to sugar cane cultivations, to benefit powerful politicians from western Maharashtra including a senior Congress party leader's farmlands. Currently, 70 per cent of Maharashtras water is used for agriculture, and over 60 per cent of that is used by sugarcane cultivators.Section 15(3) of the MWRRA Act says, The state water board, headed by a chief secretary (retired) shall prepare the draft integrated water plan [] submit the first draft to the council headed by the chief minister [] within six months from date on which the Act is made applicable in the state (2005).The senior government official told The Hindu , In the last decade, what we have actually managed to prepare is a limited water integration plan for the Godavari basin, which was received by the state government only six months back. All the west-flowing rivers  Krishna, Narmada, Tapi  are covered under this basin. Maharashtra gets an average of 164 billion cubic meters (bcm) of water annually through rains. It is allocated 126 bcm by interstate tribunals, besides 30 bcm of utilisable water from surface and groundwater sources, according to a MWRRA presentation on water pricing in the state that was released in April 2016.The presentation, made by former (his tenure ended on April 22) MWRRA member, economy, Chitkala Zutshi, explains the water use by different sectors in the state. While in 1996, 31.3 bcm (86.7 per cent of water available for use) was utilised for irrigation, 3.5 bcm (10 per cent) was used by domestic users and 1.5 bcm (four per cent) by industry. []In 2012 the same three categories accounted for 31.1 bcm (79 per cent) for irrigation, 5.7 bcm by domestic and 2.8 bcm by industry. The projected usage by 2030 is pegged at 89.7 bcm (89 per cent) for irrigation, 7.2 bcm (seven per cent) for domestic use and 3.7 bcm (four per cent) for industry.Parinita Dandekar, convenor of the South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), says that at the lower Terna reservoir, 40 km from Latur, the local sugar factory lifts 5000 lakh litres of water from this dam's dead storage.When I asked dam officials at the site about this, they said industries had reservations, and this sugar factory had a reservation of 0.5 million cubic meters of water. Compare this with the exuberance shown by political parties and administration at securing a train carrying 5 lakh litres of water. She adds that the current drought is as much due to the lack of transparency and equitable water allocation policy as it is about failing monsoon and plummeting ground water levels.Another hindrance to the organised water plan for the state is that the MWRRA itself needs to be reconstituted: the tenures of all its three jury members expired in April 2016. A senior secretariat official told this paper that the state government has finalised a proposal for the appointment of chairperson.The writer is a freelance journalist"

The JJ Hospital dean has to set up a panel of three doctors to examine Bhujbal. Senior counsel Amit Desai and advocate Sajal Yadav, who appeared for the NCP leader, said he was suffering from heart ailment and other medical conditions that required medical attention. Besides, the bail plea denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was ""law-abiding'' with no criminal antecedents.

FILE PHOTOThe government is considering banning futures trading in chana dal (brown chickpeas) and reducing import duty on sugar as part of its efforts to rein in inflation, according to a top official.Higher food prices, led by pulses and sugar, pushed wholesale price inflation into positive territory in April after 17 months of decline while consumer price inflation crossed 5 per cent in the same month.The ban in futures trading in chana dal would be discussed at a committee of secretaries meeting on Monday but a final call would be taken by the finance ministry, the food ministry official said. Urad and tur are not part of the futures trading market while chana dal is and its prices have been rising. We will take a decision on putting curbs in futures trading after inter-ministerial consultations.The finance ministry would have to decide on this, the official said.VAT exemptionSeparately, to curb the surging prices of pulses, Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan requested state governments to exempt them from VAT (value added tax) and other local levies as it could help bring down prices by five to seven per cent. States have also been asked to rationalise stock limits for millers, producers and importers based on a logical formula linked to the consumption pattern.Prices of food items like pulses, sugar, edible oil seeds shoot up abnormally due to hoarding, profiteering and carteling by traders and middlemen  without any benefit to the farmers.Traders hoard the stock of a commodity in a bordering state where stock limits are not imposed, the minister pointed out, urging all states to impose stock limits in such commodities.Sugar pricesMr.Paswan warned sugar producers and hoarders of a crackdown if prices dont correct soon and reminded them that the government had helped the sugar industry when it was in distress and now that the sector is profitable, prices need not be as high as the Rs.49 per kg prevailing now.According to our needs, there is enough sugar but attempts to initiate hoarding have begun and sugar prices are being pushed up. We will think about reducing the import duty on sugar if this trend continues. The sugar price shouldnt be higher than around Rs.33 per kg, Mr. Paswan said after a meeting with state food ministers.State watchThe minister has written to the chief ministers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, asking them to keep a close watch on sugar mills stock position to ensure availability in the domestic market.Responding positively to states suggestion that the Centre must also monitor the stock position of pulses importers, Mr.Paswan said, We dont want to bring in an inspector raj for this but the government must know the actual position.Higher food prices pushed wholesale price inflation into positive territory in the month of April"

This led to millers running up arrears of up to Rs 21,000 crore.Paswan said that with rise in sugar prices and steps taken by the government, outstanding dues by millers to farmers has declined to Rs 800 crore.Paswan also said that he has written to governments of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu to keep a close watch on sugar stocks held by millers to ensure availability in the domestic market."

Stockists cannot hold the stipulated amount of quantities for more than 30 days. This notification will be valid up to October 2016.Officials say the notification is in line with the Centre's note issued on April 29.

Market experts say that generally a wholesaler stocks about 3,000 quintals while a retailer stocks up to 100 quintals of sugar.""The sugar price is on the rise since six months and is expected to go up further due to a dip in production of sugar owing to reduction in sugarcane crop,"" said Kuwadia.Last time a cap on sugar stock was set was in 2010 due to dip in production.

If arrears to be calculated based on cane price fixed by the UP government which is Rs 280 per quintal, then dues would be Rs 5,795 crore.""The state of UP has allowed a two stage payment of FRP. Till end June, mills are expected to pay cane dues based on FRP (Rs 230/quintal), according to which arrears are presently Rs 2,855 crore. However, July onwards the mills will have to pay dues based on State Advised Prices (at Rs 280/quintal) on the basis of which the dues come to Rs 5,795 crore,"" Paswan said.Giving data of cane arrears for other states, the Minister said millers owed Rs 1,819 crore in Maharashtra and Rs 1,625 crore in Karnataka till early this month.Total cane price payable to farmers across all cane producing states is Rs 60,000-65,000 crore a year.Highlighting measures taken in the last two years to help the sugar sector, Paswan said the government had provided soft loan to millers to clear cane arrears.It also increased import duty to 40 per cent, offered export subsidy on raw sugar and a production subsidy to sugar mills to offset cost of cane price, promoted Ethanol Blending Program (EBP, he said, adding that these measures have helped the sector to bounce back.India's sugar production is estimated to be 25 million tonnes in 2015-16 season, as against 28.3 million tonnes in the previous year."

Retailers are currently selling sugar between Rs 30 and Rs 35 per kg.The government on Friday issued the Maharashtra Scheduled Commodities Wholesale Dealers Sugar (Storage Control) Licensing Order, 2016, which applies to the entire state and will be in effect till October 25, 2016. The order forbids a wholesale dealer from holding stocks of sugar in excess of 5,000 quintal, while the limit for retailers is 500 quintal. Also, a dealer cannot hold the specified quantity of sugar for more than 30 days after receiving it.The Centre had issued an order last month directing all state governments to take necessary steps to control sugar prices. We have followed orders from the Centre and issued a stocking limit for the state. It is to keep prices under control as sugar cannot be held back to create artificial scarcity, a senior official with the states food, civil supplies and consumer protection department said.Sugar factories, however, feel setting a stock limit will not be useful. Sugar production is on the decline this year, so I am unsure whether this order will have any impact, Sanjeev Babar, MD, Maharashtra State Co-Op. Sugar Factories Federation Ltd, said. Officials confirmed that there has been a drop in sugar production in the state in the last two years, and production in the next year is expected to dip .In 2014-15, sugar production was 105 lakh tonne, which came down to 83 lakh tonne in the 2015-16 fiscal. The next crop is expected to be only 45-50 lakh tonne with the drought-like condition prevailing since three years taking a toll.The area under sugarcane cultivation too has reduced by over 3 lakh hectare and is expected to shrink further. Last year, the total area under cultivation was 9.27 lakh hectare; this has come down to 6.30 lakh hectare this year.Shirish Deshpande of the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat said such measures will have a very limited effect. Despite imposing a stock limit to tur dal, prices which had gone up are yet to come down. Those who want to sell in the black market can devise various ways [to do so], so it is not a foolproof system, he said.Mr. Deshpande also questioned the sudden rise in sugar prices. Except for last year, we had excess sugar production. There was sugar stock which could have been used to control prices. It must also be probed as what led to sudden rise in sugar prices, he said.The Centre's order last month directing all state govts to take steps to control sugar prices"

There is a need of new industrial incentive policy from June 30 onwards,"" CM said and asked the industries department officials to incorporate the feedback received from entrepreneurs in the forthcoming policy.He said, the new policy was being prepared in such a way that it would enhance industrial activities in Bihar. Nitish also urged entrepreneurs not to do anything which could bring a bad name to the state.CM also announced that henceforth the 'Udyami Panchayat' would be held on a regular basis on fifth Monday of a month. ""Earlier, we organized altogether eight such panchayats for listening to grievances and suggestions of entrepreneurs,"" he said. Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and several other ministers were also present at the Panchayat.Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's announcement about boosting ethanol production in the country, Nitish said, ""We had earlier sought permission from the Centre for production of ethanol in the state's sugar mills. But the Centre then didn't give permission on the ground of security. Had Bihar government earlier got permission from the Centre for ethanol production, the state's sugar industry would have in profit.""Speaking at the BJP's 'Vikas Parva' rally at Davangere (Karnataka), Modi on Sunday declared that he would not hesitate to take on the powerful petrol-diesel lobby to boost ethanol production and reduce the dependence of farmers on sugar production in the country.

""We have removed this process for group C and D posts to rescue job seekers from middlemen. They are getting jobs based on merit as the entire process now is technology driven,'' he said addressing his second rally as part of Vikas Parv in Karnataka.To curb the menace of middlemen in the farm sector, he said the e-Mandi platform launched for farmers ensures farmers get their due price for their produce.Modi also said that more than three crore families have got LPG connections in the past one year without the assistance of middlemen. ""We aim to provide LPG connections to five crore more BPL households without accepting any security deposit in the next three years,"" he added. He said the scheme would improve health of women as they won't have to inhale smoke from hearth as studies have shown these fumes were equivalent to smoke from about 400 cigarettes.Modi said the overwhelming response to his call to give up LPG subsidy indicated that the country is not only developing but transforming as well. ""The attitude of reserving another seat in buses just to keep it vacant for their comfort seems to have gone now. It's not the question of money, but the trust between the government and public,"" he said. ""You don't even get a cup of tea for Re 1 today.

The plot already had 13 industrial units set up decades ago on 99-year leases from the MIDC. In a formal complaint to the Pune police on Monday, one Hemant Gawande alleged the land was purchased by the minister to claim compensation of up to Rs100 crore under the new Land Ceiling Act.Desais claim that the land belongs to the MIDC puts Khadse in a spot even more.An irked Khadse countered the claim: In a letter to the industries department by the then MIDC CEO Bhushan Gagarani in 2012, it has been mentioned that the land does not belong to them as the sale was not completed in 1969. The letter has also mentioned that the owner of the land Abbas Ukani has been fighting for compensation for the last 45 years. Desai had not studied the case before issuing the statement, Khadse said.An MIDC official said the land deal was sound on legal grounds, but the issues of conflict of interest and quid pro quo remained. The official pointed out that the land was purchased though the compensation case was in the High Court, and that compensation to the owner would range between Rs40 crore and Rs70 crore depending on which Act was applied.Khadse, however, told HT: The land was purchased by paying the stamp duty and registration fee for the ready reckoner price of the land which was Rs23 crore. The owner of the land has given it to me in writing that Rs3.72 crore was the settlement price between us and him as he was not able to pursue the matter in the high court because he was aged and lived in far-off Kolkata.When Khadse met Fadnavis for more than an hour, he reportedly explained the entire issue to him and requested the CM to ensure that a formal FIR was not registered on Gawandes complaint. Khadse, however, told the media that the meeting was to discuss the elctions to the legislative council and the Rajya Sabha. He also insisted that the reports of him losing the revenue portfolio were baseless.In a related development, a Congress delegation led by city unit president Sanjay Nirupam met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and demanded that Khadse should be sacked.In the evening, Damania, a former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader instrumental in exposing both the irrigation and the Maharashtra Sadan scams, alleged that Khadse had links with large-scale irregularities in the Tapi irrigation project. She also alleged that Khadses family members were directors of a sugar factory purchased by two irrigation contractors. Khadse, however, described the allegation as baseless. I was not even the irrigation minister when these contracts were awarded and hence there is no question of me favouring anyone, he said.Damania has threated to start a dharna agitation outside Fadnavis residence if action is not taken against Khadse.Meanwhile, Desais statement could escalate the war between the BJP and the Sena. The party high command has backed Desai to settle scores with Khadse who played a key role in snapping the 25-year-old ties between the two parties ahead of the Assembly election in 2014, a Sena leader said on the condition of anonymity."

The irrigation department had released water from Nilwande dam in the district to cater to drinking water needs.Prohibition orders were issued by the district collector along the riverside. However, farmers in Nimbale and Kolhewadi constructed a bund across the Pravara river to block water and use it for their villages and for their crops.Last week, irrigation department officials who arrived with machinery to break the bund, faced the farmers' ire. They were pelted with stones, but the officials demolished the bund the next day. Farmers are agitated after cases were filed against them.In Solapur, farmers in Karmala taluka blocked Ujani dam's water between Kittur and Pomalwadi, and downstream, farmers have started an agitation demanding the release of water. Tension prevails in all these villages.In Satara district, MP Udayanraje Bhosale has threatened of a 'violent agitation' if the irrigation department didn't stop the flow of Urmodi dam water to neighbouring Sangli district.""People in Satara have given their lands for the dam and they are the ones reeling under water scarcity. The local people must get first priority in water supply. If the demand is not met, be prepared to face action on the ground,"" Bhosale has warned.Meanwhile, the water level in Koyna dam in Satara is depleting. ""As of now, 11.81 TMC water is available in the reservoir. The government may decide to reserve this water for drinking purpose. Power generation may come to a halt if the monsoon is delayed,"" an irrigation department official said. The monsoon is expected in the state by June 7.The overall water availability in the state's reservoirs is 12 per cent and 4,600 villages and 7,418 hamlets are dependent on tankers. The government provides water to these parched areas using 5,738 tankers.Activists and experts have reiterated their demand, against the backdrop of Bombay high court's observations, for immediate release of water from Tata dams and the Koyna hydroelectric project for regions downstream. According to the activists, Tata dams hold a total of 159 million cubic metres (MCM) and Koyna has 536 MCM of water.The court had recently observed that, ""Natural resources such as water is national property... these resources must not be diverted for other purpose.""Sanjay Lakhe Patil, social worker from Jalna, has filed a contempt petition against the state for allegedly not releasing water despite a high court directive, this month.The bench said since it was not an expert on technical aspects, the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority should constantly monitor water levels in all the dams of the state and ensure that enough water is available for drinking in the drought-hit areas.Lakhe-Patil's contention was that private dams, including six in and around Lonavla, which have 50 TMC water and was being held, ought to be released to the affected areas in Marathwada."

File Photo: Ajaj ShaikhA resident of Pune, Maharashtras second-most developed city, uses five times as much water as her counterpart in Latur, the district most ravaged by drought in the south-central Marathwada region.Thats the extent of water inequality in Maharashtra, Indias most developed State, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of Statewide water use, characterised by disproportionate availability and consumption of water across regions, crops and consumers.The coastal region of Konkan - occupying a tenth of the States landmass and home to 14 per cent of its population (except Mumbai) - contains more than half of Maharashtras water, according to government data.The populous, dry and rain-shadow regions of western, central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, retain the other half, clashing with each other and neighbouring States for water.But the natural imbalance of water does not make drought inevitable. That happens because water has been deliberately routed to areas where it is already plentiful and to farmers who are politically powerful.Sugarcane - which is grown on four per cent of the States farms - consumes 70 per cent of water available for irrigation, IndiaSpend reported earlier, although no more than 1.1 million farmers grow the lucrative cash crop. In contrast, about 10 million jowar (sorghum), pulses and oilseeds farmers get no more than 10 per cent of irrigation water.The earlier Congress-Nationalist Congress Party-led government was entrenched in sugar politics with 13 of the 30 cabinet ministers owning or controlling sugar factories, Parineeta Dandekar, associate coordinator of South Asian Network for Dams, Rivers and People, wrote in her analysis of the sugarcane situation in Maharashtra.A natural phenomenonThere are five river basins in Maharashtra: Krishna, Godavari, Tapi, Narmada and a combined basin of westward flowing rivers in the coastal Konkan region.Of these, three are agriculturally important - Krishna, Godavari and Tapi. They cover 89 per cent of the States area; 0.4 per cent of the State falls under the Narmada river basin.The Konkan basin drains 10.9 per cent of the land, while containing 55 per cent of the States water.The Krishna basin drains most parts of Western Maharashtra, the prosperous districts of Kolhapur, Pune, Satara, Sangli and Solapur and some perennially droughtplagued areas, such as the eastern swathes of Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts.The Godavari basin covers the drought-hit regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha.Of the 125 billion cubic metres (BCM) surface water available in Maharashtras river basins, most of the 69 BCM in the Konkan region goes unutilised, according to a 2012 Maharashtra government White Paper on Irrigation.In contrast, the 17 BCM in the Krishna and 34 BCM in the Godavari basins are insufficient for the regions they water.In Maharashtra, sugarcane cultivation, which is on less than four per cent of the total cropped area of the State, takes away almost 70 per cent of irrigation water in the State, leading to massive inequity in the use of water within the State, said the sugarcane price policy report, 2014-15, issued by the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The CACP tabulates the share of irrigation water used by major crops in Maharashtra.How sugarcane corners irrigation waterSugarcane is the only crop in Maharashtra which is wholly irrigated. Irrigation water is available for no more than nine percent of pulses and four per cent of oilseeds.About 10 million farmers grow jowar, pulses and oilseeds  no more than a tenth of these farms are irrigated, as we saidand these crops use about 2.2 million litres of water per hectare, about 2,000 MCM of water through the year.Sugarcanes 1.1 million farmers use 18.7 million litres per hectare and consume 18,000 MCM  nine times that of jowar, oilseeds and pulses  annually across the state.Urban water consumption patterns are heavily tilted towards developed cities.The city of Latur in Marathwada consumes 60 litres per person daily, while an average Mumbaikar uses around 260 litres a day. The average daily use of water per person in Pune is 352 litres, according to IndiaSpend calculations, based on daily water requirements of these cities and the latest available population figures.A village with less than 20,000 people should get 40 litres of water per person per day, five litres less than the water prescribed to flush a toilet in a city such as Mumbai  these are the standards set in 1993 by the Bureau of Indian Standards in its Code of Basic Requirements.The standards also recommend reduced water supply to poorer localities in urban areas.In 2015, the Kelkar Committee on balanced regional development in Maharashtra recommended 140 litres per capita per day across rural and urban Maharashtra.The recommendation has not yet been included in the States water policy. - IANS"

Though Karnataka and Maharashtra saw a decline in sugar output, the situation does not warrant imports.

Global production is likely to fall by five per cent to 10 per cent next season. Exports are not much now because the Indian prices are not attractive in the international market. But, such a move affects the sentiment of the industry.The sugar industry is suffering for the last three years due to drought, high cane price, and cost of production. The domestic prices were at Rs. 2,000 a quintal as against the production cost of Rs. 3,400 a quintal.Now, prices have improved to Rs. 3,300 to Rs. 3,400 a quintal. I do not expect prices to go up beyond the current range, he said."

This has helped in stabilising prices in wholesale as well as retail market. The actual market prices are hovering around Rs 3,550 to Rs 3,600 per quintal at present.The crushing season of 2015-16 came to an end in the first week of May.Pramod Karnad, managing director of the bank said, ""There will be no more sugar production; the already produced sugar is going to be released in the market. Hence, we have decided not to change the valuation. This would offer steady market conditions for the next couple of months.""The demand for sugar would surge during the festive season starting with Ganeshotsav and it would remain high till New Year. The food, beverage and confectionery makers are the major bulk customers of sugar.Traders said that they will be buying sugar as per requirement in the coming weeks. ""There are limits on sugar stocking and all factories have surplus sugar, which will be available easily,"" they said.In November last year, the union government had asked mills to export sugar on priority and had promised that it would transfer Rs 45 per tonne to the farmers' accounts as compensation, providing relief to both mills and farmers. However, the government withdrew the subsidy on May 19, citing increased domestic prices for sugar. Mills have expressed their disappointment over the decision.On the other hand, sources in the state government said, ""The state wants to keep sugar prices at a certain level, which will benefit the factories while not becoming a burden on consumers."

An analysis of top listed companies' results, barring some exceptions, showed that net profit growth in the January-March quarter (Q4FY16) soared 40% on a yearly basis, which is the highest in the last 11 quarters.The analysis by Crisil also showed that total revenues of these 642 companies grew at 6.1%, the fastest in the last five quarters, while growth of ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation), at 15.2% was at a six-quarter high.""The performance (of India Inc) has been driven by a combination of improvement in operating performance and extraordinary gains. Without the one-offs too, bottom line growth is an impressive 17.3%,"" said Prasad Koparkar, senior director, Crisil Research. ""While aggregate top line growth was 6.1%, ebitda grew faster at 15.2%, a six-quarter high, which was aided by low commodity prices,"" Koparkar said.Data showed that during Q4FY16, these 642 companies, which represented 72% of NSE's total market capitalisation, earned a total net profit of Rs 49,349 crore from a total revenues of Rs 6.18 lakh crore. On an annual basis, during FY16 these companies earned an aggregate net profit of Rs 1.79 lakh crore, up 16.7% on FY15 from an aggregate revenue of Rs 22.98 lakh crore, which was up 2.5% on the years. These figures do noT include results by financial and oil companies, Vedanta and TCS, the last two since there were large one-offs for these companies during FY16 and hence strictly not comparable.On the sectoral front, power, airlines, IT, sugar and auto components drove net profit growth, while telecom and passenger car firms have lagged, Koparkar said. The analysis showed that airlines, power, IT and sugar industries demonstrated strong growth in ebitda. Companies in airlines, IT and auto components sectors benefited from extraordinary gains, too, which lifted aggregate net profit growth to 39.9%. Adjusted for extraordinary income, aggregate net profit growth for these companies was a more moderate 17.3%, data showed.The analysis also showed that pharmaceutical companies reported a 14% revenue growth, driven by mid-sized companies. Aggregate operating margin improved by close to 200 basis points due to better product mix and lower raw material cost, which offset higher other costs and compliance expenses, Crisil Research said.Compared to these industries which showed better performance, telecom companies showed a 9.5% revenue growth, following sharper focus on realisation and volume improvement. However, net profit margin declined 108 basis points because of higher interest expense arising from loan taken to purchase spectrum.In the automobile segment, Maruti Suzuki kept cruising, with revenue growing 12.3%, helped by a rise in realisation. However, exports dropped 8.6% and operating margin by 50 basis points on higher marketing outgo. Rise in tax and depreciation, and a fall in other income, resulted in net profit margin shrinking 200 basis points, Crisil Research said."

There is the community's intellectual property attached to that product.Earlier this year, seven other products - Ajara Ghansal rice, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri Kokum, Vengurla cashew, Lasalgaon onion, Waghya Ghevda, Mangalvedha jowar and Navapur tur - were awarded the GI mark.""Most of these products are from rural areas. Their qualities and traditional stories make them special. They are all natural products,"" Great Mission Group Consultancy, Pune, chairman Ganesh Hingmire said.As most of the GI products are from villages, an export market is created for these areas. Moreover, farmers are benefited by this process after they register as authorized users.Hingmire said Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana, former agriculture commissioner Umakant Dangar and the Centre had been instrumental in getting the GI marks.The custard apples from Balaghat, Beed, were awarded the GI for sweetness coming from the Total Soluble Sugar value, which is more than the apples found in UK and US. The fruit's speciality is that it grows even in rocky and waterless areas.Jalana's sweet oranges stand out for their size, sweetness and juice content. They are also one of the most vital crops for farmers in the area.Jalgaon's Bharit Brinjal is grown in parts of north Maharashtra, sharing its border with Gujarat. It's production was started by an old tribal community. As of today, the brinjal is served as one of the dishes on German airlines, especially Lufthansa.Waigaon's turmeric is grown in a small village of Wardha district, which is rich in curcumin content. The curcumin content gives medicinal qualities to turmeric and makes it useful for treating cancer. The standard curcumin content in turmeric is 2-4% by weight and anything over 6% is considered good. A 6.24% by weight curcumin content was found in Waigaon's turmeric by the Spice Board of India.Solapur's pomegranates contain more anti-oxidants than any other variety, which help in fighting cancer causing agents in the body.Figs from Saswad, Purandar, stand out for its size, colour, taste and high iron content. Moreover, it grows on red soil, which adds to the natural benefits.The golden-green Sangli raisins melt in one's mouth and has less wrinkles on the outside, which adds to its taste.Beed's custard apple, sweet oranges from Jalna, Jalgaon's Bharit Brinjal, Waigaon's turmeric, pomegranate from Solapur, figs from Purandar and raisins from Sangli have been issued certificates of Geographical Identification (GI) mark.The Agricultural Geographical Indications (Agri GI) has given these certificates to these produce that are being cultivated by generations of growers from these areas.Earlier this year another set of seven products were awarded this mark. They includec Ajara Ghansal rice, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri Kokum, Vengurla cashew, Lasalgaon onion, Waghya Ghevda, Mangalvedha jowar and Navapur tur.A geographical indication (GI) is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (eg a town, region, or country). There is the community's intellectual property attached to that particular product.""Most of these products are from rural areas and it's their unique qualities, and the traditional stories behind them, that make them special. They have a history and are all natural products,"" says Ganesh Hingmire, chairman, Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), Pune.Securing a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price. Since most of these are agricultural products from villages, an export market is created for these places and leads to spurt in international demand for them. Hingmire says that support from Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Umakant Dangar, former agricultur commissioner and the Union government have been instrumental in getting these GIs.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level. The ultimate beneficiaries of this whole process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits.The Beed custard apple comes from Balaghat and has got the GI for its sweetness that comes from the Total Soluble Sugar (TSS) value which is more than the apples found in UK and US. This apple grows on rocks. The specialty about the Beed custard apple is that it grows even in rocky, water less areas as that is the suitable atmosphere to grow them.Jalana sweet oranges stands out from the other oranges because of their size, sweetness and juice content. They are also one of the most important crops for farmers from the area.Jalgaon Bharit Brinjal that grows in parts of north Maharashtra that shares its border with Gujarat is a natural gift the production of which was started by an old tribal community. The brinjal is now one of the dishes served in German airlines especially Lufthansa. The seeds of this brinjal ooze oil while cooking which adds a particular taste to the dish that makes it different from the rest.Waigaon turmeric grown in a small village of district Wardha is rich in curcumine content. A high curcumine content of 6.24 was found in a report presented by the Spice Board of India. It is the curcumine content that gives medicinal qualities to turmeric. This also renders it useful for treating cancer and to be used as a direct food supplement. The standard curcumine content in turmeric is 2-4 and anything over 6 is considered good for the product to be used as a direct food supplement.Solapur pomegranate contain more anti-oxidants than other pomegranates. These anti-oxidants help in fighting cancer causing agents in the body.The Saswad Purandar fig stands out for its size, colour, taste and high iron content. Moreover it grows on red soil, which adds to the natural benefits that can be reaped from it.The golden green coloured uniform sized Sangli raisin melts into the mouth and has less wrinkles on its outside, adding to the taste."

We have decided to procure the surplus products and supply it to the states hit by the drought. This policy will help both the stakeholders such as the states having surplus production and those who require foodgrain,"" Paswan told the media after a Lok Jan Shakti Party workers' meeting.He said the Union government has decided to supply 5 lakh tonnes of rice and wheat to Maharashtra to tide over the drought. ""It is expected from the state governments to lift the quota by October this year in phases and supply it to the needy people through the public distribution system (PDS). Recently, Maharashtra has started lifting the quota,"" he said.Paswan said the NDA government, under Modi, ""has effectively implemented the Food Security Act in the last two years"". he said, ""We have progressed on six parameters. We have blocked 1.62 crore forged ration card holders, have increased the number of states implementing the act from 11 to 33, have brought the ration cards online and have installed GPS to track vehicles carrying food grains for PDS. We have effectively linked the system with Aadhar cards and have minimised the corruption in PDS.""Buffer stock of pulses: Paswan said in the wake of the row over rise in prices of pulses, especially 'tur', the union government has decided to create a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes. ""We have so far created a stock of around 1.25 lakh tonnes. It will be doubled in near future. This year, we will have stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes. I have asked the state governments to make sure that the price of tur dal does not exceed Rs 120 a kg. It is not only the Centre's responsibility to keep a tab on 'tur' dal price. The states should also have to take action against hoarders"" he said.India has an annual demand of 246 lakh tonnes of pulses, while its domestic production is 170 lakh tonnes. To meet the shortfall of 76 lakh tonnes, the country imports pluses from international market.""The gap between the demand and supply creates the problem. But it can be tackled by close monitoring and action against the hoarders, creating a buffer stock and ensuring timely import,"" minister said."

Since the bagasse comes from sugarcane supplied by farmers, the farmers should get a share of the income from sale of power.Shetti raised the demand during a meeting of the sugarcane price control board in Pune on Saturday. He said, ""Currently, sugar mills are paying sugarcane purchase price to farmers, when the latter has rights on the mill's earnings from other byproducts as well. For a farmer, his crop is most important and it engages the farm for almost one-and-a-half years. If mills cannot pay a higher sugarcane purchase price then they should share with farmers the income received through molasses, cogeneration and other byproducts.""Bagasse is made into blocks for combustion in thermal power generation units. This power is purchased by the state power utility as a policy to support farmers.The representatives of sugar mills in the sugarcane price control board have not yet commented on the demand.While most of the cogeneration projects are concentrated in western Maharashtra, there have been many cases from the same region of non-payment to farmers by mills."

The inquiry is expected to complete in a fortnight, said MPCB officials.The Panchganga basin has eight sugar mills and four distillery units, and each factory has different sugarcane capacity. Every year, factories apply to the MPCB for permission to crush specific quantity of sugarcane each day. The quantity of pollutants generated during sugar production is proportionate to the crushing capacity.Chokalingam has instructed the MPCB officials to review the compliance of factories which were under scanner for their pollution record... The officials must visit, review the status and take stern action if the factories are failing to curb pollution. Earlier, the MPCB had forfeited bank guarantees of a few factories. Now, the officers must check whether these factories are again engaged in pollution. If so, cases under the pollution act have to be registered against them, Chokalingam told the officials.He has also advised the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the Ichalkaranji Municipal Council to complete the sewage treatment plants at the earliest. ""The civic bodies have to complete the task on a war-footing. Instead of releasing treated water in Panchganga River, the civic bodies must convince farmers in the areas to use the water for agriculture,"" Chokalingam said.The divisional commissioner also asked the officials from the MPCB and the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation to survey sewage treatment plants of Gokul Shirgaon and Shiroli MIDC areas. Besides, he has asked the district administration to review the status of the treatment plant at Chhatrapati Pramila Raje civic hospital and suggested to register every doctor in the district for medical waste treatment facility.Uday Gaikwad, environment activist, welcomed the instructions from the divisional commissioner to curb pollution. However, he raised doubts about effective implementation. ""Considering past actions, I am sceptical about the outcome of these instructions. Earlier, the MPCB closed a couple of sugar factories in the basin over pollution issue. The factories then went to higher authorities of the MPCB and regained permissions. If this practice continued, the instructions will remain on the paper,"" he said.The KMC is yet to commence operation of the Kasba Bavda sewage treatment plan to its full capacity to treat 76 million litres of waste water per day. The plant is operating at 70% of its capacity. Besides, the Dudhali plant to treat around 20 million litres of water is not yet completed. The civic body has to link 12 'nullahs' to arrest the sewage water from reaching the river. These three crucial projects are progressing at a snail's pace for the past four years."

The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and the President of the United States of America Barack Obama met today in the White House during an official working visit of Prime Minister Modi to the United States. Marking their third major bilateral summit, the leaders reviewed the deepening strategic partnership between the United States and India that is rooted in shared values of freedom, democracy, universal human rights, tolerance and pluralism, equal opportunities for all citizens, and rule of law. They pledged to pursue new opportunities to bolster economic growth and sustainable development, promote peace and security at home and around the world, strengthen inclusive, democratic governance and respect for universal human rights, and provide global leadership on issues of shared interest.2. The leaders welcomed the significant progress made in bilateral relations between India and the United States during their tenure, in accordance with the roadmaps set out in the Joint Statements issued during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the United States in September 2014 and President Obama's visit to India in January 2015. The leaders affirmed the increasing convergence in their strategic perspectives and emphasized the need to remain closely invested in each other's security and prosperity.3. The steps that the two Governments have taken in the last two years through the US-India Contact Group, including by addressing the nuclear liability issue, inter alia, through India's ratification of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, have laid a strong foundation for a long-term partnership between US and Indian companies for building nuclear power plants in India. Culminating a decade of partnership on civil nuclear issues, the leaders welcomed the start of preparatory work on site in India for six AP 1000 reactors to be built by Westinghouse and noted the intention of India and the US Export-Import Bank to work together toward a competitive financing package for the project. Once completed, the project would be among the largest of its kind, fulfilling the promise of the US-India civil nuclear agreement and demonstrating a shared commitment to meet India's growing energy needs while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Both sides welcomed the announcement by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd, and Westinghouse that engineering and site design work will begin immediately and the two sides will work toward finalizing the contractual arrangements by June 2017.4. The United States and India share common climate and clean energy interests and are close partners in the fight against climate change. Leadership from both countries helped galvanize global action to combat climate change and culminated in the historic Paris Agreement reached last December. Both countries are committed to working together and with others to promote full implementation of the Paris Agreement to address the urgent threats posed by climate change. India and the United States recognize the urgency of climate change and share the goal of enabling entry into force of the Paris Agreement as early as possible. The United States reaffirms its commitment to join the Agreement as soon as possible this year. India similarly has begun its processes to work toward this shared objective. The leaders reiterated their commitment to pursue low greenhouse gas emission development strategies in the pre-2020 period and to develop long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. In addition, the two countries resolved to work to adopt an HFC amendment in 2016 with increased financial support from donor countries to the Multilateral Fund to help developing countries with implementation, and an ambitious phasedown schedule, under the Montreal Protocol pursuant to the Dubai Pathway. The leaders resolved to work together at the upcoming International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly to reach a successful outcome to address greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation. Further, the two countries will pursue under the leadership of the G20 strong outcomes to promote improved heavy-duty vehicle standards and efficiency in accordance with their national priorities and capabilities.5. The leaders welcomed the signing of an MOU to Enhance Cooperation on Energy Security, Clean Energy and Climate Change, and an MOU on Cooperation in Gas Hydrates.6. Reflecting Prime Minister Modi's call to embrace wildlife conservation as a development imperative, the leaders welcomed the signing of an MOU to enhance cooperation on Wildlife Conservation and Combating Wildlife Trafficking.7. The United States supports the Government of India's ambitious national goals to install 175 GW of renewable power which includes 100 GW from solar power.8. The United States welcomes the launch of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), recognizes the critical role it can play in the development and deployment of solar power, and intends pursuing membership in the ISA. To this end, and to strengthen ISA together, the United States and India will jointly launch the third Initiative of the ISA which will focus on off-grid solar for energy access at the Founding Conference of ISA in September, 2016 in India. The United States also remains committed, with other developed countries, to the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation and adaptation action.9. The United States is committed to bring to bear its technical capacity, resources and private sector, and is jointly launching with India new efforts, to spur greater investment in India's renewable energy sector, including efforts that can serve as a model for other ISA Member Countries. In particular, the United States and India today are announcing: the creation of a $20 million US-India Clean Energy Finance (USICEF) initiative, equally supported by the United States and India, which is expected to mobilize up to $400 million to provide clean and renewable electricity to up to 1 million households by 2020; a commitment to establish the US-India Clean Energy Hub as the coordinating mechanism to focus United States Government efforts that, in partnership with leading Indian financial institutions, will increase renewable energy investment in India; a $40 million US-India Catalytic Solar Finance Program, equally supported by the United States and India, that, by providing needed liquidity to smaller-scale renewable energy investments, particularly in poorer, rural villages that are not connected to the grid, could mobilize up to $1 billion of projects; the expansion of handholding support to Indian utilities that are scaling up rooftop solar and continuation of successful cooperation with USAID on ""Greening the Grid"".10. The United States and India also remain committed to the goals of Mission Innovation, which they jointly launched during COP-21 in Paris to double their respective clean energy research and development (R&D) investment in five years. Toward this end, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate on research and development, including through the announcement of an upcoming $30 million public-private research effort in smart grid and grid storage.11. The President thanked the Prime Minister for his substantive contribution to and active participation in 2016 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, DC, and welcomed his offer to host a Summit on Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism in 2018. The United States and India will work together to combat the threat of terrorists accessing and using chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological materials.12. Recalling their shared commitment to preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, the leaders looked forward to India's imminent entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime. President Obama welcomed India's application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and re-affirmed that India is ready for membership. The United States called on NSG Participating Governments to support India's application when it comes up at the NSG Plenary later this month. The United States also re-affirmed its support for India's early membership of the Australia Group and Wassenaar Arrangement.13. The leaders applauded the completion of a roadmap for cooperation under the 2015 U.S.-India Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region, which will serve as a guide for collaboration in the years to come. They resolved that the United States and India should look to each other as priority partners in the Asia Pacific and the Indian Ocean region.14. They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the Maritime Security Dialogue. Owing to mutual interest in maritime security and maritime domain awareness, the leaders welcomed the conclusion of a technical arrangement for sharing of maritime ""White Shipping"" information.15. The leaders affirmed their support for US-India cooperation in promoting maritime security. They reiterated the importance they attach to ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight and exploitation of resources as per international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and settlement of territorial disputes by peaceful means.16. The leaders applauded the enhanced military to military cooperation between the two countries especially in joint exercises, training and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR). They expressed their desire to explore agreements which would facilitate further expansion of bilateral defense cooperation in practical ways. In this regard, they welcomed the finalization of the text of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA).17. Noting that the US-India defense relationship can be an anchor of stability, and given the increasingly strengthened cooperation in defense, the United States hereby recognizes India as a Major Defense Partner. As such:*The United States will continue to work toward facilitating technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. The leaders reached an understanding under which India would receive license-free access to a wide range of dual-use technologies in conjunction with steps that India has committed to take to advance its export control objectives.*In support of India's Make In India initiative, and to support the development of robust defense industries and their integration into the global supply chain, the United States will continue to facilitate the export of goods and technologies, consistent with U.S. law, for projects, programs and joint ventures in support of official US-India defense cooperation.18. The leaders also committed to enhance cooperation in support of the Government of India's Make in India Initiative and expand the co-production and co-development of technologies under the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). They welcomed the establishment of new DTTI working groups to include agreed items covering Naval Systems, Air Systems, and other Weapons Systems. The leaders announced the finalization of the text of an Information Exchange Annex under the Joint Working Group on Aircraft Carrier Technology Cooperation.19. President Obama thanked Prime Minister Modi for his government's support for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) missions in India, including a recovery mission that resulted in the recent repatriation of remains of the United States Service Members missing since the Second World War. The leaders announced their commitment to future DPAA? missions.20. As space faring nations, India and the United States acknowledge that outer space should be an ever expanding frontier of human endeavour, and look forward to deepening their cooperation on earth observation, Mars exploration, space education and manned space flight. The leaders welcomed the progress toward establishment of an ISRO-NASA Heliophysics Working Group as well as toward finalization of a Memorandum of Understanding for exchange of earth observation satellite data.21. The leaders emphasized that cyberspace enables economic growth and development, and reaffirmed their commitment to an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet, underpinned by the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. They committed to deepen cooperation on cybersecurity and welcomed the understanding reached to finalize the Framework for the US-India Cyber Relationship in the near term. They committed to enhance cyber collaboration on critical infrastructure, cybercrime, and malicious cyber activity by state and non-state actors, capacity building, and cybersecurity research and development, and to continue discussions on all aspects of trade in technology and related services, including market access. They have committed to continue dialogue and engagement in Internet governance fora, including in ICANN, IGF and other venues, and to support active participation by all stakeholders of the two countries in these fora. The leaders committed to promote stability in cyberspace based on the applicability of international law including the United Nations Charter, the promotion of voluntary norms of responsible state behavior during peacetime, and the development and implementation of practical confidence building measures between states.22. In this context, they affirmed their commitment to the voluntary norms that no country should conduct or knowingly support online activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use of it to provide services to the public; that no country should conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national computer security incident response teams from responding to cyber incidents, or use its own teams to enable online activity that is intended to do harm; that every country should cooperate, consistent with its domestic law and international obligations, with requests for assistance from other states in mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from its territory; and that no country should conduct or knowingly support ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors.23. The leaders acknowledged the continued threat posed to human civilization by terrorism and condemn the recent terrorist incidents from Paris to Pathankot, from Brussels to Kabul. They resolved to redouble their efforts, bilaterally and with other like-minded countries, to bring to justice the perpetrators of terrorism anywhere in the world and the infrastructure that supports them.24. Building on the January 2015 US-India Joint Statement commitment to make the US-India partnership a defining counterterrorism relationship for the 21st Century, as well as the September 2015 US-India Joint Declaration on Combatting Terrorism, the leaders announced further steps to deepen collaboration against the full spectrum of terrorist threats.25. The leaders committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from extremist groups, such as Al-Qa'ida, Da'esh/ISIL, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, D Company and their affiliates, including through deepened collaboration on UN terrorist designations. In this context, they directed their officials to identify specific new areas of collaboration at the next meeting of US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group.26. Recognizing an important milestone in the US-India counterterrorism partnership, the leaders applauded the finalization of an arrangement to facilitate the sharing of terrorist screening information. They also called for Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks to justice.27.

58f606c47be9e031f13ad3ef,Maha should allow GM trials of all crops,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Maha-should-allow-GM-trials-of-all-crops/articleshow/52645085.cms,2016-06-08,"Nagpur: Biotechnology is the future of agriculture, especially drought-resistant GM crops. Hence, Maharashtra government should lift the moratorium on conducting trials of all genetically modified (GM) crops in the state. Such bans or restrictions in conducting research trials will only push the agriculture sector backwards rather than taking it forward.These were the observations by CD Mayee, former chairman of the Agriculture Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB). Mayee was speaking to reporters at a programme organized by the Association of Biotechnology-led Enterprises  Agriculture Focus Group (Able-AG) in city on Tuesday on the importance of increasing productivity and profitability of oilseed and pulses.""Indian agriculture is at the cross roads and there is strong need to improve the stagnating yields of all crops,"" Mayee said.""India imports pulses costing Rs30,000 crore and oil costing Rs90,000 crore, the highest imported items after gold and petroleum. Vidarbha has a high potential for pulses and oilseed crops. Andhra Pradesh allowed the Bt chickpea trials. But Maharashtra didn't. It is sad that this is despite the Kakodkar committee recommendations,"" he said. Mayee admitted that GM crops alone cannot be an answer to all problems in agriculture. But an adequate mix of all types of technologies, including organic, can minimize the agrarian distress.In India, 16 types of trials are on in different crops including cotton, rice (drought tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency), brinjal, sugar cane (drought tolerance), Bt chickpea and maize. ""Farmer wants technology, be it Swadeshi or foreign. If Swadeshi technology is available, it is always welcome but that doesn't mean that foreign technologies should be restricted,"" said Mayee.The Able-AG executive director Shivendra Bajaj, speaking on the proposed fields trials in Maharashtra and barriers in the way of introduction of agricultural technology in the state, said that GM technology was always a supporting technology and definitely not the only solution for all the problems in the agriculture sector. But he stressed on the need for openness in allowing research and development by the states. ""There is no issue of safety so for in any of the GM crops. GM technology is commercialized only after rigorous trials. Concerns of the general public and scientists can be addressed only through discussion and not banning trials,"" he said.Two progressive farmers from Yavatmal district, Vijay Niwal and Vasant Kale, also voiced the need for newer technologies for improving agriculture as they didn't see any future in conventional methods of farming. ""Every technology has some limitations, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be tried. We want solutions to our problems. Whether they come from home or abroad is immaterial to us. Younger generation would never take up agriculture unless it is technology based,"" said Niwal, who is surviving on Bt cotton since 2003."

59284fa57be9e0137c77cc1c,The rise and fall of Ram Briksh Yadav,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/551813/rise-fall-ram-briksh-yadav.html,2016-06-12,"Sagar Kulkarni, June 12, 2016 0:17 ISTOn a cold winter morning in January 2014, a lanky, bearded man with a band of supporters knocked on the doors of a monastery set up by his late mentor Baba Jai Gurudev off NH-2 near Mathura.Ram Briksh Yadav, who ranked among Babas favourite disciples, was keen to have his fair share in the monasteryJai Gurudev Ashramthat had properties to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore spread across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Ram Brikshs spiritual master passed away in May 2012 after handing over the keys of the empire to his driver Pankaj Yadav. Another claimant to the Babas legacy, Umakant Tiwari, too, had fallen out of favour and parted ways a couple of months before the Babas death. Tiwari set up his own Ashram in Madhya Pradesh.Left with nothing, Ram Briksh was trying his luck on the January morning to get a toe hold in the ashrams sprawling campus near Mathura. After a standoff with the inmates, the district administration directed them to Jawahar Bagh, which was then the designated spot for protests, given its proximity to the collectorate. Little did the administration know that Ram Briksh, who had around 30 supporters then, would gain thousands of followers and convert the 280-acre Jawahar Bagh as his fiefdom with blessings from the powers that be.The unsuspecting public, mostly from his native eastern Uttar Pradesh, were lured by the propaganda of establishing a Azad Hind Sarkar that would ensure a square meal for every citizen and make available essential commodities at very low rates. To entice the locals, Ram Briksh even sold sugar at a highly-subsidised rate of Rs 20 per kg and vegetables at Rs 5 per kg. The stunt worked as people from neighbouring coloniesmostly comprising government servantsthronged Jawahar Bagh.Invoking the legacy of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Ram Briksh gathered a sizable following over the next few months. He formed the Azad Bharat Vidhik Vaicharik Kranti Satyagrahi, an organisation whose followers called themselves the Swadhin Bharat Subhas Sena. Their major goals were establishing the Azad Hind Sarkar with Netaji as the first citizen and a Azad Hind currency, instead of the rupee. Initially, there were a few huts, but as the followers increased, Ram Briksh established his own parallel administration complete with arms training camps and a justice delivery system, said Vijay Singh, an engineering student in the Jail Colony next to Jawahar Bagh.Luring debt-riddenAccording to the police, most of the inmatesthere were nearly 3,000 of them at the time of eviction on June 2were from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Many of them were in deep debts due to a bad harvest and the assurance of food and other essentials lured them to Jawahar Bagh. But they soon realised the going was not easy. Once inside Jawahar Bagh, the inmates could go out depending on the wishes of Ram Briksh and only after leaving behind a family member as ransom.For the residents of the surrounding colonies, the daily sermons by Ram Briksh over the public address system became a headache. The allurement of cheap sugar and vegetables was soon replaced with regular argument with the inmates, their leader often charging at the locals menacingly surrounded by lathi-wielding followers. Soon, they had the sprawling 280-acre orchard under their control and the favourite morning walk destination of the locals saw children of inmates being trained in warfare and parades by arms-wielding men on roads leading to the settlement.Surprisingly, these poor people had very affluent friends. We saw people coming in fancy cars and SUVs to meet Ram Briksh, said Vijay Sharma, a government employee residing in one of the colonies surrounding Jawahar Bagh. But as friction with the locals increased, the former president of the Mathura Bar Association, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, got an eviction order from the Allahabad High Court.The local intelligence unit sent reports to Lucknow about arms training inside Jawahar Bagh and the possibility of links with the Maoists. But the administration was not particularly tough against the squatters, prompting accusations against the Samajwadi Party government of shielding them. The proverbial last straw was the attack on the Horticulture Department employees residing inside Jawahar Bagh in the middle of March. Their strong protests spurred the district administration into action. Already under pressure from the Allahabad High Court, the state government also fell in line.The end, however, was ugly. After adequate warnings to Ram Briksh, the district administration finalised June 3 for forcible eviction. A day earlier, SP (City) Mukul Dwivedi, along with Station Officer Santosh Yadav, visited the area to carry out a rehearsal of the action planned for the next day. As they approached Jawahar Bagh, Ram Brikshs followers showered bullets and stones at the police. Dwivedi, who was injured in the stone throwing, was lynched by Ram Brikshs followers, while Santosh Yadav suffered a fatal bullet injury. In the police firing that followed, 27 people were killed, including Ram Briksh."

On top of it, this is 'Mahar vatan' land, which cannot be transferred without the government's permission, which in this case was not taken,"" Sawant alleged.'Watan' lands are 'inam' (gift from a ruler to a subject) for service. The term is generally used in a wider sense to denote any alienation in land with or without service.NCP MLC Kiran Pawaskar said the Congress should instead move court against Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for ""shielding"" Mahajan.""This is not the first time Mahajan has been accused of indulging in wrongdoings. Firstly, he has violated his oath that he took before becoming a minister by keeping illegal property in his name. Also, he is a habitual offender. There was no action taken against him when he had once carried a revolver while visiting students in school,"" he said.Pawaskar said that Mahajan has no right to continue as minister.""Such a person has no right to be a minister. Either the CM takes immediate action against him or the Congress, instead of approaching the court against Mahajan, should instead do so against Fadnavis for shielding and not taking action against his errant minister,"" Pawaskar said.When contacted for his reaction, Mahajan merely said that he could not recall clearly whether he had purchased any such land.Khadse had resigned recently over allegations of graft and conflict of interest in the purchase of land in Pune district in name of his kin."

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

(Source: Express photo by Vasant Prabhu/ file) Records also show that while the land was bought for starting the factory, the companys directors, including Khadses kin and Mahajan, purchased about 46 acres in individual capacity. (Source: Express photo by Vasant Prabhu/ file)A land deal he entered into jointly with tainted BJP leader Eknath Khadses kin 15 years ago has landed senior Maharashtra BJP minister Girish Mahajan in trouble, with the Opposition seeking his resignation for concealing the deal in his election affidavit, and cornering land at the expense of poor farmers.Mahajan, who holds the water resources portfolio in the Devendra Fadnavis government, allegedly purchased a five-acre land in Manpur village in North Maharashtras Jalgaon on January 1, 2002, for a declared price of Rs 1.11 lakh. Documents reveal the land was one among eight land parcels totalling 86 acre bought in the garb of setting up a private sugar factory proposed by Eknath Khadse-promoted Tapi Purna Sugar Factory Ltd. But the sugar factory was never built.Records also show that while the land purchase was made for starting the sugar factory, the companys directors including Khadses kin and Mahajan purchased about 46 acre land in an individual capacity.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe main trouble for Mahajan stems from concealing details of the five-acre plot bought in his name in the election affidavits he filed in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Mahajan admits this mistake. All this time, I was under the impression that the land was purchased in the companys name. I have not even seen the land nor have I earned any income from it, said Mahajan.The Congress Wednesday demanded that the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis act against him for this non-disclosure but the water resources minister appeared to pass the buck to Khadse. He is the companys chief promoter. The board under him finalised the land deal and made the purchases. It was the company that paid the consideration value for the purchase, Mahajan said.Both Khadse and Mahajan hail from Jalgaon. The latter is now seen as Khadses arch-rival. In fact, after Khadse lost his chair in the Maharashtra government over impropriety in another land deal, Mahajan is seen as Jalgaons powerhouse.Congress leader Sachin Sawant mounted an offensive claiming land records suggest the land purchased in Mahajans name was originally co-owned by members of the Mahar community, a scheduled caste. While Sawant raised allegations it was Mahar Watan land, which cannot be bought under norms, Mahajan denied the allegation. I have reconfirmed with revenue authorities. It is not a Mahar Watan land.Activist Anjali Damania, who first blew the lid off the dubious land deal, reiterated Sawants allegations claiming she had interacted with the original owners who feel victimised. Sawant also alleged that the land was cornered at concessional rate using lure of employment in the sugar factory. Damania, who claimed Khadse had a bigger role to play in the land deal, alleged that purchasing land from farmers when the sugar factory was not even registered with the Sugar Commissionerate indicates its dubiousness further.On July 3, 2010, Shankar Patil, an original land owner, had obtained information under the Right to Information Act from the Sugar Commissionerate that the factory wasnt yet registered. The entire motive was to corner the plot, Damania alleged.The activist claimed land owners were coerced into surrendering their land, an allegation Mahajan denied. The land owners sold the plot voluntarily, Mahajan said.Khadse, meanwhile, has been refuting all allegations against him as baseless.Mahajan shared some light on how the company, which also has other BJP leaders including MP Haribhau Jawale and Maharashtra legislator Gurumukh Jagwani as shareholders, was formed following the Centres policy to boost ethanol production in 2001. All of us contributed Rs 10,000 to begin with, Mahajan said, while admitting that the plans never materialised.Some land owners claimed they were forced to sign sale agreements. Damania also showed a public notice published on May 10, 2001 where Eknath Khadse, in his capacity as the companys chief promoter, had unilaterally declared that the companys board of directors had decided to purchase the eight land parcels.In another bid to corner the BJP on dubious land deals, the Congress alleged wrongdoing in a land allegedly purchased by BJP state president Raosaheb Danve and his family in Bhokardan in Jalna. Danve claimed the land deal was entered into by his father over three decades ago, and had followed all legal formalities. But Sawant demanded probe. Danve accused the Opposition of playing politics and raising baseless allegations. An insider in the BJP, accusing the Opposition of raking up baseless matters, conceded that the controversial land deals involving BJP leaders had dented the party image in the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5941a38c7be9e0192d33ae4c,Agriculture Reform: Breaking the trader cartel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agriculture-reform-breaking-the-trader-cartel-2855435/,2016-06-16,"The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview.

Patil is likely to file an election petition against Mahajan for violation of the Representation of People Act.Patil lost the 2014 assembly polls from Jamner to Mahajan, who has represented the seat since 1995. Mahajan polled 1.03 lakh votes while Patil managed 67,730.In his letter to the ec, Patil submitted that despite Mahajan owning five acres of land in Manpur village of Jamner since 2002, he did not disclose it before the Jalgaon collector, who was the returning officer.""As per the provisions of the Representation of People Act, it is binding on all contesting candidates to disclose movable and immovable property before the returning officer. In fact, they have to submit the information on oath. In case of Mahajan, it was found that he failed to submit information on ownership of land,"" Patil said in his three-page complaint to the EC and Jalgaon Collector.Patil said that since Mahajan is an influential politician and a cabinet member, the possibility of destroying crucial documents could not be ruled out and the Jalgaon police should immediately register an offence against him for violation of the Representation of People Act.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik demanded Mahajan's dismissal from the cabinet for his alleged involvement in a land scam. ""Prima facie, it appears that Mahajan has misled farmers. They were told that the land is being acquired for a cooperative sugar factory and they will be offered jobs. A decade and half later, neither the sugar factory has been set up nor have jobs given to farmers whose land was acquired,"" Malik said."

Sugar prices have soared 47% since last September. Interestingly, scrips of leading sugar companies touched their 52-week high only on June 13.Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals Ltd and Rana Sugars Ltd led the list of gainers with their scrips surging 19.2% and 19.9% respectively. The counters of sugar companies also saw a spurt in volumes.More than 1 crore shares of Rana Sugars were traded on the BSE on Thursday compared to the two-week average trading volume of 5.85 lakh shares. While more than 15 lakh shares of Rajshree Sugars were traded compared to the two-week average of about 1.2 lakh shares, 18 lakh shares of Sakthi Sugars Ltd changed hands on Thursday compared to the fortnightly average of about 4 lakh shares.Stocks of frontline sugar companies such as Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar Ltd, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd and E.I.D-Parry (India), which hit their 52-week highs on June 13, however, closed the day lower on profit booking. Incidentally, sugar firms saw their stock prices plunge to their 52-week lows only in August-September. The Bannari Amman Sugars scrip has more than trebled in value since touching its 52-week low on September 8. While the Bajaj Hindusthan stock has more than doubled from its yearly low hit on August 25, the Simbhaoli Sugars scrip has trebled in value from its 52-week low touched on September 29.With the government notifying mandatory exports, sugar prices started improving  from 25,500 per tonne in September last year to around 37,500 per tonne now. Sugar prices stood at nearly 35,500 per tonne in May. Prices have been on a strong uptrend in anticipation of stock clearance backed by exports and lower production in Maharashtra, the largest producer of the commodity.Surplus domestic production and limited exports resulted in a steep decline in sugar prices, which hit a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne in July last year. This prompted the Centre to notify minimum indicative export quota (MIEQ) for sugar mills to export 4 million tonnes of sugar during the 2015-16 season (October-September)."

The issue echoed in the national executive meeting of the BJP held in Allahabad last week and national president of BJP Amit Shah described it as a serious communal matter that endangered the identity of Hindus in the region. The BJP has threatened to take up this issue in the 2017 assembly elections.State government has already described the BJP claims as baseless and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav warned the BJP against spreading canard and communal passions. The GOI report underlining the fact could be one of the reasons behind the U-turn by BJP leadership on the issue.The decade-long survey exposed that rise in migration has been mainly because of economic backwardness and awareness of education and jobs in other parts. The Census of India conducts the surveys on migration patterns too along with reasons and it has found that compared to the 1991 census, migration of rural population in western UP to urban areas increased in the 2001 census while the latest data of 2011 have yet to be released.Compared to western UP, rural-to-urban migration has either been static or decreased marginally in the central region, Bundelkhand and the eastern region of the state too during the same period.The report mentions that most of the western UP districts including Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Saharanpur, Aligarh and parts of the NCR have registered economic boom in the last 20 years so people from rural areas shifted to cities leading to an increase in the migration of the rural population to urban areas."" Prices of land in Gurgaon and Noida are no less than in Delhi and Mumbai and a good number of people have sold their lands in Kairana, Shamli, Saharanpur and shifted to other and better destinations, said a senior officer in the Census department in Lucknow, adding that migration has taken place in Bihar, Rajasthan , Punjab and Kerala and Andhra Pradesh too, so why the fuss over western UP.""The BJP is playing a dangerous game. Its ministers and government authorities are well aware of the fact that migration is a natural phenomenon world over in the wake of economic reforms and transformation. It has increased in the western UP also because the land holdings are getting smaller there like elsewhere and escalating farmland crisis is forcing farmers to opt for non-farm sector options to earn livelihood. Where is the apsect of communalism in this,"" said former director of Giri Institute of Social Studies , speaking to the ToI. A former principal secretary in planning department shared with the ToI that recent decline in sugar prices and khandsari prices, tax holiday in adjoining Uttarakhand and closure of a number of steel units has led to migration of the people ."

Party senior leaders Yendala Lakshminarayana, Loka Bhoopathi Reddy, Palle Ganga Reddy, Venkataramani, Muralidhar Goud and a galaxy of activists gave him a rousing reception at the district party office.Mr. Dattatreya felt that if political parties and governments kept aside politics and worked together, the welfare schemes would become successful. With the PM Fasal Bima Yojana, a large section of farmers would benefit as it drastically reduces the premium amount from 15 per cent to just 2 per cent in kharif and 1.5 per cent in rabi, he said.Claiming that there was an unprecedented change in governance in the last two years, he said that Mr. Narendra Modi built a scandal-free India for the first time. There were no scandals while development was fast and full during the BJP rule, he said. The recent ILO meeting attended by the representatives from all countries was in praise of the fastest economic growth rate in India and also the good governance, he added.He promised to talk to the State Labour Minister Nayini Narsimha Reddy and also the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, on reopening of the Nizam Sugar Factory at Bodhan and also payment of arrears to cane farmers and factory workers. He expressed his sympathies to the plight of both the communities. In a reply to a question, Mr. Dattatreya said that defections in the State were unethical and undemocratic. They were not good in a newly-formed State, he said."
58f5c38c7be9e01a357a6f14,Just 15% water left in 91 major reservoirs,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Just-15-water-left-in-91-major-reservoirs/articleshow/52803420.cms,2016-06-18,"NEW DELHI: The slow progress of the monsoon has meant water storage in 91 major reservoirs has dipped further and overall availability stands at just 15% of capacity. This has not only hit initial kharif sowing but also availability of drinking water.Though the area under kharif will increase once rains sweep the entire country over the next few weeks, the current water shortages have shrunk the total area under rice, pulses, oilseeds and other crops, except sugarcane. As on Friday, the sown area under kharif crops was 10% less than that in the same period last year.Water levels in key reservoirs dipped from 26.81 billion cubic metres on May 26, to 23.78 BCM on June 16.With water levels in key reservoirs already at worrying levels, the situation could turn desperate if the monsoon fails to pick up in the next four-five days.Reservoirs in south India are the worst affected. Central Water Commission figures, released on Friday, show that water availability in 31 reservoirs in the south was 4.86 BCM on June 16  just 9% of capacity.Comparatively, the situation in the north is much better with water levels in the region's six major reservoirs at 23% of capacity.Of the 91 big reservoirs monitored by the CWC, 27 are in the west, 15 in east and 12 in central India.Besides supplying drinking water to many cities and providing water for irrigation, 37 of these 91 reservoirs have hydropower facilities with installed capacities of more than 60 MW.The total kharif sown area stood at 84.21 lakh hectares on Friday as compared to 93.63 lakh hectares at the same point last year. Surprisingly, the sown area under water-guzzling sugarcane as on June 17 was higher than its acreage last year  signaling farmers' preference for the crop that invariably gives better returns than pulses and oilseeds. In fact, sugarcane has already occupied more than 50% of the total sown area.The NDA government's move to substantially reduce the dues of sugarcane farmers in the past two years also seems to have played a role in tilting the cropping pattern in favour of sugarcane. About 87% of the dues have already been paid for the 2015-16 season, indicating how the crop remains remunerative despite delays in payment by sugar units.The country had recorded monsoon deficits of 12% and 14% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Though it is normal for water bodies to deplete sharply in the pre-monsoon summer months, the CWC has been keeping a close watch on the storage in these reservoirs so that the available water can be distributed properly till the arrival of monsoon.Most of these reservoirs get water during the June-September southwest monsoon, while reservoirs in Tamil Nadu get water during the October-December northeast monsoon.Reservoirs being monitored by CWC include Gobind Sagar (Bhakra) and Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, Thein in Punjab, Rana Pratap Sagar in Rajasthan, Panchet Hill in Jharkhand, Hirakud and upper Indravati in Odisha, Ukai and Sardar Sarovar in Gujarat, Koyana and upper Vaitarna in Maharashtra etc."

BJP state president Raosaheb Danve will preside over the session at Balgandharva Rangmandir. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, minister of state for environment Prakash Javadekar will address the executive on Sunday.The meeting assumes importance as several BJP ministers have been mired in controversies. Notably, Eknath Khadse, former revenue minister, had to resign from the cabinet for his alleged involvement in purchasing MIDC land in the name of his family members. Controversy is raging over Girish Mahajan for allegedly ""forcibly"" buying a piece of land in 2002 to set up a sugar mill, a transaction not mentioned in his election affidavit.The opposition has also raised objections on guardian minister Girish Bapat's role in a dal scam. State BJP president Raosaheb Danve and minister of state for home Ranjeet Patil are being targeted for their alleged involvement in land transactions.

The same NDA has set an ambitious target of exporting 4 million tonnes in September last year giving a major fillip to the industry that was in the slump for the past few years.Last week, the Finance Ministry had said that the governments decision to tax export of raw, refined and white sugar exports is being done to keep domestic prices of sugar in check. This may have been a pre-emptive measure as production of sugarcane is expected to be lower than the previous year of 28 million tonnes.#Sugar #exports unviable after imposition of 20% duty: ISMA https://t.co/m5ULtGNzYJ pic.twitter.com/k0R1FbyASl  EconomicTimes (@EconomicTimes) June 17, 2016The question is if the government knew that production of sugar will take a hit as early as August last year, then why try to incentivise exports? Some states governments like Maharashtra went a step further by giving sugar mills a 3 per cent tax rebate if they could export 12 per cent of their output in the period from October 2015-September 2016. The central government then set an export target of 4 million tonnes, only to impose a 20% tax on it a few months later.Plan to levy tax could hit 75,000 tonnes sugar exports: Official https://t.co/lGY8AqVJSZ pic.twitter.com/qdxbS4RU3N  ET Economy News (@ETEconomyNews) June 10, 2016This comes as a double whammy for sugar mills. Unlike other crops, sugarcane is politically sensitive. Vested interests ensure that the Minimum Support Price is always kept high irrespective of the prevailing prices. As per Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) data, planting of sugarcane has gone up from 4,175,000 hectares to 5,307,000 hectares while production increased from 2,923 lakh tonne to 3,668 lakh tonne in the past 6 years. This means that cost of production for mill owners has kept increasing over the years due to MSP and more sowing of sugarcane, but prices have remained low.Sugarcane arrears down at Rs 6,225 crore https://t.co/wW8ESqrZRq pic.twitter.com/1FlfPSdyg2  moneycontrol (@moneycontrolcom) June 8, 2016If the tax was not levied on sugar companies, they could have wiped out losses of previous years with an export target of 4 million tonnes. It would have resulted in bringing down the cane arrears of farmers which stand at Rs 6,225 crore. This will have direct, adverse consequences on the farmer- the lowest rung in the food chain. As losses generally mount for sugar companies, so do the arrears to farmers. In their attempt to protect the consumer, the government seems to have given up on protecting the interest of the farmers."
58fedd467be9e0420db28ae0,"Camps keep cattle alive with water, fodder & free lunches for owners",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160621/jsp/nation/story_92430.jsp,2016-06-21,"You can tell from a distance that it's neither a village nor a fairground. Tens of thousands of cows, bulls and buffalo are grunting and mooing inside rows and rows of bamboo-and-tin sheds. Hundreds of people are bustling about, and fodder-laden bullock carts keep coming and going. The stench of methane pervades the air as you pick your way through a minefield of dung. Welcome - if that's the right word - to one of Maharashtra's biggest ""cattle camps"", which has all the commotion and expanse of a fairground but little of its joy or colour. But what this 100-acre tract of land, about a kilometre from Palvan village in drought-stricken Marathwada, has in abundance is grit. It's reflected in the words of Vishnu Baglane, 28, one of the hundreds who have moved in with their cattle from villages far and near, drawn by the free sheds, water and fodder for their animals and free lunches for themselves. All provided by the NGO organiser, with state government help, at a time successive droughts have left the earth parched and the fields barren. ""I tell myself several times a day not to give up,"" Vishnu says, splashing a mug of water on one of his 20 animals in temperatures approaching 45 degrees. ""It's just a matter of hanging on for a few more months."" Vishnu is hoping this monsoon will be good. He and his father Raghunath, 64, have been here since September, after the fourth straight failed monsoon in Marathwada. The son tends to the cattle from 7am to 7 pm; the father arrives after dinner to sleep in the cowshed through the night. The women of the family often come visiting from their home in Kakadhire, 5km away, bringing the children who prance about the place. Sometimes, close relatives drop by too. Long history Cattle camps or chara chhaonis have had a long history in Maharashtra and Karnataka as a short-term drought measure, apparently starting from Shivaji's reign in the 17th century. Since 2011, they have become a part of the summer landscape in Maharashtra, particularly in its dry central and western belts. But last year was the first time that some of them stretched till winter and on to the new year, and are still continuing through this summer. Social organisations or sugar factories lease farmland denuded by drought and set up these camps, running them with help from the state government or goodwill-seeking political parties. Some 350 cattle camps sheltering nearly 250,000 animals are now operating in Marathwada's three worst-hit districts: Latur, Osmanabad and Beed. Of these, Beed accounts for 265 camps, small and big, Osmanabad has 80-odd and Latur just one. The one at Palvan, 15km from Beed town, harbours about 5,000 small and big animals, belonging to 300-odd farmers from 32 villages. It's run by a multipurpose society, the Yashwant Bahuuddeshiy Sevabhavi Sanstha of Rajendra Mhaske, aide to local politician Vinayak Mete who two years ago switched loyalties from the Nationalist Congress Party to the BJP. With a staff of 65, the camp is managed well. Each inmate, like Vishnu, has been issued with an identity card, a daily coupon and a fodder quota based on the number of animals in his shed. Each farmer is given a serial number when the camp office starts distributing fodder, so that there's no crowding or chaos. Some of the cattle owners keep shuttling between their villages and the camp, the rest have moved in lock, stock and barrel, sleeping in the cowsheds or tents. Savita Sachin Munde, for instance, came from Chikhalbed, 60km away, along with her husband, two children and four cows six months ago. She tends to the cattle while her husband works as a camp labourer. ""We'll be here until the monsoon arrives,"" she said last month. (The monsoon has now arrived in Marathwada.) Like a village, the camp has developed its own community life. It recently hosted a mass wedding where 50-odd couples from among the inmates' families tied the knot. Challenges The government gives Rs 63 per big animal and Rs 30 per small animal per day but camp supervisor Satish Shelke says this is peanuts. ""We have to spend a lot from our own kitty,"" he says, ""but if you stand by people in bad times, they will stand by you."" Shelke's biggest challenge this summer has been finding water and fodder (sugarcane and green foliage). ""We need 3 lakh litres of water every day. A 12,000-litre water tanker costs Rs 1,500,"" he says. So, the camp spends Rs 37,500 on 25 water tankers every day. Add to that the cost of fodder, the free lunches for up to 400 people and other expenses, and the monthly bill runs into several crores, he claims. ""We raise most of it from our own businesses and donations."" The Palvan camp brings the fodder from sugarcane-rich Satara, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar, and the green feed from other states. ""This year has been bad, there's no fodder anywhere,"" says the supplier, Shrimant Bapu Gursale, 67. ""The sugar factories aren't allowing farmers to cut their cane and sell it to us, fearing a cane shortage that could hurt their production next year."" He adds: ""The farther you go in search of fodder, the more you have to spend. The transport cost rises, so does the wastage."" In 2012-13, Maharashtra had about a million animals lodged in cattle camps across the state's west and Marathwada. The state BJP government is under fire from the Opposition and ally Shiv Sena because this year, the camps are confined to just three districts. But the government has been reluctant to support too many fodder camps because of allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the past. In many places, therefore, farmers are being forced into distress sale of cattle. One of them is Baba Jadhav, who rears and sells the expensive Devni breed of cows at Ambewadi village in Latur district, about 250km from Palvan. The 45-year-old has won many awards for his cattle breeds but, unable to feed his cows this year, he has had to give away nearly a dozen of them to his friends in Pune. ""I sell a dozen cows and buffalo every year, each animal fetching me handsome money. But this year's drought will hurt me for at least two more years (the time taken to rear a calf),"" Jadhav says. At least half the animals in his village have been sold at throwaway prices in the past three months, some to farmers from other states. Vishnu says he is indebted to the Palvan camp organisers for saving his 10 cows, 2 bullocks and 8 buffalo after the failure of his summer and winter crops The young farmer has already seen many droughts and knows this will not be the last. But at the moment, his goal is to keep his animals alive. ""An animal saved today,"" he says, ""is an animal earned tomorrow."""

That was also the reason why electricity supply to five states was disrupted and some 40,000 families had to remain without power for days together.Drinking water was in short supply in Farakka town. Plying of boats on river Ganga had to be suspended and around 13 barges carrying coal were stuck in the mid-river because of low levels of water. This demonstrates that the Ganges is drying up faster than estimated.According to different reports, in the last decade itself, water level in 91% of countrys water reservoirs has come down. The Central Water Commissions findings are even more frightening  only 29% of water is left behind against their carrying capacity. Whats more, ground water which is the major source 85%  of water in India is depleting endlessly.Across states in India, dependence on water tankers today is greater than before. Water-related scuffles nowadays are common place. Recently, in the villages of Latur district of Maharashtra, prohibitive orders had to be clamped. Water supply to swimming pools has been cut off in Maharashtra.According to NASA, the ground water level in India is diminishing by 0.3 metre annually. Paradoxically, when there is a severe shortage of water, farmers in desiccated areas are encouraged to produce water-guzzling sugar cane. Same is the case with wheat and rice which are water-intensive.On the other side of the spectrum, water disputes are constantly on the rise. In addition to the fact that there isnt enough water for irrigation because of the myopic policies of successive governments, water is causing bad blood among people. In Punjab, after the Sutlej link canal bill was passed in the assembly, fissures have surfaced between Haryana and Punjab over division of water. In Haryana, farmers owning agricultural fields are screaming for water.Of late, state after state seem to be relying on the principle of Harmon. State governments are fostering a gut feeling that they have full control over the water that flows down from the state line.In order to trim down water disputes between states, the Inter-State Water Dispute Act was enacted in 1956. But the water dispute tribunals have consistently failed to implement the accords reached between states.In as much as the tribunal doesnt have coercive powers and its judgments are not binding on the states, the pronoun-cements are flouted and states straightforwardly refuse to abide by the agreements reach-ed. Even the Centre is toothless, as it happened in the case of Ravi-Beas river water dispute.Institutional safeguardsIn reality, the water dispute redressal mechanism in India is a lot ambiguous, hazy and muddled. Those involved in the water row, time and again, has recourse to bullying. Resolution of water dispute is a hell of a job because of the sheer number of players  the Centre, the state governments, the water dispute tribunals, the civil society and so on. Even institutional safeguards meant for development and progress is becoming ineffective.Take for example, the Cauvery river water dispute. From 1968 to 1990, there were as many as 26 minister-level talks between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; but there has been no answer to the row. Because of increasing politicisation, the Cauvery river dispute tribunals proposals have become some sort of a wild goose chase.Experts feel the increasing need of an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in the country. This Central regulatory body must know how to undertake water upkeep seriously. In the same way, we need a mechanism to share our water in the best possible way keeping in mind the social equity, need and lots of common wisdom.Industries, farmers and the common citizenry should be the partners in any talk of water distribution and conservation. We also need a couple of new laws and make stronger the present ones to maintain the ecological balance of Indias rivers. A new law to maintain minimum levels of water too is considered necessary. Politicisation of water is the last thing to be wished.All that is looked for is an attitudinal change among stakeholders. A long time solution to Indias water problem is enormously significant and the sooner we find an answer to the vexing problem of depleting water sources and the corresponding feuds the better. Water is one commodity which can never be put to buy and sell. Commercialisation of water can happen only in the depths of despair."

It would create direct employment opportunity for 12,000 people. It would soon be tabled before the state-level single window clearance authority.According to sources in the Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Limited (Ipicol), there was hardly any progress on other big-ticket proposals like petrochemical complex by Indian Oil Corporation Ltd with an investment of Rs 15,000 crore, expansion of Nalco (Rs 20,000 crore) and alumia refinery by L&T (Rs 12,000 crore).Though the government announced receiving the investment proposals during the Make in India event, the investors had announced these earlier on different platforms, said an officer in the industries department.Similarly, the fate of another investment proposal worth Rs 5,000 crore for a solar park by Indonesia-based firm Zenyam also hangs in balance.The other proposals, which the state government claimed of receiving at the Make in India week, were Rs 1,000 crore in Electronic System Design & Manufacturing sector by US based Sanmina, Rs 250 crore and Rs 809 crore in food processing sector by Ruchi Soya and ITC respectively and Rs 2,000 crore in infrastructure development sector by Tata special economic zone. Other proposals include Rs 1,000 crore in chemical and fertilizer sector by Deepak Fertilizers, Rs 8.350 crore in renewable energy sector by Panchavaktra Holdings, Rs 1,000 crore in sugar industry by NSL group, Rs 1,800 crore in power sector by GMR and Rs 1,000 crore in aluminium downstream by Vedanta Limited. Industries secretary Sanjeev Chopra said the state government is continuously following up with the project proponents. ""The GMR has already submitted its proposal for a gas-based power plant while we are in touch with Nalco for expansion of its smelter,"" he said."

The circle consists of Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts.Preparations for the plantation drive are in final stages and the last review meeting at state level will be held next week.M K Rao, chief conservator forest, Kolhapur circle said, ""The number of ready pits in the division is 21,93,052 , of which 6,49,140 are in Kolhapur district. We have using all forms of media for spreading awareness about the reason behind tree plantation. We have created a database of people who are keen to participate in the drive. Many social organisations, NGOs, youth groups, schools, and local establishments in rural areas have participated in it. We have informed them about recognised nurseries, what type of saplings should be planted, and the scientific methods of doing it.""While Kolhapur district has created 6,49,140 pits, it is followed by Satara (7,54,018), Sangli (5,02,420), Ratnagiri (1,69,453) and Sindhudurg (1,18,021). The forest department has asked all other concerned departments and participants to dig more pits up to June 24. ""This will enable them to carry out training, sensitization and distribution of leaflets,"" Rao said.The revenue and forest department has prepred a plan to carry out tree plantation in the state during Van Mahotsav, celebrated in the first week of July, starting from this year.Out of Maharashtra's total area of 307 lakh hectares, around 20% (61.35 lakh hectares) is covered by forests, while the National Forest Act, 1988 says that 33% area should have green cover, states a government resolution issued by the revenue and forest department in May. Out of the 2 crore sapling, the forest department will plant up to 1.5 lakh, while the other departments will plant the remaining 50 lakh trees.The government resolution also says that the cooperation, textiles and marketing departments should plant trees in the vicinity of their offices, sugar factories, textile industries and small scale industries.

58ff0ad57be9e0420db2bc46,Weight axe dangles on 130 cabin crew,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160622/jsp/nation/story_92627.jsp,2016-06-22,"New Delhi, June 21: For about 130 Air India flight attendants who were identified as ""overweight"" and failed to get in shape despite repeated warnings, it could be curtains now with the aviation regulator refusing to relax weight standards it had introduced two years ago. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has turned down a proposal by the government-owned airline to retain the ""overweight"" cabin crew - mostly women - saying the weight norms had been prescribed on ""technical and efficiency grounds"" and cannot be rolled back. ""The option before us now is either to ground the cabin crew members falling short of the weight standards or to ask them to opt for voluntary retirement,"" a senior official in the personnel department of Air India said. The DGCA had in May 2014 issued a circular directing all domestic airlines to classify flight attendants as ""normal"", ""overweight"" or ""obese"" - based on their BMI - and ensure that only ""fitter"" crew are assigned aircraft duties. The BMI is a measure relating a person's weight to height, calculated by dividing the mass in kg by the square of the height in metres. The circular said women would need to have BMI between 18 and 22 to be declared normal, women with BMI between 22 and 27 would be labelled overweight and those with BMI higher than 27 would be classified as obese. For men, BMI levels between 18 and 25 would be normal, 25 and 29.9 overweight, and above 30 obese. The directorate had given airlines an 18-month deadline to comply with these norms, arguing that the fitness levels of cabin crew members were directly linked to their speed and agility, and thereby to passenger safety during emergencies. After the DGCA circular arrived, medical examinations were conducted on all 3,500 cabin crew members in Air India - air hostesses and flight stewards - and 600 were found obese or overweight. They were asked to undergo clinical examinations and recommended weight reduction through a regimen of diet, exercise and lifestyle changes under periodic monitoring. ""As many as 130, however, failed to reduce weight despite several reminders and we sent a letter to DGCA in October last year asking for relaxation in norms for them since they are our senior staff and will be better able to handle international flights than the younger lot,"" another Air India official said. After launching a non-stop flight between Delhi and San Francisco in December 2015, the airline is set to begin a direct flight between Delhi and Washington soon. The national carrier, which launched a Delhi-Vienna flight in April, is also looking at taking its services to several African and Scandinavian countries. The airline currently flies to 36 destinations in the US, Europe, Australia, the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Gulf, in addition to 48 domestic ones. ""We have decided not to go back on the BMI norms as they have been set after long deliberations over safety concerns,"" a DGCA official said. ""We are hopeful the airline can sail through the situation by giving proper training to flight attendants who are fitter."" Vishakha Verma of the All India Cabin Crew Association, however, said the insistence on the regulation was ""disheartening"". ""We are considering all options - one of them could be challenging the decision in a court of law."" One of the 130 flight attendants, a 43-year-old air hostess based in Mumbai who has been working for the airline for 22 years, said: ""I did try to reduce but could not bring down my weight significantly."" Requesting not to be named, she added: ""Linking one's efficiency merely to BMI is grossly wrong and unfair."" At 162cm, she weighed 70kg and needed to lose more than 12kg to meet the BMI target. She has been able to lose only 2kg. Medical experts say a sustained workout plan is important to lose weight and not regain it. ""Some people start exercising with much enthusiasm but do not continue it or have no control over what they eat - that could be a primary reason why they fail to reach desired weight,"" said Shalu Sehrawat, director at the Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol at a Delhi hospital. ""However, in many cases a person with BMI 27 could be fitter than a person with BMI 21. Those doing fitness training regularly, with good haemoglobin, correct blood pressure and blood sugar level and a good performance on the treadmill could be as fit as someone with lower BMI,"" she said. Calcutta-based strength and conditioning coach Ranadeep Moitra argued that ""the BMI is no longer an acceptable means of calculating how overweight one is or isn't. Experts now calculate the fat percentage of the body.... It is possible that you can have high BMI yet enjoy good metabolic health. It may also be that your BMI is low yet there is too much fat in the body""."
591f15507be9e025a5d4a78a,"Water crisis: A tale of govt apathy, privilege",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553992/water-crisis-tale-govt-apathy.html,2016-06-23,"Sonia Faleiro, June 24, 2016, INYT 23:40 ISTShort on empathy and responsibility, the Centre's neglect is rivalled only by its officials' flippancyWhen 2-year-old Rutuja playfully tipped over a bottle, spilling water onto the mud floor of the familys shack, her mother, Nageshwari Rathore, let loose a screech, lunging forward as though to slap the toddler. Rathore stopped herself, sinking her head into her hands. You finished it, she whispered.The loss wrenched at the 25-year-old. That June morning she had stood in line in the scorching heat for over an hour to collect five litres of water. A government tanker rolls up once a day to the abandoned field where she now lives.Located in Ghatkopar, a Mumbai suburb, the field functions as a relief camp for 350 families who have left their villages in rural Maharashtra because of a drought, the worst in 100 years. Wild pigs root through the open sewer that runs alongside the Rathores tarpaulin shack. When the monsoon arrives, possibly in the next few days, it will flood the camp and force the family out.Over 330 million Indians  about one quarter of the countrys population  have been affected by the drought. In Maharashtra, where over half the population is dependent on the rural economy, the effects are severe. An average of nearly nine farmers committed suicide every day last year, primarily over debt related to crop failure.Rural Indians are falling behind even as urban Indians enjoy unprecedented prosperity. And the tragedies that befall the poor benefit the more affluent. Forced to migrate to the cities, displaced farmers have little option but to join the enormous, unorganised labour force that serves the urban middle class as construction and domestic workers.Trees outside the field in Ghatkopar were festooned with political banners, suggesting that the camp was the creation of a benevolent government. In fact, politicians had to be prodded to visit, according to Abhishek Bharadwaj, a homeless-rights activist.It was only after the media reported the squalid living conditions at the camp that Kirit Somaiya, a member of the state Parliament, came around to distribute cash and grain. Somaiya then uploaded a YouTube video depicting the camp as having abundant food and supplies.Shau Chavan, who has been living in the camp for two months, said that government help had increased. In previous years, a local mafia had charged 1,000 rupees a month  about 2.5 days of the migrants daily wages  for a plot of 40 square feet. This year, Chavan said, the farmers are living rent-free, most likely as a result of government intervention.If this is what passes for official aid in the richest state of the fastest-growing major economy in the world, then Indias government is short on political will, not means. This years drought is extreme, but severe weather is a regular occurrence in India. The authorities had time to plan.The state governments relief measures look good on paper, Abhishek Waghmare, a policy analyst with the data website IndiaSpend, told me. The state has poured money into the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan, a water-conservation programme to make Maharashtra a drought-free state by 2019.But the villages Waghmare has visited over the past four years still lack basic rainwater collection systems. Government efforts to rejuvenate dormant rivers and ponds are ineffective: Year after year, Waghmare said, water runs off.Government failure stems from institutional disregard for the poor. Almost 70% of Indians live in rural areas, but the government doesnt appear to view them as essential to Indias march to modernise. The spiralling number of suicides suggests that farmers despair is not resonating with politicians.Even after eight states declared a drought last year, the Centre failed to increase support for two programmes created to act as lifesaving buffers: The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which promises every household 100 days of paid employment annually, and the Public Distribution System, which delivers subsidised grains and fuel to the needy.Government investment in the employment programme has decreased since 2014, the year the BJP came to power, and fewer jobs were created than before. Because of corruption in the food programme, rations earmarked for the poor are often sold on the black market instead.Self-sustainable initiativesMitigating the effects of a drought doesnt require much investment. The villagers of Hiware Bazar, in Maharashtras Ahmednagar district, havent required official drought assistance in over two decades.They banned borewells to prevent the water table from falling further and now cultivate vegetables instead of water-guzzling bananas and sugar cane. If the government had only shown similar initiative, the state wouldnt be in such dire need.In May, the Supreme Court scolded several state governments for their ostrich-like behaviour, and demanded the creation of a national disaster mitigation fund within three months. But nothing has happened yet, a principal adviser to the court said. The governments neglect is rivalled only by its officials flippant attitude.On April 15, Eknath Khadse, the revenue minister of Maharashtra at the time, visited the drought-stricken district of Latur. The water crisis was so severe then that a special train was commissioned to bring water to the area.But Khadse went by helicopter, even though Latur is readily accessible from Mumbai  which required the construction of a temporary helipad that consumed 10,000 litres of water.The next day, the water conservation minister, Pankaja Munde, showed up, and tweeted photographs of herself grinning in front of a parched riverbed.The drought selfies, as they came to be known, drew widespread condemnation. They captured perfectly the general reaction of Indias politicians to this disaster. Short on empathy and a sense of responsibility, our leaders see even grave crises only through the lens of their own privilege.International New York Times"

Here is how you can feel fit. Being healthy is not only about looking fit, but feeling fit. Here is how you can feel fit.Having good eating habits doesn't necessarily mean going on strict diets and following difficult diet regimens. Simply putting it, healthy eating doesn't have to be complicated. There are few very basic habits that you can develop to get maximum benefit out of what you eat.Chew your food well Our elders always emphasized that we should eat slow. And it was not the pace that was important, but how well we chewed our food. Chewing slowly helps in better digestion and thus in turn helps in reducing fat. Chewing more also means eating slow and lesser than if you ate too fast.Snack on fruits and not chips We all addicted to binging at any one time of the day. But instead of eating junk or heavy stuff, make a habit of having fresh fruits. Fruits will not only give you added nutrients, but also help you feel fresh. Besides, avoiding junk food will automatically help in reducing weight.Drink lots of water Half of your health related problems can be solved if you drank enough water. It not only helps in better digestion, but also helps in having a better skin. Plus, replace any other form of fluids or drinks with water, which will regulate the liquid intake in your body.Eat sitting down Sitting down and eating is the proper way of having your meal. That way your brain and your body are better prepared for food. Besides, we also tend to eat less when sitting down. And it is more fun for sure.

Prasad felt food could be one of the reasons behind their high life expectancy. ""Traditionally, Dalits didn't have large tracts of land. They mainly grew crops such as millets that don't require much water. Millets are good for health. They didn't have money to use chemical fertilizers, which meant organic food,"" said Prasad. ""Dalits ate rotis along with wheat husks. Nowadays, the same is being touted as a superfood for diabetics,"" he adds.While several innovations from desi kitchens have captured the imagination of the west over the decades, the current favourite being turmeric latte (essentially haldi-doodh). Closer home, top nutritionists have termed this interest as going back to the roots.""Look at it this way,"" said celebrity nutritionist Pooja Makhija. ""Earlier, everybody here aped the West. Now, the west is telling us that authentic Indian cuisine is the best and we are going back to it in a big way."" Dalit cuisine is essentially full of whole grains, which means a high amount of fibre, nutrients and antioxidants, said Makhija. ""Other than the rich organic nature of the food, the ingredients make digestion harder in a good way, allowing blood sugar levels to remain stable.""Prasad, who has been working on the project for two years, has set aside a modest capital of Rs 5 lakh. From a two storied building in Patparganj, he operates a packaging facility. ""I cannot sell the products through brick and mortar retail in the beginning because I will get paid later. We will start selling online and scale up once demand intensifies,""he said.He is sourcing raw materials from across the country where agriculture is done in old fashioned Dalit way, meaning no chemical fertilisers and less water."

""Nearly 21 per cent of the entire debt (Rs 26,71,600 crore) of 507 companies in our sample had interest cover of less than 1x as of March 2016,"" Icra's senior group vice-president and co-head for corporate sector ratings Subrata Ray said in the report.Around 65 per cent of this debt with interest cover less than 1x belongs to companies in three sectors - infrastructure & construction, power and steel, he noted.""The slow pace of improvement in structural challenges in the infrastructure sector, the global commodity meltdown and anemic trends across domestic consumption-driven sectors continued to be the highlights of corporate performance during 2015-16,"" said the Icra report.Sectors like metals, especially iron & steel, witnessed sharp contraction in coverage indicators during the year as earnings were adversely impacted by a decline in steel prices as well as competition from cheaper imports.The pressure on debt-servicing indicators in the infrastructure and construction sectors also remained unabated, owing to continuation of structural challenges and limited improvement in balance sheet strength.Among the most stretched sectors, airlines and sugar saw however an improvement in interest coverage due to favourable industry-specific developments.From the profitability perspective, 2015-16 was relatively better for as benign commodity prices benefited most sectors, even as earnings of metal companies, especially steel, contracted sharply during the year.""The Ebitda margins for our aggregate sample of 507 companies improved by 70 basis points to 17.3 per cent in the year,"" Ray said.Margins expanded more in the second half of the fiscal as earnings of the consumption-driven sectors benefited from the volume uptick during the festive season.Margins of the commodity-driven sectors also stabilised with marginal recovery in international commodity prices and imposition of minimum import price, the report said.Ebitda margins expanded by 120 basis points on year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of the fiscal.Some of the key sectors which witnessed improvement in margins on account of lower input cost during the year included airlines, auto, power, FMCG and tyres, it added.

The Shiv Sena had to make do with two junior ministers, which created a perception that it was unhappy. Reports had said the Sena would get a better deal in the state cabinet expansion since it was ignored during the Union cabinet expansion earlier this week. Five of the new inductees got cabinet rank, five were brought in as junior ministers and one junior minister was promoted to cabinet rank. Allaying the perception that he was sulking, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who skipped the swearing-in, said in Mumbai the cabinet expansion was done on the lines of what had long been mutually agreed upon. Reports had, however, indicated that the Sena had been lobbying hard to get at least one cabinet berth. But Uddhav said today: ""We never demanded a cabinet berth."" He claimed rival parties, unhappy with the Sena being part of the government, were spreading canards that his party was discontented. The Sena's Anant Geete is the Union heavy industries minister. Uddhav's long-time loyalists, Gulabrao Patil and Arjun Khotkar, took oath along with two members of the BJP's smaller allies, Mahadev Jankar and Sadabhau Khot. Jankar is a Dhangar community leader from Sharad Pawar's Baramati citadel and runs an outfit called Rashtriya Samaj Paksh. Khot, a farm activist, comes from western Maharashtra's sugar lobby and belongs to the Swawlambi Shetkari Sanghatna, a faction of the erstwhile Shetkari Sanghatna of the late Sharad Joshi. Jankar was inducted as a cabinet minister and Khot as a junior minister. Fadnavis also inducted the BJP veteran from western Vidarbha, Pandurang Phundkar, into his cabinet, promoted a junior minister to cabinet rank and inducted four new faces from his party.

The new reprimand for gaining the pounds comes straight from the government and it may hurt the pockets, too! In Kerala, the State Budget on Friday has proposed a 14.5 per cent tax on "" junk food such as pizzas, burgers and doughnuts sold in upscale restaurants"" in a bid to counter rising obesity . It has become the first state in the country to impose such a ""fat tax"", that is already levied in a few countries like European countries like Hungary and Denmark already levy. If Mumbai goes the Kerala way, will we see a fat tax working here, too?This is an idea that could work well back home, believes dietician and sports nutritionist Deepshikha Agarwal. She says, ""Obesity is at an all-time high in Mumbai and it's alarming. I have kids at 10 years dealing with diabetes and high obesity-related issues. This comes down to poor eating habits. Fries, burgers and quiches are now becoming more of a convenient option and they are being consumed for lunch and breakfast, too! With life being so fast-paced, people are on the run and tend to take their nutrition for granted. The idea is, 'let me order a takeaway of fast food as I can eat lunch on the go', but that is not ideal. I hear people make excuses for this, which is a huge mistake. I often hear folks say they balance it out by doing gym for an hour after eating these foods, but that's not enough. They also say, 'I'll have green tea after indulging', but green tea is no counter to junk food. So yes, this tax is a great idea. If the money pinches, it may lead to a decrease in the intake  consumption may come down from four times a week to twice and lower health risks."" Preserved foods must be included in such a tax bracket too, she adds. ""It's high time this tax is levied in Mumbai and not just for junk food but preserved foods, which can be deadly. They are rich in sodium chloride, can cause blood pressure problems, dryness in the eyes, sluggishness and hormonal imbalance, if consumed long-term.""It's not only fast food, let's not forget that high-fat snacks and street fast food can be as bad, warns clinical dietician, Zainab Gulamhusein. ""Why just burgers and fries, Indian food is also laden with empty calories, which give no concrete nutrition  take for instance vada pao or bhajiyas, butter chicken, dal makhni or paneer makhni or even ras malai, barfi and other Indian sweets. So really speaking, the fat tax should cover a lot of foods. What is also scary is that several food preparations entail the use of colour, additives and chemicals beyond the permissible level, which could be carcinogenic in the long run.""And if you're thinking you can eat heavy food as long as it's made at home, think again. ""Even ghar ka khana must be about the right kind of dishes. If you regularly eat deep-fried ragda pattice or homemade sev puri, these have a high oil content. Diet bhel and chiwda too, have excessive salt and sugar , which people don't know about, so let's not forget all of that. Bottom line is, why wait for a tax? Why not just be aware and make the right food choices on an everyday basis?"" she asks.Just levying a tax may not deter people from putting on weight. While exercise and home-cooked food play key roles, incentivising the issue may really swing things around, feels strength coach, Jivesh Shetty. ""Abroad they have weighing scales at train stations, where you have to pay according to your body weight as this signifies how much surface area you will occupy. We could start that here, even in office cafeterias, with a 'pay less if you weigh less' approach. Spas and gyms could also offer discounts based on body weight. There can be a whole lot of such incentives for Mumbai. Taxing big eateries may just affect a small percentage of the population in the city. Instead let's use these creative incentives to get people to lose weight and put them on the road to wellness,"" he suggests.Last year, the Turkish governor derived a novel way of tackling the issue by imposing a ban on using lifts to reach the first three floors of public buildings.In Japan, it's illegal to be fat. The country came come up with legal tactics to maintain the country's obesity rate. As per The Metabo Law, it mandates a waistline of 35.4 inches for adult women and 33.5 inches for men aged 40-74.Dubai once came up with a financial incentive to lose weight where participants who shed two or more kilograms by the Eid date at the end of Ramadan would get the equivalent number of grams in gold.As per a report in October 2014, obese people in the UK would be 'paid' to lose the flab. Slimmers with jobs were given cash or shopping vouchers under new NHS plans, if they have a job.The Pacific archipelago called 'one of the fattest nations on earth' has taxed sugary drinks since 1984. Next year Britain may levy a tax on soft drinks with more than 5 mg of sugar per 100 millilitres, to contain childhood obesity. Next year Britain may levy a tax on soft drinks with more than 5 mg of sugar per 100 millilitres, to contain childhood obesity.Australia once implemented a 10 per cent tax on soda, candy and white flour bakery products."
58feff897be9e0420db2b159,Diabetes guides add to medicine benefits,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160714/jsp/nation/story_96618.jsp,2016-07-14,"New Delhi, July 13: Simple but well-crafted, periodic guidance to diabetes patients from non-physician care coordinators, when added to standard treatment, may help them achieve better blood sugar control than medications alone, a multi-city study from India suggests. The findings demonstrate an intervention that does not require any new or expensive drugs but enhances patients' likelihood of managing their diabetes better through support from trained non-doctor health workers, the doctors who conducted the study say. Patients who received such guidance showed significant improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels that would reduce their risk of developing serious diabetes complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, eye disease and limb amputations. ""This was a real-life study. It shows a pragmatic intervention relevant to India's burgeoning diabetes problem and replicable on a large scale,"" Nikhil Tandon, professor of endocrinology at AIIMS, New Delhi, and one of the study's coordinators, told The Telegraph. Endocrinologists estimate that India has over 60 million patients with diabetes, a figure expected to rise above 80 million by 2025. Medical studies suggest that only three in 10 diabetes patients in India manage to keep their sugar levels at desired levels. ""Glucose control (even among patients with diagnosed diabetes who take regular medications) is poor and there have been no major improvements in this situation over the past 10 to 15 years,"" Tandon said. In their study, doctors from diabetes clinics in Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai and other cities picked 1,146 patients and offered 575 of them special non-physician intervention in addition to standard care. They then compared these patients' progress with the remaining 571 who had received only standard care. Their results, published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, showed that twice as many patients who had received non-physician intervention achieved the desired blood sugar levels compared with those who received only standard care. ""We've not added anything new. What needs to be done was implemented in an efficient way,"" said Dorairaj Prabhakaran, a senior cardiologist and director of the New Delhi-based Centre for Chronic Disease Control who was another coordinator of the study. ""The non-physician care coordinators serve as the interface between doctors and patients,"" Prabhakaran said. ""Doctors are often busy and unable to provide adequate and detailed lifestyle guidance to patients, which the care coordinators were tasked to do."" The care coordinators used a computer-based system to track patients' records, document their needs and remind them of future follow-up visits with doctors, and provided regular guidance on diet, exercise and tobacco reduction, among other advisories. The researchers say their results are all the more significant because the study did not financially support any component of diabetes care. This ensured that the patients were not in any way incentivised to play along with their care coordinators. ""The patients were expected to come on their own for blood tests and review by doctors; they had to pay for their blood tests, medication and, for those attending private clinics, the consultation fees of doctors,"" Tandon said. The care coordinators were non-physicians, trained in allied health fields such as dietetics or social work with less than six months' experience in the health-care sector. They were able to join the study with only three days' training."

The kharif production fell sharply and in many areas no sowing took place for rabi crop. This has not deterred MSEDCL from claiming that the use of farm pumps increased by 7.1% in 2015-16 as compared to 2014-15. This is in spite of the fact that energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has said on record that MSEDCL inflated farm pump consumption figures and had set up an enquiry in this regard.Consumer activists have been contesting MSEDCL's farm pump consumption figures since years. They allege that MSEDCL inflates consumption figures to manipulate distribution losses so as to avoid being penalized by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). The activists have also pointed out that the jugglery leads to higher power tariff for all consumers.The Nagpur unit of Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (Credai) has done an in-depth analysis of MSEDCL and government data to expose the jugglery done by the discom. It presented its findings before MERC during the public hearing on Thursday. Credai consultant AP Ganguly told TOI , ""MERC projects power consumption of each consumer category for the coming year in the tariff orders. MSEDCL has claimed that the actual power consumption by farm pumps was 23% more than the MERC projection.""Ganguly said that as per MSEDCL's own figures, the actual agricultural consumption at high tension (HT) level was lower than the MERC figure. ""However, the unmetered farm pump consumption was 34% higher than the MERC's estimate while the metered consumption was 15% higher. It is clear that MSEDCL has sent farmers inflated bills,"" he charged.Reading out facts and figures to support his argument, the consultant said, ""The Economic Survey report 2015-16 has projected a 22% drop in foodgrain production with drought ravaging both kharif and rabi crops. The production of cereals was projected to decrease by 24% and pulses by 11% as per the survey. Sugar cane production was projected to drop by 21%. Some 278 out of the total 355 tehsils received deficient rainfall in 2015-16. Under such conditions, how can farm power consumption increase by 7.1%?""According to him, MSEDCL's losses were in the range of 25% and not 13% as claimed by the company in the tariff petition. ""If this fact is admitted by MSEDCL, then it will be penalized by MERC and the company will be forced to reduce the magnitude of proposed tariff hike.""Meanwhile, the enquiry against MSEDCL's farm power bills is going on. The three-member committee has appointed IIT Powai for doing field surveys to find out the actual farm power consumption. The committee is expected to submit its report to government in December this year."

(Source: express photo by Prashant Nadkar) Fadnavis arrives at Vidhan Bhavan Thursday. (Source: express photo by Prashant Nadkar)Ministers in the Maharashtra government, who are facing accusations of graft and impropriety became the target of the Opposition on Friday but Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis put up a spirited defence of each.Criticise us for the wrongs we do, but do not defame my ministers with baseless accusations, Fadnavis told the Opposition benches.Earlier on Thursday, the Opposition had put the government in a tight spot by levelling accusations against 20 out of the 39 ministers.In a bid to rebuild his governments image, Fadnavis, while replying to Oppositions offensive, took almost everybody by surprise by giving a clean chit to all these ministers. Incidentally Friday was also the Chief Ministers birthday.Fadnavis even defended cabinet ministers Sambhaji Nilengekar Patil and Jaikumar Rawal against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated.His hour-long speech also had a subtle warning for Opposition leaders. My government is trying to change the negative perception about Maharashtra which was created due to corruption that went on for the last 15 years. If I start delving into the past, all those responsible for frauds in district banks, dairies, and cotton mills will stand exposed. But jau dhya, aaj birthday aahe. (But let it be since today is also the birthday). Sources said this was a veiled dig at former Deputy Chief Minister and NCP legislator Ajit Pawar, who was also celebrating his birthday on Friday.While defending his ministers, the chief minister, however, did not give ousted minister Eknath Khadse a clean chit in the Pune MIDC land deal case. He only said that a one-member committee was probing the matter. On Thursday, Khadse, while defending himself had taken a veiled dig at Fadnavis. Later, NCPs Jayant Patil was seen rubbing salt on Khadses wounds. Why should there be one rule for other ministers, another for Khadse, he asked sarcastically, while interacting with newspersons. It seems to us that the CM is making sure that Khadse would remain out of his cabinet, he said.Following the CMs speech, the Opposition, however, created a furore, claiming that the CMs reply was not satisfactory. There was pandemonium after the Presiding Chair, Yogesh Sagar, halted discussion on the issue. Sagar later adjourned the house for 10 minutes and then for the day.The Opposition alleged that the government had run away from a proper debate. Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said, We (the Opposition) condemn the presiding officers conduct. Once the government became aware that it would stand exposed, it ran away from a debate. It tried to muzzle the Oppositions voice with the help of the presiding officer.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe CM had begun his speech with the defence of Tribal Development Minister Vishnu Sawra in the controversy over purchase of raincoats for tribal children. While accepting there had been certain irregularities in the purchase process, the CM appeared to blame it on the contractor nexus functioning in the Tribal Development department over the last 15 years, while saying that Sawra hadnt made a single mistake in the matter. Next he came out in defence of Shiv Senas Minister of State (Housing) Ravindra Waikar. Waikar is facing accusations over constructing an illegal gymnasium floor on a public land in Aarey using MLA funds.Fadnavis named similar illegalities in development works carried out by Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam and Congress legislator Ashok Jagtap.Further, while accepting that Sambhaji Nilengekar Patil had been chargesheeted by the CBI in an alleged loan fraud where he had stood guarantor by mortgaging a land, Fadnavis said that the entire matter was borne out of a family and political feud. The complainant in the matter is his grandfather (Shivajirao Nilengekar Patil, a former CM). It is of a political nature.Similarly, he said that criminal proceedings initiated against another minister Jaikumar Rawal in a loan scandal, which took place during the previous regime, were also politically motivated. His defence was on the same lines for BJPs Minister of State Ravindra Chavan, who faces 19 cases including those of extortion and kidnapping.In the Take Home Ration controversy involving Pankaja Munde, CM said that the accusations had been levelled without proper reading of a court judgement in this regard. On allegations of financial irregularities in the Beed District Cooperative whose 15 directors (out of 17) are from the BJP, he said, The irregularities mainly deal with loans provided to firms promoted by Amarsingh Pandit, Dhananjay Munde, Jaydutt Kshirsagar (all NCP) and Ashok Patil (Congress).While admitting that BJPs Girish Mahajan had erred by not naming a farm land procured in his name as a director in a private sugar mill in his election affidavit, the CM said that the minister had returned the land. He also came out in defence of BJPs Ram Shinde and Pandurang Phundkar, and Shiv Senas Diwakar Raote.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58fedc0f7be9e0420db288b8,Virat's playing out of the ordinary shots: Ashwin,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160724/jsp/sports/story_98471.jsp,2016-07-24,"Ravichandran Ashwin is congratulated by Amit Mishra after the former completed his century on Friday North Sound (Antigua): It's Carnival time in these parts, but thus far in the first Test, the partying has all been India's monopoly. The honours have gone to two men: Virat Kohli, India's Test captain, and the fiercely competitive Ravichandran Ashwin. Virat and Ashwin collaborated no less than 168 for the fifth wicket, throwing the West Indies on the mat so very early in the four-Test series. While Virat's an absolute master now, highly accomplished, too, is Ashwin. Just months after telling The Telegraph that Virat would go on to become an ""all-time legend,"" Ashwin had the best seat as the former stroked his way to a maiden 200. Ashwin, promoted to No.6 ahead of Wriddhiman Saha, himself played a handsome hand of 113 as India took a stranglehold on the opening Test. In fact, all three of Ashwin's Test hundreds have come against the West Indies, beginning with the 103 in his debut series (Mumbai, November 2011). After being in the thick of action for almost all of Friday, Ashwin faced the media at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Excerpts... On enjoying batting against the West Indies... That's because I've got more time against the West Indies and, each time that I got a hundred, I had a specialist batsman at the other end. For a batsman lower down the order, that's important... I have got runs against the West Indies and if you start getting a liking towards one team, then something within tells you that you can do it again. Simply enjoying batting... I've always wanted to be in the top seven for India. It's a goal I have to strive for and get better at. I need to thank Anil bhai (head coach Kumble) and Virat for having had the confidence in me to be pushed at No.6... Virat had called in the morning to say I'd be batting at No.6, ahead of Saha, which was a big boost... I'd been working on my batting in Chennai over the past one month and I'm happy with the results... I'd never left so many balls... Before the Test, Ajinkya Rahane told me about batting for 200 balls. My aim was for 150 and to try and see where I got... In between, I'd played one over from (Shannon) Gabriel which was loose. Virat came over and said that is what I needed to avoid to be successful in Test cricket. [As it turned out, Ashwin batted for 253 balls.] Change in stance... First things first, Sanjay Bangar, our batting coach, has worked very closely on my stance for the past 12 months. It has been a challenge... I used to be extra side-on and had to open myself a little bit. The change has been very effective. Other things like my initial movement also had to be sorted. It was a process for 10-12 months and, on the way, I did lose a few innings as a batsman. Role he's looking at and if the 113 has helped him make a statement... I'm not trying to state anything that is not obvious. I'm just trying to enjoy my batting. If this is what the team expects out of me, then that is what I'm going to try and give. Some sort of solidity walking in at No.6. It's not that you walk in at No.6 and start getting the runs. It's not as simple as it sounds, but I'd really make an effort to be as solid as I can be. The team should feel that somebody who gives solidity has walked in. More than anything it's a goal I'm striving for. Batting with Virat... The West Indies bowling coach (Roddy Estwick) has talked about how good the wicket is, but certain shots cannot be played on it. The wicket has good bounce and there are areas where the ball is coming at a different pace... Yet, when I walked in, I felt Virat was hitting a few shots which I'd find impossible to connect. That's the sheer brilliance of Virat and he's been batting like that for the past year or so. He's playing shots which make the bowling look ridiculous. Out of the ordinary shots. On looking ahead... We'll have to maintain the intensity for every hour. We'll have to earn every wicket. Postscript: Back at the Sugar Ridge Resort, Ashwin was warmly hugged by chief selector Sandeep Patil. ""Very good innings, well done, Ash,"" he said."

Another 11 mills have also lost their licence to crush cane because of their delay in making payment before the deadline.State cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh said, ""The dues are from 2015-16 cane crushing season that ended in April this year. The total amount due was Rs 167 crore but Rs 2 crore was distributed to farmers. Thus reducing the amount to Rs 165 crore.""He made the information public during the ongoing session of state assembly and legislative council.In December last year, the government decided to go ahead with the 80:20 formula, where 80% of the total sugarcane purchase amount was asked to be paid as first instalment to the farmers. The decision was taken because sugar mills had expressed their inability to pay complete amount for sugarcane purchased based on Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) formula laid by the Union government. There are 11 sugar mills in the state that have failed to pay the sugarcane cultivators as per the formula finalised by the state government and farmers' organisations. Pune division alone has dues worth Rs 89 crore.""The state based sugar mills produced 84 lakh tonnes of sugar. In March this year, the prices of sugar started rising and reached Rs 32 per kg in April. Worried by the sudden increase, the union government restricted the stock size and forced the traders to sell sugar into the market. The wholesale dealers in sugar are now allowed to stock upto 5,000 quintals, while retailers can stock only 500 quintals,"" Deshmukh said.The Maharashtra State Cooperation Bank (MSC Bank) has already set the sugar valuation in the state at Rs 3,200 per quintal (minimum price for trading). This benefits both the sugar mills as well as sugarcane cultivators. The former will earn more out of it and some amount can be utilised for payment of arrears to sugarcane cultivators. A rough calculation estimates that a sugarcane cultivator would get Rs 85 per tonne extra than the earlier estimated price of Rs 1,875 per tonne.""As a routine practice, the MSC bank from time-to-time decides the valuation of sugar, which is used as a bar for trading. Based on the valuation, the factories can calculate their income and release the stock in the market.Sources from the state government pointed out that rainfall has been good in the state so far, which means the festival season could be a good opportunity for enhancing business. Festivals are a major booster for the economy and there is more demand for sugar from confectionaries and beverage units.EoM/NDThe state based sugar mills produced 84 lakh tonnes of sugar. In March , the prices of sugar started rising and reached Rs 32 per kg in April.Worried by the sudden rise, the union govt restricted the stock size and forced the traders to sell sugar into the market."

Recounting the incident, he said on June 29, an SUV was following them. Subsequently, the militants intercepted them and asked them to raise their hands over their heads and threatened to shoot them if they failed to comply. Srinivas said they fired five to six rounds in the air as well following which he and his colleague were blindfolded and taken to an isolated place after travelling for nearly 400 km at a speed of 100 to 120 km.After reaching their spot, there the kidnappers, nearly about 25 men, first offered them bread and water, and later a cup of curd.""Bread and water is the food that was given to us. I never used to eat bread in my life, but here I was forced to have it. To control the sugar levels, I requested them to offer a spoon of sugar every day which they agreed. They also washed our clothes for two days,"" Srinivas said, adding that he lost nearly 6-7 kg during his time in captivity.Srinivas further added that he was allowed to speak to his company management twice and once to directly speak to them for settling the ransom demand made by the abductors. ""They kidnapped us only for money. Thankfully, my company offered the ransom, but I don't know the details. I was supposed to reach home on Saturday, but finally landed at Mumbai airport on Sunday morning and arrived at home at 2.45 pm,"" Srinivas said, adding that he was released on July 16 at 11 am.""As I was completely blindfolded during captivity, I spent nearly 40% of my time praying to all gods including Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy of Tirupati.

(Representative Image) An increase in massive downpours has completely altered farming in Malin village in Pune district, and made daily life a precarious affair.Once, rain was a consistent pitter-patter on the roof over several months, says Sanjaykumar Zanjare, an eight-generation farmer here. Now it is more likely to be heavy spells of incessant rain within a span of a few days or weeks.This month, there was heavy rainfall for two days and there have been hardly any showers for the last seven to eight days, said Zanjare who has a degree in agricultural science. The erratic rain, resulting run-off and soil erosion have compelled far mers to stop cultivating many crops, including finger millet (nachni), urad and paddy, says Zanjare, who owns 18 acres of land.Then there's the danger: Two years ago, on July 30, a cloudburst triggered a landslide in the Wester n Ghats, destroying homes and taking lives--including Zanjare's grandmother. This is one of 20 villages that have been identified as at risk. Villagers also have to grapple with increase in temperature during summer. As in other places, poorly planned development has added to the problem. Deforestation has reduced green cover in the area. ""Earlier, it would not be so hot during summer as the forest cover would protect us from the heat. Now, there is a perceptible rise in temperature,"" he says. ""The uprooting of trees also loosens up the soil, leading to frequent landslides during heavy rainfall.""These perilous weather changes have compelled the villagers to suggest safety measures in and around their houses.""We have to raise a safety wall for those living close to hillsides.Besides, houses need to be built on extra solid and robustly moulded plinths and the roofs need to be strong enough to stand a heavy downpour,"" said Zanjare.TERI projects minimum temperatures to increase particularly in Pune, among other places, which will have an adverse effect on some crops. While extreme rainfall is not expected to go up here as much as in some other districts, deforestation in the region and treacherous hill topography makes even small increases important.RELATED STORIESPune division +Maharashtra, including Mumbai, is set to get significantly warmer and wetter in the next few decades, according to projections by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which could have profound implications for crop growth, water resources, and disease.Temperature is expected to rise by 2030. But there will also likely be greater climatic variations across the state - which means different regions will have different experiences.Northern Maharashtra is projected to see many more extreme rainfall events, whilemay see a rise in dry spells. Average temperatures could go up the most in parts of Vidarbha and Marathwada. But parts of the Konkan, including Mumbai, are likely to see the greatest increase in minimum temperatures.These projections are part of a climate study commissioned by the state government in 2010 and submitted by TERI in 2014 but only recently made public. Climate modelling was done in collaboration with the UK Met Office to predict temperature and rainfall for 2030, 2050 and 2070 compared to 1970-2000.The analysis projects that annual mean temperature will go up by more than one degree Celsius across the state by 2030, with the western parts of Vidarbha, northern Maharashtra - includes Nashik, Dhule and Nandurbar - and Marathwada seeing the biggest increase.In these regions, annual mean temperatures could go up by as much as 1.4 1.6C compared to increases of 1-1.2C in the Konkan and Pune regions. Maximum temperature increases follow a similar geo graphical pattern.On the other hand, south-west and north Maharashtra will see some of the biggest increases in minimum temperatures. That means that south Konkan, as well as Mumbai, Thane, and parts of Nashik, will have noticeably warmer nights in the near future.The study predicts that minimum temperatures will rise more than maximum, shrinking the distinction between day and night. This closing gap is significant because it leaves less time for the land to cool down, says Suruchi Bhadwal, associate director of the earth science and climate change division at TERI, New Delhi.""Usually, because land temperatures cool off in the night, it takes a certain amount of time in the mornings for temperatures to go up again. Now it will take less time and temperatures will go up further,"" she says. This cycle of warming will be especially painful for cities like Mumbai where concrete development and lack of green cover boosts local temperatures further. Demand for electricity will likely increase--life will get harder for those who have no recourse to fans or ACs.Winter is also warming up, notwithstanding cold spells. ""So there's no break from summer to winter,"" notes Bhadwal.In coastal districts, as well as parts of Vidarbha, humidity could make things worse. These areas score worse on the heat index, which combines temperature and humidity.In the longer term, temperatures will rise even more, the study predicts, with mean temperatures touching a 3C rise by 2070 in large parts of the state. In some areas like Vidarbha, minimum temperatures could rise by as much as 3.5C by 2070.However, researchers caution that longer term scenarios are very difficult to predict.The number of extremely low rainfall days is projected to rise most sharply in south-central Maharashtra, ie parts ofand Marathwada. Storing water will be more important in these areas to tide over the dry days.But there will be an overall increase in monsoon rainfall in parts of north and northeastern Maharashtra (Amravati and Nashik divisions). But much of this increase seems likely to be in short, intense bursts. The number of extreme rainfall days (calculated as rainfall intensity 99% higher than the baseline period) is predicted to increase across the state, especially in northern Maharashtra, including Jalgaon, Dhule and Nashik, as well as Akola and parts of Aurangabad.Mumbai, Thane and Sindhudurg might see relatively smaller rises in extreme rainfall events - a 10% increase, say, compared to 30% in Nandurbar.However, that doesn't mean Nandurbar will have more flooding than Mumbai or the rest of the Konkan, note researchers.Since the Konkan has high rainfall already, a little extra rain could be the difference between saturation and flooding.In Mumbai, the flood risk may also be aggravated by a rise in sea levels, projected to be in the range of about 24cm to 66cm for this coastline by the end of the century.On the other hand, areas like Dhule and Jalgaon may not have the resources or infrastructure to cope with extreme events.Climatic projections have to be combined with local context, emphasizes Bhadwal, to understand their effects on the ground. ""These projections give us a general picture of change, but local topographical features and other factors shape the local outcomes, including the capacity of a place to cope with change,"" she said."

Both the buses were heading to the city in the morning. The bus terminal here was deserted with only a few passengers, who were unaware of the strike, stranded there. From the Belagavi bus terminal, 685 suburban and inter-state trips are scheduled, but none operated on Monday. The 155 trips in the city were called off.Private carriers made the most of it as the district administration and police relaxed the norms on maxi cabs entering the city limits. They ferried passengers along the main roads of the city. The railways got a huge number of commuters on the Gokak and Khanapur section with the Miraj-Londa, Miraj-Hubballi- Chikkajajur and other passenger trains running full.Nitin Hegde, NWKRTC Belagavi divisional controller, said the MSRTC of Maharashtra and Kadamba Bus Service of Goa did not ply their buses, especially in Belagavi district. The nine buses operated on Saturday night by Kadamba returned the same day.Goa and Maharashtra-bound buses of the NWKRTC and NERTC were cancelled due to strike.A group of 10 men, who came from Madhya Pradesh in search of jobs in Hukkeri sugar factory, were stranded. Deepak Chouhan, a job-seeker, said, ""We arrived here late night by the Nizamuddin Eexpress. Our labour contractor told us to wait at the Belagavi city bus terminal from where he would pick us up, but till noon he couldn't come."""

GiriAlmond is a healthy snack that young affluent adults in the country have turned to quell their sporadic urge to eat, said experts at a seminar on diet and fitness organised by Almond Board of California here on Tuesday.As per a recent survey conducted in the country, 97 per cent of affluent Indians like snacking on almonds, followed by fruits and other dry fruits.In the survey published early this year 3,037 affluent urban men and women between 18-35 years were interviewed across Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Bhopal and Coimbatore.The study indicates that affluent Indians had turned to healthy snacking, that not just tickles the taste buds but contributes to nutrition intake.Interestingly, 72 per cent of Hyderabadis want snacks to be healthy and tasty as against fried food. Also, the citys affluent preferred snacking in the evening to overcome fatigue and exhaustion.However, 30 per cent of young affluent people in the country snack when they undergo stress.Stress snacking or eating when not hungry is high in the city and Bangalore even as people in Mumbai, Chandigarh and Bhopal are least inclined to snack when under stress.The study also found that 97 per cent of young and affluent Indians prefer to snack on almonds when happy, followed by fruits. In cities like Bangalore (99 pc), Chandigarh (99 pc) and Coimbatore (99 pc) youngsters overwhelmingly prefer almonds for snacks, the study said.Further, unlike popular perception, a whopping 82 pc of young and affluent adults say that they do not feel guilt after snacking. As much as 92 per cent of young adults in Mumbai say they seldom feel guilty after snacking. While these are the fun facts about almond snacking in the country, speaking at the seminar on diet and fitness, Sheela Krishnaswamy, a well-known Bangalore-based diet and nutrition consultant said, Increasing disposable incomes, a need for convenience owing to fast-paced lifestyles and a cultural tradition of snacking have contributed to overall trend towards snacking in India. As a consequence, snacking has sub-consciously become a part of our daily routine. However, uncontrolled and mindless snacking on unhealthy foods, coupled with sedentary lifestyle has contributed to a rapid rise in lifestyle-related disorders.According to Ms. Krishnaswamy, it is important to ensure that snacking habits are healthy. Healthy options like fruits or a handful of nutritious almonds which may have satiating properties that promote feelings of fullness, can be a substitute to unhealthy snacking or overeating, she said.Further, almonds can also help lower the blood sugar impact of carbohydrate foods, experts said."

The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

This announcement was made by Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari during Global Tiger Day programme on Friday.The minister said that the pilot project of providing a bamboo canopy will help maintain environmental balance. ""Bamboo is a fast-growing plant and absorbs large quantity of carbon dioxide,"" said Gadkari. Highlighting another project to curb pollution, he said bamboo would be used to produce ethanol which could act as alternative fuel for running vehicles. ""Hopefully, bamboo's cost will come at par with sugar cane,"" the minister added.Apart from Gadkari, state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge attended the programme organized by state forest department at Mankapur Sports Complex.Congratulating the forest department for its two crore trees plantation drive, Fadnavis said the focus would now be on meeting the target of planting 50 crore trees in the coming two years. ""Forest ministry, which was always low profile, is playing an active role. Iconic tigers like Maya and Jai have not only generated revenue for the government but also given employment to local communities. We must all pledge ourselves for tiger conservation,"" he said. Fadnavis added the severe drought that the state faced in last few years was due to environmental imbalance.Mungantiwar urged citizens' participation in Green Army project. He also informed about Tadoba festival to be held in Mumbai from November 11-13.The ministers released postal stamps depicting Tadoba tigers and also felicitated winners of Sant Tukaram 'Vangram', Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 'Vanshree' and Selfie with Tree awards.Earlier, they inaugurated administrative building of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM). This is the first green building of the city that is energy-efficient and eco-friendly with rainwater harvesting facilities. They also unveiled a Tiger Rock at Civil Lines. The rock, which is worth Rs7 lakh, is built by Tathastu resorts."

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."

Hes also made his Bollywood directorial debut recently with crime thriller Missing On A Weekend .Thats a lot to begin with! But hes slowly recovering from the mayhem, far away from Mumbai. Since 2012, Ive been writing scripts for myself, says Jawkar. But something I read about a German tourist being raped in Goa triggered off this particular script that ended up as Missing On A Weekend .I felt this thriller should be the first film I make, not a typical love story. He adds, This is also a commercial film. In the 110 minutes, Ive managed four songs too [one of which he has written]. I believe that a filmmaker should enjoy watching his own film. Jawkar admits he only watches typical Bollywood masala films.The film also had a run-in with the censor board. Jawkar says that CBFC initially asked (verbally) for 50 cuts with an A certificate while he was expecting a U/A certification. He ultimately received a list of seven cuts to be made after he slapped a legal notice on the Board.It all began when the films trailer was released and had a line that said Goa is the New Delhi for crime. The PR team of the Goa Tourism Board apparently got in touch with the CBFC asking all references to Goa to be cut because it would spoil the image of the State. People like us, we back off after our job is done, says the director.The funny thing is before you shoot in Goa you have to submit a synopsis to their film society seeking permission. We had got a clearance and we even shot for seven days in the Calangute police station! With the kind of cuts suggested, my film will become a web series! He has now appealed to the revising committee. Of course, all this has meant that the release date has been pushed further. Planning a film release date is like planning your wedding! Right now there are too many big films coming out, says Jawkar. So my film will be released on August 26.Missing On A Weekend is also the debut film for Karan Hariharan, son of ghazal and Bollywood playback singer Hariharan. Jawkar knew Hariharan and had met his son at a time when the young boy weighed over 100 kilos. Two years later, Karan was half his size. It was a surprise audition that landed him the role, says Karan. Versatile actor Pawan Malhotra essays the role of a cop in the film.Jawkar, an economics graduate, says he was an aimless kid in college pretty clueless about what he would do once he finished. I wanted to go to Australia or the U.K. to do an MBA and have a good time, he laughs. A friend who had seen him do event management in his college days set him up in a film production company. Here, Jawkar started at the very bottom, buying film reels and worked his way up to making documentaries for Fox Entertainment and History channels.Then he got an opportunity to invest in film distribution with Singham . When you make good money on your first project, you keep going! he says. Jawkar went on to distribute a host of films including Yamudu , Golimaar and the Telugu dubbed versions of the Harry Potter series.Then Jawkar set up production house Red Bulb Studios two years ago and co-produced Marathi films Dabba Ais Pais and Sugar , Salt Ani Prem . Hes now working on a script for a friend on a Marathi film and hoping to start filming his second Hindi film, a women-centric one by December 2016.Jawkar started at the bottom, buying film reels, and went on to make documentaries for Fox Entertainment"

(Credits: Ganesh Shirsekar/file) File Photo: Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis with Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar in Mumbai. (Credits: Ganesh Shirsekar/file)Days after social activist Anna Hazare demanded liquor prohibition in Maharashtra, the state government ruled out a blanket ban but said it may adopt the Tamil Nadu pattern of disallowing sale of country liquor.Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwa, who had followed up the issue of banning alcohol in his home district Chandrapur, said liquor sale generates around Rs 13,000 crore revenue and the government is not considering banning it in any other part of the state.If there is specific demand for liquor prohibition from a certain district, we will consider it. However, we are not considering a complete prohibition as of now, he said.

According to Registrar of Companies (RoC) records, he resigned from the firm on July 5, three days before being inducted into the council of ministers. The company filed his resignation with the RoC only on July 26.Yerawar, earlier, had a 14.28 per cent stake in Chintamani Agrotech, which he later diluted to 1.9 per cent, according to the companys latest available annual report of March 2015.Gadkari was also with the company since its inception and resigned as a director on August 31, 2011, while Fadnavis joined the firm on October 23, 2009, and resigned on May 21, 2012, as per RoC records.Unlike Yerawar, neither Fadnavis nor Gadkari had any shareholding with the company, an analysis of its financial statements shows.Chintamani Agrotech  with zero turnover for the first several years, low income from sales, high reserves and substantial landholding without any operations  is a subsidiary of Jinbhuvish Powertech Pvt Ltd.Gadkari did not respond to text messages and questionnaires emailed to his office.Fadnavis said: I was associated very briefly, but I resigned and opted out because I couldnt contribute any value or time to the project. I dont know the status of the project.He added that the government had recently passed an Act that enables original landowners to secure their land back as per current rates if the property was acquired for a specific project that failed to take off within a stipulated period.The retrospective applicability needs to be checked, he said.Minister of State Yerawar said the power project could not take off due to a financial crunch and is not likely to start soon. The situation on the ground is still the same and I plan to resign as director of Chintamani Agrotech now I am a minister of state, he said when The Indian Express spoke to him on July 16.The plan was to have an integrated power plant with sugar and ethanol production. But then, policies changed and the government stopped giving loans for the sugar component. It was difficult to raise finances for the project and ultimately it could not take off. The company only has the land, purchased privately with proper permissions, he said.But Uttam Ingale, another director of Chintamani Agrotech and a former BJP legislator from Yavatmal, claimed the project was set to begin. The background work is going on. It is in the final stages. Some NOCs are awaited and finances need to be put in place, Ingale said.The company proposed to set up a sugar plant with a capacity of 3,500 tonnes of cane per day and a 30-mw co-generation power plant along with a 45 kilo litres per day ethanol plant at Mahagaon in Yavatmal.Watch Video: Whats making news[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8After its incorporation in 2001, Chintamani Agrotech acquired 127 acres in Bijora village of Mahagaon taluka in Yavatmal to set up the plant in 2002-03, Yerawar said.Devidas Mohakar, a resident of Mahagaon and a former member of the local zilla parishad, said, At the time of buying the land, the company members convinced farmers that they would set up a power plant and give jobs to members of their families. But nothing happened. Then the other company, Jinbhuvish, bought another 300-350 acres of adjacent land for the power project. But nothing has moved.Jinbhuvish Powertech, Chintamani Agrotechs holding company, owns 89.37 per cent of the firm. The company was incorporated in September 2006 originally as Aarya Financial Services Pvt Lt to provide consultancy services related to securities and deal in financial instruments, according to RoC documents.The company was started by a Nagpur-based entrepreneur, Manish Mehta, who was also a founder member of Chintamani Agrotech.Following the long wait for the plant to take off, a group of original land owners approached the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court in 2011, seeking the cancellation of sale deeds. The court disposed of the case, saying that registered documents of sale deeds could not be challenged through a writ petition.The landowners also wrote letters to the Collectors office in Yavatmal and to the state revenue department, saying the land in question was tribal land, which the company purchased after promising jobs to the owners. They said that the government should now reverse the sale deeds and restore the land back to its original tribal owners.Mohakar said, There has been no action on these letters. Some farmers have also started cultivating on what used to be their land at Bijora.As per land records, Chintamani Agrotech currently owns at least 64 acres at Bijora, which the company converted to non-agricultural land in 2009. The land is worth Rs 13.62 crore, according to the company auditors report as of March 2015. This newspaper was able to trace the purchase of 37.04 acres of Chintamani Agrotechs current landholding at Bijora to May 2002, when the company paid a total Rs 9.86 lakh for the land parcels.Besides, Jinbhuvish Power Generations, another subsidiary of Jinbhuvish Powertech, owns 356.5 acres in Bijora and the neighbouring village of Dhanmukh, according to records. As per the governments annual statement of rates, the land is worth nearly Rs 52 crore.Some of these land parcels were acquired from Chintamani Agrotech. For instance, on August 26, 2011, Chintamani Agrotech sold nearly 47.5 acres to Jinbhuvish Power Generations for Rs 9.01 crore in Dhanmukh.Similarly, there are also records of transactions between August and October 2011 of Chintamani Agrotech selling land to Amarupa Engineering & Mining, in which Manish Mehtas brother Nilesh is a director, with the land ultimately being in the name of Jinbhuvish Power Generations.Chintamani Agrotech, which changed its registered address at least four times in 15 years , from Yavatmal to Mumbai to Nagpur and then to Uttar Pradesh, had no revenue to report until 2010 when it for the first time posted a turnover of Rs 4.39 lakh. The companys annual report of March 2015 says that the firm derives hundred per cent of its turnover from the manufacture of sugar, and puts the revenue from sales and other income at Rs 4.47 crore.Besides Yerawar and Ingale, the firms current crop of directors includes Nagpur-based Ravindra Yerawar and Avinash Agrawal, and Jinbhuvish Powertech directors Nilesh Chanandrikapure and Pankaj Kaushal.Like Chintamani Agrotech, Jinbhuvish Powertech, the holding company has also reported a zero turnover since inception as against a large amount of loans and investments. According to the companys latest available profit and lost statement, it had no revenue from operations, but Rs 14,853 from other income. At the same time, it had reserves of Rs 237.9 crore and long-term investments of Rs 284.2 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

No party, they say, is complete without blotters (blotting papers that carry the chemical hallucinogenic) or ganja.An official at Narcotics Bureau says, Ganja costs around Rs 300 for 30 grams and you can get 10 powerful doses from every gram... The quality of LSD varies, so its price might range between Rs 300 and Rs 600 for one strip (of blotting paper). Students can easily afford these prices in this city.The teenagers that City Express spoke to say users have a party once or twice every week and fun is measured by the substance served and its strength. LSD comes mostly in sugar cubes or on strips of blotting paper.A Class 10 student from Indiranagar says 10 out of his 50 classmates do drugs. They do it four or five times a week. We go to our friends houses when their parents are out, he says.The teenager says he has tried everything. Whitener, LSD, marijuana, hash, heroin and even meth but the best is Molly. Trippiest stuff, man, says the student, candidly.Molly (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) aka Ecstasy is the new rage among Bengalurus adolescents.Another student of Class 10 says his classmates started early: I know many who started when they were in Classes 7 or 8.A Class 12 student says that he has tried to stop his friends and juniors, but no one listens. What can I tell them? My own classmates do it a lot and are deaf to my warnings, he shrugs.What happens when a child is caught abusing drugs? The offenders are kept on a tight leash for a few days. When the parents or teachers loosen their hold, busy with their own routines, the children slip back into their old ways.VV Singh, Superintendent, Narcotics Control Bureau, says they recently nabbed a man, headed for Kuala Lumpur from Kempegowda International Airport, who was carrying 20 grams of Molly and 21 kg of ketamine in food packets.The drugs are supplied from Mumbai and Chennai, says Singh. Foreign residents from Nigeria, South Africa and from East African countries such as Tanzania peddle them.They reach the students through a grassroot network. Local retailers sell them to everyone, including young students, says Singh. We occasionally catch students doing them.Parents are devastated when they learn of their childs addiction, says another official at NCB. It always comes as a surprise. They blame themselves for neglecting the kids, he says.Parents are often busy working and providing for their families, pitches in another official. But they dont know the abysmal state of the children today... school girls from Classes 8 to 12 are being lured by the peddlers. They are introduced to the drugs when someone spikes their drinks, then they become addicts and the peddlers demand sexual favors in return for the drug. All the while, parents are under the impression that their kids are out for combined study with a classmate.Child psychiatrist Jayashree Chakravarthy says, Families are predominantly nuclear these days and parents are unable to spend enough time with their children. There are no elders to guide them or show affection. This causes insecurity in the children and they resort to such desperate measures. Chakravarthy works for the reputed Manasa Hospital in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh.Nagesh Babu, a social worker, says, Parents should ask children to account for the pocket money and only give them enough to meet their needs.The Class 12 student also agrees that guardians must keep a close and consistent watch on the kids. Parents and teachers should keep checking our bags and other possible hiding places, he says.A Class 11 student says stricter laws could help, but that did not work out very well for rape... so, I dont know."

""I have heard fans of Pokemon Go say the game may even be driving a pandemic of sore legs,"" said Delhi-based Misra, adding all the walking would definitely have an effect on blood sugar levels and hypertension.Pokemon Go, which is only the latest version of a 20-year-old Japanese game, has been reviewed in many health websites in the month since its launch. Matt Hoffman, an assistant professor from Texas A&M Nursing College, wrote the game is a catalyst that gets ""people moving"". Players have to walk one to six miles for their Poke eggs to hatch. A professor in community medicine, Dr Irvin Sulapas, from the University of Baylor, said Pokemon Go forced people to interact. ""Instead of playing the game indoors, watching TV, it forces you to go out and interact,"" Sulapas said. An American psychologist has noted the game helps in lowering levels of anxiety and depression.But the moot question is whether Mumbai's schoolchildren will reap health benefits supposedly associated with Pokemon Go? A few year ago, Dr Aashish Contractor, who heads the rehabilitation and sports medicine department of HN Reliance Hospital in Girgaum, had done a study showing Mumbai's schoolchildren were less active than their western counterparts. ""On an average, children studying in classes VII to IX (13-16 age group) took less than 10,000 steps a day while children in the UK and Australia average 12,000 steps,"" he said.Given the sedentary lifestyle that Mumbai's children are forced to adopt because of lack of open spaces as well as the obesity epidemic, doctors feel Pokemon Go should be given a chance. Of course, Poke hunters need to follow safety rules like no Poke-hunts while driving or in inhabitable areas, among others.""Exergames will, undoubtedly, be more used by teenagers and young adults, who are smartphone savvy. Unfortunately, obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing in such a young population in developing countries, specifically in South Asia. The forecast for 2016 shows about 2 billion smartphone users worldwide and 204 million in India. Such 'exergames' could be used as a novel way to exercise with sustained interest,"" added Dr Misra."

The outgoing governor said that part of the agenda for his remaining 28 days in office was to tweak the way banks calculate their benchmark rates so that borrowers will benefit.According to Kotak Mahindra Bank president Shanti Ekambaram, the highlight of the policy was the commitment to adequate liquidity and an assurance that the money would come up front through buyback of government bonds. ""This has already resulted in market yields falling sharply,"" she said.Rajan also accused banks of finding reasons to not pass on reductions in their borrowing costs. ""Earlier, some bankers said that it was the lack of liquidity that was holding rates high. Now I hear from some that it is fear of the FCNR(B) redemptions that is making them reluctant to cut rates. I have a suspicion that some new concern will crop up once the FCNR(B) redemptions are behind us,"" the governor said. He added that he expected banks to cut benchmark lending rates when public sector banks - after their bad loan clean-up - start competing to lend to corporates.A status quo policy was widely expected. A small section of bond dealers hoped for a rate cut since most of earlier concerns - such as Brexit, monsoon uncertainty - had abated. Also, it was felt by many that the RBI had only a small window of opportunity to experiment with lower rates as the implementation of GST would cause an increase in prices.Explaining the rational for holding rates, Rajan said it was inflation driven by food prices. Not just vegetables, prices of commodities such as sugar are also higher than usual due to a decline in domestic production. Rajan pointed out that while vegetable prices could come down, prices of pulses have been rising again since April after a short-lived correction in the previous quarter. Besides food prices, the governor was concerned that implementation of the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) will push up housing inflation."

Sanjeev Babar, managing director of Maharashtra Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd, said, ""It is true that shortage of sugarcane in the coming crushing season is a major concern. We have discussed the issue with the officials, including state co-operation minister Subhash Deshmukh.""""Generally, the crushing activity picks up pace after the Diwali season. A good recovery rate of sugar is generally achieved between January and March. Hence, the mills are reluctant to start the season before Diwali. In the current year, Diwali will be at the end of October because of which the mills have demanded to start crushing season in November,"" he said.The state has a daily crushing capacity of 5.6 lakh tonnes of sugarcane, while the actual production is 550 lakh tonnes. It means that the entire sugarcane crushing season could last for 100-120 days as production in districts such as Kolhapur and Sangli is huge, while Ahmednagar, Pune and most of the Marathwada region have shown a sharp decline.Confirming the development, Deshmukh said, ""If we insist on starting the sugarcane crushing season, it would be inappropriate because the labour force will not turn up before Diwali. During the winter season, sugarcane is not completely mature which affects sugar recovery. With lower sugar recovery, the mills will face higher production cost.""In 2015-16, as many as 177 sugar mills had crushed 740 lakh tonnes of sugarcane. The average requirement of sugarcane for efficiently running all the mills is 940 lakh tonnes. Deficit rainfall in 2014 and 2015 followed by surplus sugar production and sluggish international market collectively affected the income of farmers from sugarcane cultivation. Every year, the Union government increases the fair and remunerative price formula which hikes the sugarcane purchase price. But due to low profit margins, most of the sugar mills have not paid the entire amount to farmers.The areas such as Solapur and Nashik as well as districts of Marathwada that receive scanty rainfall have reported reduction in sugarcane cultivation."

The properties together are estimated to be worth over Rs. 100 crore. Officials said the property is being attached as part of the probe into the alleged Maharashtra Sadan scam and related allegations of money laundering against the ex-minister and his family.Senior officials said the agency will take possession of the properties after completing the attachment formalities. The ED has also attached a plot worth Rs. 160 crore in Khargar and a sugar mill and prime land worth Rs. 50 crore in Nashik. All properties were in the name of Bhujbals son Pankaj and nephew Sameer.The Bhujbals are facing two charges under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) in the Mahrashtra Sadan case, which came to light after the PWD headed by Bhujbal had awarded the contract to his close associate, KS Chamankar. The contractor in turn sold the development rights obtained in lieu of the structure to a third party. The ED investigation revealed that Rs. 850 crore had been laundered in the matter.Reacting to court order, Pankaj Bhujbal said the family has full faith in the judiciary.

The reason is not just the prospect of a bumper crop on the back of a great monsoon so far, resulting in increased plantings in the current kharif season.After two torrid years of their incomes taking a hit from drought as well as poor produce realisations, Indian farmers finally seem set for better times.The reason is not just the prospect of a bumper crop on the back of a great monsoon so far, resulting in increased plantings in the current kharif season. No less important is a second factor  a gradual recovery of farm commodity prices from the lows of the past couple of years.Between January and July, the Food and Agricultural Organisations Food Price Index (FPI) has risen 8.4 per cent, from 149.3 to 161.9. This is also reflected in the global prices of most agri-commodities currently ruling higher than their levels from a year ago. Although nowhere close to their peaks  the FPI scaled an all-time-high of 237.7 in February 2011  the underlying trend suggests that farm prices may have bottomed out.A correction was inevitable after a prolonged phase of low prices. We are probably seeing that happening, though a clearer picture will emerge from the next few auctions at Global Dairy Trade (an online marketplace of New Zealands milk products giant Fonterra), said R G Chandramogan, chairman of Hatsun Agro Product Ltd, Indias largest private dairy company.In the latest fortnightly auction on August 2, skim milk powder prices averaged $1,965 per tonne, having traded at their lowest of $1,419 one year ago. The drop in prices, from a high of $5,142 per tonne in early April 2013, had led to Indias powder exports falling from Rs 2,717.56 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 292.57 crore in 2015-16. As dairies slashed procurement, farmers in states like Maharashtra were forced to sell cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre  against Rs 25-26 when exports were booming  even amidst drought-induced fodder and water shortages.But while milk powder prices may be just looking up, there is no such ambiguity with regard to sugar and cotton. Global sugar prices have almost doubled in the last one year. With ex-factory rates in Uttar Pradesh, too, firming up from under Rs 23 to about Rs 36 per kg, the pressure for hiking cane prices for growers ahead of next years Assembly elections would be obvious.The outlook for cotton prices has similarly brightened after a global slump, reducing Indias exports of the nature fibre from $3.64 billion in 2013-14 to $1.94 billion in 2015-16. The accompanying decline in domestic realisations for kapas (raw, un-ginned cotton), from Rs 5,000-5,500 to Rs 4,000-4,200 per quintal, apparently had some role in the setbacks to the ruling BJP in Gujarats district and taluka panchayat polls last November.But that has changed significantly. In the past three months alone, international cotton prices have surged from around 69 cents to over 81 cents per pound. The US Department of Agriculture on Friday forecast global ending stocks for 2016-17 at 89.61 million bales, the lowest since 2011-12 when prices were really on fire.We can expect kapas realisations to be better than last year, said Dhiren N Sheth, president, Cotton Association of India. That would be great news, especially for Maharashtras farmers who have sown more area under cotton this time. Having endured back-to-back droughts, a combination of increased production, courtesy copious monsoon rains, and higher prices couldnt have come at a better time.Neelkanth Mishra, India equity strategist for the Swiss investment banker Credit Suisse, estimates that the countrys gross value of crops and livestock production  farm incomes, in other words  registered an average annual growth of 13.9 per cent from 2004-05 and 2013-14. The contribution of global prices to this can be seen from overall agricultural exports, which soared from $7.53 billion in 2003-04 to $43.25 billion in 2013-14.The subsequent two years, however, witnessed the end of the global commodity boom. As prices collapsed, so did the value of Indias agri-exports to $32.53 billion in 2015-16. Farm income growth also slid to 4.8 per cent in 2014-15 and 2.8 per cent in 2015-16, according to Mishra.An example of what global prices can do is provided by rubber. In 2011-12, average prices of benchmark RSS-4 grade sheets were Rs 208.50 per kg in Kottayam, Kerala. On a production of 903,700 tonnes, the value of this rubber would have been roughly Rs 18,842 crore. But in 2015-16, the average price was Rs 113.06/kg, a level uneconomical for many growers. As they discontinued tapping, production fell to 562,000 tonnes and that was worth just Rs 6,354 crore  a third of what growers grossed in 2011-12.But like in other farm commodities, a mild revival of fortunes is now visible even in rubber. RSS-4 prices in Kottayam have climbed to Rs 142/kg, up from Rs 117.50 at this time last year. If replicated across other crops in a good monsoon year, there can be nothing better for the economy and, perhaps, for the NDA government as the next election season approaches.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

590474797be9e04154df721b,Trends in progress of sown area of khariff crops shows that it will be difficult to meet targets,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trends-in-progress-of-sown-area-of-khariff-crops-shows-that-it-will-be-difficult-to-meet-targets/,2016-08-18,"The numbers released by ministry of agriculture just before the advance of the southwest monsoons targeted a 7.1% increase in total food grain production in 2016-17. Both khariff and rabi grain output was expected to go up by the same extent to push up total food grain production to 270.1 million tons. This was indeed an ambitious target as it would require that the increase in food grain production be stepped up to the highest level in the last five years.However, the progress of the khariff sowing season has lent hopes that the grain production this year would match the ambitious targets laid out by the government. Numbers released for the period up to the middle of August shows that the sown area in the current khariff season has touched 954 lakh hectares which is 6.5% higher than the sown area in the corresponding period of the same previous year.However, the increase in the sown area has been uneven across the major states. Among the four states with the largest sown area, and which account for close to half the total sown area in the country, only Maharashtra had registered a sizable 15% increment in gross cropped area. One reason for this may be the increase in states rainfall, which went up close to a quarter during the current season.However, the total sown area in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the other major states with the maximum sown area, have remained largely stable. This is surprising because the increase in rainfall in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has been higher than in Maharashtra. Among other states with extensive cultivation Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have also registered a substantial increase in the gross sown area in the current season.But a crop wise investigation of the trends in the progress of the total sown area shows that increase has not been in proportion to the targets set in case of many crops. In fact only in the case of rice and pulses has been the increase in sown area been commensurate with the production targets set. So while the agriculture ministry targets has set that the khariff rice crop be increased by 2.7% and the pulse production be raised by 32.1% the sown area for these crops has increased by 7% and 33.2% so far which indicates that the targets can hopefully be achieved.But in case of other crops the increase in sown area has not been very significant. For instance in the case of coarse cereals and oil seeds the ministry has targeted 16.4% and 36.5% increase in khariff output. However, the trends in the progress of the sown area so far shows that sown area has so far only increased by 6% and 5.1% respectively. To achieve the targeted increase in output the productivity of these crops has to go up substantially in both cases.However, the worst case scenario is seen in the commercial crops like sugar cane and cotton. The targets set out by the ministry would expect sugarcane and cotton output to increase by 2.4% and 17.9% respectively. However, the trends in the sown area indicate that the crop under sugar cane has declined by 8% while that under cotton has fallen by 8.9%. That would make the achievement of the targets difficult if not impossible in the current season.So the overall assessment is that while the good monsoons has improved the prospects of achieving the target set for important crops like rice and pulses it does not seem to have very much improved the prospects of others like coarse cereals, oilseeds, sugar cane and cotton. The country has to roll out more innovative programs to improve productivity of important crops if it is the raise agriculture output to much higher levels."

Local BJP MLA Manda Mhatre has also launched an attack on the officer, who has barely completed three months in office. I am not saying he is a bad officer. But I must say he should take people of the area into consideration before taking action, Ms. Mhatre had earlier said.The Opposition Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is ruling the NMMC, has, however, decided to wait and watch.Mr. Mundhe, on the other hand, says he is just going by the book. I have been doing my duty and following the law. It is possible that people do not like the way I work and may find me strict. But I have to do my duty and I will continue to do so, he said.Mr. Mundhe, who was posted as the Solapur collector prior to this, had his fair share of critics there as well. While water conservation activists gave him credit for reducing the number of water tankers used in the district during the recent drought-like situation, politicians protested against his policies, saying they hurt the interests of sugar factories. Such was the discontent against him in the political leadership that the districts guardian minister Vijay Deshmukh himself joined the protest demanding his ouster.I am not blaming any political party or leader. They are doing their work and I am doing mine. If there are some problems, those can be solved by mutual understanding between the two sides, said Mr. Mundhe.His challenge is to motivate the administration to work as per the rules, he said. I have been observing problems in several departments of the corporation such as land use, building permission, etc. We are working on them and making the process more systematic, he said.In the past three months, the corporation has taken action against over 15,906 hawkers; 287 buildings for encroachments, 1,412 slums; 30 religious places and 1,994 illegal banners and hoardings, as per NMMC data.Action against illegal dumping of debris alone has helped NMMC earn over Rs. 46.97 lakh."

Latur district had faced drought this year.Molasses released from a sugar mill has polluted a reservoir, the only source of water in Darji Borgaon village in Renapur tehsil of Latur district in Maharashtra, locals have alleged.Rena Co-operative Sugar Mill, controlled by a local political leader, allegedly discharged tonnes of molasses in the reservoir earlier this month. Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has issued a notice to the mill, the district Collector said when contacted. The villagers, along with the Art of Living organisation, built this cement nullah bund at a cost of Rs 6 lakh. It is the only source of drinking water for the village. After it was built last August, the water lasted us entire year, said advocate Jabbar Pathan, a resident.In the first week of this month, molasses from Rena sugar mill were unscrupulously discharged into the stream,which has left the water unfit for drinking and destroyed the aquatic life in the reservoir, he added. Bhagwat Mane, deputy sarpanch, claimed that the authorities were reluctant to take action against the mill. We have no option but to depend on tankers for the drinking water now. In spite of writing a letter to the collector on August 8 and tehsildar on August 12, no action has been taken, Mane said.Latur district collector Pandurang Pole said the MPCB had issued a notice to the mill. It is true that Rena cooperative sugar mill has discharged molasses into the water which caused pollution. We have received complaints from villagers, but as the issue was not under my jurisdiction, we informed the MPCB which issued a notice to the mill, he said. We have decided to provide the village with a specialwater supply scheme, and I will make sure that the mill bears the cost of it.

""This is news to me. We have not made any statements about that (Sharif's visit to Washington),"" Peter Lavoy, special assistant to the US president and senior director for south asian affairs at the national security council of the White House, told PTI. ""If it is pakka (final) you would be the first to hear.""The rethink  or at least holding back the announcement  of the visit comes after the administration conveyed to Islamabad that it will not certify the effectiveness of Pakistan counterterrorism operation to Congress to enable passage of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), the military reimbursement aid that goes towards keeping Pakistan solvent.As part of its rentier-state ethos, Pakistan provides logistical support to US and coalition forces in Afghanistan and in turn bills Washington for reimbursement.The CSF was scheduled to end following the US drawdown from Afghanistan in December 2014, but the Obama government extended the program for another year through a legislation containing additional conditions, including a requirement for certification by the defence secretary that Pakistani military operations are rolling up terrorist networks, including the Haqqani group in North Waziristan.But true to form, Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment has again suckered Washington fooling the US by keeping the death from illnesses of Taliban supremo Mullah Omar and Jalalludin Haqqani while trying to manage their succession.The manipulation, coming after Osama bin Laden being sheltered in Abbottabad, has further eroded trust in a country with a long history of lying and dissembling. Although US policy of forbearance is centered around its fear of Pakistan's collapse, that tolerance is being tested in the face of the Pakistani military-intelligence's serial malfeasance, including its continued patronage of terrorists associated with the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in which six Americans died.""The US move is politically more damaging for Islamabad than its financial impact, which is significant nevertheless for being an important source for narrowing the current account deficit. More importantly, it coincided with the deterioration in ties with Afghanistan because of Kabul's allegations that Islamabad continued to harbor Taliban bases from where attacks were being launched,"" Karachi's Dawn newspaper, which first reported the rupture, said on Thursday.""The US decision is also likely to sour ties in the run-up to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's scheduled visit to White House in October,"" it added.Pakistan's economy is both parlous and perilously-poised, despite frequent juggling of numbers in a country that does not even conduct a regular census. With economic growth barely matching projected population growth, it is reduced to living on aid and remittances. Even aid is starting to dwindle after its familiar patrons in the Gulf have pulled the plug and its sugar daddy China has not come through with the expected bail-outs.Desperate to keep the US pipeline open, the Pakistani military, which runs the country's foreign policy on behalf of the nominal civilian government, has been decimating its civilian population with every-day air-strikes this week in North Waziristan, announcing dozens of dead ""militants"" which no one is able to authenticate due to lack of access.However, the country's continued patronage of terrorists on its eastern flank with India, including its protection of UN designated terrorists such as Hafiz Saeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, indicates there has been no fundamental change in its policy.With Pakistan's salience to American objectives declining in the context of US outreach to Iran and the drawdown in Afghanistan, some scholars are now pressing for a review of Washington's ties with Islamabad. In a Foreign Affairs magazine piece headlined ""An Unworthy Ally,"" C Christine Fair and Sumit Ganguly have argued that the time has come for Washington to ""cut Pakistan loose,"" going as far as to suggest punitive sanctions against Pakistani elite, including visa denials to its top generals and officials who support terrorism.* ""Since the current approach has little chance of aligning Pakistan's interests with those of the United States, the time has come for Washington to change course. If Washington cannot end Pakistan's noxious behaviors, it should at least stop sponsoring them.""* ""Despite Barack Obama's understanding of Pakistan's misdeeds ... his administration, like his predecessor's, has failed to develop policies that limit American complicity in them. As a result, Washington has continued to pay Pakistan to do what any sovereign state should do: eliminate terrorists exploiting its territory.""* ""All the while, the United States has not required Pakistan to stop backing militant groups, such as the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, even as Islamabad battles those militants who have turned against the state. Indeed, Islamabad has created a permanent revenue stream by arguing that so long as it is fighting militants, it should be entitled to US aid. The United States has been willing to comply because it considers the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons a core national interest.""* ""The strategic demands of today's South Asia are distinct from those of the Cold War era, but the central dynamic of US-Pakistani relations remains constant. The United States turns a blind eye to Pakistan's misdeeds because it depends on the country's leaders to counter US enemies in the region-first the Soviets, now the melange of militant groups active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. As a result, the United States has subsidized both the expansion of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and its stable of Islamist terrorists through programs ostensibly created to manage those same concerns.""* ""Past attempts to induce Pakistan to change its behavior have largely failed, and there is little reason to believe that a change in course is imminent. Indeed, what little convergence of interests existed between Washington and Islamabad during the Cold War has long since disappeared. After six decades of policy predicated on Pakistani blackmail, it should be possible to achieve US interests with a different approach.""* ""A strategy of containment is the United States' best option. Above all, US relations with Pakistan should be premised on the understanding that Pakistan is a hostile state, rather than an ally or a partner."""
58ff31177be9e04153145f49,Maharashtra Cooperation minister hints at major reforms in sugar sector,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-cooperation-minister-hints-at-major-reforms-in-sugar-sector/,2016-08-26,"Maharashtra Minister for Cooperation Subhash Desh-mukh has signalled the governments readiness to usher in major reforms in the sugar industry, which could pave the way for gradual decontrol of the sector. These reforms come at a time when around 50 per cent of the sugar mills in the state are in various degrees of financial distress.Deshmukh said the state was in favour of doing away with the renewal of crushing licenses for the mills. Crushing licenses are issued by the sugar commissionerate before the start of the crushing season, and mills that start operating without it can invite penal action.The need for yearly renewal of crushing licences is cumbersome and the state government is in favour of scrapping it. Mills need to send us a proposal on this and we will take it up with the Centre, to make the necessary changes in the Sugarcane Control Act, he said.The move, Deshmukh said, was in line with the governments attempt to deregulate industries and reduce the number of licences required. He said that the government had already brought down the licences necessary for setting up of industries from 60 to 27. Like other sectors, the sugar sector should be allowed to regulate. We are also in favour of reducing other restrictions, such as aerial distance between two mills, he said.The proposals, he said, should come from the sector and the state would then take it up with the Centre. Last season, 177 mills had gone for crushing.While ruling out immediate financial boosters for the mills, Deshmukh said the state would help in restructuring their loans or selling of excess land to help mills get on their feet.Watch Video: Whats making newsBy 2019, all cane fields in the state should be under drip irrigation, Deshmukh said. During our meeting with sugar millers, it was proposed that the government and the mill owners contribute in setting up of drip facilities along with farmers. We will consider it, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: August 26, 2016 2:26 am"

With his retirement at the end July, the city lost one of its culinary titans that quietly shaped the food that we ate.Distinct cuisinesAfter all, the Vivanta by Taj - President is home to three restaurants, each serving a distinct cuisine: Thai Pavilion, Trattoria (the Italian coffee shop) and Konkan Caf in addition to the bar, Wink (which replaced the iconic Library Bar).Solomons replacement is chef Chakravarthy, whos already done one major stint at the property though his most recent position was as Executive Chef of Vivanta by Taj - Yeshwantpur, the hotel chains largest property in Bengaluru.Chakravarthy has had a peripatetic childhood, since his father worked in government education, and as a result, has lived all over the country. His tenure with the Taj Group of Hotels has mirrored that constant movement, and hes spent time in hotel kitchens in Delhi and Hyderabad in addition to his stints in Mumbai (where he worked under Solomon).Smooth handoverThe day we caught up with Chakravarthy, he was still living in the hotel while looking for accommodation following the move. With a perpetual toothy smile and the coolness that comes with experience, Chakravarthy elaborated on his past with the hotel group, as well as his plans for the future.Hed spent between close to a decade at the Vivanta by Taj - President before moving to Bengaluru in 2011, so hes familiar both with the hotel and its staff. This allowed his handover from chef Solomon to be short, as opposed to the normal month that a change of guard would normally take. He says, Im so used to this hotel, so the handover was just four days.When asked about his relationship with Chef Solomon, Chakravarthy said with enthusiasm, I think, the best, you can say. Every second day he used to call me up or I used to call him up. Not because of the operations, but I saw this, this is nice. Why dont you try it? And I used to say, this is very nice, why dont you try it? I had a very good rapport with him.Ringing in changeWhile talking to Chakravarthy, what becomes evident is that he knows the Vivanta by Taj - President intimately, and that he was involved in some way or the other when it came to most of the changes that have been made to refresh the lobbys three restaurants.So Trattoria has gone from a pizzeria and pasta joint, which got converted into a very Italian eatery, where you get a lot of meats. Obviously pizza and pasta is an integral part, [but theres also] lots of antipasti and good deserts, he says.Chakravarthy talks about introducing seafood like sea bass and John Dory to diners when the Italian eatery was re-launched in 2000 with a giant mural along the back wall, pink sofas to add more colour to the newly redesigned space.It was renovated again in 2013, though most of the menu is still the same.Similarly, he was a deputy to chef Solomon when Thai Pavillion was redesigned moving from the brightly lit, some might even call it kitschy interiors to the moody and minimal space it is today. The interiors, crockery and food got a facelift, and Chakravarthy remembers getting involved in all aspects of the changes: from adding new sauces to the tables to changing the cutlery.True to flavourIf Chakravarthy has an overarching vision, it is not to tamper with the philosophy and passion that have built each of the propertys restaurants.He points out that all three restaurants are very rustic and theyre fast food, He clarifies, he doesnt mean the term in the sense of processed food, but that the food has to reach the table, fresh and hot, without skimping on flavour. When it comes to his own cooking viewpoint, he says, make it simple.The hotels three restaurants exemplify this maxim, as each restaurant uses traditional techniques to bring a sense of authenticity to the plate. So whereas other coastal eateries use liberal amounts of butter to toss their seafood, at Konkan Caf, the dish is cooked as it would be in a Malabar home. Similarly, the sauces at Thai Pavilion are made using recipes that were learned in Thailand, and not in a Thai restaurant, where tradition often loses out to efficiency.Immediate changesThe changes Chakravarthy plans to make immediately are to the modernise the patisserie and baked goods on offer, both for hotel guests at breakfast and that are sold through Sugar and Spice, the hotels patisserie.Chakravarthy spends time in the kitchen daily, in addition to overseeing the large team of chefs that take care of hotel restaurants and banquet requirements. He makes it a point to prepare food daily whether its for service or just the testing of new recipes, ingredients and ideas. He says, If you stop cooking, your ideas stop.The author is a freelance writerAll three restaurantsare very rustic and theyre fast food.

590473fe7be9e04154df716a,The countdown has begun,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/first-person/the-countdown-has-begun/,2016-08-29,"I am back from Apollo Group of Hospitals in Chennai with a MELD (The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score of 22.This is an internationally-accepted objective measure of how urgently a patient needs a liver transplant within the next three months. The score ranges from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill). Based on the lab values of Bilirubin (a measure of how effectively my liver is excreting bile); INR (how effectively its clotting blood) and Creatinine (my kidney function), MELD helps hospitals and governments agencies monitoring liver donation prioritize patients waiting for a transplant.I am O+, which means I am a universal donor, but when it comes receiving blood products or a liver, I am at a disadvantage. I dont have antigens A or B, which makes me a rare blood group type. So, in order to prevent the tumor in my cirrhotic liver from growing at its current alarming speed, I need to undergo Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). During TACE, the radiology team will administer drugs into my hepatic artery to kill the tumor. A non-invasive procedure, it will buy me three months wait period.The wait list at a multi-speciality hospital is a dynamic list, where a patients name rises and falls every week, depending upon the number of cadavers received, matched (as per the recipients blood group, weight etc) and the physical availability of the patient.It made sense for me to register at two hospitals in Mumbai (Jupiter and Kokilaben) and 5 Apollo Group hospitals in Chennai, where I have to rush to within three-four hours flight time  for thats how long the hospital can keep a cadaver liver alive. There are others in the line-up at Apollo Chennai, which, I realize has turned into a cadaver capital of the world, with patients flying in from across the globe.At the hospital that receives a cadaver from the Zonal Transplant Co-ordination Centre (ZTCC), a not-for-profit government agency, the medical team calls the first three patients on the wait list and if, God forbid, the first happens to be running fever, the second is unable to arrange funds, the three is unable to make it to the hospital in the given time slot, the liver will be assigned to the fourth patient.The name shuffle also happens if, during the interim, the patient on the wait list dies, or receives his transplant at another hospital, where he was higher up on the list. I am at No.#2 to No#5 on the four hospital lists, Ive chosen to register with.To be on the active list, Ive had to pay a fee (anything between Rs 5000 to Rs 60,000 at each hospital) that is re-fundable if I dont end up taking the liver from that hospital, or pop off, in the meanwhile.Therefore, I must keep my bags ready, my funds liquid, my sagging spirit high, and remain in the best of physical fitness and mental health to stay in the race and be able to answer the hospital call anytime of the day or night. I am now the mistress of my destiny.While my family is assisting me in the funds department, I have to concentrate on keeping enough work in the pipeline at www.writesolutions.co to have my fledgling content development practice running, my kitchen fires burning, and be able to overall support my aged father and my young daughter survive the crisis, during the two months post-surgical recuperation. As the sole bread earner of my family, I must live or die in harness.Since my cirrhotic liver is not allowing me to make or store adequate amount of proteins and have begun to lose weight, in order to remain in a fighting fit condition in preparation of my surgery, my dietitian has advised six egg whites a day, lots of fish, milk, pulses, soya and fresh fruits, and advised me to switch to a no fats, no oil, no sodium (salt), low sugar diet. Eat like a baby, frequent, small meals, bland, mashed and cooked well, she said, or you can end up cannibalizing your weak muscles.Meanwhile, Ive also been issued a strict exercise regiment by my physiotherapist  if you want to bounce back on your feet quickly and not stay on the vent for longer than a day, he cheered.I broke down during my psychiatric evaluation, so the shrink had to re-schedule it for another day. Get a grip on yourself, my good natured bro-in-law chided. You dont want this to be a hurdle, he winked and I understood the pointlessness of being vulnerable, when I have such limited options. Surely, I want a second shot at life?Since, I have severe edema (fluid retention in my legs) due to the malfunctioning liver, Ive been advised to restrict my fluid intake to 1 liter a day (max), and have a diuretic to flush out the excess fluid build-up. The daily ablutions should be normal, so exercise daily my physio warned.As I walked into my home-cum-office today morning, my daughter greeted me with, Did you take pictures in Chennai, Mama? and before I could find a suitable answer, my concerned intern chimed in, Did you find a cadaver, Maam?Sometimes, I dont know whether to laugh or cry at the ghoulish tale, unfolding in my life.Why me? I want to ask my God.And then the answer comes, Why not me?"
58f21f40a3d24b68099aa52b,Sweet surrender likely with sugar prices on the rise,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Sweet-surrender-likely-with-sugar-prices-on-the-rise/article14597240.ece,2016-08-30,"The effects of drought in parts of the country over the past two years are set to impact prices of sugar and confectionary items, with shortfall in sugar production in India causing a demand-supply gap.A research report by Rabobank has predicted that India would witness major a shortfall in production during this financial year and will have to import sugar, which will push prices upwards.India, the worlds second-largest producer of sugar, will witness a fall in production by 3.7 million tonnes due to consecutive droughts in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and will become a net sugar importer in 2016-17, Rabobank analysts Sudip Sinha and Kelvin Chow said in the report. Since mid-April, worldwide prices of raw sugar have risen by 30 per cent as the market started factoring in potentially lower global sugar output in this year. Domestic sugar prices across Asia also reflect the tighter supply situation.In Mumbai, sugar is retailing at Rs. 41 per kg, and the prices have gone up by Re.1 in the past three months, mostly due to inadequate supplies. As per figures with the Indian Sugar Mills Association, production in the state has dropped in the past year. Higher price trend is likely to persist over the next few quarters and will have substantial impact on Asian Food & Beverage (F&B) corporate margins The report Hurry Cane: Managing Higher Sugar Prices in Asia said.According its estimates, Asia is heading towards its first sugar deficit in over five years, and this is being led by India. Sugar production in Asia is expected to be significantly lower in the 2016-2017 sugar season, as the 2015 El Nio-induced drought pulled output down to a five-year low. For 2015-16, the forecast is that Asia will witness a deficit of an estimated two million tonnes, the report said.While Europe and Brazil could see improved production next year, the world is expected to face a sugar deficit of 5.5 million tonnes in the next sugar season, it said.While households will have to shell out more to meet their regular demand of sugar, that too in the upcoming festival season, prices of confectionary products and soft drinks may go up if the manufacturers decide to pass on the additional burden to consumers. The production cost of dairy items, mainly condensed milk and ice cream, will also go up, putting pressure on the manufacturers profit margins.The largest sugar consuming sectors are processed food-based products, confectionery and the traditional sweet-making industries, which will bear the brunt. The twin impact of sustained demand and lower 2015-16 production has pulled Asian sugar inventory to historic lows... sugar prices in the region have increased by 30-50 per cent since 2015, the report said.With subdued production expected during this year and sustained growth in demand, prices would remain high until the fourth quarter of 2016. In India, domestic prices have risen over the past 6 months and if users are slow to react, it could mean ballooning costs and a squeeze on profit margins, it said."

It has proposed a 20.5MW bagasse-based cogeneration plant.The transmission line is critical for transmitting the power generated from this plant to the MSETCL grid. In phase-I, 12MW of power generated by the cogeneration plant would be transmitted to the grid.Petitioners Vinayak Anand Tambe and others claimed that the authorities of the sugar cooperative executing the work in its capacity as transmission licensee and MSETCL had deviated from the consolidated sanctioned map to ensure that the towers erected for the line did not pass through lands owned by influential farmers, but through plots belonging to small and marginal farmers.They contended that the Pune SDO, despite being aware of the sanctioned map, went on to pass the impugned (under challenge) order of injunction against them. Moreover, they stated that the MSETCL did not follow the due process like giving an advance intimation to the petitioners regarding proposal for the hight tension line, survey of land for the same purpose and inviting objections, if any.Apart from the Pune SDO, MSETCL's executive engineer for high tension construction work and Ghodganga sugar cooperative's chairman Ashok Pawar and managing director Sambhaji Patil are named respondents in the matter.MSETCL's executive engineer Mahendra S Katange, who filed an affidavit in the high court earlier this month seeking dismissal of the petition on various grounds, confirmed the court's stay order on the project.Ghodganga sugar cooperative chairman Ashok Pawar said, ""We have invested close to Rs100 crore in the cogeneration plant, which will be providing electricity to MSETCL's transmission grid. Our role is confined to executing the work as a transmission licensee, while all the planning and sanctioning for the transmission line has been done by the state transmission utility.""He said, ""The claims made by the petitioners are not in tune with the factual position. Since the matter is sub-judice, I won't be able to speak much before it is settled by the court. MSETCL has planned the transmission line as per legal provisions."""

The idea is aimed at ensuring more supply into the market so that prices would not go up drastically. The mills are asked to stock maximum 37% of their total produce.An official announcement on the norm is expected in a couple of days, a senior official from the state cooperation department said.The current retail market prices of sugar are in the range of Rs 40 to Rs 45. Every year the prices surge during the festival season. To avoid it, the government has decided restrict the sugar stock to 37% of the total production. The mandatory export quota will not not be included in this stock limit .P G Medhe, consultant to the Chhatrapati Rajaram Cooperative Sugar Mill here said that sugar mills will be allowed to keep only 37% stock from October 1. This would push the mills to sell more sugar in the retail market and the excess supply will keep the prices under control.A senior trader said that the Union and the state governments are aware of the fact that people will not buy more sugar just because prices are down.Sugar production in the state has gone up consistently in the past three years. The unsold sugar has led to piling up of stock and putting pressure on factories. There has been financial assistance from the government to the factories, but it has limited reach. Had the government increased its assistance, factories would have been able to sell the sugar in the market, sources said.In June, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, the premiere bank at state level among the cooperative sector, has kept the sugar valuation unchanged at Rs 3,100 per quintal. This has helped in stabilising the prices in the wholesale as well as the retail market.The actual prices are, however, hovering around Rs 3,550 to Rs 3,600 per quintal."

According to leadership guru Steven Denning, the life expectancy rate of Fortune-500 companies has reduced from around 75 years in the 1950s to less than 15 years now. Defying this average, a list of Indian companies have been in existence for over 100 years  and several of them are still going strong.Year of Inception 1879 Headquarters Mumbai Promoters Public shareholders and Nusli Wadia FamilyBombay Dyeing Company turned to textile only after it started suffering huge losses in its dyeing business in the early 1900s. This was around the time when Indian cloth merchants stopped importing cloth from Chinese manufacturers.""It can therefore be surmised, Bombay Dyeing flourished along with the domestic textile industry in Bombay,"" says corporate historian Raman Mahadevan.The company has managed to stay afloat over 100 years, despite competition, cut-throat price wars and emergence of low-cost upcountry manufacturing centres across the country.""The company's ability to innovate and modernise continuously has helped it survive long,"" Raman Mahadevan adds.However, Bombay Dyeing has not been a great performer - in terms of corporate earnings - over the past few years. The company's profit margins have shrunk significantly since 2013-14. In the last financial year, Bombay Dyeing suffered a loss of Rs 85.24 crore. The company management blames economic sluggishness as one of the reasons for the poor show.Bombay Dyeing's real estate vertical - Bombay Realty - has had problems securing clearances for its residential projects. The textile division is facing headwinds from cheaper substitutes manufactured by the unorganised sector. Bombay Dyeing's polyester division was dogged by falling crude prices and the resultant drop in polyester prices.In the near future, the company intends to outsource textile manufacturing to reduce cost. Strengthening of the 'Bombay Dyeing' brand is also on the cards.Year of Inception 1902 Headquarters Gurgaon Promoters Public shareholders and Jindal familyShalimar is billed as the oldest paint company in South Asia. A clutch of government agencies such as Central Public Works Department, NTPC, Indian Railways, BPCL and IOC feature in its long list of loyal clients.""We have several institutional clients who have stayed with us for more than three generations,"" says Surender Bhatia, CEO of Shalimar Paints. ""A robust product range and a strong network of dealers and customers have helped us perform well all these years,"" he adds.The company has made rapid strides in the recent past, moving from ubiquitous distempers to emulsion paints, water-based colours, weatherproof paints and new-age decorative colours. Today Shalimar boasts of giving 55,000 colour options to its clients. The company recorded profit of Rs 5.2 crore on a sales turnover of Rs 403 crore last fiscal.""Consumer taste changes every 4-5 years. We try to keep pace with changing tastes. The company is also getting re-branded as we speak. The idea is to make Shalimar a modern company,"" says Bhatia.Year of Inception 1863 Headquarters Mumbai Promoter Public shareholders and Nusli Wadia FamilyBombay Burmah Trading Corporation (BBTC) was established in 1863 by Wallace & Company, a firm controlled by a Scottish family of six brothers based in London.According to Raman Mahadevan, a Bengaluru-based business historian, Wallace brothers set up their business in India with the help of a Parsi entrepreneur Framjee Nusserwanjee Patel. The company ventured into Rangoon subsequently, sighting good business prospects. It leased out large tracts of forest land in Burma and emerged a big teak exporter.""The assumption that the Wadias had assumed control over BBTC as early as 1913 seems to be misplaced. Even as late as the 1940s, the managing agents and secretaries of BBTC, as listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, is that of Wallace & Co,"" Mahadevan adds.In the early 1900s, BBTC diversified to raw cotton, textiles and oil as well. The Wadias seem to have picked shares of the company post 1930 - and tightened its grip on the company only in the post-Independence era.BBTC is currently engaged in plantations (tea and coffee), auto electric components, healthcare, real estate and weighing products businesses. The company recorded a loss of Rs 33.15 crore in the last financial year.Adverse weather conditions and increase in wages eroded earnings in the company's tea business. Slowdown in the auto industry and real estate verticals also hit the bottom line last year. The company has started taking measures to improve its earnings. It has started replanting tea bushes to improve yield; BBTC also intends to launch a retail brand of special tea in India.BBTC is also looking to unlock in its land parcel value over the next few years. The auto-parts and healthcare divisions too have plans to expand their products and service offerings.In India since 1892 Headquarters Mumbai Promoter United Technologies CorpAbout this time next year, Otis would have installed its fastest elevator in the country, ferrying passengers 2.5 metres every second  or about 500 feet per minute. This, in itself, is not a big achievement because Otis has set up speedier lifts elsewhere in the world. The company's elevators in Burj Khalifa - the world's tallest skyscraper - hurtle from ground level to 124th floor in 59 seconds - at 10 metres per second.""Up to 80 per cent of elevators installed in India move at speeds lesser than 1 metre per second. This has to improve, without compromising on safety of passenger or their comfort,"" says Sebi Joseph, managing director of Otis Elevator Company. ""We want to make smarter elevators that will meet the rising aspirations of our customers.""Otis started actual production some six decades ago. The company has a manufacturing plant in Bengaluru, which produces 10,000 units every year. Otis has 2,600 employees in India.""Our order book is growing 20 per cent every year.

Our strategy is to make quality elevators available at all price points,"" says Joseph.Year of Inception 1907 HQ Vadodara Promoters Publicly shareholders and Chirayu Amin familyAlembic's factory, in the mid-1930s, was so technologically advanced that it manufactured its own internal combustion engine running on 'power alcohol' - a product that mixed alcohol with petrol in a 4:1 ratio to increase engine performance and efficiency, while reducing pollution at the same time.Later, in the 1940s, when public sentiment turned against alcohol in Gujarat, Alembic moved on to making cough syrups, vitamins, tonics and antibiotic drugs.""We've faced challenges every decade, but strong fundamentals have helped us sail through. We've never taken short-cuts in business,"" says Pranav Amin, managing director of Alembic.""Our strong point is that we respect technology a lot. We never ever backed out of investing in technology,"" Amin added.Alembic Pharmaceuticals reported profits of Rs 698 crore last fiscal. The company's international generics vertical reported 75 per cent Y-o-Y growth, driven by strong traction in the US.The US generic business is likely to drive international business over the next two years on the back of 13-14 product launches, according to an HDFC Securities stock report.""The world has become a very dynamic place. Companies have to be nimble-footed. We have to keep re-inventing every day,"" Amin sums up.Year of Inception 1839 Headquarters Chennai Promoters Public shareholders and Murugappa GroupLike all free traders, the lure of commodities brought Thomas Parry, an English trader, to India. Parry & Co started off as a general trading company dealing in sugar and spirits.""By the late 19th century, the company had emerged as one of the largest traders of sugar with a firm grip over South Indian market. Parry & Co was so strong then that it floated two separate companies  East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories Ltd,"" says business historian Raman Mahadevan.In 1962, Parry & Co merged the two companies to become EID Parry. The Murugappa group acquired control over EID Parry in 1981.EID Parry reported profits of Rs 25.34 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal compared with the corresponding quarter loss of Rs 138 crore in the previous year. The standalone sugar business of the company logged a PBIT (profit before interest and tax) of Rs 56 crore. The bio-products division (comprising pesticides and nutraceuticals) registered a PBIT of Rs 4 crore.""The company's performance was satisfactory, largely due to better price realisation on sugar. Going by the current trend in prices, the sugar scenario for the year remains positive,"" stated EID Parry managing director V Ramesh in a post-results media release.EID Parry, along with its units, has nine sugar factories having a capacity to crush 39,000 tonnes of cane a day, generate 160 MW of power and four distilleries having a capacity 230 kilolitres a day.Year of Inception 1887 Sector Jute Headquarters Kolkata Promoter BP AgarwalThe fortunes of Kamarhatty Company hit a downward spiral in the early 1980s, when plastic became more accepted in the packaging industry. Labour unrest, lower demand for jute and rising cost of production crippled the company even further in the subsequent years. This was around the time when most jute companies downed their shutters across India.Shortly after the Agarwals stepped in, the company's losses mounted and it slipped into BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) - and remained there for about 10 years, until 2001.""We're still in restructuring phase. It took us a long time to turn around,"" says SK Agarwal, managing director of Kamarhatty Company.In the last financial year, Kamarhatty recorded profits of Rs 1.5 crore. The company has also diversified into newer product segments like non-woven jute and linen yarns. ""We'll survive for many years, we've got expansion plans,"" assures Agarwal.Kamarhatty is among the few jute companies that are using technology to reduce labour and increase production efficiency. The company manufactures close to 30,000 tonnes of jute every year - using almost 75 per cent of its installed capacity.Kamarhatty has reduced its head count from over 6,000 a few years ago to about 5,000 now. It intends to round off total workforce to about 2,500 in three years.""Demand for jute is slowly picking up. Several countries have banned plastic completely. These markets should give us good business in future,"" Agarwal adds. Kamarhatty faces stiff competition from Bangladesh-based jute mills, which sell their wares 30- 40 per cent cheaper than Indian companies.Year of Inception 1841 HQ Kolkata Promoter Bharat BajoriaKaamjaari, the traditional way of distributing work among garden employees, is still practised at Teesta Valley tea gardens. Every evening, after the day's work, garden supervisors are handed out chores which workers have to complete the next day.When 900 workers come for work the next day  at 7.30 am  they are fairly well aware of the tasks at hand. The 850-hectare-tea estate is divided into several sections are manned by a pool of supervisors, whose job is to walk around and inspect the work. Fifteen minutes after 4 pm, when workers file out for their homes, supervisors walk back to the estate office to get their next day's mandate. The 175-year-old company exports special teas to Japan, Germany and the UK, among other developed markets.""Discipline is the key to success of any tea garden. We still follow old British traditions,"" says RK Dixit, who has spent 60 years managing tea gardens across the North East, and is on the board of Teesta Valley Tea Company.Despite the regimented work method, the company ran into rough weather post Independence, when demand (for tea) and prices declined globally. Weather also played havoc on the crop in 1950, 1953 and 1955. In the mid-60s and 70s, the company faced problems from trade unions.""The last three years have been bad for most tea companies. Global tea prices have fallen 10-15 per cent and the cost of production is steadily going up,"" Dixit says.But he is sanguine. ""This company will live on for many years. We've already commenced uprooting old tea bushes and replacing them with new ones. New bushes will mature for plucking in 8 years and will yield for the next 40-50 years,"" Dixit adds.Year of Inception 1876 Headquarters Kolkata Sector Stock trading, NBFC operations Promoters A group of individualsThe previous management of Amluckie sold their tea gardens in the late-1960s when business became tough for the industry. The next two decades were pretty staid for Amluckie. When the current management took over reins of the company in mid-90s, it just had a capital base of Rs 20 lakh and a functional non-banking finance company (NBFC) licence.""Even brand recall was not there as the company had exited its tea business long ago,"" says Santosh Jain, CFO of Amluckie Investment Company.The company, owned by a group of individuals, does proprietary stock trading and SME lending these days. Amluckie has a loan book of Rs 10 crore.""We're profitable in a small way. We have expansion plans to grow our business. We're actively considering venturing into microfinance and asset reconstruction businesses,"" adds Jain.Promoters Public shareholders and India GovernmentBanks Allahabad Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab & Sind Bank, Central Bank and State Bank of Mysore.The Presidency banks, namely Bank of Bengal, Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay, were established by the East India Company more than a century ago with a view to manage its finances in the country and also lend money to the Indian mercantile class.However, these banks (managed by the Brits) were not comfortable lending money to Indian businessmen, mainly because they found it difficult to understand the 'HUF-way' (Hindu Undivided Family) of doing business. They failed to even grasp the 'chopda' system of book-keeping, prevalent among traditional Indian business families then. Among the three Presidency banks, Bank of Bombay was more liberal in terms of offering loans to Indians, albeit at higher coupon rates.This resulted in the setting up of banks like Allahabad Bank (1865) and Punjab National Bank (1895), with many influential Indians of those times on the board. Allahabad Bank is the oldest public sector bank in India while Punjab National Bank is the first bank to be purely managed by Indians. Freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai was actively associated with the creation of Punjab National Bank.The formation of RBI in 1935 and the promulgation of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and amendment to the Act in 1965 helped these banks to operate in a regulated environment.""These banks survived long mainly because of nationalisation in 1969. The government induced capital and also gave business to these banks to stay afloat,"" explains veteran political economist and author Amiya Kumar Bagchi.""The government forced these banks to spread out to rural areas, which strengthened their roots firmly. The Green Revolution helped these banks to grow their business portfolios significantly"" Bagchi adds.Some of these banks are facing severe stress of bad loans (NPAs) currently."

Jalarams Farsanwala, with its first Bengaluru outlet in Basveshwarnagar, just does that.Farsan in Gujarati means snacks and are eaten with almost every meal in a Gujaratis house. Hence the name Farsanwala. This joint promises premium snacks that are not expensive, says Raakesh Rajpopat, co-founder of Jalarams Farsanwala.There are few places in the city that serve a fusion of Gujarati and Marwari food, but none are authentic, says Raakesh who has outlets across different cities such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad.Farsanwala has a variety of sweets. There is mohanthal made from gram flour, ghee, milk and dry fruits; churma ladoo with wheat flour, jaggery, coconut and sesame seeds; kutchi peda that is a hard, roasted peda from khoya and dry fruits; gulab pak that is khoya cooked with rose petals; and sata, a thick maida puri like a donut with a sugar glaze. They also have the regulars  motichoor ladoo, Bengali sweets and, the ever popular, kaju barfi.In savouries they have 20 you can pick from. There is papdi that is deep fried wheat crackers seasoned with cumin seeds; farali chivda, a mixture that is usually had while fasting because it is made with potatoes and gathiya, again fries made from gram flour and condiments.They also stock up about nine varieties of baked khakra. So it is all healthy.Talking about its uniqueness, Rajpopat says At Farsanwala, we serve the most authentic Gujarati food in the whole city. The fafdas (fries from gram flour and seasoning) that we serve are just like what you would get in Gujarat on a Sunday morning. All their chefs are from Gujarat.If you are at the store, you must try the ghugra (deep-fried sweets with a stuffing of coconut, cardomom and nuts), dabeli (toasted pav sandwich with coconut, fruits and potatoes) and fafda jalebi.Other than this, they have twenty different kinds of farsan such as kutchi dabeli, kutchi ghoogra, Mumbai vada pav, undhiyu, khandvi and dhokla.On Sundays, they add specials too. We have Undhiyu (a Gujarati special vegetable made during the Sankranti festival) one day and Dal Pakwaan, the next, and somedays both. Currently, for the Shravan month, we have sabudana vada, sabudana khichdi and farali khakra, which people prefer during the fasting session.They plan to add chaats in time, including pav bhaji, pani puri and dahi puri. But that will come in a little later, says Rajpopat.Rajpopat says, A lot of people said that we were located a little away from the centre of the city... in Basveshwarnagar. But, it is the closest hub for the Gujarati community. About 70-80% of our customers are old time Gujaratis who have been in Bengaluru for 30 years or more."

The decision to float a tender was communicated to the committee members on Monday.Tasgaon sugar factory was sold to a firm of Sanjay Patil, the BJP MP from Sangli. The farmers who were shareholders of the factory objected to its privatisation.It was one of the first cases of privatisation of co-operative sectors against which farmers have been agitating since the last six years.Sanjay Sankpal, a member of the committee, said, ""The state co-operative bank cancelled the agreement with Ganpati Sangh in April this year. The minister has asked the officials of the bank to float fresh tenders. The tenders will be floated for appointing operators for long term, probably for 10 years. The shareholders will have a say in every decision of the private operator. Once the factory starts getting profit, it will be handed over to the farmers.""The state co-operative bank had issued tenders thrice, but the operators could not be finalised. The committee told the Bombay high court that the factory was sold without paying any cost. The court accepted the demand of the committee to keep the rights of shareholders intact while leasing out the factory to a private firm for operation and maintenance.""The factory is owned by 27,000 farmers from the area. The factory is closed since the last three years. Once the factory starts, over 2,500 tonnes of sugarcane will be crushed every day. It will not be sold to any private firm and the shareholders will get it back after the debt is cleared,"" Sankpal said."

The price of sugar was between Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg in the retail market last year and has been steadily increasing for the past few months.According to sources, the price of sugar is skyrocketing due to fall in production which in turn is due to the closure of sugar units like Deccan Sugars Limited last year and cane farmers switching to other crops due to non-payment of arrears to them by the factory managements. Besides, the expected rise in demand has led to some traders illegally hoarding stocks and creating an artificial shortage at the commencement of the festival season.""Sugar production has come down from 3.2 lakh metric tonnes last year to 2.5 lakh metric tonnes this year. This because the sugarcane cultivation area has come down to 32,000 hectares from 45,000 hectares during the previous years. In this kharif, sugar plantation so far is just 19,000 hectares in Telangana,"" sugar commissioner Bhadru Maloth told TOI on Tuesday. Interestingly, there was about 1.2 lakh metric tonnes surplus sugar supplies last year. In view of this, the Telangana government considered imposing entry tax on sugar imports from neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as these states were dumping the sugar stocks here as they too faced a surplus.Officials recall that farmers were given Rs 2,600 per tonne including the Fair and Renumerative Price (FRP) of Rs 2,300 per quintal last year announced by the Centre. Now, the price has gone up to Rs 3,700 per quintal. ""The crop area has not only come down in Telangana, but also in other states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka due to continuous drought,"" Maloth said.Farmers blame the state government for this current crisis and rise in sugar prices. There had been uncertainty over the fate of Nizam Deccan Sugars Limited (NDSL) for the past few years. The state government had appointed a committee that is still to come out with any concrete decisions. Three units of NDSL located at Bodhan in Nizamabad, Metpally in Karimnagar and Mombojipally in Medak district had stopped the sugarcane crushing and the units were closed last year.""Of about 40,000 farmers, who cultivate sugarcane and supply the produce to NDSL, 12,000 farmers switched to other crops while another 5,000 to 6,000 moved to other crops due to drought,"" industries department officials said."

This year also, a selection of exotic praline and cranberry sweetmeats is seen in shopfront displays.Mithai shops commonly use mawa, cashewnut paste, dried fruit and nuts, or chocolate as a base and then add different flavours or fillings to each. These are then shaped into moulds. The original favourite 'ukdiche modak' made of rice flour is not readily available off the shelf except the odd restaurant.In the bustling lanes of Thakurdwar, connoisseurs seek out small shops which work a perfect balance with the sugar content. Tuesday evening, the cooks at Swastik Dry Fruits kept bringing out large thaals of anjeer, kesar, orange, rose, strawberry and Cadbury chocolate modak. Ranging from a modest Rs 440 per kg to Rs 600, these were far more palatable than those at a famous Maharashtrian branded store nearby that curiously uses Glucon C to sweeten its modaks.Morbiwala nearby also lays out a delectable array of kiwi fruit, rose, anjeer and chocolate costing up to Rs 880.Residents of Bandra-Khar flock to Regal Plus at Pali Naka for their annual modak treat. Owner Bhushan Bandagle says, ""This year our new guava flavour is the pick of the season. Other bestsellers are black currant, orange, caramel, rose butter scotch and chocolate."" Regal's sweets in milk, mawa, chocolate and dried fruit cost between Rs 680-1,300 per kg. It also has a ""no added sugar"" selection which comes for Rs 1,650 per kg.Meanwhile, the humble 'ukdiche modak' now costs an exorbitant Rs 30 apiece at Modakam restaurant near Siddhivinayak temple. Owner Pushkaraj Gaikar says that this season, his wife and mother have been preparing the sweets at his apartment home rather than handing the task to his chefs at the restaurant. Denying labour trouble, Gaikar says the modaks are softer than before."

The factories collectively owe Rs. 900 crore to the banks.Following the meeting, State Co-operation Minister Subhash Deshmukh told mediapersons that the government is positive about helping the sugar industry. The industry is in trouble because of consecutive years of drought. The sugar mills have to repay loans of around Rs. 1,000 crore to banks. The State government will form a committee to decide on the restructuring of loans, Mr. Deshmukh said.According to an estimate, consecutive years of drought have ensured that only 99 co-operative sugar factories were functional in 2015-16, of which barely 30 to 40 may begin the crushing season this year due to a shortage of sugarcane.During 2013-14 and 2014-15, around 134 co-operative sugar factories received loans worth Rs. 3,273 crore. Instalments worth Rs. 1,000 crore are due this year. The governments decisions including capping stocks of sugar, relaxing the mandatory sugar export rule and 20 per cent export duty on sugar has led to a fall in sugar prices.Mr. Deshmukh said the delegation demanded the sugar stock cap be lifted. The State government will be requesting the Centre for the same, he said.The Maharashtra State Co-op Sugar Factories Federation Limited (MSCSFF) had claimed sugar units in Marathwada are the worst-hit as only four of 62 such units managed to begin the sugarcane crushing season."

And that's not all. Being the third largest consumer of coal, India is also the third highest producer of black carbon emissions in the world, experts added.So what should be done to bring down this carbon emission from Indian households. Ask the experts and comes the prompt reply. ""To economise and utilise more efficient solutions, the use of methanol should be encouraged over fossil fuel in domestics as well as industry set-ups,"" they said.""Methanol produces no smoke or soot when burnt and reduces health damage which ordinary cooking stoves can cause. It can also eliminate the dependence on petroleum products and natural gas,"" said Harry Stokes of US-based non-profit Project Gaia, while presenting a Methanol-fuelled stove on Friday. He was speaking at a lecture series on 'Methanol Economy for India' in the city.""India is the third highest emitter of black carbon in the world. Around 40% of this black carbon is produced in Indian homes due to cooking using solid fuel. Nearly 400 million (40 crore) people are exposed to indoor pollution here as two-thirds of the households in India still use solid fuel such as wood and charcoal for cooking,"" he added.GK Surya Prakash, co-author of 'Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy' with Nobel Laureate George A Olah, too spoke about Methanol. ""India produces 1 billion tonnes of non-edible biomass, including the large amount of sugarcane husk (bagasse) which is left over after sugar production in Maharashtra. This husk can be used to produce methanol which would cost about Rs 18 per litre,"" Prakash said.During his inaugural address Niti Ayog member VK Saraswat spoke about the uses of methanol in India. ""Cellphone towers use a significant amount of the total diesel consumption of the country. If we can switch these to methanol, it will not only greatly reduce the country's emissions, but also cut down on fossil fuel usage. Additionally, it can also be used to fuel existing vehicles with a low-cost conversion, the easiest of which will be two-stroke engines,"" he said.To promote use of this eco and pocket-friendly fuel, domestic use is a good starting point. ""There is much misconception about methanol and alcohol fuels. When people start using it at their homes, these misconceptions will gradually subside,"" Stokes said.The stove has been developed by Clean Cook Sweden AB CEO TED Orbrink and costs about $20 (approximately Rs 1,300).

Picture by Ranjeet Kumar Dey Patna, Sept. 9: Vice-President Hamid Ansari today reminded chief minister Nitish Kumar of Bihar's failings, after praising its GDP growth over the past decade. Ansari said the state needs expanding economic growth for at least two decades to join the league of developed states. ""Impressive as these gains (economy and per capita income growth) are, they have to be seen in the context of small economic base. States like Haryana and Goa have outperformed Bihar, which still has one of the lowest per capita income levels in the country,"" Ansari said. ""Bihar lags behind Madhya Pradesh by 10 years and India by 15 years. The Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation data shows the state's economy was the 14th largest in the country in 2014-15, up one spot from 15th in 2004-05."" The Vice-President was speaking after inaugurating the 90th anniversary celebrations of the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries at its headquarters in Patna before Governor Ram Nath Kovind, chief minister Nitish Kumar, deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav, chamber's president O.P. Sah and others. Ansari's comments came after he pointed out that the 10th Bihar Economic Survey Report-2015-16 - tabled by the state government in February - said the economy grew annually at 10.5 per cent from 2005-06 to 2014-15, the highest among major states in the country. Sectors like manufacturing, construction, insurance and banking in Bihar grew at over 15 per cent during the decade and per capita income from Rs 7,914 to Rs 15,640 - the state's overall contribution to the country's economy rising from 2.6 to 3.3 per cent. The Bihar economic survey report calculated per capita income at constant prices with 2004-05 as base year. But the central government data reveals that Bihar was at rock bottom when it came to per capita income in 2014-15 - be it on constant or current prices. Delhi topped the charts in 2014-15 with a per capita annual income of Rs 2.41 lakh at current prices and Rs 1.18 lakh at 2004-05 constant prices. Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Punjab had a per capita income three to five times more than Bihar's. Ansari's remarks heralded pin-drop silence. He proceeded to say the state must ""expand its economic growth and maintain its tempo for at least two decades if it aspired to join the league of developed states"". ""Bihar has tremendous potential in the agriculture sector, given its natural advantage such as fertile soil, access to river water for irrigation and warm climate,"" Ansari said. ""I'm informed the government is pursuing a 'rainbow revolution' akin to the Green Revolution, that can change the face of agriculture if implemented well."" He said Bihar must reap the demographic dividend with greater focus on education and skill development. He also emphasised that business could be conducted best under conditions of peace, stability and good governance, of which ""rule of law"" was an essential ingredient. Though Ansari went on to elaborate national and international nuances of the ""rule of law"", it left the audience wondering if his comments were a reference to the recent prohibition Act and charges about rising crime and lawlessness. Ansari honoured five industrialists with Bihar connection, namely Vedanta Resources chairman Anil Agarwal, Alkem Laboratories founder Samprada Singh, Bennett, Coleman and Company Limited managing director Vineet Jain, KK Birla Group of Sugar Companies chairman and managing director C.S. Nopany, and ITC chairman YC Deveshwar. Vineet, Samprada and Deveshwar were not present in person."

Agarwal, who is into aluminum and energy business, said his company ""will explore possibilities of setting up aluminum, oil and gas, zinc, lead, copper and silver processing units in Bihar, as the state is close to my heart."" He added that he wanted to use 75 per cent of his wealth for social service. The Vedanta Resources chairman said Bihar has become an ideal place for industrial investment with cheap land and labour, lack of labour unions, easy availability of water and electricity and a better law and order situation. ""Granting special category status to the state would have helped attract industries to Bihar. However, the status' importance will decline with GST coming in force in the country,"" he said. Expressing concern about large-scale malnutrition in the country, he said he was taking forward Prime Minister Narendra Modi's thoughts and had decided to establish 4,000 Nand Ghars, of which 500 would be in Bihar. ""These Nand Ghars would be centres where emphasis will be given on health, nutrition, medical needs and education of children and economic empowerment of women through various skills. They are expected to benefit 2.5 crore children and 1.2 crore women,"" Anil said. He said he also wanted to help develop medical facilities in his home state, and added that Bihar government should try to persuade companies like those of Baba Ramdev's Patanjali group, which is setting up huge food processing industries in Maharashtra and other states, to establish them here."

An MPCB official said that the 15 sugar factories had crushed excess sugarcane than the stipulated quantity in the 2015-16 season. It also said that industrial units have not followed norms on precautions over effluent treatment plants.Three units of these six industries are members of the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) in the Kagal MIDC area. However, they have not connected the pipeline to the plant for treating the waste material.Last year, the MPCB had forfeited bank guarantees of 17 sugar factories amounting to Rs 85 lakh for flouting environmental norms.Each year, factories have to apply for MPCB permissions to crush a specific quanityt of sugarcane each day. The quantity of pollutants generated during sugar production is proportionate to its crushing capacity.Pune divisional commissioner S Chockalingam had in June asked the MPCB to check the limit at each factory and the actual sugarcane crushed. Following this, the MPCB found 15 sugar factories that had crossed the prescribed crushing limits.During a recent visit to Kolhapur, Chockalingam had asked the MPCB to take action against those factories falling in the Panchganga river basin that crushed excess sugarcane than the allotted quota each day. He had also asked sub-divisional magistrates to take action against these establishments under section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for causing danger to public health and issue notices to these factories.N H Shivangi, regional officer of the MPCB, Kolhapur, said, ""We found that 15 factories crushed excess sugarcane than the stipulated quantity allotted each day. The proposal to seize the bank guarantees will help keep a check on other sugar factories in the next crushing season. We have sent the proposal to our head office. Once we get approval, we will seize the bank guarantee of these sugar factories.""The bank guarantee varies from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh depending on the sugarcane crushing capacity at each factory."

58f647eea3d24b0b70c29d8a,The bane of a bumper crop,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-bane-of-a-bumper-crop/article14985193.ece,2016-09-17,"Every day, around 3 p.m., hundreds of lorries loaded with onions queue up at the new agricultural market complex at Lasalgaon, around 45 km from Nashik, waiting for the afternoon auction to begin.As a group of traders approach, the farmers drop their produce at their feet, as if to tempt them into bidding high. The traders halt and look over the merchandise. A market committee employee calls out the reserve price: 400! Eyes roll, unspoken words seem to pass between the traders. Then the bidding starts: 1! 11! 13! 17! In less than 30 seconds, the auction is over. The farmer gets 17 rupees over the reserve price, Rs.417 per quintal (100 kg). A pittance at any given time, more so now when compared to prices last year.A trader-controlled marketNo matter how united the farmers are, no matter how hard they fight for a better price, they turn into mute spectators in front of the traders when auction begins. The auction is dictated by the traders with money and considerable political clout. Traders decide the price, farmers accept it without protest.The market complex has a huge parking space for the lorries. Sometimes there are up to 1,000 vehicles at a time. The otherwise deserted place comes alive twice a day. The first auction of the day starts at around 10 a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. Depending on the number of vehicles, the auction can stretch from an hour to three hours.Once the rate is fixed, the group of traders moves immediately to the next vehicle. The farmer, left with the price decided by the group, starts collecting the onions he has dropped on the ground. An official from the market committee approaches him with a receipt, bearing the auction rate, traders name and farmers name. With a receipt in hand and onions in the vehicle, the farmer then proceeds to the godown where the weighing process takes place. As per the rules laid down by the market committee, the farmer must get the payment before the end of the day, which is largely followed.After the produce is dropped off at a shed in the complex, the traders take control of it. Workers start segregating the onions according to the quality and the packaging begins. Vehicles are loaded with the produce to be sent off to cities or to different States. Traders then get into a huddle to firm up the retail price of the produce  adding their profits  with nary a concern for the farmer and the price demanded by him. The operation is bloodless and smooth.Barely breaking evenWhile onion is one of the major crops in this belt, farmers also cultivate grapes, soya bean, sugarcane, and ginger. Speaking out against the cartel of traders is not easy when the farmer is dependent largely on the onion crop, as it may result in traders ganging against him (or her) by dropping rates for his produce.Official data from the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) says that this years prices  between Rs.500-Rs.800/ql., down from Rs.970-Rs.3,786/ql.  are the lowest in the last five years. This year, Rs.1,020/ql. (in June) was the highest rate given to farmers, compared to Rs.6,326/ql. in 2015-16, and Rs.2,626 in 2014-15.Growing onions costs between Rs.50,000 and Rs.80,000 per acre, and a cultivated acre yields not more than 100 ql. With this years average selling price at Rs.728/ql., an acres worth of onions would get the farmer around Rs.72,800. This sees some farmers barely break even; many lose money.Small wonder that Milind Darade, who owns 13 acres of land, is furious. This is the only industry where producers have no right to decide the price of their product, the onion farmer from Karanjgaon, Nashik district, says. Isnt it cruel? Shouldnt we get angry? The week before The Hindu caught up with him at the Saikheda sub-market committee, Darade was given a humiliating price for his produce: Rs.5/ql., or 5 paisa/kg. If that was not bad enough, Maharashtras Minister for Co-operation, Subhash Deshmukh, said on a live television show that his onions were rotten. Let me give you some information, he says indignantly, this is the onion you eat at a restaurant. Just peel off two layers and you would wonder whether it was really rotten.Darade has preserved the official paper from the market committee with the offered rate; he has laminated it to ensure it doesnt get dog-eared. He says that he was so angry that he refused to sell his onions and brought the load, some 10-11 ql., back to his farm to use as fertiliser. But, he says, When I calmed down, it dawned upon me that I must use it to highlight the plight of onion farmers.Supply-demand mismatchSimplistically put, there was a shortage last year, and this year has seen record onion cultivation. Abundant supply has brought the prices down. The farmers, though, are used to this kind of fluctuation. They dont blame the bumper crop and supply-demand equation; they say its the traders who are conspiring against them and the government has done little  or the wrong things  to help.To understand the current crisis for farmers, we need to step back a little.India has three onion crops a year. Early kharif (the crop sowed in the monsoon) onions come to market between October and December. Onions from the rangda, or late kharif, crop arrive from January to March. The winter or rabi crop is up for sale from April to May. Usually, some parts of the rabi crop are stored for a few months to fill the gap from May to October. Traditionally, prices rise from July to October; official data show that wholesale rates rise by as much as Rs.1,000/ql., even Rs. 1,500, later reflected in the retail market with an increase of Rs.5-Rs.10/kg for consumers.In 2014-15, the onions took a hit following a hailstorm in North Maharashtra which, in turn, affected their storage value. With many rotting, the onions that did make it to market commanded high prices.Then the drought of the summer just past played a role too; many sugarcane farmers switched to the less thirsty onion this year. The onion cultivation area in the State has almost doubled in year 2015-16, says Nanasaheb Patil, Director, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED). Farmers hoped that they will get last years rate  close to Rs.3,000-Rs.4,000/ql.  which did not happen, as production increased in huge proportions.India is the worlds second-largest onion producer (after China) with 26.79 per cent of the planets land under onion cultivation and 19.90 per cent of its production. Maharashtra is Indias largest producer, with a 32.45 per cent share of total onion production, and in turn, Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for with 41 per cent of the States onion harvest. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India produced 203.33 lakh metric tonnes (MT, 1,000 kg) of onions in 2015-16, up from 189.28 lakh MT in 2014-15. Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, received around 32,680 MT in the previous fiscal year. Five months into this year, it has received 10,874 MT.To make matters worse for Maharashtras farmers, other States  notably Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka  have reported higher onion yields.Holding on for a better dayAside from the production glut, another important factor was a 40-day strike by traders in July and August, opposing the State governments decision to free agricultural market committees from government regulations. With no outlet for their rabi onions, farmers had no option but to store them and wait for the strike to end. In addition, thanks to the low prices, some farmers are choosing to not bring their onions to the markets, and instead are storing them away hoping an artificial scarcity later in the year will pay off for them.This strategy, however, comes with its own dangers: that of the crop rotting or the onions sprouting. Malti Bodke of Bhuse village points to her rotten onions with disgust. How long can we store them? Its been almost four months. Once the onions start sprouting, they lose weight, and it becomes difficult to get a higher price.The farmers also say that the traders are colluding to cheat them. Its a cartel of traders which decides the rates and once the market reopened, they ensured prices didnt cross Rs.1,000/ql., says Rajaram Fafale, from Maralgoi village.The strike gets blame for the glut. But did trade actually stop? Officials and traders seem to want consumers to believe that, but farmers say it never really stopped. Darade says that opportunistic traders discreetly approached farmers and quoted lowest possible rates. Farmers, thinking it was better to sell, even at a low price, rather than keep them and let them rot, did sell.Three years ago, when the farmers were getting Rs.4,500-Rs.5,000/ql., retail onion prices reached Rs.90/kg., which resulted in protests from the then-opposition parties, as well as consumer organisations, in Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, accusing the United Progressive Alliance government of failing to protect consumers.The governments first step was to increase the Minimum Export Price (MEP) to $1,150/MT. This made it difficult for Indian exporters to compete in international markets; whatever stock was available was diverted to the domestic market, which brought prices down. By March 2014, when the late kharif crop got to market, prices had dropped to less than Rs.1,000/ql. in the wholesale market, and consumers got theirs at Rs.20-Rs.25/kg.This may have played out well for consumers, but has had other consequences for the industry. There is absolutely no consistency in our approach towards onion exports, says NAFEDs Patil. A look at MEPs between December 2010 and December 2015 bears him out: the figure has fluctuated wildly, dropping to $0 in May 2012, and with a high of $1,150 in November 2013. It only enrages our customers overseas, says Patil. They are left with absolutely no guarantee of quantity and price of onions exported from India. These customers have instead chosen Pakistan, China and Iran, and we have lost guaranteed markets.Patil says that the governments decision to placate enraged urban customers has lost it both its farmers support and its overseas markets. The onion, he says, is no longer an agricultural commodity, it has become a political symbol.An MSP for onions?Assuming the government has to balance the needs of consumers with those of producers, what else could it have done to ensure that farmers get some return on their labour?The National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) keeps track of potential harvests by collecting information on each district. This year, despite being aware of the possibility of a bumper crop, the government appears to have failed to take any measures to protect farmers. The NHRDFs estimates say the rabi onions should be selling at around Rs.818/ql., which is significantly higher than what farmers are managing to get. If the government chose to use its Price Stabilisation Fund, it could subsidise the crop, paying, say, Rs.500/ql.What the State government has announced this week by way of relief  Rs.100 per quintal, up to a maximum of 200 quintals, or a maximum of Rs.20,000  has, to put it mildly, failed to enthuse farmers. Every farmer The Hindu spoke to called the measure not just inadequate but practically a mockery of their plight.Fafale, who sold 10 ql. at Lasalgaon for Rs. 220/ql., or Rs 2.2/kg., greeted the news with scorn. Now I will get one rupee more. What a relief! he says sarcastically. We arent begging in front of the government. What we are asking is our right. How does this government conclude that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Who advises them? Have they bothered to check the ground reality?One of the major demands the farmers have is for the government to introduce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for onions, as it has for sugarcane. Why dont the officers understand that we are not independent and traders enjoy a free run here? says Darade. Unless an MSP is announced, we cannot be sure of a certain minimum profit. Why this neglect?Western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt, has seen, in recent times, sugarcane farmers agitating for an increased MSP. It became an electoral issue in 2014 when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) suffered major defeats in the Assembly polls in the region considered a bastion for both.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS; its name means organisation for farmers self-respect), led by Raju Shetti, which was in the thick of the agitation, is now part of the State government and Shetti is an MP. While the SSS has stage limited protests in the States onion belt demanding an MSP, it has not been able to take the protests to a wider audience. With the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena regime, as with the previous Congress-NCP rule, the MSP for onions issue is far from being solved.In the village of Bhuse, Ramdas Bodke, 65, is philosophical. I have seen many seasons and farming has never been easy. We know how to tackle nature. What do we do with man-made problems? We farmers feed the world, but now we wonder whether we will have food cooked at home. He lapses into silence for a minute, and then his tone turns bitter: Did the government discuss its proposal to hike MLA salaries for even a day? The government takes an instant decision to increase the salary of MLAs, but it takes a long time to decide about farmers. This is injustice. But there is no one to give justice to farmers.As for the urban consumers and their agitations, farmers mince no words when the topic comes up for discussion. Turning towards me, one of them asks, You get agitated when prices skyrocket, but have you ever wondered what happens when prices hit rock bottom? Why dont you come out on the streets demanding a fair price for us?I have no answers.Abundant supply has brought prices down. But farmers say traders are conspiring against them and the government has done little to help"

Sugar prices have been on an uptrend since hitting a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne last July. A global sugar deficit drove up prices in the international market as well. Sugar production is estimated to have declined 11% to 25.2 million tonnes in 2015-16 season.Ratings agency ICRA expects domestic sugar production to decline by about 8% to 23.2 million tonnes during the 2016-17 season. This is largely on account of lower cane availability in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to poor monsoon rainfall last year. Although the monsoons are better this year, the impact on the cane output would be seen only in the 2017-18 season as sugarcane is a long gestation crop.Domestic sugar prices are likely to remain firm in the next 3-4 quarters, given the tight domestic stock situation, analysts tracking the sector said.However, the extent of cane price increase, especially in SAP (state advised price) following states like Uttar Pradesh , is likely to have a significant bearing on the (profit) margins of sugar mills in these states, they said. While the government has imposed 20% export duty in June and also implemented stock holding limits in September, these measures haven't acted as a deterrent to the increasing trend in domestic sugar prices, said Sabyasachi Majumdar , senior vice president, ICRA. ""Sugar prices are expected to remain firm in the near term in spite of these measures, given the tight stock position. However, these measures may dampen prospects of a further significant price rise,"" he stated.""Domestic production falling short of domestic consumption is likely to continue in 2016-17, for the second straight year a shortage of around 2.6-2.8 million tonnes,"" ICRA estimated.While sugar production is expected to decline in 2016-17, an opening stock of 7.6 million tonnes is likely to result in an overall sugar availability of 30.5-31 million tonnes, which is expected to meet the domestic consumption of around 26 million tonnes.But the closing stocks are likely to be lower than the normal sugar stock level of around 6.4 million tonnes or the equivalent of domestic consumption of about three months. While mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka are likely to benefit from the rising sugar prices and the stagnant cane costs, cane pricing in UP, which is yet to be fixed for 2016-17, will be crucial for the sustainability of the profitability for Uttar Pradesh-based sugar mills, ICRA said. ""With the FRP (fair and remunerative price) of cane for 2016-17 fixed at the same level as of the previous year and sugar prices on the higher side, the profitability of sugar mills based in Maharashtra and Karnataka is likely to improve,"" Majumdar said.""However, the extent of increase in profitability could be moderated with the decline in cane availability in these regions,"" he said."

The device, which is presently used by a Karnataka-based dairy is similar to a sugar monitoring device which will display the purity of milk put into it.""The quality of milk can be reflected by the colour of the milk sample put on the plate. If the colour remains white, it will indicate total purity while if it changes to red or blue, it will determine presence of acidic or alkaline solvents in the milk,"" said dairy development minister Mahadev Jankar , who announced his plans to develop the gadget at a function in Thane on Saturday.Presently, the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to conduct raids and ascertain purity of milk but the board has plans to seek amendments to the same following a presentation to the chief minister soon. Once an approval is sought, the device will be given to the Maharashtra dairy development department on a trial basis to randomly check quality of milk and then made public.""Once the device is easily available for the public, the common man can easily be a catalyst to weed out milk adulteration from the state as adulterators will think twice about contaminating the milk,"" he said. The gadget will roughly cost between Rs 35-50 and the dairy development board will initially use it for internal purpose and later work on making it public, said an official.Meanwhile, around 50 dairy farmers from western Maharashtra, including Sangli and Kolhapur latched on to the weekly 'direct to consumer' concept in Thane.Around 800 litres of special Kolhapur milk was brought for sale at the weekly market at Gaondevi and was immediately sold out as the product was cheaper by Rs 5 per litre as compared to that available in the market."

A little bit of modification in the daily cooking will do the trick.If you think that tastier food can be prepared only by using liberal portions of cooking oil, Preethi Trivedi, Art of Living teacher from Mumbai, believes in a different theory.Her six-day-long cookery session held at Niranjan hall, Dondaparthy crafted a new menu that lists a variety of soups, vegetable salads, sandwich made of pulses and whole wheat flour cakes sans any artificial flavour and oil.Demonstrating how steamed dahi-vada can be made at the session on Saturday, Ms. Preethi says most of her recipes include less amount of cow ghee or oil. Steamed vegetables are any time a better option. The methods we follow while cooking play an imperative part in retaining nutrient value of the vegetables. Those who are used to fried food can switch to healthier menu without compromising much on taste. Replacing oil by little amount of cow ghee, sugar by jaggery or rock sugar are some of the options that can be considered while cooking. Similarly, there are many such natural supplements available to us to lead a healthier life, she says.Ms. Preethi says there is no hard and fast rule as far as cooking is concerned. Despite using abundant oil, she says certain recipes can turn out to be a mundane stuff. Creativity plays a vital role in cooking. Variations can be brought only if we keep experimenting with new ingredients, following safe cooking methods, says the AOL teacher.Those who attended the classes said the recipes learnt can be tried with other ingredients as well. For instance, I tried plantain paratha for the first time and it came out really well. Cooking will be interesting only if we bring in innovative elements to the process, says R. Sarada. Homemakers who were part of the session found the platform quite useful as it offered something new to their little ones."

A pioneer realised three decades ago that Olympic-level athletes are not made overnight, that it is a continuous process and requires time and effort. And so S M Kaluti built a sports school.Tucked away in the remote Chandargi village of Belagavi district, this school is doing its bit to catch sporting talents young.Like Prashant E, son of an agricultural labourer from Raichur. The 13-year-old is a well-known name in cycling in India. Last month, he won a gold medal at the Association Meet National Cycling competition. Three Class 9 students bagged gold medals for securing highest points for their team in National Level Kho Kho meet held in Chhattisgarh.There are hundreds of such inspiring stories of sportsmen emerging from this school. The Composite Sports High School boasts of infrastructure for all games like football, tennis, kho-kho and Sepak Takraw  Malaysian kick volleyball game.Thirty years ago, as a wrestler, Kaluti wanted to create a sporting facility in Chandargi. But he had to battle several odds. Recalling the struggle, Kaluti says his idea was met by incredulity. Many were surprised that he wanted to start a residential sports school.As the cooperative movement was at its peak in Maharashtra and Karnataka then, he wanted to build the school on a cooperative model. But not many were enthused as they felt sugar factories would give them higher revenue. I had to convince educationists and leaders in the cooperative sector. The idea was welcomed slowly and the share holders came forward, Kaluti says.We approached the royal scion of Torgal, Uday Singh Narsoji Rao Shinde, for his palace property near Chandargi for the school. He sold the huge palace for just `1.25 lakh. He also paid the stamp duty. We purchased 18 acres around the palace and today our school is spread over 100 acres. Help poured in and the number of our share holders grew, he recalls. It is the only residential school in India which is run by a sports co-operative.During the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1983, I was stunned by the performance of international sportsmen. I thought if the right infrastructure was provided, we too could produce national-level champions. Chandargi school is best suited to prepare Olympians, says Kaluti, who is also the managing director of Munavalli Sugars in Belagavi district.Today 600 students study in this school and are involved in different sports. They are taught in both Kannada and English. Besides achieving glory in sporting events, the school has also been giving 100 per cent results in SSLC for years.It is not all play and no work for the students. Their day begins at 6am with jogging and cycling. Schooling begins at 9am and they return to their respective sports by evening for practice."

When the blood sugar level is more than 200mg per decilitre consistently for five years, a peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness and pain from nerve damage, usually in the hands and feet) is a possibility. Diabetic foot ulcers are common in such patients.While surgical debridement (cleaning dead tissue in a wound) is done commonly, lesser known maggot therapy is an option. Maggot therapy is a type of biotherapy that involves applying live, disinfected maggots on soft tissue wounds. The larvae eat necrotic/dead tissue in the wound and disinfect it. The thought of creepy crawlies in your limb may be unacceptable but it has shown successful results. Charaka Samhita, an ancient Sanskrit text that is one of the foundational texts for Ayurveda in India, mentions maggot therapy.In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of maggots as medical device. Dr BR Srinivas, a diabetologist who runs City Healthcare Hospital in Kolar, has been treating diabetics for more than a decade now. One cannot believe the kind of diabetic foot ulcers you get to see in rural areas. They are unaware of the necrotic/dead tissue. Since there is no sensation they step on foreign objects and are not aware of it. Once I found three stapler pins embedded in a patients foot, he said.Appalled by the number of patients coming with diabetic foot ulcers where the amount of dead tissue to be removed was a lot and non-healing, he turned to Charaka Samhita for a solution and treated five patients with favourable results. Now he has written to the director of AYUSH in Karnataka requesting him to use the therapy in AYUSH hospitals in the state.AYUSH director Raj Kishore Singh said that a protocol had to be developed before using it. He has also written to the Drug Controller General of India to recognise maggots as a medical device.Dr Sanjay Reddy, consultant diabetologist, Fortis hospital, Cunningham Road, said, It is rare in Indian hospitals because we are not sure where ulcer grade maggots are available. I do not have first-hand experience of working with it but even a physician can administer it. In UK, there are medical-grade maggots that are approved and are used commercially. Its been there for ages. It costs 20-30 pounds in the UK. Its legal, its available all across the world.On the aspect of legality, Indian laws are silent on maggot therapy. If one is using a new form of therapy, they should take the local ethics committee permission giving evidence for the procedure and then go ahead. But maggots therapy are not patented or anything, and neither is it a new drug or device or biological substance or biotechnology, Reddy added.Dr R Balaji, HOD, Plastic Surgery, Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, has been treating diabetic foot for the past 25 years. Id rather use surgical debridement than maggots because the latter is time consuming. Also, culture maggots are available only in Mumbai, he said."

Even as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu limped back to normalcy following friction over sharing river water, meteorological reports indicate that southwest monsoon this year may be below normal. This comes on the heels of two years of deficient rainfall, putting more pressure on groundwater resources. Water shortage poses an economic, environmental and security threat to India. Its important all levels of government understand the gravity of the situation. Things can change, but that requires an integrated approach which combines economic incentives, technology and tighter regulations.Agriculture uses about 80% of Indias water resources. A solution, therefore, must focus on changing agricultural practices. Indian agriculture is inefficient in its use of water. We use two to four times more water to produce a unit of major food crop than China or Brazil. Within India, a Punjab or a Maharashtra which are among the most water intensive producers of rice and sugar are key producer states. To get away from this suboptimal situation, governments must realise that power subsidies have had an adverse impact on irrigation patterns. States must break the groundwater-energy nexus to remove a perverse incentive to overuse groundwater.Decades of perverse incentives have led to a situation where 65% of the wells in India registered a decline when water level this year was compared with the last decades average. Action on power subsidies needs to be complemented with use of technology to carry out aquifer mapping. Efforts thus far have been haphazard and technology needs to be used more effectively. Technology and tighter regulations also need to be combined to mitigate water contamination. India may be water stressed but so is Israel, which manages its water resources far better to obviate any shortage."

When TV channels started broadcasting Ajit Pawar's statement, he clarified that he had no intention to ""hurt"" the community. Meanwhile, the Maratha community stands divided on taking a tough stand against their own leaders, who have led the community and controlled state politics and rural economy since 1960s. The community leaders, across spectrum, are not missing a single opportunity to show solidarity with those who have hit the streets in Marathwada and plan more silent marches in western Maharashtra starting next week.Political analyst Prakash Pawar said the lowest strata of the Maratha community, which has remained deprived of socio-economic development and power in politics, is voicing its anger. It's well-known that a few families among the community have dominated the state politics for years. These families control sugar mills, cooperative banks, educational institutes and financial institutions.""There is anger against the established Maratha elite, which has stifled the poor community and has kept reins of power within their families.

(Express Photo: Shubhangi Khapre) At a rally in Nanded, Sunday. (Express Photo: Shubhangi Khapre)Chhaya Ramakrishna Atkare (35), a resident of Solapur, believes reservation for Maratha community will help her tide over the financial crisis that is threatening the education of her son Prafulla who has taken admission to a private college for industrial training. The poor Maratha mill worker has paid Rs 30,000 for the admission. The private college owned by a rich Maratha leader has asked for Rs 30,000 more.Satyabhama Mulak is angry as her son Amar has been asked to pay Rs 90,000 for admission to an engineering college. The family, which owns 2 acres of land, finds it hard to meet the high cost of education in a private college and face the competition at the same time from reserved category candidates (Dalits/OBCs) to get a seat in government colleges.As the Maratha rallies gain momentum across the state, the divide between the haves and have-nots within the community has come to the surface. After every rally in Latur, Nanded and Solapur, women from rural and urban Maharashtra expressed anger against the established Maratha leaders who have failed to address their concerns in the field of education and employment. The Marathas constitute 33 per cent of the population and almost two-thirds live in rural Maharashtra. Almost 70 per cent of this population is engaged in agriculture.The middle class and the poor among the community are unanimous in their feeling of being let down by established Maratha leaders who are education barons, own cooperative banks, dairy cooperatives and sugar cooperatives.At the grassroots, the message is loud and clear: there are only a handful of Maratha families that have wielded socio-economic and political control for the last six decades. In spite of massive education network, there is not a single college owned by these education barons where meritorious students from the poor in the community have received financial concessions.A report compiled on the list of established Maratha families says only 159 Maratha families have run the state for the last six decades, said a member of the Kranti Maratha Morcha.Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh chief Prakash Ambedkar said the rallies were a battle between the rich and established Marathas versus the poor Marathas.Speaking to The Indian Express, Chhaya said, When it comes to seeking our votes, they display the caste card. But when it comes to helping our children on merit, they show no charity. Time has come to re-look and also stand with only those who will secure our childrens future.Even as the community cutting across sub-castes and class has united to demand reservation in education and employment, the undercurrents indicated the Maratha youth are looking for an alternative leadership.As Kashmira Tatke, a college student, put it, If you notice our rallies, there is not a single established Maratha leader on the stage. Whether it is women or youth, we have only one issue  reservation for Marathas.Tatke is part of the core committee that is organising the rallies under the banner of Kranti Maratha Morcha.However, senior leaders from the Congress-NCP have described the rallies as an outcome of anger against the BJP government. Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The cooperative movement has played a significant role in addressing the concerns of the farmers and rural people. Stating that there are several examples of charitable work own district, he said, We have great bond between farmers and our constituents.A senior NCP leader from Western Maharashtra, who did not wish to be named, said, We can understand the poor Marathas anger. The agriculture crisis due to drought and growing aspirations are making life difficult. But the cooperative sectors role in addressing community welfare cannot be undermined. There are thousands of registered cooperative societies accommodating lakh of members from our community in various institutions across sugar mills, district co-op banks, cooperative dairy, private colleges, schools, hospitals etc.Another Congress leader said, The problem is established leaders had started treating the cooperative sector as private limited company instead of public trust in last three decades. As a result, the generation next Marathas have started raising questions today. He added, The reforms in Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank exposed massive corruption. The misuse of funds by several leaders of our own Congress-NCP had pushed the bank to debt. But it turned into profit when we appointed new administrator. So, our communitys concern about farmers with small land holding not getting loans from district cooperative bank or not getting admission in private colleges owned by our colleagues need a re-look.A Kranti Maratha Morcha volunteer said the mammoth public support to the rallies was an alarm bell for the established Maratha leaders in Congress-NCP who dominated the community vote bank. He said, At this moment, these rallies are leaderless. There is, however, fierce competition within as most prominent leaders in their respective districts are trying to take the credit.

It directed that water be released through direct closed pipelines from upstream reservoirs in Nashik and Nagar districts to Jayakwadi (Paithan) dam that caters to four Marathwada districts of Aurangabad, Beed, Jalna and Parbhani.""The state is the trustee of the water and the public, at large, its beneficiary . Therefore, no citizen or entity is entitled to claim any preferential right to get supply of water in a particular manner or of a particular quantity ...,'' said a bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka. Keeping in mind Article 39, it was the state's ""obligation to equitably distribute river water and water stored in dams for the common good of all"", it added.On the vexed issue of water for Kumbh mela, the high court said: ""If sufficient water cannot be allotted for usage in primary , more essential categories, there cannot be any allocation of water for Kumbh mela and other religious purposes.""In the last two decades, there has been a ""sea change to the scenario with population explosion and climatic changes, unsustainable growth and destruction of environment"", said Justice Oka, who authored the 199-page judgment. ""Water management is one of the most important and challenging issues"" and the ""failure of the state to make equitable distribution of water is leading to serious conflicts"", he added.The landmark judgment came on a bunch of PILs and counter-PILs on release of water from reservoirs in Nashik and other water-rich districts like Ahmednagar to drought-hit Marathwada. The issue before the court was essentially one of how and who should regulate water distribution and its management.The first PILs filed in 2013 questioned the validity of a certain provision of a 2005 state law on water and its regulation -Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act -that promoted equitable distribution during time of scarcity. A Marathwada welfare organization filed a counter, calling for a direction to the state to release water to Jayakwadi to ensure equitable distribution to Marathwada region.During the 2014 drought, proper water supply was orde proper water supply was ordered to Jayakwadi dam from upstream dams catering to Nashik district. A slew of PILs by sugar cooperatives, village panchayats and farmer organizations from mainly North Maharashtra challenged these orders, seeking delineation of water bodies in the state to determine rights of farmers in various regions.Along with release of water, the HC directed the state to strictly observe the 2004 order banning new projects upstream of Jayakwadi. The order, which took into account concerns of all stake-holders from all regions, is bound to be periodically reviewed and has been placed for a compliance report in January."

There are 177 sugar mills in Maharashtra. The sugar stock limit (37 per cent) allowed under this quota would not include exports. There are 177 sugar mills in Maharashtra.Sugar mills in Maharashtra are miffed with the Centres directive to reduce their sugar stocks to 37 per cent by this month-end, a measure aimed at keeping retail sugar prices under control.The Union government, in a letter dated September 8, has asked every sugar mill in the state to keep only 37 per cent of its stock, thus pushing them to offload the rest by September 30.The sugar stock limit (37 per cent) allowed under this quota would not include exports. There are 177 sugar mills in Maharashtra.The sugar sale in the state, on an average is 6-7 lakh tonnes. Going by the Union governments directives, mills will have to (over) sell up to 10-12 lakh tonnes of sugar before September 30 (to meet quota obligations). It means sugar will be sold at lower rates and mills would incur losses, Managing Director of Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd (Sakhar Sangh) Sanjeev Babar told PTI.When asked about the likelihood of other states facing a similar situation, Babar said, Some states neigbouring Uttar Pradesh  the largest in terms of sugar mills  do not produce sugar. Hence UP (sugar) mills get better rates (even during heavy selling). However, the neighbouring states of Maharashtra such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are major sugar producers. Thus, the state would not fetch better rates like UP.Besides, he said, the Centre has already withdrawn its export subsidy to mills, which has come as a setback to them. Now, the government is forcing mills to sell their sugar at lower rates compounding their problems.Also, the fresh directive has brought down wholesale sugar prices by Rs 150-200 per quintal. At present, sugar is traded in the wholesale market at Rs 3,200 per quintal, he said.The sugar rates were around Rs 3,400 a quintal a couple of months back, but downfall began with various restrictions introduced by the Union government, Babar claimed.Sugar mills in Maharashtra have already exported 10 lakh tonne sugar so far.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They are demanding reservation in education and employment. Photo: S SudarshanOn July 13, a 15-year-old girl in Maharashtra was alleged to have been brutally gang-raped and killed by three men who were drinking liquor to celebrate the purchase of a motorcycle. When her body was found by her villagers, who were mostly from the Maratha community, her private parts had been mutilated, her hair pulled out by hand, and her hands and teeth broken. She did not make it to the hospital alive.The incident happened in the Kopardi village of Ahmednagar district, around 300 km south east of Mumbai, and shocked the State. All three men were arrested a few days later, but the latent anger prevalent among the Maratha community since the previous Congress-NCP government passed a law in 2014, giving the community 16 per cent reservation in education and jobs, without transgressing on OBC reservation, was evident.Last-ditch sopThe law was widely perceived as a last-ditch sop by a government on its last legs, intended to appease the politically influential Maratha community. Not much had happened since then, but when the rape-and-murder came to light, Kopardi became a powder keg for the community to agitate. The community decided  surprisingly without the support of any political party or any leader such as Hardik Patel in Gujarat who is leading the reservation agitation for the Patidar community  to hold silent rallies (muk morcha in Marathi) across the State. Such has been the groundswell since the first rally in August that the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP-Shiv Sena government has had to sit up and take notice.These rallies are like a Maratha Arab Spring, says Praveen Gaikwad, who heads the Sambhaji Brigade, a vocally pro-Maratha outfit that is said to be behind the rallies, even though there is no official organiser.The notion gaining currency in the media is that political leaders or parties are behind it. This is wrong. On the contrary, several of them are attempting to take credit now that these agitations have struck a chord across Maharashtra. Marathas are among the most influential communities in the State, accounting for about 34 per cent of Maharashtras population. Since the formation of Maharashtra on May 1, 1960, Maratha Chief Ministers have governed the State for around 30 years.The States cooperative sugar movement, easily one of the strongest agricultural lobbies in the country, influences politics like no other industry does and is dominated by Marathas. Milk cooperatives, and cooperative banks, too, wield a large influence in State politics as well as policy-making. Both these industries are run primarily by Marathas.One of the first rallies, held in Aurangabad district on August 10, was the turning point. Locals said they expected only 5,000 people. More than a lakh turned up, thus setting the template for future silent agitations that have only grown in strength. The Aurangabad rally was held after the authorities denied permission for a rally in Mumbai.Women leading protestsAlmost every silent rally is led by women and they account for nearly 30 per cent of the protesters.Their demands: implementation of the reservation law, amendment to the Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act, and death penalty to the accused in the Kopardi case."
590494fc7be9e04154df8d6f,Even the modak is going mod!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/75266/,2016-09-27,"It is the tenth day of the festival at my friends house and as she bustles around the house, she occasionally wipes away a tear. Surrounded by family and friends, there is frenetic activity as rituals are performed. For ten days now, there has been a constant flow of family and friends coming to give offerings of fruits, flowers, and sweets, all for the venerated guest at home who is about to leave their house. As the time comes to bid farewell to this guest, she feels an overwhelming sense of sadness.The guest the family is bidding adieu to is the elephant god, Ganesha and the festival is Ganesh Chaturthi. The end of the official monsoon season brings around one of Maharashtras best known and most beloved festivals. Celebrated by devotees as the birthday of Ganpati, Ganesh Chaturthi also marks the beginning of a feasting time for gourmands. This is the famous modak season, the dumpling that has been Maharashtras favorite sweet for centuries. Popularly known as ukdiche (steamed) modak, these rice flour dumplings are traditionally stuffed with coconut and jaggery and eaten warm with pure ghee.An interesting nugget my maternal grandmother used to tell us as kids is that shape of a modak is very similar to that of a coconut. As she would roll out the dough amidst a sea of interested grandchildren, she would tell us modak tales and enthrall us by showing us how the shape was in the form of folded palms for Namaskar: a sign of benediction for the god who would visit our house during the season. As we used to roll up the rice flour to stuff the ingredients inside, all of us would vie to make the best namaskar possible to atone for perceived misdemeanors.While the traditional modaks are stuffed with coconut and jaggery mix, the modak, in keeping with the times, has gone through numerous hybrids. So during the season, there are enough variations to whet even the sternest appetite. From modaks stuffed with dry fruits to those infused with strawberry or chocolate mixes, there is a modak for every palate. I have seen modaks steamed with fragrant turmeric leaves, others stuffed with mawa/khoya sugar and cardamom powder and still others stuffed with dried sweet mango. I have even seen modak flour made from dried fruit pulp and rolled out diligently and carefully before being stuffed with desiccated almonds!The festivities and sweets make ones diet go for a toss. But there is a way to ramp up on these delicacies and not worry about the numbers on your weighing scale. For the health-conscious among us, there are baked modak and sugar-free ones. The stuffings too have become less stuffy over the years. From grated beetroots, diced carrots mixed with coconut, oats, and fruit fillings, the modak season in the past few years has given itself a healthy twist.In all this excitement about the modaks, what is often times taken for granted is the little known and often overlooked delicacy called Nivagrya or nivagria. Typically made during the ten days of Ganesh Chaturthi, nivagrya are little savoury, steamed patties made from leftover ukad (rice flour dough) that was made for the modak casing. The leftover dough is kneaded together with fresh coriander, cumin seed powder, coarse green chilly paste, a bit of oil and salt, flattened, and steamed. The little patties are eaten with plain curd or a bit of peanut oil and are absolutely wholesome and delicious.Barely has the Ganpati festival got over and the monsoons gave a firm send-off, when a host of festivals come chattering around the corner, starting with the nine-day Navratri Fest. And for epicureans, this means a nine-day food fest despite the fasting that most people do during the period. As I prepare for a dandiya-ras deluge to hit the city, I am looking forward to savoring delicacies like aaloo mewawale, kacche kele ki chaat, singhaade ke pakode, singhaade ka halwa, kuttu ki puri, and fried arbi ki sabzi.But thats a blog for another day!"

Balasubramanian, the CEO of the Hyderabad-based Sresta Natural Bio Products Ltd, which owns the '24 Mantra Organic' food brand, was travelling in a cab in New Delhi. He got talking to the driver about organic food. When the driver asked him the name of the brand, Balasubramanian said, 24 Mantra Organic.The driver shocked the CEO when he said, That is what I use. The atta (wheat) is very good. It is Rs 52 a kg, and it costs me Rs 500 a month, but I don't mind. My family enjoys good quality rotis, which I used to eat as a child.At the Lulu Mall, on a recent visit, to Kochi, Balasubramanian says, I have never forgotten that conversation. Meanwhile, as he is speaking, at the Hyper Market, where the company has a section, Radha Menon (name changed) takes a 5 kg bag of wheat. I have been using this for two years, she says. The quality is very good. Balasubramanian smiles when he hears this.The USP of the company is that, with the help of 32,000 farmers, it makes its own food, pesticide-free, in an area of 1.7 lakh acres, across 16 states. We encourage the farmers to use cow dung and other natural fertilisers, says Balasubramanian. In place of pesticides, we encourage them to use neem, ginger and cow urine. Essentially, we are using traditional methods in a scientific manner.The company goes to areas where particular crops grow well. So, they grow ginger in Sikkim, gram in Maharashtra, jaggery and sugar in Karnataka and Uttarakhand, chillies (Andhra Pradesh), peanut (Karnataka), apart from black pepper, cardamon and spices in Kerala.Meanwhile, the company is very particular in the way they store the produce. We have developed our own indigenous methods, says Balasubramanian. At the storehouse, we just remove the oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, no insect or larva can breathe. We do this for 15 days, till the larva cycle ends. Thereafter, we put the products in a pack and seal it.Following this, it is checked by any one of the 14 international agencies which are accredited with the government of India. Thereafter, it is sold through 250 outlets in departmental stores and malls. Asked why they don't have their own stores, Balasubramanian says, We are already doing farming, processing, packaging and marketing. It would be too much to run stores, too. In Kochi, you can get their products at Sunrise City, Panampally Nagar, SR Organics, Tripunithara, and Bismi Supermarket, Kaloor, among other places.But Balasubramanian is honest enough to admit that the products are on the expensive side. Fora family of four, you will be buying Rs 4000 worth of food products every month, he says. But when you switch to '24 Mantra Organic', it will go up by Rs 1500. But this is just the cost of a movie outing at a multiplex for a family.And it may be safer to pay more and have organic food, so that you can avoid dangerous diseases like cancer. Anybody I meet I ask this question: do you know of anybody who has cancer? And the answer is always yes, says Balasubramanian. Cancer from pesticide-laden food happens over several years, and not in a short time of, say, five years.Finally, when asked about the meaning of the word, '24 Mantra Organic', Balasubramanian says, It stands for a Sanskrit slogan: 'Bhumir Apo Analo Anilo Nabha' - 'You alone are the Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether'. When you write it in English there are 24 letters."

I am still in disbelief, she says, as she sits down for this interview.This 13-year-old girl from Kalyan Nagar is among the 20 children selected from all over the world to present a talk at the TED-Ed to be held on November 3 at TED headquarters in New York City.TED is a global conference, started in 1984, where an individual is given 18 minutes to present an idea engagingly. TED-Ed, an offshoot, is a platform for teachers and students. At the event, Esha will be speaking on the power of questions and how the understanding of a question is subjective.Margaret Sullivan from TED group confirms that Esha is to speak at the next event on December 3. She was invited after the TED-Ed Team saw the video of her TED-Ed Club talk, says Sullivan.My mother had said, lets keep this as a surprise till November and I had agreed... But the next day I started receiving calls from all my relatives. My mother had told everyone, she says, rolling her eyes and trying not to laugh. Esha says she is thankful to everyone who supported her but gives a little extra thank you to Sreeja.Sreeja Iyer, a graduate of Havard School of Education, is Eshas after-school teacher.Sreeja runs a pre-school and an after-school called Sparkling Mindz that follows a Reggio Emilia system of education. Reggio Emilia believes in a hundred-language approach that involves painting, sculpting, music, etc., for a childs development. Esha goes to CMR school and is currently in class 8, and she has been attending Sreejas after-school for the past four years. The TED-Ed video, done two years ago and through which she was selected, was an assignment with Sparkling Mindz.Her talk, How I Chased my Dream And Learned, is a mix of her plans of becoming a master chef and her philosophy of life. In it, she shares a memory of her first attempt at cooking, she made a dessert with cocoa powder, baking powder and sugar but she didnt bake it. It didnt taste right, she says, but her first attempt taught her many things, the primary being not to be a quitter.Esha is still surprised that her video which she feels could have been better landed her on the international stage. I dont hate my talk but I cannot be in the same room if somebody is watching the video, Esha says.Her mother Rakhee Prabhudesai, while enrolling Esha at Sreejas institute four years ago, had said, She is a very shy kid. Please do something. Esha says, I know I wouldnt have been able to do anything had Sreeja not pushed me to do it. I, in fact, had no intention of being a part of TED-Ed club since I am very lazy and always think I am not good enough. Had Sreeja not persuaded me of putting on that little extra effort I wouldve still been holding a piece of paper that reads no-confidence.Aishwarya Chodankar from Mumbai who is in class 12 is another Indian selected among the 20 to talk at the TED-Ed weekend. Esha and Aishwarya are already in touch through e-mails."

(Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran) Sangharsh Dongre with his father Tau Trimbak Dongre at their farm in Adhegaon village, Solapur. (Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran)Sangharsh Trimbak Dongre completed his Bachelor of Engineering from the S K N Sinhgad College of Engineering at Pandharpur in Maharashtras Solapur district in 2015. His family, which farms 12 acres at Adhegaon, a village in the rain shadow Mohol taluka of Solapur, spent Rs 7 lakh for his four-year undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering.More than a year later, the 24-year-old is yet to find a job and has gone back to farming. His sole consolation: Only one out of the 189 who passed out of my batch has managed to land a job at Tata Motors. The next batch, too, has graduated this year and they are all jobless like us.Watch what else is making newsSangharsh was among the lakhs of aspirant educated rural youth from the Maratha community who took part at a rally in Solapur on September 21. Such mammoth rallies have been taking place in towns and cities across Maharashtra all through this month. A central demand in these protests  by peaceful, but angry young men and women  has been reservation quotas for Marathas in government jobs and educational institutions.At the heart of the unrest is an agrarian crisis stalking Maharashtras rural countryside, stemming from shrinking landholdings over time and magnified by the back-to-back droughts and price crash  whether ofsugarcane, cotton and soybean or onion and milk  over the last two years. Coupled with the overall bleak jobs scenario and inability to cope with the high cost of education in private professional colleges, it has stoked discontent amongst the community that is being reflected in the spontaneous street actions now.Sangharshs engineering education  as of many others from his background who saw investment in higher professional studies as a passport for a future beyond agriculture  was financed largely by a loan of Rs 4 lakh from the State Bank of India. His younger brother, Vinayak, is doing his first year of BHMS (Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine & Surgery) at Sataras Sawkar Homeopathic Medical College, yet another private educational trust institution. The annual expenditure, at Rs 1.10 lakh, is lower than the Rs 1.50 lakh or so incurred for Sangharshs degree, though the course here is of four-and-a-half years followed by one year of internship.We chose BHMS because admission to a regular medicine (MBBS) course would have entailed donation of Rs 15-20 lakh on top of annual fees of Rs 4-5 lakh. Also, we decided not to go for any loan and fund from our own incomes and savings, says Sangharsh. That hasnt been easy for the family of four  including his father Tau Trimbak Dongre and mother Savita  exclusively reliant on agriculture.Till 2012, Sangharshs father grew sugarcane before shifting to pomegranate due to uncertain availability of irrigation water. Our average net yearly income has been Rs 2.5-3 lakh. The last two years have been particularly bad because of the monsoon totally failing. Although pomegranate requires less water compared to sugarcane, we have had to use tanker water for irrigation even in this case, complains Sangharsh.The familys agricultural woes, combined with the zero returns from investment in an engineering degree, have been an obvious source of frustration. All through this difficult period, Sangharsh has kept touch with his erstwhile college colleagues through a WhatsApp group, which they use to exchange notes and information on prospective job openings. Hes also part of a separate 250-member group linked to the ongoing pan-Maharashtra Maratha protests.Sangharsh relates to both the key demands expressed in the protests: Scrapping the SC & ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (which is used to harass ordinary farmers like my father), and reservations for Marathas in government educational institutions (how can we afford expensive private education with the meagre income generated from our farms?).At every rally  from Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur to Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Nanded, Hingoli, Buldhana and Amravati  the emotive plank that has united rural Marathas is reservation. The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), the organisation spearheading the massive muk or silent marches, has sought to highlight the economic backwardness of the community, even though it is considered socially forward by virtue of owning much of the agricultural land in Maharashtra.We constitute a third of the states population, but three-fourths of our people are still engaged in farming where incomes are uncertain. Investment in education is the only way to secure the future of our children. That is, however, beyond the means of most rural households, points out Sachin Gaikwad, an MKM activist and sports director at the Brahmdevdada Mane Institute of Technology in Solapur.Bhanumati Pawar, who was present at the rally in Nanded where the women outnumbered men, is most concerned about the high cost of private education. If my son gets admission in any private engineering college, the minimum fees would be Rs 1.5 lakh a year. If he can secure a seat through quota in a government institution, our financial burden will reduce considerably, observes this 45-year-old, who cultivates 10 acres at a village in the outskirts of Nanded.The irony is that many of the private education institutions dotting the state are promoted by Maratha politicians, mainly from the Opposition Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Prominent names include D Y Patil, Patangrao Kadam, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Rajesh Tope and Balasaheb Thorat, each of them controlling education trusts or deemed universities running a chain of engineering, medical, pharmacy, management and other professional course colleges.These institutions were originally the offshoots of cooperative sugar mills, dairies and banks that came up across rural Maharashtra from the mid-fifties to the eighties. The founders were mostly grassroots Maratha leaders, who used the cooperatives both as vehicles for development of their regions and also for furthering their political interests. Education was an extension activity, which unfortunately degenerated into a money-making business. The public trusts that many of these leaders created effectively become private family-controlled institutions, admits a former NCP minister, who himself controls one such cooperative-cum-educational empire near Pune.The politically dominant Maratha leaders well-versed with agricultural issues are themselves responsible for the backwardness of our community, alleges Ashok Prataprao Patil, a farmer from Chakur in Latur district.According to official data, Maharashtra has 19 government and government-aided engineering institutions with an annual student intake capacity of 6,097. On the other hand, there are as many as 348 such unaided (private) institutions with an aggregate intake capacity of 1,47,770. The picture is practically the same in every other technical stream, barring medicine where the private sector has comparatively less presence.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena administration has been sympathetic to the Marathas demand for reservations both in education and jobs. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has declared his governments commitment to grant reservation to the community, while noting that the students from rural areas are restless, as they cannot afford the higher fees in private colleges.At the same time, though, Fadnavis has drawn attention to the fact that even a 16 per cent quota in government engineering institutions would translate into just over 900 seats. Equal, if not more, emphasis should be laid on skill development and providing new avenues for employment in rural-based industries. The state government is working on a scheme for skill development linked to the setting up of district-level hubs for textile, food-processing and allied industries. The proposed project also aims at roping in private partners for training of rural youth, who can find employment in the units that would come up in these hubs.That, of course, is a more durable solution to a problem with both short- and long-term implications.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, vice president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation said the High Court had, however, accepted the sugar millers petition challenging the stock limit.Earlier this month, the central government imposed a limit on the amount of sugar stock that can be held by millers. In view of sugar prices crossing Rs 40 per kg in retail, the central government decreed that millers should not hold over 37 per cent of their total sugar stock by the end of September. Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan had tweeted about this decision and the government resolution was issued later on. Stock limit has already been imposed on sugar traders and stockists.Watch What Else is Making newsDandegaonkar said around 55 mills had approached the High Court for a stay in the matter.These are the mills which have more sugar stock than the the approved limits imposed by the central government, he said. He also said that the mills have slightly higher proportions, like instead of 37 per cent many of the mills have around 41-45 per cent of sugar stock. Millers are ready to sell sugar, but there is hardly any demand from the market, he said.Earlier the Sugar Commissionerate had asked the Excise department to verify the sugar limit for individual mills. The food and civil supplies ministry had earlier asked for the stock positions of individual mills. A new survey will be done by the Excise department and the Sugar Commissionerate to get the September end stock positions. Action, if any, is to be taken by the district supplies officers later on.With a lean sugar season in the offing, mills have been reluctant to sell sugar in anticipation of better prices. Millers have also talked about low demand from markets which has subdued sales.Sugar Commissioner Dr Bipin Sharma said the mills should ensure they adhere to the sugar stock limits imposed by the central government at the earliest.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58f644a7a3d24b0b70c29b80,A silence that’s deafening,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-silence-that%E2%80%99s-deafening/article15006571.ece,2016-09-30,"If any political leader or pundit were to have said, even just four months ago, that lakhs and lakhs of Marathas were going to mobilise and march across Maharashtra, week after week, from Parbhani in Marathwada to the so-called intellectual and knowledge capital Pune, nobody would have believed that prognosis. Nobody, not even the powerful Maratha leadership, including the strongman of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, had seen the turbulence beneath the superficial and deceptive calm in the community. Now it is obvious that the frustration and anger among the Marathas has been brewing intensely.Most people outside Maharashtra do not understand the difference between the two phonetically similar sounding terms, Maratha and Marathi. Why, even the metropolitan Mumbaikar cannot comprehend the distinction. The broadcast media and panel pontiffs too are confused by the sudden tsunami-like Maratha marches, which they cannot simply ignore because of their sheer size and breadth. Indeed, the mobilisation is so grippingly picturesque that television cameramen and anchors cannot underplay it by pretending that Kashmir and the Cauvery water crisis are far more important!The class divide among MarathasThe Maratha caste can be broadly compared with Jats in Rajasthan and Haryana or Patidar-Patels in Gujarat, primarily farmers. They are one-third of the States population and Marathi is their mother tongue, though not exclusive to them. Within the community, there is a hierarchy observed very diligently, particularly when it comes to matrimony. However, irrespective of social hierarchy, they are all directly connected with agriculture, sons of soil, as it were. But there is another hierarchy, that of class. There are four class divisions.The elite Marathas are directly related to power or power centres  ministers, chairmen of commissions, various boards, directors in cooperative banks, board members of sugar cooperatives, zilla parishad or gram panchayat chiefs, and so on. These Marathas are seen to not distinguish between the private and public.The class just below them is the rich farmer, bagayati or cash crop farmer. They are powerful because they command respect on account of their wealth, which also gives them status and authority in the villages. They are not in political power directly, but they have political heft across parties as they finance candidates.Next in the hierarchy comes the small or middle peasant, who survives on a season-to-season basis, is dependent on the vagaries of nature, is anxious about the monsoon, takes small loans to run the farm or for wedding expenses, and commits suicide if harassed by the bank or moneylender. The middle peasant aspires to be a rich farmer, and hence imitates the lifestyle of the well-off farmer. When he fails to live up to his projected image, distraught, he hangs himself.The lowest and the last layer is that of the landless peasants and agricultural labourers who depend on government employment guarantee schemes and other benefits.The only bond among this four-layered class structure is of caste. Being Maratha gives them a feeling of difference from the other and an illusion of being important.The power elite have everything going for them. The rich farmers main worry is that he is not getting cheap labour because of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. His economic interest pits him against his Maratha brethren because of the class distinctions. The real frustration is among the small/middle farmers, the vast section of landless farmers and/or agricultural labourers. A young person among the lower classes of Marathas has had no opportunities for higher education, no possibilities of migrating to the cities for a better future, and certainly no avenues to new kinds of jobs  in the information technology sector, for instance. Unemployment, declining agriculture, compounded by severe drought and devastating floods, have threatened his very survival.For the past two years these suffering classes waited with great expectation for  Achche Din . They had voted against the Congress because their condition saw no improvement during the years of Congress rule. They thought Narendra Modi would provide what the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) alliance did not. Now, theres disillusionment.Searching for an object of ireThus, multiple frustrations got accumulated and mixed up. But who should be held responsible? The Marathas are in power from sugar cooperatives to Mantralaya, the administrative headquarters of the State government. All parties, from the Congress, NCP, to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena have large contingents of Marathas. In assemblies and local self-governments there is Maratha domination. And yet the lower- and middle-rung Marathas feel isolated, neglected, marginalised in the job market and denied opportunities in higher education.The reservation policy gave Dalits an advantage vis--vis Marathas in getting admission in reputed colleges. Ironically, many of the States private colleges and deemed universities are owned, run and managed by the Maratha power elite! Moreover, the subcaste, or parallel caste, Kunbi, was included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation category. That, too, has fuelled the demand for reservation among other larger Maratha groupings. The disgruntled Maratha youth, instead of wagging an accusing finger at the power elite of their own caste, began to see an enemy in the Dalit community, the beneficiaries of the reservation policy.The brutal rape and murder of a Maratha girl in July by a few Dalit youth in Kopardi village of Ahmednagar district provided these marginalised Maratha youth an opportunity to direct their wrath against the Backward Castes and OBCs. Though none of the recent Maratha marches have witnessed any diatribe against the Dalit community, the underlying message is that the mobilisation is targeted against the Dalits. Since the NCP founded and led by Mr. Pawar has the largest Maratha following, many commentators believe that he and his party are behind the movement. The Maratha elites are happy to face this charge, because they get credit for channelling the discontent when they are at best only supporting from behind the scenes what is essentially a spontaneous expression of mass (and class) frustration.In the past it was the Brahmin (caste and class) that was the enemy of the Marathas (self-declared Bahujan). The Dalits and OBCs too regarded Brahminism as the main enemy. Demographically, this upper caste had just about 4 per cent presence in society but dominated education, bureaucracy, media and other institutions of power. That domination was sharply reduced following reservation, and a section of the Marathas too entered the corridors of power and influence. But still there were the vast armies of lower- and middle-end Maratha youths deprived of participation in the mainstream economic, political and cultural affairs. Around 200 Maratha families have kept the reins of power in their hands, claim organisers of the protest movement.Rage of the have-notsAs stated in the beginning, the marches are a reflection of the massive crisis in the agricultural economy of Maharashtra. That is the reason the demand for the implementation of reports of the M.S. Swaminathan-led National Commission on Farmers between 2004 and 2006 has acquired importance in this agitation. The farmer is denied competitive prices for his produce, affordable prices for the input elements, relief and support during drought, famines and floods, and help from financial institutions when it is the need of the hour.This hapless and helpless small and middle farmer is seeing around him the new wealth, new opportunities, new jobs, new lifestyles that he too aspires to. The urban haves and rural haves have cornered the new wealth, making him the new poor. The new poverty is not poverty imposed on him by nature or overall backwardness; it is enforced by the ruling class and the ruling government and the ruling establishment. He knows who the enemy is: it is in his neighbourhood and his community. That is why all the marches are silent protest processions, perhaps. The marches are disciplined, clean, huge and silent, with massive participation from women of all age groups and girl students who are angry because they feel the future is being snatched away from them.The silence of the lakhs of marchers is deafening and the elite  Maratha or Brahmin or Dalit  are feeling threatened. It is a silent political bomb ticking and could explode anytime, devastating all that we think is stable and settled.Kumar Ketkar is a veteran journalist and Chief Editor of Dainik Divya Marathi.The disgruntled Maratha youth, instead of wagging an accusing finger at the power elite of their own caste, began to see an enemy in the Dalit community"

The interest on the loan kept mounting with the mills repayment plans taking a hit. On December 17, 2015, the PNB initiated recovery action granting the mill a two-month period to pay off the loan. Following the mills failure in repayment, the bank intimated that it planned to take over the mill property as per its rules. Finally, on September 30, the PNB informed the Ahmednagar district collector that it was in possession of the mills land, Pachputes office, and a bungalow. Pachpute was a Minister in the Congress, NCP regime. But he switched over from the NCP to join the BJP ahead of the 2014 Assembly polls. He, however, failed to retain the Shrigonda Assembly constituency.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
59208ad17be9e04a516a94f2,Quota no answer to Maratha stir,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573707/quota-no-answer-maratha-stir.html,2016-10-02,"October 03, 2016, DHNS 23:44 ISTThe protests started by members of the Maratha community in parts of Maharashtra some weeks ago have spread and gained in strength, and are likely to escalate further. The silent marches with no clear leaders and wide participation by women have shaken the political establishment in the state. The immediate trigger for the protests was the gang-rape and murder of a Maratha girl reportedly by some Dalit men in Kopardi near Ahmednagar, but they have now grown into a vehicle for other issues and demands. These include death sentence for the culprits in the case, repeal of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and reservation for the Marathas in education and employment. There cannot be action, or even a promise of action, on any of these demands. The punishment in the case is to be decided by the courts. The SC/ST Act was legislated as a deterrence against atrocities committed on Dalits, who are the weakest section in society. It was strengthened recently, and there is no case for its repeal.The previous UPA government had granted 16% reservation to the Marathas. The decision was stayed by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court has refused to vacate the stay. So, neither the state government nor the Centre can do anything on these demands. But all political parties, and especially their Maratha leaders, have supported the protests. There are expressions of sympathy from the ruling BJP too. The irony is that the Marathas, who form about 30% of the population, are politically and economically the strongest community in the state. Their leaders have dominated politics, industries like sugar and agriculture. These sectors of the economy have declined in the past few years and the community has a grouse that it is getting left behind and has been unable to gain from development.Dominant communities in other states like the Patidars in Gujarat, the Jats in Haryana and elsewhere and the Kapus in Andhra Pradesh have also launched agitations, making similar demands and expressing similar sentiments. They may be signs of a growing agrarian discontent and a crisis affecting traditional occupations and small industries. Many farming and peasant communities are in distress. Reservation is no solution because the existing quota system cannot be stretched to benefit more people. The norms do not allow that,too, and in any case there are too few opportunities to be shared. Development that creates more jobs and opportunities can only address these demands and grievances. Unfortunately, the agitations have become mobilisations based on castes and communities, though the basic grievances are economic. The resulting tension and conflicts between communities are bad for society."

Water was discharged at the rate of 5,000 cusec in the afternoon and at the rate of up to 9,000 cusec in the late afternoon.Officials in the state irrigation department said the water released in the river was flowing to Pandharpur and then to parts of Karnataka. An alert has been sounded in the villages along the river about the probable increase in water-level. The department said the water release would continue till the reservoir received water from other dams.The stock in the dam had depleted to an alarming low of minus 28 TMC (-53%) at the beginning of monsoon (in June). It has added about 75 TMC within four months, bringing relief to farmers in Solapur, Pune and adjacent districts.The increase in the water level of Ujani to its full capacity was an outcome of water released from dams in the upstream areas of Pune district. On Monday, the dams were releasing water at the rate of 17,500 cusec. Besides, the catchment areas of Ujani have been receiving heavy showers over the past few days.""Generally, the reservoir gets filled because of water released from the dams in Pune district. This year, catchments of Ujani recorded significant rainfall. Since June, 554mm rainfall - almost equal to showers in Pune - has been recorded. Heavy rain has led to healthy increase in water level,"" said an official of the irrigation department.The water stock in the dam is much better now as against the last year, when the dam had only 4% water stock in the first week of October. ""There was only 2 TMC live water stock in the reservoir as against this year's 54 TMC as none of the dams in the upstream area released water because of scanty rains, prompting depletion of the water stock to minus 58%. Water from dead stock was utilized to meet requirements,"" the official said.The water stock in Ujani reached its maximum capacity in 2013, 2014 and 2016. The dam supplies water mainly to sugarcane fields in rural parts of Solapur, Pune, Satara and Osmanabad districts.Regulation mustExperts have pushed for regulation on the use of Ujani water.

The decision was taken following the decline in the cultivation of sugarcane in the state this year. As per the state government estimates, this year 6.33 lakh hectares are under sugarcane cultivation this year. At the meeting, CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ""The state witnessed drought over the last four years. The cultivation has declined. This year, the state witnessed good rainfall which will help during the next crushing season.""Shetti said he would compel the government to change its decision. ""The decision to delay crushing season is completely wrong and foolish. The sugar factories from Karnataka will start crushing from November 15 and they will be targeting sugarcane from not only villages bordering Karnataka but they can penetrate deep into Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara along with Solapur districts. This will ultimately affect the sugarcane sector from southern Maharashtra, which will not have enough sugarcane for crushing. The ultimate result will be that they will not able to pay farmers their dues,"" he said.""It is surprising that when we are part of the government, they have not discussed the issue with us before taking the decision. When we were out of power, we had fought with government by launching agitations against wrong decisions of government. Now being in the government, we will ask the authorities concerned to reverse the decision as it goes against farmers,"" he said.Vijay Autade, executive director of Shahu Sugar Factory, said though there is decline in the sugarcane cultivation in the state, in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, the decline is only 15% as compared with last year. ""Hence, we will have to start crushing as early as possible. Besides, we also have to compete with sugar factories from neighbouring state, where crushing season starts from November 15. The state government should consider these issues and take appropriate decision in this regard,"" he said.Representatives of sugar mills in the meeting on Monday said they will not get adequate manpower to harvest the crop till Diwali-end. They also said the sugar recovery rate will be low if cane crushing starts early. Experts have maintained that crushing will last for just three months during this season.The meeting also discussed issues such as irrigation of the sugarcane farms and restarting defunct mills. The CM stressed on the use of drip irrigation for sugarcane to reduce water wastage and to set up a committee under cooperatives minister Subhash Deshmukh to draft a policy to re-start defunct mills."

Speaking at the regional round table meeting on the implications of the new education policy for schools and higher education, minister of state for water resources, water conservation and parliamentary affairs Vijay Shivtare said he had floated the proposal and had asked the party leader, Aditya Thackeray , to take up the matter seriously with the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.""In Maharashtra, 60,000 seats in private engineering colleges are vacant. With the private colleges charging huge amounts as admission fees, bright but financially weak students can only dream of taking admission in them despite having the required marks.In a way , those who should be engineers are forced to take admission in ITIs (industrial training institutes) and those fit for odd jobs are becoming engineers because they have money . This system needs to be changed and we have proposed a system and informed the state government about it around three months ago. However, with the response being not up to the mark, I have asked Aditya Thackeray to pursue the matter,"" said Shivtare, also the guardian minister of Satara district.According to the proposed plan, the state government should come up with a merit list of financially weak students residing in rural and urban areas after a proper background check. Once the list is in place, the banks have to ensure education lo ans to these students for admission to the institutions.""The state government should make it mandatory for the banks to provide education loans to these students. The system should be on the lines of the agricultural loans, provided to farmers on a mandatory basis.Once the students starts studying, the role of the private institutions will come to the fore. They will have to pay the interest of the loan for these students. If any student fails to repay the loan after his or her education with the institution is over, the state government should chip in and repay the bank the principal amount. This move will help the financially weak students study in good institutions,"" the minister pointed out.Shivtare cautioned against making things political when asked if the state government was doing enough in the education sector considering that so many seats in the private engineering colleges were vacant.""Things shouldn't be seen in a political perspective all the time. This is a good plan and when implemented, will change the lives of many .The Shiv Sena has decided to take up the issue with the state government and by the next year, the proposal will be implemented in the state.If the state government can give Rs 20,000 crore to sugar mills, it can easily provide more funding when it comes to educating financially weak students,"" the minister said.The draft of the national education policy of the Centre has been finalized and is doing rounds among experts before being formally approved.The new policy aims at providing quality education and reducing the number of non-literates in the country .India currently has the largest non-literate population in the world with the absolute number among population aged seven and above being 82.6 million in 2011."

While the number of Kolkatans with high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar was higher than the national average, skipping meals was more common among then than the residents of other metros. What has made the city's cardiac future even bleaker is that Kolkata has more smokers and alcohol drinkers than other major cities.Conducted by Saffolalife, the survey studied the lifestyle of cities through a composite score and ascertained lifestyle impact on heart health. On most counts, the city fared poorly. Incidence of high cholesterol in Kolkata, for instance, is 33%, higher than the all-India average of 28%. Also, 28% Kolkatans surveyed turned out to have a high fasting blood sugar level, higher than the all-India average of 21%. The city also has the highest proportion of people with high BP at 20%, a figure much higher than the allIndia's 11% figure, Mumbai's 14% and Delhi's 6%.Irregular food habit was quintessential to Kolkata, the survey said. As much as 75% here skip a meal, the highest among key cities (59% in Mumbai and Delhi; 61% across India). While 72% took wholegrain food, higher than the national average of 58%, 43% Kolkatans regularly ate fruits, less than Delhi's 49%.Consumption of green leafy vegetables, however, is high in Kolkata at 44%, higher than the national average of 39%.The city also seemed sleep-deprived, the survey showed. While only 26% citizens got optimal 7-10 hours of sleep, lowest in India (national average stands at 53%), only 32% Kolkatans got sound sleep, again the lowest in the country (national average stands at 47%). ""While the findings do reflect the cardiac health trends of Kolkata, it excludes a few key factors. One is the sharp rise in the consumption of carbohydrates, which has contributed to the growth in cardiac ailments in recent years even as we seem to be magnifying the ill-effects that marginal cholesterol poses,"" said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar Screening of cardiac health, however, was better in Kolkata, the study revealed, with only 31% people never checking their sugar levels; the all-India figure is higher at 35%. While 47% Mumbaikars surveyed did not get their BP checked, in Kolkata, the number is 22%.The city also has better women's heart health awareness than other metros."

All he had managed on that occasion was 0 & 3 -combined with 4 & 18 in the previous game at Old Trafford, his two-Test comeback was a disaster, prompting many to write his international career off for good. The left-hander, however, wasn't willing to give in so easily. Those who know him say that while in `exile,' for the last four years, he was disappointed, but not defeated. He continued to introspect and work on his game. Interestingly, he was willing to put the team ahead of his personal cause.As a Delhi skipper, he opted for green tracks, ignoring the advice of his India colleagues to play on flat pitches and make runs to stage a comeback in the Indian team. He made it clear that he didn't want to be selfish, and wouldn't sacrifice the team's cause for his personal cause. In the IPL too, he chose to play on tracks that suited his bowlers and not pitches which would aid slam-bang cricket. The emergence of Murali Vijay, Shikhar and Rahul didn't bother him as he maintained that the only way to beat the competition was by training harder. Looking for an intense workout, he went to Australia and worked with former Australian opener Justin Langer and his personal coach Noddy Holder. Both suggested to him that he should play with a more open stance, so that he could play short-pitched bowling better. To his credit, Gambhir adapted well to this massive change, which is a bit like a golfer changing his swing, and slammed four fifties in the Duleep Trophy.He worked hard on his fitness too, and modified his diet-going completely off carbs, sugar and oily food. It has been almost two years since he hasn't had rice or rotis. Instead of contemplating quitting the sport, Gambhir pressed on the accelerator and made a state-of-the-art indoor batting facility at his home, and a personal gym in Delhi. Even the DDCA doesn't have an indoor batting facility.The Gambhir story, though, isn't so simple. The man is known to have a fiery temper. His clashes with India skipper Virat Kohli (during the IPL in 2013) and Manoj Tiwary (in the last season of the Ranji Trophy) are well-documented. During the last IPL, he kicked a chair in disgust after losing to Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore.It leads one to the question: 'Gambhir ko gussa kyon aata hai?' Those who know him well say that the Delhite's pensive and intense look is just his 'game face.' Off the field, he's extremely jovial and a prankster, something that his teammates vouch for. A close friend of Gambhir stressed that he doesn't have any issues with either MS Dhoni or Kohli.""It's the sheer desire to win at all costs that brought out the conflict between Virat and Gautam. In fact, both he and Virat dined in his Taj Gardenia hotel room the day they fought in Bangalore in 2013, but sadly, these things never get reported. Both admire each other, GG calls Virat 'Cheeks,' while Virat addresses him as 'Bhaiya.' Both love Man United and play stations, and are even currently together in the gym in Indore with Team India trainer Shanker Basu,"" a close friend of Gambhir tells TOI.He also clarified that Gambhir wasn't taking a pot-shot at Dhoni, when he tweeted recently that saying sportspersons didn't deserve to have biopics made on them. The tweet had again triggered speculation that there was a problem between him and Dhoni somewhere. ""He never tweeted against any individual's movie. All he said was that the Indian soldiers deserve a biopic more than a sportsperson. He doesn't feel that MSD was responsible for his exit,"" he says.Another friend describes him as a fierce patriot. ""He's extremely emotional and loves his country to bits. He often says that if he wasn't a cricketer, he would have been in the army. In fact, a couple of years ago, he wanted to join the territorial army."""

The fast during the festival causes acidity too. The suffocation due to crowd could cause unconsciousness among devotees. We treat the patients according to their physical condition. We send them to hospitals in the case of emergency. The ambulance is stationed on the premises of temple.""Samiti secretary Vijay Powar lauded the efforts of the doctors and the volunteers of the NGO. ""We appreciate the coordination among these organisations. These centres are providing necessary treatment to devotees coming from far flung areas.

The state excise department has accused a molasses-based distillery owned by Guttes firm, Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Limited, of illegally supplying ethanol or rectified spirit for manufacture of illicit liquor.The department, led by BJPs Chandrasekhar Bavankule, has even served the firm a notice, threatening to suspend the licence for the alleged violation. The firms plant is in Parbhani.Gutte had close ties with former Union Minister (late) Gopinath Munde and had even unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly poll from Gangakhed taluka as the official candidate of the BJP-led alliance. Last year, Income Tax authorities had raided Guttes flagship firm, Sunil Hitech. The firm had also courted controversy over a contract allotted in Parbhani under Jalyukt Shivar.In its notice, the department alleged that it had intercepted a tanker (MH04 DS 9808) containing 20,000 litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Ahmednagar on September 6, 2016. The tankers driver and cleaner, who were arrested, told investigators that the consignment, meant to be taken for a notorious alcohol maker who operates along the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border, had allegedly originated from Guttes distillery. Sources said about 1 crore litres of alcohol, worth several crores, could be brewed using this spirit.Further, investigators came across a telephonic conversation between the driver and the distillerys manager, Balasaheb Lohar, on the same day for collection of the consignment. The department claims to have further collected evidence, which shows that the same tanker had transported declared goods out of the distillery in the past. Sources revealed that CCTV footage from the distillerys unit is being investigated.A raid subsequently conducted on the distillery revealed the presence of unaccounted for molasses, investigators claimed. The department notice used this as evidence to suggest that the firms intention was to divert this for manufacture of illicit alcohol.The Indian Express accessed the firms written reply to the departments notice, where it denied the accusations. While admitting that Lohar was employed with the distillery, the firm denied any links with the tanker operator and the alcohol maker.The firm also said the molasses found in the distillery had been gained in surplus during sugar production this year. It further said that an application to regularise this surplus was rejected on June 14 without citing any ground. Senior officials, however, said the firms explanation wasnt satisfactory.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

This year too, cane cultivation area is less because of water scarcity. The ripple effects of this will be seen next year also. It is natural that when production is limited, cost escalates.As per the CCDDS data, in 2014-15, sugar production in Karnataka was 49 lakh metric tonnes (MT) and in 2015-16, it was 40.05 lakh MT. This year, so far 30 lakh MT sugar has been produced. The total cane production in 2015-16 was 376 lakh MT against 300 lakh MT this year.Not encouragingPavan Kumar, SISMA president, said nationally there is a 20% reduction in cane production and 30% deficit in Karnataka.Maharashtra which meets 40% of the total needs of sugar is the largest producer, followed by Uttar Pradesh (30%) and Karnataka (25%). Tamil Nadu is gradually registering an increase in production, with a share of 6%.Though cane is an annual crop, its maturity time is October and November. If there are good rains, standing crops absorb water, which will increase the thickness of the stem, making it sweeter and profitable for the cane industry. But if that does not happen, there is further decline in sugar production, Kumar said."

(Source: PTI)NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pitched for reservation for the Maratha community without diluting the quota for other communities. Meeting the Prime Minister for the first time after the Maratha agitation broke out in Maharashtra, Pawar said the community needed facilities that were available to others less privileged as a substantial section of the Marathas subsist on farming.After the meeting, Pawar told reporters that he requested for initiating a coordinated action in the Parliament in this crucial matter which pertained both to the state and central governments.The silent marches taken out by Maratha Kranti Morcha around Maharashtra to highlight demands like reservation in jobs and education have created ripples in state politics, with major players adopting a wait and watch approach to see if the massive mobilisation will eventually assume electoral dimensions.Observers say that all main partiesBJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCPare unnerved by the huge success of the rallies, the immediate trigger for them being the rape and murder of a girl from the community at Kopardi in Ahmednagar.During the meeting, Pawar also discussed the issues faced by sugarcane growers and the sugar industry.He stressed that various government decisions regarding sugar were creating difficulties for the growers to get remunerative prices of their produce.He also drew the Centres attention to the plight of sugar mills which have started cogeneration but have been hit hard by reluctance of the government to buy power from them.Cogeneration is the generation of electricity and useful heat jointly, especially the utilisation of the steam left over from electricity generation for heating.Pawar sought a review of the government policy on ethanol, saying the recent changes have affected sugar mills producing ethanol for blending it in petrol.He criticised Maharashtra Minister Mahadev Jankar for allegedly using abusive language against him but appealed to people, especially NCP workers to show restraint and not to take law into their hands.In an apparent dig at Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, he said, Everyone is awaiting the action which is being initiated against the cultured minister.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Action was taken following orders by MGCM chief Ajoy Mehta, a senior civic official said on Wednesday.Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Encroachment) Milind Sawant said, While cracking down on illegal hawkers and food vendors, our team has seized 5,160 hand carts, 1,044 cylinders, 57 table-stalls, 24 sugar cane crushing machines and other goods and articles.Most of the hawkers were found in G-North ward where 13,173 illegal food vendors were caught.

Sugar has a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices.Inflation worries have clearly receded in most food items  barring sugar, potatoes and chana. Even for the last two, the current high prices may be a temporary phenomenon, as the improved soil and sub-soil moisture conditions from a good monsoon is likely to spur plantings in the ensuing rabi season.That leaves only sugar, where there is a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices. This is unlike in wheat, for which the governments own precarious stocks position is more than offset by low global prices. At about $205 per tonne, the landed cost of imported wheat in India works out to Rs 1,365 a quintal  below even the minimum support price of Rs 1,525/quintal that was payable to farmers for last years crop.In sugar, on the other hand, the 2016-17 season (October-September) has started with estimated carryover stocks of 75 lakh tonnes (lt). With output projections for the new season ranging from 220 lt to 235 lt, and expected consumption of 260 lt, the closing stocks for September 2017 would be anywhere between 35 lt and 50 lt  not very comfortable.Moreover, white sugar if imported today will cost well above Rs 40 per kg. That is more than the Rs 35-36 per kg that mills are currently realising. A clear picture  of the actual sugarcane available for mills to crush, especially in the wake of successive droughts in Maharashtra and Karnataka  will emerge by January.Either way, sugar is the commodity to watch in the New Year, when we also have the countrys largest cane producer Uttar Pradesh going for Assembly polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Of the 11 mills which were put up for sale earlier this year, only one could be sold which has prompted the bank to re-issue tenders.Pramod Karnad, Managing Director of the MSC Bank had stated the decision to sell these mills was taken after they had failed to clear their outstanding debts. The total accumulated debt of these mills was over Rs 360 crore and majority of the mills were closed for the last two crushing seasons. Initially, the bank had floated tenders for seven mills and subsequently four more mills were put up for sale.Other than the Jai ShivShankar Cooperative Mill in Nanded, none of the other mills found response. The lean sugar season, many had pointed out, was one of the reasons for the lukewarm response. The 2017-18 sugar season is expected to be a decent one which might see more private players involved in the field. The mill which was sold in Nanded was also purchased by a private player.Sale of cooperative mills to private players had created a major controversy in the state with many opposing the same. In 2013 the state cabinet had decreed that cooperative mills will not be sold to private mills. However, many had pointed out that it could not be implemented.Cooperative mills, many said, were weak financially and very few will be able to make investments in these mills. In case of a sick or closed unit, the new party has to invest substantially in terms of machinery and modernisation.Meanwhile, Karnad while talking about the payment of pledge loans by mills said the unpaid pledge loan owned by the mills to the bank at present stood at Rs 1,700 crore. At the end of the 2015-16 crushing season the amount was around Rs 2,100 crore, he said. A pledge loan is the money raised by the banks from the MSC Bank by pledging their sugar stock. Once the sugar stock is sold, mills repay the money to the bank. This money is used by mills to pay the farmers. The MSC Bank gives pledge loans to 32 sugar mills in the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58ff2f477be9e0420db2e1b8,Move to raise LNG import,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161014/jsp/business/story_113334.jsp,2016-10-14,"New Delhi, Oct. 13: India plans to more than double its LNG import capacity to 50 million tonnes (mt) in the next few years as part of a strategy to move towards a gas-based economy, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today. ""We have an LNG import and regassification capacity of 21mt, which we plan to raise to 50mt in a few years,"" he said. The country wants to raise the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 per cent in the next 3-4 years from 6.5 per cent, Pradhan said during the signing of an MoU between The Energy and Resources Institute and PetroFed. Globally, natural gas makes up for 24 per cent of the energy basket. Petronet LNG operates a 10 mt-a-year LNG import terminal at Dahej in Gujarat and has a 5mt facility at Kochi, which is lying mostly idle because of the lack of a pipeline to take the gas to consumers. Royal Dutch Shell operates a 5mt-a-year terminal at Hazira in Gujarat and a 1.2mt facility at Dabhol in Maharashtra. While the Dahej terminal is being expanded to 15mt this year and to 18mt in the future, the construction of a breakwater will take capacity to 5mt at Dabhol. Pradhan also said the first LNG-driven bus was likely to start plying in Kerala early next month. ""Petronet LNG and IOC are in discussions with the Kerala government."" Meanwhile, the cabinet has approved a new method to revise the price of sugarcane-extracted ethanol used for blending in petrol, resulting in a drop in rates by Rs 3 to Rs 39 a litre.<> Among the new terminals being built is a 5 million tonnes facility by GSPC-Adani at Mundra in Gujarat, Adani-IOC-GAIL combine's similar capacity unit at Dhamra in Odisha and another equal capacity terminal by IOC at Ennore in Tamil Nadu. Shell and GAIL are looking at building a floating LNG import terminal at Kakinada with initial capacity of 1.75 million tonnes. India's natural gas demand is expected to grow from 473 million standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) now to 494 mmscmd in 2017-18 and 523 mmscmd in 2018-19. Ethanol The price of ethanol will be determined on the basis of prevalent price of sugar in the open market as also demand-supply situation, Pradhan said. ""Any pricing mechanism should be market driven and we are moving towards that in case of ethanol as well,"" he said. The NDA-government had in December 2014 fixed a price of Rs 48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol. ""The rate paid to sugar mills was never Rs 48.50. It was Rs 42. That price (Rs 48.50) was after including excise duty, VAT and other levies and transportation cost,"" he said. Oil companies have to necessarily blend up to 10 per cent of ethanol in petrol. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs ""approved the mechanism for revision of ethanol price for supply to public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to carry out the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme,"" an official statement said. For ethanol supply period from December 1, 2016 to November 30, 2017, the administered price of ethanol for the EBP programme will be Rs 39 per litre, it said. Additionally, charges will be paid to the ethanol suppliers as per actuals in case of excise duty and VAT/GST and transportation charges as decided by OMCs. ""If the need arises to increase/reduce the retail selling price of petrol by public sector OMCs, then such increase/ reduction would proportionately factor in the requirement of maintaining the fixed cost of purchase of ethanol during the ethanol supply year,"" it said. With the domestic gas output dropping, import of the environment-friendly fuel presents the best option. Using LNG directly as a fuel will help to skip a step of converting the imported liquid gas back into the gaseous state."

Had he accepted the report of a pathological lab on the city's Govind Mitra Road at face value, he would have to. A blood donor with connections in the medical fraternity, the man in mid-40s went for a second and even third opinion, and ""I am saved, you see"".The Bank Road lab's test report showed Hissariya's postprandial blood glucose level at 148mg/dl on October 4. Only a day earlier, his peak level of the blood sugar was reported to be 356mg/dl by the Govind Mitra Road lab!A tad confused, Hissariya had his blood sample taken two hours after meal by a big-banner lab's franchise in the city. Its result matched with the Bank Road lab's. ""Mind it, I had the blood taken out of my veins exactly 120 minutes after the meal -- at all the three labs,"" said Hissariya who runs a drug store on Govind Mitra Road.What added to the indignation of Hissariya was the ""utterly irresponsible"" response of the ""erring"" lab when he went to complain about the ""criminal negligence"". ""They nonchalantly offered me to repeat the test for free if I so wished,"" he told TOI earlier this week.Hissariya's is not a one-off case. Doctors are also complaining. Not only physicians, pathologists too rue the mushrooming growth of illegal labs. The Bihar chapter of Indian Association of Pathologists and Microbiologists (IAPM) has even filed a PIL in the Patna high court, seeking a directive to the government to crack down on such labs.The IAPM had in fact written to the Medical Council of India as well as the Bihar health department bosses in 2014, complaining about this. ""Patients are wrongly being diagnosed and thus wrongly treated,"" the letter read and added patients' life was in danger due to the mafia's stranglehold on this life-saving diagnostic field.The letter made startling revelations. While MCI rules prescribe a pathological lab must have a dedicated pathologist who should sign every test report, the letter hinted many labs were being run by technicians. ""Pathologists' name and signature are being misused (forged)... For example, one particular pathologist is (purported to be) present in ten different districts of the state on the same date, which is impossible,"" the letter pointed out.The letter, also marked to Union health ministry officials, alleged most labs in Bihar lacked proper diagnostic equipment, qualified technicians and qualified phlebotomist (who collects blood samples from patients).""According to MCI rules, one pathologist can give services in not more than five labs and that too within a prescribed distance. Patna has at best 50 trained pathologists, but even a conservative estimate puts the number of labs in the city at 2,000. Who are managing them? Labs can be found wholesale outside big hospitals like PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS. The gullible masses suffer,"" IAPM's Bihar chapter joint secretary Dr Prabhat Ranjan fumed.However, the administration pleads helplessness. ""The Patna high court earlier this year ordered no coercive action against the labs or hospitals not registered under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act. What can we do?"" asked Patna civil surgeon Dr G S Singh.The IAPM still sees a way out. ""The high courts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, MP and UP have ruled in favour of MCI rules. Using these rulings, the Bhagalpur and Purnia civil surgeons ordered raids on labs in 2014. Many of them were found running without qualified pathologists,"" Dr Ranjan claimed and wondered why couldn't the Patna civil surgeon take a cue from his Purnia and Bhagalpur counterparts.The International Standards Organisation and the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) are into certifying medical labs. Though not mandatory, the accreditation by these non-government bodies is considered by experts as a proof of quality infrastructure at the certified lab. Bihar has only ten NABL-accreditated labs."

""All possible steps are being taken to ensure there is no more increase in retail prices. There have been cases of short selling by sugar producers in UP, which has impacted Delhi prices. We have asked UP government to enforce the stock limit norms strictly. We are also keeping track of how much sugar is arriving in the open market,"" a food ministry official said.According to sources, though sugar producers in UP have claimed that they have released enough from their stock and the excise department records also show the sale, officials are surprised why the prices still have not fallen.""This raises doubt that hoarding in some form or the other is happening and states have to act,"" a government official said.Meanwhile, the food ministry has written to UP government to confiscate sugar stocks of companies who owe the maximum amount of money to cane growers in the state. Out of the total Rs 1,584 crore outstanding of farmers across country, only UP's share is Rs 800 crore. Moreover, only five companies need to pay Rs 680 crore of UP's total cane arrears."

These farmers sow the cane even as its outsized water demands relative to other crops threaten to plunge this traditionally arid region back into a drought.""It is the only reliable crop. Earlier this year I cultivated onions and incurred a 50,000 rupees loss as prices crashed,"" said Wagh, who plants 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of sugar cane.Four months ago Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing region in India, suffered the worst drought in four decades that ravaged crops, killed livestock, depleted reservoirs and slowed down hydroelectric power output.Environmental activists and the government blamed the rapid expansion of sugar cane growing for creating the water scarcity. Cane consumes about 22.5 million litres of water per hectare during its 14-month long growing cycle compared to just 4 million litres over four months for chickpeas, a pulse, commonly grown in India and called gram locally.Without government intervention to reset the revenue balance in favour of other crops, experts warn the sustained production of sugar cane will further deplete scarce water resources and leave the region prone to droughts. This could create social unrest stemming from the widening income gap between cane growers and other farmers.""The government asks farmers to shift to less water consuming crops, but it does little to support those crops. It failed to solve the problems of oilseed and pulses growers,"" said Pradeep Purandare, a former professor at Maharashtra Water and Land Management Institute based in Aurangabad.Erratic prices for vegetables, oilseeds and pulses limit the incentive for farmers to plant them.In contrast, the government requires sugar mills to buy cane at a set ""fair and remunerative price"" (FRP). The government also buys wheat and rice at what is called the minimum support price (MSP).""Returns from other crops are unpredictable. This year I allowed 5 tonnes of onions to rot. Prices were so low that my losses would have increased by transporting onions to the market,"" said Suresh Kothawale, another Aurangabad farmer.India's government hopes higher subsidies for pulses and oilseeds will change farming patterns.""We are creating oilseeds and pulses as an alternative for sugar cane by raising their minimum support prices,"" said a senior official at India's Agriculture Ministry who declined to be named.But industry critics said the pulse and oilseed MSP only exists on paper as the government never procures them aggressively like wheat or rice.""Green gram prices were trading below support prices due to higher production. This makes the support price irrelevant for farmers,"" said Nitin Kalantri, a pulses miller based at Latur in Maharashtra.HARDY CROP, POLITICAL CLOUTThe sugar mill buildup in Marathwada was initially pushed by politicians in the region trying to replicate the prosperity of mills in other areas of Maharashtra state and was focused on areas with plentiful water, said Jaidev Dole, a political analyst in Aurangabad.""But later politicians opened mills everywhere, even in areas where drinking water is not available, to build a constituency rather than making farmers rich,"" he said.Farmers sell cane directly to sugar mills, effectively getting 100 percent remuneration, but other crops pass through middlemen, ensuring farmers get half the price consumers pay, said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.Sugar cane's sturdiness also attracts farmers because of limited access to insurance that protects against crop failures.Mature cane withstands heavy rainfall or dry spells and is also less vulnerable to pest and diseases compared to other crops, said farmer Sharad Mate, who has lost pulse crops due to droughts and un-seasonal rainfall.""I had taken crop insurance for pulses last year, but didn't get compensation despite losing an entire crop,"" said Mate, a farmer from Sillod, northeast of Aurangabad."

The decision was taken by a cabinet committee in its meeting scheduled in Mumbai on Wednesday, bringing respite to both farmers and sugar factories.The sugarcane crushing season generally starts in November every year and continues till April, amounting to around 150 days. Considering the sharp reduction in the sugarcane cultivation area, the state government had taken the decision to delay the crushing season up to December 1. The decision was opposed by sugar factories and farmers organizations like Raju Shetti's Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana.Welcoming the state government's decision, Vijay Autade , executive director of Shahu Sugar Factory, said, ""Sugar factories from South Maharashtra have heaved a sigh of relief following the decision to start crushing from November 5. Immediately after Diwali , the cane cutters will reach the respective regions from their hometown in Beed, Mhaswad and Sangola. It will take around two days and almost all factories will begin crushing by November 5 or 6. All factories are ready and have completed the routine cleaning and other processes required to start crushing.""He further added that there is enough sugarcane cultivation in the South Maharashtra and it was necessary for sugar factories from this region to start crushing in November. ""Besides, the neighbouring Karnataka state had decided to start crushing from November 15 and if these factories had started crushing before the factories from Maharashtra, it would have impacted on sugarcane crushing in South Maharashtra,"" Autade concluded.It should be noted that last year, the crushing season went on till mid-April and total production of sugar touched 83 lakh tonne and the production started at the sugar mills in the district on November 1."

The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills.Arun Magdum is a relieved man. The source of it is the Maharashtra government reversing a decision, taken on October 4, not to allow sugar mills in the state to crush any cane for the new 2016-17 season before December 1.Had that been implemented, it would have led to 10-15 per cent weight loss for my sugarcane, says this six-acre farmer from Mangaon, a village in Kolhapur districts Hatkanangale taluka.Mills in Maharashtra normally start crushing from end-October or early-November and wind up operations by late-April/early-May. It enables farmers, then, to plant a quick crop of summer moong (green gram) or groundnut on their vacated fields, before the main kharif season. A one-month delay in crushing rules out cultivation of moong, which, apart from giving me extra income, is also good for replenishing soil nutrients. The governments decision would have dealt a double blow, by reducing the weight of my cane and also preventing me from taking a summer crop, notes Magdum.Watch Video: Whats making newsOn Wednesday, a committee  comprising Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, minister for cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar, the sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma and representatives from the sugar industry  decided to rescind its October 4 decision. The starting date for the season has now been fixed at November 5.The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills. With severe drought conditions till almost the middle of this year impacting plantings, the state government expects mills to crush only 445 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane in 2016-17, down from 742.94 lt and 930.41 lt in the preceding two seasons. That would translate into a sugar output of just 50.28 lt, the lowest since the 46.14 lt produced in the 2008-09 season.Delayed crushing would have allowed for increased sucrose concentration in the cane, resulting in higher recovery. But now, instead of an average 11.30 per cent sugar recovery, you will have a rate of 11.2-11.25 per cent. Also, the cane that is crushed would be relatively immature with lower yields. It could lead to sugar production dropping below 50 lt, says Jaiprakash Salunkhe Dandegaonkar, vice-president, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation and chairman of the Purna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd at Hingoli.That view is also shared by S S Katake, scientist and farm in-charge of the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute. According to him, the cane crop can give 0.2-0.5 percentage points additional sugar recovery, if allowed to remain in the field for an extra month. This year, if crushing were to start by early November, mills will have only around 400 lt of cane to crush. Average recovery, too, hovers between 8-9 per cent during October-November and rising to 10-12 per cent from December. If crushing happens in November, especially this time when there is hardly any cane, you may even end up with sugar production of 40-45 lt, he warns.Low sugar recovery may also hurt farmers, as the fair and average price (FRP) of cane is linked to this rate. The more the sugar recovery, the higher is the FRP payable by mills. Farmers, however, are not buying this argument. For them, the weight loss in cane from a delayed start to crushing and the opportunity foregone in growing a summer moong or groundnut crop far outweigh any gains from higher sugar recovery.Interestingly, the industry itself has been divided on the issue. Mills in the Marathwada region and the adjoining districts of Ahmednagar and Solapur  which include those belonging to both the chairman (Shivajirao Nagavade) and vice-chairman (Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar) of the state cooperative factories federation, and also the cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh  have been in favour of commencing crushing only from December 1.But mills in western Maharashtra  the districts of Pune, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur  have opposed delay in crushing, mainly because of worries over their cane getting poached. Sangli and Kolhapur arent too far away from Karnataka, where mills are expected to begin operations by November 15. There is a shortage of cane in Karnataka. If we do not start in time, the mills there will pay upfront to our farmers, who wouldnt mind diverting their cane, notes Arun Lad, chairman of the Kranti SSK mill in Sangli.Magdum confirms that he was contacted by representatives of Karnataka mills to accept upfront payment against supply of cane. Personally, I wouldnt have wanted to give to these mills, as they pay Rs 200-500 per tonne less than the price I get from the factory here. But if the crushing was to take off only from December 1 (mills starting before that date were liable to pay a hefty fine of Rs 500 for every tonne of cane crushed), I would have been left with no option, he adds.What has tilted the equation, forcing the Fadnavis government to go back on its earlier decision, has been the greater clout wielded by western Maharashtra mills. In normal years, the Marathwada region along with Solapur and Ahmednagar contribute roughly 50 per cent to Maharashtras total sugar output. But this time, 70 per cent of production is likely to come from the four western Maharashtra districts, which were comparatively less impacted by the drought.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58ff39a57be9e0420db2eb7a,Tribals Mahasweta touched back to cursed life,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/bengal/story_114891.jsp,2016-10-22,"Little Sabars in Akhodbandh village ;villagers play a game of cards in the Sabar village of Bangthupi. Pictures by Snehamoy Chakraborty Purulia, Oct. 21: The Sabar community, the centrepiece of Mahasweta Devi's work, is not very well. Kajali Sabar and her husband Sarat make tea by boiling CTC tea leaves in water with salt. They cannot afford sugar. Kajali and Sarat live in Balakdih Sabar Tola, a village 36km from Purulia town. Around 12,000 Sabars live in Purulia's 164 Sabar tolas. The Sabars were never very well, the reason why Mahasweta Devi, the writer-activist who won the Magsaysay Award, stepped into their lives. British law had declared the Sabars a ""criminal"" tribe in 1872 and they had been ""decriminalised"" in independent India, but when Mahasweta Devi came in, they were still regarded as criminals, being arrested and tortured indiscriminately by police with a little help from other communities. Mahasweta Devi fought on behalf of the Sabars, questioning their ""criminality"", trying to lift them from utter poverty and alienation. They called her mother. At the Sabar Mela in Purulia in 1983, she was anointed ""Sabarer Ma"". She brought them hope - and livelihood. She began to market and sell their handicrafts. But it was short-lived. Her presence was withdrawn from their lives from the time she fell ill five or six years ago, and finally with her death this year on July 28. The Sabars are not picked up for every crime in the neighbourhood any more. But otherwise they are back to where Mahasweta Devi found them: utter poverty and alienation, nursing only a few habits picked up from their recent encounter with the world. Twenty years ago, a Sabar did not know tea. ""We saw people in nearby villages,"" says Sarat, in his late 50s, who makes his living by collecting wood from the forest. ""We can't afford sugar and wanting milk is pointless. We boil water with some tea and salt. It is our tea,"" says Kajali. Finding work is more difficult than finding milk. Says Mahadeb Sabar, a 60-year-old man who folded his hands in respect at the mention of Mahasweta Devi: ""When Ma came to us, we could earn about Rs 1,500 a week by selling our handicrafts. Now it is hard to earn Rs 400 a week from selling these."" In the absence of the projects Mahasweta Devi brought them, many Sabars are turning back to selling wood. This is not easy, as cutting trees is illegal without replantation, and Sabars are facing resistance from forest officials. In Bangthupi Sabar Tola, another Sabar village, Meghnad Sabar, a youth who passed Madhyamik in 2008, then stopped his education, became a labourer and married at 18. ""Two months in monsoon we work as farm labourers as all fields here are single-crop. The rest of the months we cut trees and sell in the markets in Kenda or Puncha blocks in Purulia. My daily income is about Rs 60,"" says Meghnad. ""We only eat once during the day,"" he says. The one proper meal they have is ""just phenabhat (starch rice) with salt"", he adds. Meghnad has a television set and a mobile phone, but neither works because he does not have the money to repair them. Mahasweta Devi, who had been visiting Jharkhand's Palamau tribal areas since the sixties, was introduced to the Sabars in the eighties by activist Gopi Ballabh Singh Deo, or ""Gopibabu"", a retired schoolteacher. Gopibabu, 82, who lives in Rajnowagarh village in Purulia, had already been working for the uplift of the Sabars for two decades. He founded the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti in 1968. The Sabars were ""decriminalised"" in 1952, but only in name. The police would allegedly conduct raids and torture them for every crime in their area. "" Ghorey ghumai murdhumsa, Chorey kate dhan. Jodi kaukey na pali to kheriya dhorey aan (The fat landlord sleeps and thieves cut off paddy from land. If no one can be caught, go catch a Sabar),"" the Sabars would say. The complaint that Sabars don't fit in persists, making it difficult for them to find work and even get state scheme benefits. Gopibabu is unable to speak because of his ill health. Prashanta Rakshit, the current director of the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti, which has its head office in Rajnowagarh, says Gopibabu had acted as a shield for the tribe from the police, running from one place to another to protect the Sabars from the law-enforcers' torture. ""He is the pioneer of the movement for the Sabar tribe,"" says Rakshit. The 1983 Sabar Mela had been organised to bring together members of the tribe people on one platform so that they could fight together for their rights. Mahasweta Devi, who had already written Aranyer Adhikar (The rights of a forest), her novel on the tragic, brilliant life of Santhal leader Birsa Munda, was with them. Later she would write Byadhkanda (The book of the hunter), a historical novel about Kalketu, the founder of the Sabar tribe. It is a passionate appeal to preserve the Sabar world. ""It is not that the tragedy of our life ended as soon as our mother Mahasweta Devi promised to be with us,"" says Jaladhar Sabar, secretary of the Kheriya Sabar Samiti. As the tragedy of Chuni Kotal would prove soon. The first woman graduate among the Lodha Sabars, Chuni, who graduated in 1985, could not bear her harassment in the workplace, a cell made for the welfare of Sabars. She committed suicide in 1992. Mahasweta Devi had reported the incident to the police. ""But it was the beginning of a movement. Most important, we learnt to fight the police and the government,"" Jaladhar Sabar says. The custodial death of Budhon Soren in 1998 was another flashpoint. Budhon, from Akarhbaid village, was believed to have been beaten to death in police custody, but his death was shown as suicide. After the post-mortem, the Sabars kept his body at his home for further autopsy, tricking the police by burning a false pier. Mahasweta Devi filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court and a CBI probe was ordered. The case is still being heard. Mahasweta Devi marketed the Sabar handicrafts made traditionally with Kashi Ghas, leaves of date-palm trees and bamboo as far as she could in original ways. ""We began training camps. Within two years the Sabars, mainly women, started to make money. We used to buy handicrafts directly and our organisation sold it at different shops and fairs in Calcutta and Delhi,"" says Rakshit, who travelled with Mahasweta Devi to various countries. ""Didi (Mahasweta Devi) used to keep the handicrafts in her Calcutta home. She would tell visitors: 'I will give you an autograph if you buy one handicraft made by my Sabar daughters',"" Rakshit adds. Not that targeting Sabars ended following Mahasweta Devi's efforts. In 2003, Bhadra Sabar of Tilabani village under Boro police station was killed when villagers allegedly threw stones at him on charges of theft. The police and officials feel that a section of Sabar men were involved mainly in road robbery till one or two years ago. But as Jaladhar Sabar points out: ""The torture by the police has gone down. We will continue our fight to bring proper financial and social development to our people."" That is the big challenge. The Samiti gives legal help and still conducts training for Sabar people to make handicrafts and market these. But it is not enough. It is also clear that Mahasweta Devi's work model was not sustainable. Some other personalities who promised help have disappointed the Sabars. The Samiti members said that in the nineties, five schools opened in Sabar villages, but have closed down recently because of lack of funding. The villagers in Bangthupi and Akarhbaid said no teacher was willing to teach their children as no one can pay. Individuals and organisations who visited the Sabar villages because of Mahasweta Devi have left. Desperate, many Sabars ""upgraded"" their traditional practices into lucrative ones. Earlier the Sabars would make liquor from Mahua, but now they are using molasses and yeast to brew alcohol and sell it. In Bangthupi, a Class VI student was found making hooch in his house. This business makes his family more prosperous than others in the village. ""My left leg was cut off as it was burnt in an accident. I had no option other than selling hooch. I earn Rs 400 in three days,"" says Anil Sabar, the father of the Class VI student. Other Sabars are going the contemporary way: migrating. Sabar women have begun to go to Purulia to work as maids and a large number of young men are migrating to Gujarat, Mumbai or Bangalore to work as construction labourers. Kalyani Sabar from Balakdih village, who received handicrafts training for Mahasweta Devi's projects, has started working as a maid. She is happy. Kalyani is proud that she could spend Rs 4,000 on the last rites of her father and treat all villagers to lunch, comprising fish, chicken, vegetable curry and plenty of rice with aloo posto and chutney. ""I could afford the money only because I started work as a maid. I earn Rs 4,000 easily a month. My son Motilal works as a labourer in Purulia town,"" she says. At least 1,000 Sabar youths, mostly school dropouts, go to other states every year to work as construction labourers and return home with at least Rs 15,000 every four months or so. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has not been much of a help. Few job cards have been updated since 2008. ""I don't know how to get work under the scheme. No one calls us,"" says Uttor Sabar, 40. A district official from Purulia says the Sabar people had not been brought under the government project successfully because of their ""culture"". The Sabars, hunters and wood-gatheres, do not enjoy the kind of work possible under such a scheme, he adds. Same with government institutions. Sabars do not fit in. ""We have provided concrete houses to them under government schemes. Many of them are not concerned about bank accounts or documents, which we provided by going to their villages. We are trying to connect them with the mainstream with Aadhaar card facilities,"" says Ajay Sengupta, the block development officer of Puncha. One solution would be to give agricultural land, Rakshit feels. ""But it would take a special initiative from the government to provide agricultural land for a 'decriminalised' tribe like the Sabars."""

Sambhajiraje also helped convince top BJP brass to induct Ghatage into the party.""Samarjit is the son of the late Vikramsinha Ghatage, who is credited with running Shahu factory successfully for many years.Ghatage's induction will help BJP to keep NCP leader and former minister Hasan Mushrif busy in Kagal. At present, Mushrif faces opposition from Shiv Sena's Sanjay Mandalik and Sanjay Ghatage , both prominent leaders from Kagal.The NCP's local leaders claim that the move will affect the party's prospectus in the zilla parishad elections. Kagal is considered school of politics as each leader has visible mass support and elections here are won not on party lines but on the basis of number of leaders on each side.The elections to ZP will be decisive with respect to the political clout of all these leaders. People from Kagal have always favoured grassroots leaders against those belonging to wealthy background, said a local NCP leader."

""We have asked the local party workers to take a call on an alliance. We will not ignore their feelings,"" Danve said.The tone of contesting local elections sans Sena was set in June when the BJP state executive body met in Pune where state executive members were vociferous in their demand that Sena should exit the state government if it was unhappy.BJP's poll strategists have prepared an analytical report for the sugar belt which shows that the NCP retained its base in western Maharashtra in 2014 assembly polls even as BJP gained in the urban areas of the region. Of the 58 assembly constituencies in the sugar belt, the BJP won 19 seats -- mostly in urban areas and mainly in Pune-Pimpri Chinchwad. The Sena, on the other hand, won 12 seats. The NCP, however, succeeded in guarding its bastion by taking 16 seats.""If the BJP wants to improve in the sugar belt, it needs to take on Sharad Pawar's party on its own. The NCP was able to win at least one seat in all the five districts in Pune, Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Kolhapur. The BJP, which won most seats in urban areas, was not able to perform well in the rural parts. Shiv Sena has a small base in Western Maharashtra and it is right time for the BJP to eat into Sena's base and lock horns with the NCP,"" said a senior BJP minister. He said that if they decide to go solo in the local polls, the straight fight will be between BJP and NCP. Congress, with just seven seats in assembly from the region, has been reduced to a small player.Western Maharashtra has been the lifeline of Sharad Pawar's politics as his party dominates local bodies, the sugar and milk co-operatives and educational and financial institutes. The party controls a majority of power centres -- from municipal corporations to gram panchayats and from district central banks to village credit societies.""I am traveling in rural parts to understand the mood of party workers. We want an alliance, but not at the cost of our party's growth. BJP is capable of contesting the local polls on its own,"" said senior cabinet minister Girish Bapat.BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Kakade said, ""We have already told the chief minister and state party president that the BJP is strong enough to contest on its own in a city like Pune.""BJP's Sangli MP Sanjay Patil said the BJP has developed its own strength in the region and is all prepared to gain roots in the rural parts of the region."
593f5ccb7be9e024e459630c,Mumbai: Sugar baron’s distillery licence revoked,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/mumbai-sugar-barons-distillery-licence-revoked-3097847/,2016-10-23,"Maharashtras Excise department has permanently revoked the professional licence of a distillery owned by sugar baron Ratnakar Gutte after it was accused of being involved in an illegal liquor racket.The sugar baron, considered close to the current BJP-led government, may even face criminal charges in the matter, confirmed top sources. While revoking the distillerys licence Friday, Excise Commissioner V Radha directed her staff to slap a criminal case against Gutte, along with other directors of the distillery.Gutte is known to have enjoyed close ties with former Union minister (late) Gopinath Munde. He had even unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Assembly polls from Parbhanis Gangakhed constituency as the official candidate of the BJP-led alliance. In 2015, Guttes flagship company, Sunil Hitech, had courted controversy over water conservation contracts allotted to it in Parbhani by Maharashtras Water Conservation department, which was led by Mundes daughter Pankaja at that time. Last year, the Income Tax department, too, had raided Sunil Hitechs offices.The fresh trouble with the Excise department comes at a time when Sunil Hitechs stocks have surged. Gutte, when contacted, however, said the controversy wont impact the companys performance in the stock market.The controversyGangakhed Sugar and Energy Private Limited, a group company of Sunil Hitech, runs a molasses-based distillery in Parbhani with a total capacity of almost 60 kilo litres daily. Gutte is the companys chairman, while his wife Sudhamati and son Sunil are co-directors.The Excise department has alleged that the distillery had illegally supplied ethanol or rectified spirit for the manufacture of illicit liquor. In the licence cancellation orders issued Friday, the firm has been accused of unauthorised transportation of intoxicants, unauthorised sale of duty evaded intoxicants, wilful violation of norms, among others.According to information, the trouble for the firm began after September 6 when the departments enforcement division intercepted a tanker (MH04 DS 9808) containing 20,000 litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Ahmednagars Pathardi. The tankers driver and cleaner, who were arrested, allegedly told investigators that the consignment, which was allegedly being transported to a notorious alcohol maker operating along the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border, had originated from the distillery. Top sources said about 1 crore litres of alcohol, worth several crores, could be brewed using the supply.Investigators claimed the driver had confessed that the distillerys in-charge, identified as Balasaheb Lohar, had contacted him over the phone that day asking him to collect the consignment. The department, which had earlier filed a case against the driver and the cleaner, has obtained call data records for evidence of the conversation which took place between Lohar and the driver. Investigators said the same records also show that the driver was in the distillerys premises for over an hour that day. They have further obtained CCTV footage from a nearby toll naka, which proves the driver had been to the distillery to collect the consignment.During further investigations, the department came across 1,071.85 tonne of unaccounted for molasses at the distillery. Similarly, 6,232.76 tonne of unaccounted for molasses was found at the sugar factory. Rejecting the firms claim that the molasses found in excess in the distillery and the sugar mill had been gained in surplus during sugar production last year, the departments cancellation order has charged the firm over an intention to divert this for the manufacture of illicit alcohol. On the basis of the orders on Friday, excise officials will now confiscate the distillerys belongings, including the unutilised molasses, revealed top sources.Foul play, says firmGutte, when contacted, indicated plans to go into appeal against the revocation order. According to the department procedure, the firm can file an appeal before Minister of State (Excise) Vijay Deshmukh.Denying any links with either the tanker operator or the alcohol maker, Gutte alleged that he was being targeted unfairly. My distillery already enjoys tax concessions under the mega projects category. Why should I evade the small tax I have to pay then, he said.Interestingly, even as Gutte denied that the intercepted tanker had collected the rectified spirit from his distillery, the firm, in its written reply to the department, has agreed that Lohar was employed with the distillery. It has also agreed that the tanker in question had transported duty paid spirit from the distillery. Gutte further argued that he had approached the department last year to regularise the excess molasses gained, but the department had rejected his application on June 14 this year without citing any grounds. While they (the department) rejected our plea, it did not tell us how to dispose of the surplus molasses, Gutte argued.Radhas cancellation order, however, has rejected this argument. The surplus molasses found is above 5 per cent of the sugar mills production capacity, which cannot be regularised under norms, the order states. It has also rejected the firms contention that the molasses found at the distillery had flowed accidentally from the mill.Second big catchEarlier on October 17, the Excise department had revoked the countryliquor licence of Osmanabad-based Vitthal Distilleries Private Limited, which is run by the family of NCPs sitting MLA Babanrao Shinde, over a two-year-old case related to illegal sale and disposal of 23,227 litres of countryliquor. Vitthal Distilleries has already gone into appeal against the order. Ironically, Vijay Deshmukh, the MoS (Excise), who will hear the matter, represents the same district as Shinde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

About distribution of seats in the upcoming civic polls and an alliance with Shiv Sena, Patil said,  We are not at all thinking of breaking the alliance with the Sena. We have given freedom to our party workers to take decisions at the local level. And so our allies should stop giving repeated threats of breaking the alliance. In the past few years, BJP has emerged as a stronger party and the seats should be distributed considering this. Even Sena must demand seats keeping their strength in mind.

This is the 15th sugarcane conference organised by Shetti and is considered the annual congregation of the party and sugarcane farmers, who have launched agitations for higher price after the conferences in the past.The demand would set the tone of the upcoming local municipal elections in western Maharashtra, considered the sugar bowl of the state. Politics in western Maharashtra, especially Kolhapur and Satara districts, revolves around the sugar cane farmers's demands and sugar mills in the region.According to sources from the party, Shetti will make demand that will be accepted by every farmer attending the conference. ""This year, the sugarcane cultivation area is less compared to last year and the number of sugar mills has remained the same. This may increase the bargaining power of the sugarcane farmers and Shetti may demand Rs 3,000 as first instalment of sugarcane from sugar factories,"" sources told TOI.Bhagwan Kate, district unit head of SSS said, the annual sugarcane conference will begin from Tuesday where farmers from across the state will participate. ""Shetti will declare the first instalment on Tuesday during conference. It will be mandatory on every sugar factory to declare the first instalment before the start of the crushing season. We will not allow any factory to start sugar cane crushing until the factories declare their first instalment price for cane producers,"" he said.The state has advanced the crushing season from December 1 to November 5 and the sugar factories are prepared to start crushing sugar cane immediately after Diwali . SSS activists have already shown their mood by setting fire to a truck carrying cane to the Warana co-operative sugar mill as the factory started crushing before declaring first instalment to the farmers."

We will need to wait and watch,"" Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala said.Sales growth from most consumer-product companies over the past two years suggest that many are grappling with choppy demand, especially in rural markets, local competition and an unfavourable monsoon. Last year's monsoon was the worst in six years with a rain shortfall of 14%. Bad weather also damaged crops.""Our discussions with corporates as well as distributors indicate no meaningful uptick in consumer spending in the second quarter. But companies are optimistic about the second half of the year in view of normal monsoon after two consecutive years of drought and increased government spending on infrastructure and salaries. We expect the benefits of increased rural demand to start reflecting post-harvest towards the end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of FY17,"" said Arnab Vora, analyst at BNP Paribas Price changes were limited and promotional intensity remained high in select categories such as shampoos, biscuits, soft drinks, hair oils and toothpaste. However, it has come down in soaps and detergents over past few months. ""We expect demand to be primarily volume-led rather than based on value. There has been an accelerated focus on promotions and value offers across the sector,"" PepsiCo India chairman DShivakumar, said.A report last week by researcher Nielsen forecast consumption revival in soft drinks in the festive quarter riding on the back of aggressive pricing, volume-led growth and newer channels of distribution including e-commerce, overtaking growth in the peak summer months.The industry, led by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, has been seeing single digit growth for the past six quarters at least. Analysts said they expect aggregate volume growth to slip further in September quarter to roughly 3% compared to 4-5% in the June quarter.At the same time, margin expansion will be much lower as the base had benefits such as lower crude prices. Over the last three years, several companies have aggressively discounted and slashed prices in an effort to win shoppers, especially the ones that have slowed down spends in discretionary daily items.Prices of key raw materials such as wheat, sugar and palm oil, though low, have been gradually rising, which could impact profitability if promotions continue.For instance, input costs such as palm oil has increased 17% while sugar and wheat prices are up 59% and 14% each, respectively, over a year ago period. ""FMCG revenue growth will likely remain steady as there will be some pick-up in price growth which will compensate for lower volumes. The price offers in soaps are being pulled back while price hikes in personal care are underway,"" according to Arnab Mitra and Rohit Kadam of Credit Suisse. Experts also feel consumer companies will need resurgence in volume growth or pricing growth to meet market expectations of double-digit domestic business earnings growth.""Volume growth trends, government stimuli in rural India, pricing power amidst increases in commodity costs and consumer promotion intensity will be drivers for stock performance,"" said a recent report by Morgan Stanley that last month downgraded the Indian consumer sector expecting weaker revenue and profit growth at a time when the industry grew about 4% last year, the lowest in 13 years."

Excerpts:When (MNS leader) Raj Thackeray brought up this topic of Rs 5 crore (donation to the Army Welfare Fund) during the meeting, I told the Film Producers Guild clearly that I am opposed to it and that you don't need to accept it. We had no issues over the other two conditions (about Pak artistes being banned from future movie projects and showing a slide paying tribute to soldiers before the screening of the film). I told them in front of Raj that the contribution has to be voluntary and upon how much patriotism you feel. I clearly told them that you need not pay this amount. However, the producers themselves were keen on it and said that they wanted to pay.See, the guild wanted me to intervene; it was not my decision to call Raj Thackeray for a meeting. When there was a need for action we did it, we had arrested 12 of their cadres (who barged in to a South Mumbai theatre). However, when there is a possibility of the issue being ended by talks then it should happen, this is the essence of democracy.The Jalyukt Shivar project to conserve water is the biggest project. Our state was in drought for years consecutively. For the first time we have turned this in to a people's movement. The other major initiative we have taken is that we were always lagging in education  our rank was 13th to 16th as per the Economic Survey. The learning outcome has been dismal as 60% of 5th standard students could not read the books of the third standard. So we have focused on learning outcomes. Today, in 17,000 schools the learning outcome is 100%. 15,000 students from private English medium schools have migrated to government-run schools this year.What we are planning is to bring the agricultural feeders on the solar network. We are making two pilot projects. Earlier we used to give farmers electricity in the morning and in the evening. This electricity was also heavily subidised by charging more from industries. If we convert our agricultural feeders into solar network, we would be able to supply cheaper power to the farmers and also curb transmission losses. The other major initiative that we are going to undertake is to bring in a scheme for sensor-based drip irrigation. We would be approaching sugar factories asking them to take a loan to provide money to sugarcane farmers to install sensorbased drip irrigation as it leads to better yield with less wastage of water. Those factories that don't participate in this will not be eligible for any of the state schemes.The WB cannot put any conditions on us that the situation doesn't exist anymore. Now we put the conditions (on them), everybody is coming to give us money. Take the example of the Nagpur-Mumbai Communication Expressway, this would change the future of the state. When it is completed our state would be 20 years ahead of the rest of the country. Twenty-four districts would be integrated with Mumbai. In 10 hours you will be able to reach Mumbai from anywhere. In 16 hours maximum a container would be able to reach JNPT. The petroleum ministry has agreed to lay four pipelines below this road, one will carry gas, one will carry petrol and one will carry petrochemicals. Imagine a stretch of 800 KMs  an entire industrial stretch would come up. The reason the electronics industry has not been able to set up in India is, to sustain, the industry needs gas and with this project this will open up both Mumbai and Nagpur for gasbased industries.We are not monetising land, we will just securitise it, we are just showing our worth, we are going to start a holding company where we will show all our assets and we will get loan accordingly. For instance, for the Nagpur-Mumbai expressway, we have got Rs 34,000 crore from private sector banks and ADB after we told that the land we have is worth Rs 50,000 crore. Similarly, we are also retiring our costly loans. For instance, from the energy department, we had loans taken at 11.5%. We have now brought it down to 8.50%. This will result in annual savings of Rs 800 crore.The kind of protests that the Marathas are taking out is something that we cannot criticise because this is ideal in democracy. By launching a peaceful protest they are piling on pressure on the state and we are acting on it. If there was violence in the morchas, then I don't think there would be any pressure on us. There are legacy issues but the issue could be resolved, the two communities should not stand against each other but should work together ... The Dalits should not think that every other community is coming together to bring down their security. We have to ensure that this feeling should not be allowed to develop. Most of the Maratha community leaders want to resolve the issue. Only a few want to exploit it for political gains.None of the organisers of the morcha is interested (in that). However, there are some among the political parties who are interested in a leadership change through the movement.I said that I won't be a lame duck CM even for a single day. I won't sit in the chair for enjoying it, I want to lead the state to progress. You can write it down that I would be the chief minister for the complete five years.We want him to come back.We had formed a committee to look into the issue. The committee found that the agreement with the toll operators was so lopsided and in favour of the contractor that if we cancel the contract, the contractor would benefit immensely. It's a matter of surprise as to how the contracts were executed by the previous governments. Even the irrigation contracts are the same, hence we cancelled many of the contracts in the Gosikhurd project as the tenders were given at double the normal rates."

File Bombay High Court. FileSugar millers in Maharashtra heaved a sigh of relief as the Bombay High Court temporarily put a stay on action, by either the Central or state government, against millers who had failed to adhere to 24 per cent stock ceiling. The High Court issued the order on Monday while hearing the ongoing case filed by sugar millers against the stock limit. In September, the Central government issued a circular directing sugar millers to not hold more than 37 per cent stock of sugar by the end of September. The same would then be reduced to 24 per cent by the end of October, protesting which as many as 55 state mills moved the High Court.Watch What Else Is Making NewsSurge in the price of sugar in the retail market had prompted the Central government to take the decision.Vice-President of Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, confirmed the order saying, The court had directed both the Central and state government not to take action against millers who have failed to adhere to the stock limit. The High Court has fixed November 17 as the next date for hearing, he added.Earlier, the HC had refused to put a blanket stay on the ceiling.While no action was taken against the mills who had failed to adhere to the ceiling, around 28 mills were issued notices by the department of civil supplies. Due to its higher production, mills in Maharashtra had a higher stock of sugar as compared to those in Uttar Pradesh or Karnataka.Good price realisation in the domestic market has made millers cautious about releasing their stock. Besides, a lean upcoming season had bouyed their hopes of better price realisation in the future. Currently, around 32-40 mills in the state have more stock than the allowed limit. Sanjiv Babar, managing director of the federation, said millers might have to sell eight to nine lakh tonnes of sugar to meet the limits set by the government which may soon ease out sugar prices in the retail market.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This compares quite favourably with the Rs. 240 and Rs. 290 for the two varieties respectively at the beginning of 2015-16 season.The 2015-16 season turned out to be quite good for the market. It received 30 lakh lumps (each of 15 kg) i.e., 45,000 tonnes of jaggery during the season.The black quality began to be bought at Rs. 220 and moved up to Rs. 270 and the deluxe from Rs. 270 to Rs. 320 during the season. Traders stocked about 13,000 tonnes from January to April, say market sources.When demand rose they started offloading beginning at Rs. 290 for the black variety and it shot up to Rs. 360. The best quality had begun at Rs. 330 and ended at a high of Rs. 450, according to market sources.What resulted in considerable improvement in the rate for the stocks enabling us to offload the inventory was the crop failure in Maharashtra, analyses prominent trader Korukonda Butchiraju of Anakapalle.Said to be the second largest jaggery market in the country, the Anakapalle market has a a turnover of more than Rs. 110 crore.Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are major sugarcane producing States and failure in the latter has also resulted in spurt in sugar price, he points out.The price for a quintal of sugar that was more than Rs. 2,000 jumped to around Rs. 3,700 in 2015-16 season, he said."

A formal announcement in this regard is expected from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai on Wednesday.However, it will be a tough task for the BJP leaders to keep all the alliance partners in tandem. Raju Shetti's Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana , which has been with the BJP since 2014, has been a strong opponent of the Jansurajya Party. Both Shetti and Kore have stood against each other at many platforms, especially during the agitations of farmers.District guardian minister Chandrakant Patil said, ""We have formally completed the discussions with Kore and he will soon be part of the ruling BJP alliance. His party will be the sixth, including the BJP, to be a part of the ruling state government. Kore will meet Fadnavis in Mumbai on Wednesday morning, where the formal announcement will be done in the presence of senior BJP leaders.""He added, ""Adding Kore and his party to our list of friends will make BJP powerful in south Maharashtra, including Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur. Jansurajya Party members will be now part of BJP alliance and our first test of unity will be the local body elections in the state. BJP will help Jansurajya party and vice versa during the forthcoming municipal council elections in the districts.""Shetti and Kore are traditional rivals and Shetti's party has always targeted Kore and his sugar factory during farmers agitation. Kore has never heeded to the pressure of agitations of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana for sugarcane price.Just last week, members of SSS set a truck carrying sugarcane crop to Kore's Warana co-operative sugar mill on fire alleging that the factory should not start sugar cane crushing without paying last year's arrears to the farmers.The Jansurajya Party joining the BJP coalition will also change political equations in the district. Vinay Kore had formed alliance with NCP during the Kolhapur Municipal Corporations election, Kolhapur District Central Co-operative bank and Agricultural Producers Market Committee elections. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana had formed alliance with Congress at ZP elections and was in power there."

Express Archive Succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. Express ArchiveBY THE summer of 2015, when the new state government was about six months old, the refrain in rural Maharashtra was that voters might have miscalculated terribly in being swept up by the Modi wave. Led by the BJP, a mostly urban party, the government appeared to be at a loss on how to stem the rising rural discontent.Now, two years into its tenure, the government finds that succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. But with the rain gods having finally offered respite this year, September-end sowing data showed that a recovery could well be under way in the fields  the state government has recorded a 11 per cent increase in area under cultivation, storage levels in the big reservoirs augurs a likely good Rabi season too.The biggest challenge for this government in this sector was handling drought, and hardly any relief or compensation was paid to farmers and agricultural labourers, said Dr Ashok Dhawale, national joint secretary of the left-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha. In fact, as the rural economy worsened owing to drought, the state persisted with time-worn relief strategies, spending more and more on fodder camps and water tankers. In 2014-15, the state sought a Central assistance of Rs 6,013.28 crore  it received Rs 1,962.99 crore. It then sought Rs 4,002.82 crore in 2015-16 and received Rs 3,049.36 crore.In worst-hit Marathwada, from subsidised foodgrain to free fodder camps for animals, state relief measures were central to farmers lives during the summer months, but the impact of the distress on various aspects of rural life continued to deepen.Additionally, the bankruptcy of the governments policies is seen in its inability to offer a right price for farm produce. This year, to give you one example, soyabean and moong prices are half of last years prices  the peasantry has more crop this year but still, less money, said Dr Dhawale, adding that issues such as the connection between rising malnutrition-related infant deaths to agrarian distress had not even been touched upon.In fact, farm prices have been a recurring ground for criticism of the states agriculture policies, across commodities.Due to the low price of sugar, mills ran into trouble last year with many failing to clear payments to growers  a first for the sector. Together, the state and the Central governments had cleared Rs 1,200 crore as excise and soft loans for the sector to help them pay the growers. Millers on their part had wanted the above amount as a grant, which the government refused. They have to start repayment of the loans from this season. Non- payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to growers also led to action against 34 mills in the last two years  the highest ever recorded in the state. While millers accelerated the payments, the crushing season of 2016-17 kicks off alongside unpaid dues of Rs 123 crore. This, despite the presence of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana  representative of thousands of cane growers  in the state government.Millers concede that this has sent out a strong message to the powerful sugar barons  no more largesse and bailouts to the sector, something it had been accustomed to. One of the promises on which this government was elected was a fair price for farm produce, and the government has committed a breach of faith of farmers, said Raghunathdada Patil, senior farmer leader who contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on an AAP ticket. Worse, multiple laws this government passed have been anti-farmer. The beef ban law, for example, has led to interference of the state even on a farmers pashudhan (livestock). And then, whether its a bullet train or smart cities or other land acquisition, its the farmers who are at a loss.The state has also not been able to reverse the low coverage of agriculture insurance in Maharashtra. In 2014-15, Maharashtra had 22 per cent of gross cropped area insured, not even half the percentage scored by Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. On the positive side, there is now an agriculture policy of the state government, with the mission-mode objectives clearly stated  to achieve 4 per cent growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors, to promote entrepreneurship in agriculture and allied sectors, to increase net farm returns, crop diversification, etc.Also on the positive side, during 2014-15, Maharashtra stood first in terms of fruit production with a 12.22 per cent share in total national production, despite low productivity.In a huge reform, the state has also launched farmer-to-consumer markets alongside taking forward the APMC reforms for more barrier-free markets.Some of these moves are seen as political. The market committees, for instance, have been strongholds of the NCP and the Congress. The government has now taken to appointing expert directors on these bodies. Former NCP MLA and president of the federation of APMCs Dilip Mohite Patil called this an attempt by the Sena-BJP to gain a backdoor entry to these bodies.Another innovative reform is a pilot project of 10,000 solar pumps for agriculture, offering round-the-year power, a reduced demand-supply gap and a lower subsidy burden to the state electricity board. The policy also makes mention of infusing public investment in agriculture, to boost growth and build capacity, about furthering agricultural research and, critically, the revival of district cooperative banks. Much of this, however, will only begin once the government is well into its third year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Along with this there are number of issues on which we have raised objections, including Central government policies towards co-operative sector and sugar factories. I registered an objection to include sugar in essential commodities segment and have demanded that government should deregularise sugar prices. We hope that government will look into these matters soon.""Kore is the third major personality from Kolhapur district that BJP has succeeded to rope in into the party after Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati and Samrjeetsinh Ghatage.

This year, even the North Indian community in Kerala has decided to steer clear of bursting crackers, plastic decorations and over-consumption of power, going in for a green Diwali ! Check out how.Mumbaikar Rekha Mahindra and her friends in Wayanad have taken a unanimous decision to avoid non-biodegradable accessories and use only recycled products to spice up their Diwali celebrations this year.""In the past, the rangoli was made with rice and pulses and was used to feed birds. So this year, we have bucked the trend of using artificial colours and returned to the old ways. It is also a good way of sharing food with small birds and ants during the festival,"" says Rekha, adding that she will be using natural flowers from her garden to give her rangoli a finishing touch.To decorate the house, they are using recycled materials instead of plastic accessories. ""Instead of candles and electric lights, we made diyas out of orange peels, coconut shells and wheat dough. And we are gifting indoor plants and kitchen herbs with cards made of recycled paper tied to them,"" Rekha explains.The group are also giving plastic gift wrappers and disposable plates a miss. ""The festival meal will be served in plantain leaves and the drinks in steel tumblers,"" she says.As the festival of lights usually sees a spike in electricity consumption, many in the State will be using natural diyas instead of electric lights. And those who have busy schedules are going for LED lights, which consume less power.Gujarati Rajani Sheth, who is settled in Kochi, says, ""I cannot imagine a Diwali without lights. For safety and ease, I was using electric lights all these years. But this year I will turn off the lights and light up diyas that are bio-degradable. Diwalis from now will also serve as 'save your electricity day' for my family.""Those who took pride in bursting the maximum number of vibrant crackers seem to have finally realised that all that expenditure is unnecessary. Bollywood actor Karan Khandelwal, who was born and brought up in Kozhikode, confesses that he and his friends have often wasted a lot of money over crackers.""This year we plan to donate all the money that we usually spend on crackers to orphanages and old-age homes. We were burning our hard-earned cash in the name of the festival, to satisfy our pride. Why not use it for charity and light up the lives of the marginalised?"" asks Karan.Many in the state have taken patriotism to another level by shunning Chinese products. ""In the previous years, I used to buy Chinese crackers that are more colourful but this year I am going solely for 'Made in India' products. I am a patriotic person and won't encourage the use of crackers from China whose policies are anti-Indian,"" says Kochi-based IT employee Karthik S, a Delhi native.Homemaker Sanjana Bhoi from Chhattisgarh, residing in Kochi, says that Diwali is the festival of lights and not of noise and pollution.Supporting her view, Bunty Singh, a Punjabi entrepreneur in Kochi, says, ""Bursting crackers is part of our tradition and we cannot skip it. However we are going for a noiseless one considering the animals in the neighbourhood. We will be using crackers like ground spinners and fountains that do not produce any sound,"" he says.Animal lover Monica Kothari says, ""Animals are sensitive and can hear noises four to seven times louder than humans. The noise of crackers is traumatic for dogs, cats and even birds. We are all for a cracker-free Diwali.""Many families of the Marwadi community in Kerala have decided to quit crackers to stay away from pollution. ""The pollution levels increase during Diwali celebrations with levels of harmful gases such as SO2 shooting up. This leads to a lot of respiratory ailments such as asthma. So, this year we have all decided to avoid crackers of all kinds,"" says Anju Rajesh Kajeriwal.A lot of people give their healthy diet a miss during Diwali. However, a few have decided to say no to the sugar loaded sweet boxes. ""Instead of milk cakes, peda and barfi, we are preparing sweets at home using millets, brown rice, rice flakes and dry fruits. Some of the sweets we make are healthier alternatives like fruit sandesh and carrot-beetroot halwa. Going a step ahead, we are replacing sugar with jaggery,"" says Priyanka Rajani, a Gujarati settled in Kannur."

After remaining stable at 36,000 per tonne in September, sugar prices increased to a new high of 36,500 per tonne in October.Supported by an expected decline in the sugar production during the 2016-17 sugar season (October-September), actual decline in the domestic sugar stocks during the 2015-16 season, and a global sugar deficit scenario, which drove up international sugar prices, prices are still ruling high.Sugar prices are likely to remain firm in the next 3-4 quarters given the tight supply situation in the domestic market, analysts tracking the sector said.Prices have surged by 15.9% since March this year. Sugar prices have been on an uptrend since hitting a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne last July. Sugar production is estimated to have declined 11% to 25.2 million tonnes in 2015-16 season.Ratings agency ICRA expects domestic sugar production to decline by about 8% to 23.2 million tonnes during the 2016-17 season.This is largely on account of lower cane availability in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to poor monsoon rainfall last year.Although the monsoons are better this year, the impact on the cane output would be seen only in the 2017-18 season as sugarcane is a long gestation crop.While sugar mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka are likely to benefit from the rising sugar prices and the stagnant cane costs, cane pricing in UP, which is yet to be fixed for the 2016-17 season, will be crucial for the sustainability of the profitability for the UP-based sugar mills going forward.The union government imposed sugar stock limits in April this year in order to boost availability of sugar in the open market and help control the price rise. The limit on stock holding was approved for a period of six months and fixed at stock limit of 500 tonnes and a turnover limit of 30 days for sugar traders in the country.In a recent notification, the government has extended the limit for another six months i.e. till April 2017.""The extension of stock holding limits for sugar mills and traders by six months till April 2017 is unlikely to have any significant negative near term impact on sugar prices,"" ratings agency ICRA said.""This move in conjunction with earlier measures such as imposition of a 20% export duty on sugar and withdrawal of incentives on sugar exports is likely to however restrain any further hike in the near term,"" said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president, ICRA."
58f6b3f0a3d24b0b70c2e327,Crushed by the cane lobby,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Crushed-by-the-cane-lobby/article16013754.ece,2016-11-03,"In a move that marks the reversal of a decision made on October 4, the Maharashtra State government has decided to start the sugar cane crushing season from November 5 instead of December 1 as proposed earlier. The decision was made taking into account apprehensions of weight loss due to late harvesting and of poaching by millers of neighbouring Karnataka especially from the sugar cane-rich Kolhapur and Sangli belt of western Maharashtra.Rumblings in the sugar sectorMaharashtra is the largest producer of sugar in India, contributing almost 37 per cent of the total national output. The 2016-17 sugar season is distinctly different for three reasons. First, this year marks the completion of a decade since major reforms were introduced in the Sugarcane Control (Order), 1966 via reduction of the aerial distance limit between two sugar units to 15 km from 50 km and the dropping of provision 5B, also known as Bhargava formula; the provision had enabled limited profit sharing out of excessive realisation from the sale of free sugar, in case of erratic cane supply, with cane farmers of the mill. Second, the estimated availability of sugar cane this year stands at 445 lakh tons, implying that the State will produce just 5 million tons (MT) of sugar as against 8.5 MT last season. With just 90 days of crushing, a large number of mills will remain shut resulting in idle machinery, extra manpower cost, and a likely default on term-loan repayment leading to non-performing assets. Third, the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, championing the cause of sugar cane farmers for the past 15 years, is agitating for an increased cane price.Cooperative sugar mills have contributed largely to the development of rural Maharashtra by providing consistent farm income to large shareholding members. But the ownership profile of sugar factories in the State has undergone a major change in the past decade with the amendment to Section 6A of the Sugarcane Control (Order), 1966. The change has also been accentuated by the questionable practice of lending banks, especially the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, taking over assets under the provisions of the SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest) Act, 2002. Data indicate that altogether 68 cooperative units were liquidated and sold later to the private sector, to entities floated by cooperative barons themselves, with a few exceptions.The bigwigs of the sugar cooperatives, including former State cooperative ministers, floated private sugar units, in a way sowing the seeds of doubt on the working and efficacy of the cooperative model. The number of private sugar factories in Maharashtra has consistently increased from 2006-07. Almost 154 private sugar units have obtained Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM); at present there are 78 operational private sugar mills with total crushing capacity of 2.48 lakh tons of cane per day (TCD) as against a mere 12 private units a decade ago. In comparison the number of operational cooperative units stands at 102 with a capacity of 3.52 lakh TCD. Private sector capacity gradually increased from 10 per cent of the total sugar production in the State to 45 per cent.Cooperatives vs private millsThe natural question that arises is how the increase in private sector participation impacted the sugar cane payment and sugar recovery per ton of sugarcane crushed. The change in ownership pattern has impacted the cane price payment to the growers in the State (see graphs). To understand the payment dynamics, it is essential to understand the process of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP), a payment model unique to Maharashtra. Unlike other cane-producing States where the farmer brings his produce to the factory for crushing, in Maharashtra it is picked up by sugar millers from the farmers fields to ensure uninterrupted cane supply and smooth operations.The harvesting and transportation (H&T) cost thus incurred by millers is, however, ultimately deducted from the FRP paid to the farmers. A year-on-year analysis of H&T costs incurred by cooperative and private millers illustrates the larger impact. The private units have incurred Rs.57.07, Rs.48.58 and Rs.83.14 per ton on H&T more than cooperative units in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively, implying thereby that the cane farmers are burdened by an additional Rs.477.20 crore. Likewise, the cooperative sector sugar recovery rate, which is directly linked to the FRP paid to farmers, has always been higher than that of the private sector over the same period.The difference between cooperative and private sector in recovery when monetised, calculating on the basis of FRP fixed by the Government of India, comes to Rs.1076.10 crore. Shockingly, in some cases cooperative sugar units reported less H&T expenditure and better recovery before management was taken over by the private sector. If both H&T and recovery are put together in monetary terms, the ultimate loss is borne by sugar cane farmers due to dwindling payments under private mills.The common belief is that the private sector is competitive, efficient and professionally managed when compared to the cooperative sector. Ironically, the private sugar sector in Maharashtra doesnt stand the test of data. How can such differences between cooperative and private sector in sugar recovery and H&T cost  which are directly related to cane payment  be explained?Cooperative society members, with easy access to management, meetings of the board of directors and vigilance on the factory premises during and after crushing, bring in effective stakeholder participation in the overall working of mills. As a result there is better sugar recovery and considerable reduction in cost of H&T, thus financially benefitting the cane farmers. Given this backdrop, the recent trend of cooperative sugar barons opting to set up private sugar units despite overwhelming support of shareholders for the cooperative model is alarming. This, when the entire country is looking to emulate the Maharashtra sugar cooperatives model.Steps to control retail sugar prices  such as like putting stock limits on millers and wholesale traders, capping of retail prices, increased cess and non-payment of export incentives  succeed in providing relief to consumers even though they impact the earnings of millers. In a similar manner, identifying and effectively implementing steps to protect farmers interests is the need of the hour. The provisions of the Maharashtra Regulation of Sugarcane Price (Supplied to Factories) Act, 2013, enacted on the recommendation of the C. Rangarajan committee, may provide an effective instrument for the administration to limit H&T cost per ton of sugar cane and dwindling sugar recovery rate of the private sector in the State.Rajagopal Devara is serving Secretary, Government of Maharashtra, and former Sugar Commissioner, Maharashtra. Views expressed are personal.The bigwigs of sugar cooperatives floated private units, in a way sowing the seeds of doubt on the efficacy of the cooperative model"

In fact, the special `economic boycott department' was set up and headed by Pushpaben Mehta.Boycott committees were set up in Calcutta, Mumbai, Madras, Cochin, Malabar and other cities of the country ,"" writes Jani. The committees shot off letters to various institutions which obliged by stopping supply of crucial commodities like petrol, kerosene, garments, sugar and grains to Junagadh. The Indian government stopped supplying coal from October 1, 1947.""The strategy paid off. The railway's daily income plummeted from Rs 30,000 to Rs 5,000 per day and residents, majority of whom were in favour of joining India, stopped paying taxes,"" said Jani in his two-volume book. Of the total 222 princely states in Saurashtra, Junagadh was the biggest with an annual income to the exchequer to the tune of Rs 86 lakh-Rs 90 lakh. Finally , left with no options, Junagadh declared its accession to the Indian Union on November 9, 1947. When Junagadh's economy got weakened due to boycotts, the Nawab turned to Pakistan for help. However, Pakistan demanded money for supply of essentials, which he couldn't afford, said Jani."

Four cities in the state, including Nashik , have reported higher than the permissible levels of particulate matter in the air.On Monday, Mumbai reported the highest PM10 (diameter less than 10 micron) level in the state at 166 micro gram per cubic metre. Nashik and Pune followed closely with 147 and 148 PM10 levels, respectively. Chandrapur, which is known for its coal mines, reported PM10 level of 133.""The result of daily sampling for 24 hours should be less than 100 microgram per meter cube for PM10 parameter and annual average should be 60. The PM10 levels of 147 recorded in Nashik means that the air pollution has increased,"" said an MPCB (Maharashtra Pollution Control Board) official from the head office in Mumbai.With the rise in air pollution, Nashik may no longer be counted among the cities with salubrious climate unless immediate steps are taken. MPCB regional office, which has been insisting that the air pollution is under control, has now assured of initiating the necessary action.MPCB regional officer R U Patil said, ""It is due to the drop in temperature that dust does not go up. PM levels are found higher than usual during this period. The levels also go up due to regular pollution. We will issue notices to the civic administration.""In the meantime, farmers setting sugar cane stubble on fire after the harvest in November has added to the air pollution in Kolhapur. The MPCB records show that Kolhapur reported respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) at 75 to 80 micro gram per cubic metre, while suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels are 195 to 250 micro gram per cubic metre in August.According to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the concentration of SPM in air should not exceed 150 micro gram per cubic metre and that of RSPM should not exceed 80 micro gram a cubic metre. Over the past two years, the SPM levels in the months of December, January and February have been well over 400 micro gram a cubic metre, nearly three times the permissible limits. The RSPM levels have been over 110 during these months.Environmentalist Uday Gaikwad said, ""Farmers burn the sugar cane stubble to prepare the farm for the next season. Smog gets easily developed during this period though the particles emitting from the fires do not remain in the air for a long time. Also, the dry grass burnt in the nearby villages adds to the smog."" Activists and officials claim the campaign, Pachat Abhiyan, launched in November 2011 had yielded positive results. The campaign reached out to farmers to prevent burning of after-harvest sugarcane stubble to avoid air pollution and make farmers aware of benefits of using the trash as organic manure in the fields."

Five hundred farmers and representatives of five sugar mills, including three from Maharashtra, participated in the meeting. While the sugar mills from the State offered a maximum of Rs. 2,000 a tonne, those from Maharashtra offered up to Rs. 2,500. But, the farmers were persistent on Rs. 2,700, he said.Reasonable demandMr. Kulkarni reasoned that Rs. 2,700 a tonne was very reasonable, considering the amount of sugar produced from a tonne of sugarcane and the better sugar price in the market. By crushing a tonne of sugarcane, 110 kg of sugar, worth Rs. 4,180, can be produced. The mills can earn money by selling the by-products as well. Our demand of Rs. 2,700 is reasonable, he said.Mr. Kulkarni demanded that the Deputy Commissioner intervene in the issue by calling a meeting of cane growers and sugar mill owners.He also said sugarcane growers were reluctant to sell their produce to mills in Maharashtra, considering the payment and transportation issues. Maharashtrabased mills are trying to lure sugarcane growers in Kalaburagi by offering a little more than the mills in Karnataka. They are also giving written undertakings to buy the crop for the next three years at the market rate. But our farmers are reluctant as they may have to suffer in the event of crop loss during transportation and delay in payment, he said.Terming the Gulbarga Electricity Supply Companys arrangement of supplying power to rural areas for four hours during the day and three during the night as an inconvenience, Mr. Kulkarni demanded for continuous three-phase power supply for seven hours.

Picture by Rajesh Shrivastava Nov. 12: Villagers allegedly looted a ration shop in Madhya Pradesh after its owner refused to accept 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, as people's patience seemed to wear thin at many places in the country after four days of the cash crisis spawned by demonetisation. Munnilal Ahirwar says he watched helplessly last evening as over 100 villagers, many of them women, looted bags of wheat, rice and sugar from his store at Bardua in Chhattarpur district. Ahirwar was allegedly roughed up each time he raised his voice or tried to physically stop the looters. ""I recognised most of the faces, but will the police act?"" he asked today. Police from the nearest outpost, 6km away, arrived this morning and registered a case of looting against unknown people. Long queues were seen at bank branches for the third consecutive day throughout Madhya Pradesh, while most ATMs remained non-functional for the fourth day, adding to the popular frustration. For the past three days, most rural areas have received no cash from big cities like Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which are battling their own cash problems. A video clip went viral on the social media, purportedly showing the police thrashing people who had lost their cool after waiting hours outside a bank in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh today. The cops are seen beating the people with canes and belts outside the State Bank of India branch in Porsa. The customers had tried to barge into the branch around 3pm, apparently angered by a policeman on duty allowing some people in through the backdoor, an eyewitness said. ""No one has approached us with a complaint yet, but I'm going to look into the incident and if the policemen are found guilty, they will be punished,"" superintendent of police Vineet Khanna said. In Chhattarpur's Motwan mohalla, Mathura Prasad Ahirwar was able to perform the last rites of his wife Raj Bai only after neighbours pooled the necessary money. His granddaughter Anuradha said the cost of the necessary materials such as milk, yoghurt, honey, ghee, wood and sandalwood came to more than Rs 2,200 but the shopkeeper refused to accept the demonetised notes. Eventually, the funeral was performed after sunset, which is not the preferred time according to local custom. In Sagar district, retired BSNL official Vinod Kumar Pande, 69, suddenly collapsed and died after standing in queue for an hour at a Union Bank branch. He was carrying Rs 4,000 in large currency in his pocket that he had wanted to exchange. Customers ran wild when a bank at Sujdu Chungi in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, delayed the exchange of the demonetised currency yesterday saying it lacked 100 and 50-rupee notes. Some people damaged the cash counter and stoned the police when they arrived. The mob also damaged a government bus and two private cars on the street outside. Later, the police carried out a baton-charge that left Khatiza Begum, 30, and Ayesha, a two-year-old girl, injured. Some people claimed the police had also fired in the air outside the bank. During the vandalism, a few customers chanted "" Mera desh bigad raha hai (My country is deteriorating)"" - a take-off of the slogan ""Mera desh badal raha hai (My country is changing)"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted after completing two years in office in May. Eyewitnesses said the problem began at 11am when an iron net attached to the teller's window, which some customers had grabbed as they jostled to get closer to the counter, came off under their collective weight. Someone then smashed the glass pane at the counter, prompting nervous bank officials to call the police. ""The bus driver and the bank manager have lodgedcases against unidentified people,"" circle police officer Tejveer Singh said. ""We are trying to identify and arrest them."" He said the bank received cash after an hour. Some 200 angry customers waiting outside a State Bank of Travancore branch in Kerala's Kollam district allegedly broke a glass door today after the bank decided to down shutters because of the heavy rush. The police are questioning several people. Long queues formed outside bank branches across Kerala for the third day, amid complaints that the ATMs were running out of cash. An elderly man had collapsed and died while queuing to deposit cash yesterday at Haripad in Alappuzha district, while another man fell to his death from a building housing a bank branch in Kannur. People clashed with bank officials at several places in Gujarat, prompting police baton-charges and detention. Customers complained that several ATMs were closed and that banks were exchanging the demonetised notes with coins and very small-denomination currencies. ""Even hospitals are refusing to accept the larger notes,"" Ramesh Agarwal said. ""Bank officials said they had run out of the new 2,000-rupee notes and only had coins,"" said Bipin Patel. ""They have given me coins for Rs 4,000, which is very difficult to carry."" Rajesh Shah, a senior citizen, said: ""We stood in queues for two days.... We have Rs 3 lakh in our bank account but can't buy essentials. Modi should have made proper arrangements for cash."" The police caned customers who had clashed with bank officials when they refused to dispense money at a branch at Shihori in Banaskantha district. A similar incident was reported from Abdasa in Kutch. A senior assistant of the Kolhapur zilla parishad in Maharashtra was arrested on the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs 35,000 that contained 17 newly introduced Rs 2,000 currency notes, officials said. Chandrakant Sawardekar, 45, had allegedly promised to help the complainant secure a promotion as a principal in a zilla parishad-run school."

The fraud was initially estimated at around Rs 22 crore, but the police believe it may go up to Rs 50 crore.Principally, sugar was exported in 2007-08 at rates lower than market prices, but the transport company was paid at rates higher than that prevalent at the time. Around 200 accused have been listed, including the chairmen, managing directors and directors of the 21 factories in Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Pune.An advocate, Govind Patil, had filed the case with the police. ""The modus operandi was that over two lakh tonnes of sugar were sold to Kenya, Tanzania and Sri Lanka at a much lower price than the market rate in India. Moreover, the transportation fees given to M/s Shakti Credit Limited were much higher than market rates. During our initial probe, we found that it was the transporter's firm that had brought the proposal of export and the remaining work was done with its help,"" said a police officer.A Kolhapur resident, Vasant Apte, had filed a petition in the Bombay high court in 2008 seeking a probe. The HC directed the Sugar Committee to inquire. During its second inquiry, sugar commissioner Raj Gopal Deora found a loss of crores and the court ordered Mumbai police to probe. ""After a preliminary inquiry, we registered a cheating case in August 2016 against the chairman, managing directors, directors and office bearers of M/s Shakti Credit. We have written to all the sugar factories to furnish records of all exports during 2007-08 and are waiting for their reply. We have also made an office bearer of the Maharashtra Sugar Federation an accused,"" added the officer.The sleuths said they are trying to track how Shakti Credit got the tenders for the exports, mainly through JNPT, Kandla and Port Bundar ports. The role of some officers of the Indian Sugar Export-Import Pvt Ltd is under probe."

Having such great scope for production of sugarcane and sugar in the district, farmers are feeling insecure to grow sugarcane in their field as there is no support price and there is a big political lobby to keep cane prices low. As a result area of sugarcane cultivation has decreased by 30% this year. Sugarcane is being cultivated on 1.8 lakh hectares this year whereas it was about 2.2 lakh hectares last year.Sugarcane is a major crop in the neighbouring Maharashtra too. Authorities there conducted a meeting of factory owners and farmer leaders and came out with the support price which is FRP+175 per tonne. This means the price will be around Rs 2,700 to 3,000 depending on the recovery of cane in Maharashtra. Farmers there have agreed to this and harvesting has begun. But here in Belagavi, even three weeks after the crushing season began, the government has made no moves to declare support price.Opposing the apathy of the government, sugarcane growers have decided to stage a massive protest during the winter session of the assembly to be held at the Suvarna Vidhan Soudha (SVS) in Belagavi. Farmer leader Basangouda Sidramani said that the area of sugarcane has reduced due to no support price and non-payment of dues by factories. If the government does not declare support price before the session, we will stage a massive protest, he said.Dr R B Khangave, director, S Nijlingappa Sugar Institute, said that a meeting of the Sugarcane Control Board will be held in Bengaluru on Tuesday where the issue of fixing support price for sugarcane will be discussed."

Similarly, in Maharashtra, the BJP and the Shiv Sena are in an alliance, which will be continued in the local body polls. Such meetings are not going to thwart the investigations we have launched into corruption during the Congress-NCP regime, the party member said.Senior BJP leader Madhav Bhandari said it was the NCP chief who often approached the PM.Frankly, I would describe this as one-way traffic. It is Pawar who always approaches the PM to get him on board for his functions and share the dais with him. There is nothing wrong with this officially. But dont read any politics into it, Bhandari said.Another leader described the NCPs flip-flops about its attitude to Modi as amusing.Are we not aware of Pawar play? In October, he personally met the PM in Delhi to invite him for the November function. But the impression given outside was that he had come to discuss and resolve the ongoing Maratha agitation across Maharashtra. Before that, on June 10, during the NCPs anniversary, Pawar had observed that the PMs popularity was on wane, the leader said.However, a former NCP cabinet minister close to Pawar said that Modi and the NCP chief had always shared a good rapport.Let us not forget that Modi and Pawar always shared a personal rapport. Pawar admired Modis development agenda when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. Similarly, Modi has always publicly acknowledged Pawars knowledge in field of agriculture and his commitment to farmers.The leader said that a meeting between Pawar and the PM does send across a political message. Ahead of the winter session of the Parliament, the ruling party would definitely like to have on board Pawar, who networks with smaller regional forces to form a pressure group. At a time when the Congress and parties like the Trinamool are trying to adopt an aggressive posture on demonetisation, Pawars support to the PM would definitely be welcome, he said.However, NCP senior spokesperson Nawab Malik dismissed any question of a tie-up ahead.Modi is the prime minister of the country and not any party alone. So, the meeting should be seen in the context of democratic norms, where ruling and opposition leaders can share the dais. It is not for politics. The NCP has always considered the BJP as its political rival. So, where is the question of any alliance ahead?, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The transplant in Pune could be the seventh or the eighth one in the country, doctors said.The donor, a 16-year-old boy who met with a road accident on November 4 and was declared brain dead the next day, gave his liver, kidneys and pancreas that helped save the lives of four persons. The liver has been successfully transplanted into a 60-year-old man suffering from end-stage liver disease for the last four years.During the pancreas-kidney transplant , doctors did not have to remove any diseased organs from the recipient's body. They placed the new kidney on the lower left side of the abdomen and connected it to nearby blood vessels and the intestines. The ureter was attached to the bladder. On the lower right side of abdomen, the pancreas was connected to blood vessels and the intestines so that secreted insulin is passed in the intestines for metabolism.""The recipient has two pancreas and three kidneys in his body. It is an established and evidence-based practice where doctors do not remove the diseased organs (like damaged pancreas and a kidney in the man's case) and instead create a new place in the body for the donated healthy organs and have a new connection for them to function normally,"" multi-organ transplant surgeon Vrishali Patil said.She added that the patient was recovering and his diabetes has been reversed and would be discharged in a day or two.Patil carried out the transplant at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital on November 6. ""Post surgery, the man's condition is completely stable. All his deteriorating parameters are within healthy ranges. His blood sugar level is absolutely normal but he has been allowed to eat sweets only in moderation,"" she added.""I am gorging on sweets now and feel relived. The surgery has restored my confidence and given me a new lease of life,"" the man diagnosed with type I diabetes when he was just 10 years old said.His condition had deteriorated in the last five years. ""The man's kidneys had started failing after years of diabetes. He was on periodic dialysis treatment. The unstable and uncontrolled diabetes could either drastically drop or spike dangerously at the slightest variation of insulin doses. He has been lately diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy. Besides, functioning of his heart had also taken a beating. He was losing his nerve sensation. The transplant has simply given him a new lease of life,"" Patil added.Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital got the licence for the pancreas transplant five months ago. ""We have been waiting for a fitting donor since then. Our first attempt failed three months ago when a brain dead patient's family consented to donate his pancreas along with other vital organs. But upon examination, our doctors found that his pancreas was unfit for transplant as its vital function of insulin secretion had failed. Currently, we have five more patients enrolled for pancreas transplant. Our is the only certified pancreas transplant unit in Maharashtra,"" cancer surgeon Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of DMH, said.Besides Patil, the pancreas transplant team at DMH comprises certified multi-organ transplant surgeon Ninad Deshmukh, transplant physicians Sachin Palnitkar and Vishnu Biradar, transplant nephrologists Atul Mulay and Tushar Dighe and transplant intensivist Prasad Akole."

Almost 65% of the district's sugar is transported to Marathwada, Pune, Mumbai, Rajashthan and Gujarat through roads.Subhash Jadhav, president of Kolhapur District Lorry Association, said, ""The lorry owners in the district engage in the transportation of sugar, vehicles, equipment and textiles. But the demonetisation of old high-value currency notes has affected our business. We are not able to get new orders. The government has waived off toll in this situation, which is kind of an oasis in the desert. Our vehicles are off the road since last week.

A Lok Mangal staffer in the car said the cash belonged to the Lok Mangal bank. Deshmukh said it was meant for payment to workers in a sugar factory affiliated to the Lok Mangal group.The vehicle has been impounded in Umarga tehsil in Osmanabad district, while the cash has been deposited in the local treasury.""We have sought clarification from the group. In addition, we have informed the income tax department and the local police. If the group justifies the cash, it will be returned. Else, legal action will be taken as per the provisions of law,'' Narnaware said.Subhash Deshmukh did not respond to a TOI sms. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress were quick to demand immediate dismissal of the controversial minister for black money transactions. In the past, Lok Mangal was under the scanner of Sebi for irregularities in mobilising funds for the group.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, ""We feel that maximum black money is stocked in the houses of BJP leaders. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis should sack Deshmukh immediately and the income tax department must search the official and residential premises of leading BJP politicians.""Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant echoed the NCP's demand and said the IT department should probe into the transactions of all BJP leaders during the last six months.

Many have been forced to stop work.These labourers, who work in farms mostly in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, are usually paid in cash. Now, with the dearth of notes, their payments have been delayed.The demonetisation impact is pinching further in parts of the rural economy around the cane-cutting season because district cooperative banks have been banned from exchanging and depositing high-value notes.The sugarcane crushing season started from November 5 and is expected to go on for five months. On an average, a labourer makes between Rs 350 and Rs 500 a day and is paid every 15 days by the sugar factory to which the cane is made available. ""Generally, the sugar factory pays the mukadam (supervisor), who in turn distributes it to the labourers, usually in cash. The first installment of payment still hasn't been given in many areas,"" said Ghanininath Thore, chairman of the union of these labourers.Since most of the labourers are debt-ridden, the delay in payment would almost amount to a crisis, he added. They are already facing pressure because this year, the area under sugarcane has significantly reduced due to the few years of drought.Experts say that if the situation remains unchanged, it will have a largescale impact on the sugar industry. Since it is just the beginning of the season, factory managements have been able to convince the labourers to stay on the farms and helped them get food and daily essentials on credit.""Payment to these daily-wage labourers has been a major issue. Since it is only the beginning and most of them have taken some advance before beginning work, the situation is under control. But if in a few days there is no solution, it could lead to work stopping in many farms, impacting sugar production,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. Since the co-operative banks haven't been allowed to do any transaction, farmers too aren't being paid, he added.Maharashtra is one of the largest sugar-producing states. Over 7 lakh rural poor migrate to Beed, Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts every year to cut sugarcane. Some of them have their own farms, but do the work for additional income.When TOI spoke to a few labourers, they said their daily needs like food were being affected for lack of adequate cash. Also the loans they have from their own farms too would be affected.Sadanand Shinde and his wife have travelled 450 km from their village in Jalgaon to work in a farm in Baramati. ""We haven't been paid since we started work earlier this month. The advance that we had taken from the mukadam was given to us in Rs 500 notes that we cannot exchange as the nearest bank is about 5km from the farm and queueing up would mean loss of pay for those hours,"" said Shinde."

For, horse-trading is rampant in this election in which elected members of local-self-government are voters. Bhandara-Gondia and Yavatmal are the two seats in Vidarbha.The candidates were busy on Friday wooing voters using all means. Talk of horse-trading and currency muddle was rife. Politicians joked of voters returning the old currency handed over before November 8 and demanding new notes or gold coins to seal the deals. Naturally, each party blamed the other for indulging in such nefarious tactics.In Bhandara-Gondia, it's a triangular, tough fight but in Yavatmal the battle is virtually straight between the Congress and the Shiv Sena.NCP stalwart Praful Patel's prestige is at stake as his close confidant and sitting MLC Rajendra Jain is re-contesting on NCP ticket from the Bhandara-Gondia seat. BJP candidate Parinay Fuke is seen as 'CM's choice,' making it a proxy battle between CM Devendra Fadnavis and Patel. Complicating the fight is Congress candidate, Praful Agarwal, who is in the fray as Patel refused to yield seat to the Congress thus aborting the NCP-Congress seat sharing pact.With all three candidates likely to draw equal votes, the parties are now trying to garner second preference votes to get past the winning mark.""I don't think Jain will have problem retaining the seat. The NCP has enough votes to get elected,"" Patel told TOI on phone from Delhi where he is busy with Parliament session and has no plans to be on home turf of Gondia on election day. The 393 voters of the constituency include members of zilla parishad, municipal councils, nagar panchayats and sabhapatis of panchayat samitis of Bhandara and Gondia districts. The party wise strength is BJP-119, Congress-102, NCP-123, Shiv Sena-25, Independents-25 and CPI-1 giving a clear edge to Fuke.For the BJP, local MP Nana Patole is leading the campaign and is confident that Fuke will win comfortably as the Sena-BJP with 'friendly' independents make up the largest chunk of over 150 votes. Fuke is hopeful that he will get through on strength of the second preference votes. Though an outsider, Fuke is using his proximity with power in the state to his advantage to influence voters.The Congress is in no mood to give up. It has deployed master-strategist Satish Chaturvedi at the last minute as observer. Praful is son of local Congress veteran Gopal Agarwal who has won the seat twice in the past. Chaturvedi, along with Nitin Raut (who is in-charge of the campaign), MLA Sunil Kedar, Anant Gharad will be camping in the constituency on Friday. ""Though we are short of numbers on our own, we have garnered enough support and the result will be a big surprise,"" said Chaturvedi.Meanwhile, in Yavatmal seat NCP sitting MLC Sandeep Bajoriya's withdrawal from the fray has made it a straight fight between Congress' Shankar Bade and Shiv-Sena's imported' candidate Tanaji Sawant. A sugar baron who also runs 78 educational institutions in western Maharashtra, Sawant is said to be close to Sena chief Uddhav Thaceray who wants him to win at any 'cost.'Congress stalwart Shivajirao Moghe spearheading Bade's is confident that Sawant's money-power would not work.

Sugar factories and paddy farm owners have not been able to pay the workers due to cash crunch after demonetization.The 13 sugar factories in south Gujarat have started cutting and crushing job. They are expected to harvest 70,000 tonne of sugarcane in this season spending nearly Rs 500 per tonne. Labourers from Dang and Narmada districts in Gujarat and some belonging to Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are paid Rs 250 per tonne on a weekly basis. Sugarcane harvesting has just started whereas paddy harvesting is 60 per cent over in south Gujarat whose sugar economy is estimated at Rs 2,500 crore, cotton market at Rs1,000 crore and milk business at Rs 2,000 crore.""The cap on withdrawal of money from bank, which is just Rs 10,000, makes it impossible for us to make payment to all labourers. We have made arrangement for the labourers to get grocery items on credit from our credit societies. But, still we need some cash to give them,"" Bardoli Sugar chairman Bhavesh Patel said. This sugar factory alone has 7,000 labourers of the estimated 70,000 workforce engaged in sugarcane harvesting. The number of labourers working in paddy fields is around 30,000. Nearly 10 per cent of these workforce has left for their homes after demonetization.Gujarat Khedut Samaj president Jayesh Patel said, ""We fear that another 20 per cent of workers may return home as there is no point in staying here without money. We plan to take out a rally on Saturday to demand that the government pay us cash and allow farmers to open accounts in district banks. If this situation continues any further, the operation of sugar factories will come to a standstill."""

There might have been some irregularity, but it was certainly not wrongdoing, Deshmukh told a news channel while trying to clarify his position on the `91.5 lakh cash found in a vehicle belonging to the business group owned by him. I am ready to accept any action for the irregularity, he added.Subhash DeshmukhThe Election Commission had earlier in the day served notice to the ministers business group Lokmangal asking it to clarify about the huge cash within 24 hours.I have never used my political background for my business. In fact Ive been a successful businessman even before I joined politics some 15 years ago. Transactions of such large amount are not new to my business. My family has been running the business very honestly. We pay all taxes, the minister said while clarifying allegations that the money was being transported for use in the municipal council polls.The minister had earlier said the money was being moved to his sugar factory to pay the cane workers. The money was withdrawn from the Solapur headquarters of Lokmangal bank on November 5. But, it was not deposited back after the demonetisation move, he said.However, NCP leader and leader of opposition in legislative council Dhananjay Munde raised several questions over the incident and demanded Deshmukhs resignation."

(EXPRESS PHOTO BY PRAVEEN KHANNA) In Maharashtra, the cooperative sugar mills and the DCC banks have been powerful centres of power and often interlinked. In order to yield political power, parties vied to control both the DCC banks as well as the sugar mills. (EXPRESS PHOTO BY PRAVEEN KHANNA)Early adoption of bank transfers to pay farmers and a strong banking network may help the Rs 35,000-crore sugar industry in Maharashtra to insulate itself, to an extent, from the side effects of demonetisation. Sugar mills had as early as the 1970s adopted the system to pay farmers, harvesters and their own labourers via bank transfer.Watch What Else is Making NewsSanjiv Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said the system of bank payment had started with Pravara Cooperative Sugar mill in Ahmednagar. The sugar industry in Maharashtra is almost a century old and had seen massive growth post independence, he said.Along with the sugar mills, the network of District Central Cooperative (DCC) banks had also grown. DCC banks, which were financiers to the sugar mills, also acted as bankers to the farmers and thus, payment was linked easily to the bank accounts.Every farmer had both a loan and a savings account in the local branch of the DCC bank from where they availed crop loans. Post payment of the cane price by the mills in the main branch of the DCC banks, the local branches used to remit the same to the individual farmers accounts after deducting the loan amount from it, he said.Before the advent of electronic money transfer and internet banking, the operations were done with the help of registry, duly maintained and tallied at the DCC banks.The same system now continues albeit electronically and the farmer withdraws money from his savings account. Mills also paid the cane harvesters and their own labourers through the banking system. Rough estimates say that there are 5 lakh cane farmers, 2.5 lakh harvesters and 1.5 lakh sugar mill workers in Maharashtra and payment to all of them happens through the banking channel. Mills in Maharashtra had paid more than Rs 18,000 crore as cane payment to farmers for the season 2015-16.In Maharashtra, the cooperative sugar mills and the DCC banks have been powerful centres of power and often interlinked. In order to yield political power, especially in the rural areas, parties vied to control both the DCC banks as well as the sugar mills. Control over DCC banks would have allowed easy access to working capital for the sugar mill and its control would ensure control over the purse string of farmers, which in turn ensured political survival.Traditionally, the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have controlled both the DCC banks and the sugar mills. Entry of private players had seen the continuity of the model with nationalised banks and urban cooperative banks entering the fray in providing working capital to the banks. Also, in districts where DCC banks are weak or non-functional, even cooperative mills have similar arrangements with nationalised or urban cooperative banks. It is estimated that half of the mills have working accounts with the DCC banks as of now.BB Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Millers Association (WISMA)  the body of private millers  said the bank linkages had ensured transparency in the sector.This year also, the millers will be able to credit the farmers accounts but the problem can arise when the farmer goes to withdraw cash, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In addition, report of the income tax department and police is still awaited. Under such circumstances, it will be wrong to say a clean chit has been given,"" Narnaware told TOI.The special flying squad set up by the state election commission in view of the civic elections had on November 16 seized Rs 91.5 lakh from a car belonging to the Lok Mangal group controlled by Deshmukh. Then Narnaware had entrusted the probe to the deputy registrar of cooperative societies. Simultaneously, information was submitted to the income tax department and the district police administration.Deshmukh had contended that it was not black money and that the cash belonged to the Lok Mangal bank and was being transported from one branch to another. Further, Deshmukh had stated that the cash was meant for payment to sugarcane growers and labourers working in the Lok Mangal sugar factory.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik insisted on dismissal of Deshmukh from the cabinet, saying it was indeed unaccounted money. ""Our information is that it was black money. Deshmukh's explanation was misleading and false,"" Malik said.Malik said the probe into the incident should be conducted by an independent agency, since at the moment, the investigation is being carried out by a deputy registrar, who is directly reporting to Deshmukh. ""For an impartial probe, the investigations should be entrusted to the enforcement directorate and pending inquiry, Deshmukh should be sacked from the cabinet,"" Malik said."

Even Supreme Court and Calcutta High Court made observations about the decision and the hardship faced by people. We condemn Fadnavis remarks, Sawant said.Campaigning for BJP ahead of the municipal council polls, Fadnavis had said those opposing the PM on demonetisation were harming the country.In this battle for economic freedom, those with Modi are soldiers and the ones against the PM will be against the country, he had said.Sawant also criticised the chief minister for announcing, at a rally at Pen in Raigad district, that state planning body CIDCO will purchase the land belonging to the defunct Pen Urban Bank to give relief to its depositors.State Election Commission should take cognisance on its own of these statements (for breach of code of conduct).

However, collectively the party does not appear to have learnt any lessons to stand united.Maharashtra is a textbook example of the working of the Congress system at the state level. The party has occupied the ruling space in Maharashtra for most of the past 60 plus years. Between 2004 and 2014 it had to share the space with Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Though both the parties maintained a good working relationship in running the government for 10 year, their rule was riddled with corruption.The party that won over 200 seats (out of 288) in the assembly several times in past has been struggling to get to three digits since 1990. The NCPs entry in the political arena in 1999 shrank them further. In 2009 most of the Congress leaders wanted to sever ties with the NCP before the Assembly elections hoping to win more than 100 seats. However, that did not happen and the Congress won 82 seats. In 2014, the tally slid further to 42, the partys worst performance in the state.The Congress has been completely uprooted from Vidarbha, North Maharashtra and Marathwada. In Konkan, Narayan Rane  who was a chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1998  is the face-saver for the Congress, while it faces a tough challenge from its ally, the NCP, in western Maharashtra, its erstwhile bastion. The party apparatus had withered and workers were left demoralized after the devastating defeat in 2014. The first sign of the partys revival came early this year when it won the maximum number of seats in rural local body elections. However, at the same time the party couldnt do much in the corporation polls in Navi Mumbai and Aurangabad, underlining the fact that its hopes lie in the rural area, its traditional base.The Congress partys state president Ashok Chavans efforts to revive the party have obvious limitations due to the Adarsh housing scam case. Ranes entry into the state legislature during the monsoon session earlier this year created a stir. But in the past few days, his name too is being taken in a case that the Enforcement Directorate is said to be investigating. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan is another leader who has the vision to revive the party in the state. But he lacks a mass following and has little support amongst state leaders. The party survives in pockets where leaders have a good connect with the people. But they lack statewide appeal.The BJP government in the state had been systematically targeting the cooperative sector  the APMCs, the credit societies, sugar mills and cooperative banks. Its success in this endeavour would be the biggest threat to the Congress."
58e52d727be9e05a951f51ac,Trump meet with India partners raises dust,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161121/jsp/foreign/story_120384.jsp,2016-11-21,"Nov. 20: President-elect Donald J. Trump met in the last week in his office at Trump Tower with three Indian business partners who are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex south of Mumbai, raising new questions about how he will separate his business dealings from the work of the government once he is in the White House. A spokeswoman for Trump described the meeting as a courtesy call by the three Indian real estate executives, who flew from India to congratulate Trump on his election victory. In a picture posted on Twitter, all four men are smiling and giving a thumbs-up. ""It was not a formal meeting of any kind,"" Breanna Butler, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said when asked about the meeting on Saturday. One of the businessmen, Sagar Chordia, posted photographs on Facebook on Wednesday showing that he also met with Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. Trump's children are helping to run his businesses as they play a part in the presidential transition. Butler and Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, declined to comment when asked on Saturday if the meeting with the Trump family members included any discussion of Trump businesses in India or expanding that business. The three Indian executives - Sagar Chordia, Atul Chordia, and Kalpesh Mehta - have been quoted in Indian newspapers as saying they have discussed expanding their partnership with the Trump Organization now that Trump is president-elect. Sagar Chordia did not respond to a request for a telephone interview. But in a series of text messages with The New York Times early Sunday, he confirmed that the meeting with Trump and members of his family had taken place, and that an article written about it in an Indian newspaper, which reported that one of his partners said they had discussed the desire to expand the deals with the Trump family, was accurate. Washington ethics lawyers said that a meeting with Indian real estate partners, regardless of what was discussed, raised conflict of interest questions for Trump, who could be perceived as using the presidency to advance his business interests. ""There may be people for whom this looks OK,"" said Robert L. Walker, the former chief counsel of the Senate Ethics Committee, who advises corporations and members of Congress on government ethics issues. ""But for a large part of the American public, it is not going to be OK. His role as president-elect should dictate that someone else handles business matters."" Internationally, many properties that bear Trump's name are the result of marketing deals - like the one in India - in which he is paid by someone for the use of his name but does not actually own the underlying property. Atul Chordia and Sagar Chordia are well-known figures in real estate in Pune. Their father, Ishwardas Chordia, was born into a family of sugar traders, but as a young man forged a close friendship with NCP leader Sharad Pawar. Beginning in the 1990s, Chordia businesses built luxury hotels, corporate parks and residential projects in upscale neighbourhoods in Pune. The third executive at the meeting, Mehta, is the managing partner of a real-estate firm named Tribeca, which is also a part of the Trump projects in India, which go by names including Trump Towers Pune and Trump Towers Mumbai. Tribeca is also planning a project in Calcutta. Dave Besseling, a former deputy editor at GQ India, hosted an event at Sagar Chordia's hotel during the 2016 presidential campaign and said Chordia expressed ""elation"" about Trump's candidacy and the opportunities it would bring. The same week, Trump's daughter Ivanka - an executive at the Trump Organization hotel chain - attended a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The move drew criticism from former State Department officials, given that Ms. Trump does not have security clearance and is helping run the family business enterprises. Butler, the spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the family was moving to try to formally separate Trump from his family's business ventures. ""Mr. Trump is not going to have dealings in the day-to-day business of that organisation,"" she said. Another spokeswoman for the Trump Organization added in a written statement that ""the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations."" Asked if such a separation had already taken place in the aftermath of the election, she said she did not know."

He said the government was anti-farmer and he hadnt seen such a government in the past. Protesting the arrest of the farmers, the BJP members rushed into the well of the House and demanded immediate release of all the arrested farmers.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said farmers were arrested to ensure that they do not block the national highway and, the police have been directed to release them. Instructions were issued to the police around 9.30 am to release the farmers.Documents in MarathiMaharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES)-backed MLAs Aravind Patil and Sambhaji Patil demanded that the government provide official documents in Marathi. However, after members cutting across party lines opposed them, the two MLAs who were sporting saffron-turbans walked out of the House.After the Question Hour, the two MLAs stood up and demanded that the documents be presented in Marathi instead of Kannada. Aravind Patil who was making the demand was opposed by other members. Speaker K B Koliwad asked to members take their seats as he had not permitted them to speak.Members from the treasury and Opposition benches opposed the demand and asked the two MLAs to speak in Kannada as they know the language very well. With their demand not met, Aravind Patil and Sambhaji Patil staged a walkout.Revenue Minister Kagodu Thimmappa told the Assembly that the process has begun to simplify the administration of Revenue department and make its offices across the state paperless.Replying to Balakrishna C N during the Question Hour, Thimmappa said that as the process was on to make offices paperless, incorporating corrections in record of rights of properties has become difficult and the same would be done later.Earlier, Koliwad moved obituary references to condole the death of former legislators G Basavanneppa and S K Dasappa, senior journalist Girish Nikam and the victims of the Sundays Indore-Patna Express train accident in Uttar Pradesh."

However, the revenue generated between November 1-18 this year was Rs 533 crore, as against Rs 494 crore in the same period last year, which could partially be attributed to an increase in the sales of country liquor.The sale of country liquor in rural areas has seen a 5-8% increase. While IMFL is mainly consumed in urban areas, demonetisation has also hit rural areas but liquor there is easily available on credit.The increase in sales of country liquor is on account of several reasons. The state government's new toddy policy came into force last month, under which no licence will be issued if the toddy seller can't show the tree which is the source of toddy. In Mumbai, all the 230 toddy shops have been shut down as there is not a single such tree in the city. Toddy is a perishable item and has a shelf life of six to seven hours, so it has to be manufactured locally. In most places, a chemical was used to make a concoction which was sold as toddy. ""We wanted to stop such illicit sale and our new policy has shut 600 of the 1,200 toddy shops. We also declared a total bandh on toddy shops for a month. Those consuming toddy have moved to country liquor as it costs nearly the same,"" said V Radha , state excise commissioner.Some of those unable to afford IMFL have also moved to country liquor. Further, better policing in rural areas has meant illicit breweries are unable to operate. Radha, who took over in September this year, put in place a control room at the state excise headquarters where citizens can complain about illicit breweries, distilleries and other violations. Excise flying squads too are being monitored through GPS to ensure they act on complaints. Complaining to the control room ensures anonymity to complainants.All this has meant those consuming illicit liquor have also turned to country liquor. In the last three months, the state's excise revenue has increased. In Thane, where the revenue was -12%, it has now jumped to +12%. A similar increase has been seen for other districts.Tracking of vehicles leaving distilleries with rectified spirit and sugar factories with molasses has also ensured there are no diversions for illegal manufacture. The department has also increased monitoring at permit bars to ensure they do not sell non-excise liquor. Between April to November 18, the revenue has been Rs 7,022 crore as against Rs 6,799 crore during the corresponding period last year."

In the results declared on Tuesday, Parinay Fuke, a two-term corporator from Nagpur won the Bhandara-Gondia seat while Tanaji Sawant, another 'outsider' fielded by the Shiv Sena, won the Yavatmal seat.Fuke, who has a Congress background, joined the BJP barely four months ago. But he had latched on to Devendra Fadnavis right from the day he was sworn in chief minister. This proximity as the 'CM's man' earned him a chance to contest his first legislative election and emerge successful. He defeated two-term MLC Rajendra Jain of the NCP. Jain is a close associate of NCP stalwart Praful Patel, for whom the party's defeat on his home turf is seen as a huge political jolt. Money power and influence pedelling are known to play crucial role in these elections.With Fuke, a Nagpur resident, now billed to be MLC, the city's power quotient has gone up a notch further. The number of legislators residing in the city has now gone up to 13. (See box). The city is already power high with the chief minister and a powerful Union minister representing Nagpur. Praful Agrawal, son of Congress MLA Gopaldas Agrawal of Gondia, was also in the race but lost his maiden election. In fact, Fuke's win was largely on the basis of a tacit understanding with the Congress. Most of the second preference votes of the Congress went to Fuke, ensuring a BJP win.A sitting corporator of NMC in his second term, Fuke is the 20th corporator ever, and fourth sitting corporator from the city to be elected legislator. In the first preference counting, Fuke took a lead by securing 153 of the 387 votes while Jain got only 117. In the second preference votes, Fuke got 67, taking his tally to 220 while Jain managed only 20 for a total of 137. Agarwal of the Congress had to be content with the number three position with 112 votes. Five votes were invalid.In the last election from the seat, the then sitting corporator from NMC Sandip Gavai, also BJP candidate, contested against Jain and lost by a huge margin. That the NCP and Congress fought separately and fielded two candidates, splitting the secular vote, aiding the saffron surge in both seats wrested from the NCP.In Yavatmal, Shiv Sena candidate Tanaji Jaywantrao Sawant defeated his nearest rival and Congress nominee Shankarrao Bade by a margin of 270 votes. Sawant secured 348 votes while Bade managed to get only 78. Independent candidate Sandeep Bajoria (the sitting NCP MLC) polled only two votes while five votes were found invalid. There were a total of 439 votes of which 433 voters turned up to exercise their franchise last Saturday.A Pune-based sugar baron, who also runs an education empire in western Maharashtra, Sawant was sent by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to try his luck in Yavatmal. The Congress's campaign projecting Sawant as an outsider failed miserably."
590a18107be9e033b96eac8a,Large-scale cross voting in Legislative Council polls,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/large-scale-cross-voting-in-legislative-council-polls-4390759/,2016-11-23,"At a time when the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is projecting Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation initiative as an effective strike to curb black money, elections to fill six Legislative Council seats threw up several combinations.Election results for the polls for the six seats  Yavatmal, Bhandara-Gondia (Vidarbha), Sangli-Satara, Pune (Western Maharashtra), Jalgaon (North Maharashtra) and Nanded-Waghala  were announced Tuesday. While the results jolted the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which failed to retain three out of four seats it had been representing, political analysts said large scale cross-voting emerged as the mainstay in these elections.Watch what else is making news:In Yavatmal, Shiv Senas Tanaji Sawant, a sugar baron from Marathwadas Osmanabad, wrested the seat defeating Congresss Shankar Bade and sitting NCP legislator Sandeep Bajoria. The margin of his victory was the telling blow. Sawant, the outsider, polled 348 votes, against Bades 78, while Bajoria polled just two votes. The BJP had supported Sawants candidature before hand. Incidentally, sensing the race had slipped away from him, NCPs Bajoria, too, had at the last moment endorsed Sawants candidature.A similar tale emerged from Bhandara-Gondia too. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnaviss handpick Parinay Fuke, a corporator in the Nagpur municipality and vice-president of BJPs Nagpur unit, won from an alien constituency, exploiting the rift between the Congress and the NCP. Senior NCP leader Praful Patels close associate and incumbent legislator Rajendra Jain had been renominated by the party, but the Congress fielded MLA Gopaldas Agarwals son Praful, making the win possible for Fuke and the BJP.In Satara-Sangli, Mohanrao Kadam, an education baron and brother of former Congress minister Patangrao Kadam, upset NCPs Shekhar Gore to wrest the seat. The Satara-Sangli seat was seen as a fortress for the NCP. Party insiders confirmed that the NCP had been divided on Gores candidature. Ajit Pawar had pushed for Gores candidature amid objections raised by local heavyweights Jayant Patil and Udayanraje Bhonsale. Talks between the Congress and the NCP for a pre-poll arrangement had broken off over the Yavatmal and Satara-Sangli seats.Though the Congress retained the Nanded-Waghala seat, independent candidate Shyamsunder Shinde, a retired bureaucrat, managed to poll votes from Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP councillors to give party candidate Amar Rajurkar a scare. The seat is a bastion of state Congress chief and former chief minister Ashok Chavan. While Rajukar polled 251 votes, Shinde was not far behind with 208 votes. Rajurkar had been elected unopposed the last time.The BJP retained the Jalgaon seat with its candidate Chandulal Patel winning convincingly. In the run-up to elections, an internal struggle had ensued within the BJP after the incumbent legislator Gurmukh Jagwani, a close-associate of former minister Eknath Khadse, was denied a renomination at the last moment. Khadses party rival and sitting BJP minister Girish Mahajan had propped up Patel, a builder. Khadse had aired his disappointment over the partys decision, pointing out that Patel did not even have the partys primary membership. The state BJP, however, heaved a sigh of relief when the results showed that the internal struggle hadnt impacted the polls outcome. The only solace for the NCP was that the party managed to retain the Pune seat. Partys sitting legislator Anil Bhonsale won the race convincingly.No sooner had the poll results been announced, the blame game between the Congress and the NCP started. While the NCP blamed the money power and the Congress for their poor performance, the later hit back. Had the NCP not played truant and struck a pre-poll understanding with us, the outcome would have been different. Both parties would have won three seats each.The BJP and the Shiv Sena were not complaining. While the NCP is still the largest party in the Legislative Council with 23 seats in the 78-member House, the Congress now has 20 members, followed by the BJP (18) and the Shiv Sena (9).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Mahadev Prasad has said it is possible to give high prices to growers during the crushing year 2016-17.Speaking to The Hindu soon after a meeting with leaders of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) here, the Minister said it was possible to pay Rs. 200 to Rs.300 per tonne of sugarcane above the current Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs.2,300 per tonne for sugarcane at 9.5 per cent recovery.He said he would convene a meeting with the managements of sugar mills in North Karnataka to take up the growers demand for higher prices and payment of previous dues in Belagavi on Thursday. The farmers were demanding Rs.3,500 per tonne, which included a share from the profits earned from the byproducts by the mills.Mr. Prasad said Karnataka was facing shortage of sugarcane this year for various reasons. As against 376.65 lakh tonnes of sugarcane crushed to produce 40.45 lakh tonnes of sugar last year (2015-16), around 300 lakh tonnes of cane was available this year (2016-17).This shortage situation would further result in fall in sugar production to about 300 lakh tonnes only.Earlier, to a question he told newsmen that there was no difference between the Maharashtra and Karnataka model on sugarcane prices. The only difference was that a few mills were facing shortage of cane in their respective areas were giving higher prices, which could not be bench mark for all other mills to follow.The government had already announced FRP of Rs.2,300 per tonne for cane yielding 9.5 per cent recovery. The prices were higher for every one per cent increase in the recovery. There were around 40 to 45 mills achieving more than 10.5 per cent recovery, which meant that the farmers could get higher prices from these mills as against those achieving 9.5 per cent or less recovery. However, he appealed farmers and their leader for exercising patience and assured of coming out with a decision as per the expectations of the agitating growers."

The politically influential sugar lobby in the state had been up in arms over the cap, that was introduced by the department on May 2, 2015 and had restricted the release of surplus molasses.Maharashtras sugar sector is all set to gain considerately with the state government further easing control of molasses for the production of ethanol. The excise department, led by BJPs Chandrasekhar Bavankule, has decided to withdraw the existing cap on the surplus molasses gained during the extraction of sugar from sugarcane. Molasses is the dark, sweet, and syrupy byproduct of refining sugarcane.The politically influential sugar lobby in the state had been up in arms over the cap, that was introduced by the department on May 2, 2015 and had restricted the release of surplus molasses, gained over and above the declared annual production, to five per cent.Millers had claimed that the cap was adhoc and lacked any scientific basis as the production of molasses can vary depending on the variety and the manner of sugar extraction, along with the process used for the extraction of the byproduct.Following their protest, the department has decided to withdraw the cap allowing the millers to release and sell molasses gained in surplus.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced decontrol of the byproduct on January 16 this year.Sources said the move is expected to translate into a handsome gain for the sugar mills, especially since the sale price of molasses has risen sharply  from Rs 3,000 per tonnes to Rs 7,000 per tonnes.Confirming the move, Excise Commissioner V Radha said about 1 lakh tonne of molasses was pending disposal across the state due to the cap. We have decided to release it. But the mills have been asked to submit an affidavit confirming that they are aware about facing strict action if this was found to be misused or misdirected, she said. Radha had held a meeting in this regard with the reprensentatives from the sugar industry and the states sugar commissionerate last week.Formal orders regarding the withdrawal of the cap are expected to be issued soon. Industry sources said that the move will provide sugar mills a legalised mechanism for disposal and sale of surplus molasses. Maharashtra is the countrys largest sugar producer. It has about 194 sugar mills, most of which are controlled by senior politicians. Of these, nearly 100 have also set up distilleries for production of alcohol using molasses, while a few sell the molasses to nearby distilleries.The release of the surplus old molasses is also expected to cushion the impact of an estimated shortage in its production this year. Sources said that the estimated availability of sugarcane this year stood at 445 lakh tonnes, that when crushed translates into just five million tonnes of sugar as compared to 8.5 million tonnes last season. The drop in sugar extraction will proportionately impact molasses production too, said sources. Following the rise in the molasses sale price, several sugar factories have stepped forward to report surplus gain of molasses. In fact, even three mills with linked distilleries, too, have applied for regularisation of gain in surplus, sources said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express photo) Vasai Fort was originally built by the Portuguese in 1536. (Express photo)Holding a faint smell of sea in the air, the coastal ruins of the crumbling Bassein Fort, popularly known as Vasai Fort, amidst tall coconut trees may today feel like a trip to a pirates cove. But you will be disappointed if you expect to find forgotten treasures or hideouts of buccaneers. For the rotting moss-covered walls of the fort hold not only some long-forgotten stories of war and victory but also of neglect.Around 70 kilometres away from the city, tucked in the suburbs of Vasai, lies this city of ruins. Visuals from films like Josh and Khamoshi play in your mind as you walk past the site. More recently, British band Coldplay visited the fort to shoot its song  Hymn for the weekend.In its existence of over four centuries, Vasai Fort, as it is better known as today, had seen several rulers. Originally built by the Portuguese in 1536, the 110-acre fort was captured by the Marathas in 1739 and eventually by the British after the First Anglo-Maratha War in 1802.The fort is the standing testimony of Indias diverse history. Before the entry of the foreign powers, Vasai was controlled by Bongle Raja in 1414 who built Nageshwara Temple at the fort premises. Then, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat took over and left his mark in the form of Islamic carvings on the fort walls. While fortifying the area, the Portuguese too had built seven churches within the area.Finally, when the Marathas took control, they took away the church bells as victory symbols and placed them in temples across Maharashtra.Father Francis Correa from Giriz Church in Vasai who had researched about the lost bells for over 26 years found them in temples in different parts of the state. During Chimaji Appa (Maratha Peshwa Bajiraos brother)s conquest of the fort from 1737 to 1739, he awarded the church bells to the military champions as war trophies, who in turn gave them away to temples of their choice. We found 38 church bells in places like Nashik, Jalna and Kolhapur, he said.During their two-century rule over Bassein, the Portuguese had made the fort a self-contained city with colleges, chapels, churches, restaurants, library, hospital, granary, town hall and an international market, where it is believed slaves were sold. The fort precincts also had a coin mint, an orphanage, separate bathing areas for men and women, a court and a prison.The British, however, commercialised the fort and installed a sugar factory in the precinct. But when the factory failed to yield desired profits they started neglecting the area.In 1990, after the Colonial rule had ended, the locals installed a statue of Chimaji Appa at the entrance of the fort to mark Marathas victory in the area.Not many people know the rich history of this ancient fort. Hence, a few have taken up the initiative of raising awareness about the place by conducting walks and drives for tourists. Pascal Lopes, a native of Vasai, is one such person. Lopes has done his masters in Numistatics and Archaeology and had been organising free get-to-know walks in the ruins during weekends.With greater accessibility over the years, Lopes has seen a growing interest among the people to know more about the fort. People from all age groups have begun to join him. While the fort does not see tourists every day, during weekends many groups queue in to explore the area. The fort is also frequented by young couples posing for their pre-wedding shoots, lovers looking for cosy nooks. Many naturalists have also developed a liking for this site to spend some quiet time with the sea or just watch the birds.However, the night brings a different set of visitors to the fort  drunkards, prostitutes and black magic practitioners.For the last five years, the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) has also been bringing the fort to life once a year with its Vasai Vijay Utsav on May 13  a celebration of Chimaji Appas victory over Vasai Fort.But the lack of conservation activities is slowly killing the site. Lopes says that the fort had faced maximum deterioration after it came under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1904. After ASI took over, the fort was left abandoned for many years. During this time many people plundered the fort for its stones and other treasures. It was also affected by natural causes like lightning and thunder. The many wars also left the fort weakened.The foundation of the Chimaji Appa statue has already weakened and locals warn that it may fall anytime now.A visitor of the fort for over two decades now, Lopes feels that a lot is lacking from ASIs side to conserve the fort. While they are working on the fort, they tend to do more of renovation than conservation. The fort should be made more tourist-friendly and tickets must be applied for visitation. The money could be used to conserve the fort better, said Lopes, adding, If things go on like this, in ten years the fort will be entirely in ruins.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Even chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' rally ahead of the polls failed to swing support in her favour. ""I accept defeat. The poll loss cannot be linked to the chief minister,"" she said.Dhananjay said people of Parli trusted his party for the good work it had done in the past five years. ""Even after the BJP sent its brigade of leaders, including CM and finance minister to Parli, citizens voted for NCP,"" he said, while also taking a dig at Congress and independents for lobbying against his party.""Pankaja should not try to hinder the development of Parli by arresting government funds as people were annoyed with such tactics,"" he added.In June this year, a panel led by Pankaja had taken control over Vaidyanath Urban Co-Operative Bank Limited in Parli by defeating the panel supported by Dhananjay. In April, Pankaja received a shot in the arm when her panel won the election to the Vaidyanath cooperative sugar factory.In another major upset for BJP, wife of water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar lost the president's post in the Partur civic body in Jalna district. Interestingly, Lonikar's wife Mandakini had preferred the poll symbol of hand-fan instead of the BJP's lotus.BJP president Raosaheb Danve failed to perform any miracle in key polls in his hometown Jalna district with his party and alliance partners losing three civic body polls out of four.Congress won the Partur, Jalna and Bhokardan municipal council elections, while the BJP could win only Ambad municipal council. In Bhokardan, a part of Danve's Lok Sabha constituency, BJP was defeated by the Congress."

But, soon after he deposited Rs 5.6 lakh back in the Kedgaon branch of Bank of Maharashtra  a desperate measure to tide over demonetisation  the bank refused to let him withdraw it as Hambir had no credit balance on November 8, the day of the announcement.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates that the money needs to reflect in his account balance sheet as of November 8.""I am showing all the proof of money transactions to the bank officials, but nobody is listening. We have no black money; each penny is from sugarcane bills sent to the sugar factory and the amount is transferred via the online system in Pune District Central Co-operative Bank (PDCC). We later transferred the sum to the Bank of Maharashtra, Kedgaon branch, to get interest on the savings account. We are suffering for no fault of ours,"" a harrowed Hambir told Pune Mirror.The Hambir family had withdrawn Rs 6 lakh on October 24 from their Bank of Maharashtra account. Rattled by the announcement, they had deposited Rs 5.60 lakh into the same account in two installments  first on November 19 and then on November 25. Now, the 27-year-old groom is running from pillar to post to get some relief from the bank authorities, but is unable to withdraw more than a few thousand rupees as the officials are sending him back every time, citing the RBI notification.When Mirror spoke to RBI spokesperson Alpana Killawala, she insisted, ""Even though the RBI has issued the notification, the bank can easily help needy customers in such exceptional cases by using the rights falling under their own jurisdiction. The announcement is meant to stop the flow of black money only. The relaxed rules for wedding purposes are actually not that hard and fast either. If the customer is able to show his source of income without any doubts, then I feel that the bank should consider his pleas."" But, she clarified that the issue is solely between the bank and its loyal customer and that the RBI has no right to interfere.Purushottam Balasaheb Hambir holds his wedding invitation card, which the family even sent to PM Modi and Fadnavis on WednesdayMeanwhile, the bank is playing by the rules, leaving Hambir and his family in a limbo.

My entire family is under tremendous stress as there is no money for the purchase of clothes and jewellery, or even to settle the bills of the pandal, DJ system, decoration and caterers. We rarely use debit cards as we are habituated to cash. But, even if we switch to ATM cards now, the amount coming out of the kiosks is too petty,"" rued Hambir.The RBI notification, issued on November 21, allows the withdrawing of up to Rs 2.5 lakh cash for wedding ceremonies. But the rider is that money can only be withdrawn from the credit balance as of November 8. ""I am relentlessly doing the rounds of the offices of PDCC and Bank of Maharashtra, carrying all my documents of proof, hoping that after seeing them, they would consider this as an extraordinary case and give me some relief,"" Hambir said.Purushottam Balasaheb Hambir holds his his withdrawal and deposit slips, and passbookSandeep Hambir, one of his cousins, added, ""We have sent a marriage invitation card each to PM Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis by post on Wednesday itself.

The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

Mumbai-based Lupin will market Eglucent - a new version of insulin lispro - through its own field force, while Lilly will be responsible for the manufacturing and import of the drug. Lilly will continue to sell the older lispro under the brand name Humalog through its existing channels. Lupin had earlier collaborated with Lilly in July 2011 to promote and distribute its Huminsulin range of products in India and Nepal. Eglucent is an injectible medication to improve blood sugar control in patients with type I and II diabetes. Eglucent will be available in both cartridge and disposable pen forms and is meant to complement diet and exercise to check sugar levels. ""We are excited about expanding our partnership with Eli Lilly and the progress that we together have made to combat the rising incidence of diabetes in India. Our entry into the rapid-acting insulin analog segment will not only bolster our existing diabetes portfolio, but will also go a long way in strengthening our position in the Indian pharma market,"" Shakti Chakraborty, group president - India region formulations - Lupin, said. Lupin is the fifth-largest company in the diabetes segment with a market share of 6.34 per cent and growing at 18 per cent, according to IMS MAT September 2016.

Instead, the cabbage took a tad longer and by the time a deal was made the agriculture market was reeling under a cash crunch that slashed prices of all farm produce.When Gunjal, a farmer from Khandgaon village in Ahmednagar district finally sold his cabbage, he got only Rs 6,000 for the entire acre of produce instead of Rs 80,000, the market price he could have got earlier.On the heels of three consecutive droughts and unseasonal rains, Gunjal and his family was counting on this cabbage field to make some headway in 2016. ``The money I would have got from the cabbage would have gone into planting of pomegranates in this season, paying back one installment of loan, running the house and paying labourers. Now, I have been left with half a field of cabbage that even the trader did not bother to take and will have to plough over it, said Gunjal, whose family including two other brothers owns 16 acres of land, where they grow vegetables, sugarcane and fodder crops.Like Gunjal, lakhs of farmers in rural Maharashtra are facing the brunt due to demonetization as the cash crunch has led to a drop in prices of farm produce. Majority of agriculture markets in the state that have so far been dealing solely in cash, were working at only 50 % or less of their capacities this month.With the district co-operative banks, where a majority of farmers have their transactions, not getting enough cash from the state banks, currency has only a notional value even for the relatively well to do sugar cane farmers, as they cannot withdraw money from their accounts. The result is that the entire cycle of transactions in the farm sector from commissioning agents to landless labourers, has been disrupted.`` My farm labourers have to be paid weekly in cash. I owe them Rs 20,000 already. I have had to let go of sowing in this rabi season because there was no money in hand. I lost 60 per cent of my last onion produce in the rains. The remaining 40 per cent or 100 quintals I brought to the market but traders have no money to pay me,  said Namdeo Karade, farmer from Ahmednagar in Western Maharashtra. ``I have sold my entire produce on trust to a trader; he will pay me when the cash is handy in a couple of days. I have never been paid in cheque before, what if it bounces?At the Sangamners APMC, traders and agents owe farmers like Karade nearly Rs 5.72 crore in the last 15 days. At the Ahmednagar APMC, that makes a profit of Rs 9.4 crore, nearly Rs 12.10 crore is pending in payments to farmers in the 14 days from November 8 to November 26.``We are functioning at 50 per cent of our capacity.. the cash crunch has slashed all prices especially of fruits, vegetables by 30 to 40 per cent. But, cheque payments have slowly started with 35 to 40 per cent of payments being done in cheques. It is going to be slow but the shift can be made as all farmers do have bank accounts. The problem is that clearance of cheques can take as much as 10 days, said Abhay Bhise, secretary of Ahmednagar APMC.By the time the shift to cheque payments is 100 per cent and farmers can actually get their hands on their hard earned cash, the rabi sowing season will be over. In this shift, many a small farmer, will be hit so badly that it will take him another year to recover, that too only if the monsoons are good.Rajaram Akolkar for instance is among those, who says, survival will be difficult. Akolkar drove on his motorcycle 53 kms from the drought prone Pathardi taluka to come to APMC in Ahmednagar, carrying with him one quintal of lemons, seeking a better price. He was however offered only Rs 8 for a kilo of lemons and he can return home with Rs 800, but this pricely sum includes one old Rs 500 note.`` I have no choice but to accept Rs 800 being offered to me, including one old Rs 500 note, stand in a queue to deposit the money and withdraw it. I have a Jan Dhan account in a nationalized bank but the branch is away from my village and will cost me one days work. I need the cash now, he asked. After demonetization, Akolkar was forced to abandon his 200 bags of onions in local market at Pathardi, for the lack of buyers. In APMCs, farmers like Akolkar sitting on gunny bags of produce from ginger to carrots, hunting for buyers and finally abandoning produce is not uncommon.READ MOREProtest against demonetisation in Mumbai: Congress leader calls Centre anti-poorDemonetisation effect: Fewer property registrations in Maharashtra"

We expect to receive the money on Wednesday.""A sugarcane cooperative leader said, ""There is the need to raise the weekly bank withdrawal limit from Rs 24,000 to Rs 50,000.

He also lashed out at the previous government for lapses in initiating measures to curb the black money menace.Under the PDS, the government supplies fuel (kerosene), foodgrain and other essential commodities like sugar to poor families at subsidised rates. In rural areas, it is a major source for lower middle class families. The government is also planning to provide biometric ration cards to weed out fake cards that are used for black marketing foodgrains and fuel meant for PDS.Further, POS will be made available at 30,000 citizen facilitation centres in villages for farmers. Fadnavis added that all state government initiatives will gradually go cashless. The government plans to train 1,000 college students as volunteers to educate citizens about cashless transactions.Fadnavis dismissed allegations that foreign-linked payment gateways, such as PaytTM, were controlled by China or the Alibaba group. He said that there was no question of any apprehension of foreign country involvement.Responding to the Oppositions concern that the rural economy in Maharashtra is getting affected due to the Centres decision to not allow rural cooperative banks to conduct transactions in demonetised currency, Fadnavis said he would be leading a delegation of all party leaders on Thursday to meet Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and request for restrictions on cooperative banks to be lifted.Earlier, launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led government at centre over demonetisation, the opposition in both the Houses of the state legislature accused the government of making lives difficult for the rural population by banning acceptance of high-value notes in cooperative banks.Initiating the debate in the state assembly under rule 101, former chief minister and senior Congress member Prithviraj Chavan pointed out that by banning the transactions by cooperative banks, the Union government was destroying the rural economy.He alleged that the decision was taken with an eye on the Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Can the BJP and Fadnavis say under oath that the black money was not used in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014? Did they use debit and credit cards for electioneering? Chavan quipped. Attacking the ruling party, Chavan said that surprisingly, the government was promoting foreign linked payment gateways like Paytm.Ridiculing the cashless economy, Chavan said nowhere in the world had the cashless economy been fully implemented.Countering Chavan ,Fadnavis said the previous government had failed to ratify a United Nations treaty on black money which was waiting since 2004.Between 2004 to 2011, BJP led government at the Centre signed the treaty, thereby allowing access to accounts of all Indians in foreign banks.The opposition also came down heavily on the government over the issue in the upper house of the legislature.READ MOREMaharashtra guv asks universities to go cashless, accept fees through online bankingDemonetisation: Fee payments in Maharashtra may soon go cashless"

(Express Photo: Subham Dutta) Farmers at a sugarcane plantation in Murshidabad. (Express Photo: Subham Dutta)What should have been a sweet season for cane growers in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh (UP) is turning out to be a bitter one, with prices of both sugar and gur falling thanks to demonetisation. It has meant reduced bargaining power for farmers, even with Indias total sugar production slated to dip from 252 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2015-16 to 225 lt this season and UP being the sole state seen to record an increase from 68.55 lt to 75 lt-plus.Since demonetisation happened on November 8, ex-factory sugar prices in UP have eased from around Rs 3,600 to Rs 3,450 per quintal. The drop has been even more for gur, where prices at Hapur have plunged from Rs 2,800 to Rs 2,400 per quintal.Watch What Else Is making NewsDemand is subdued, as there is little cash available in the market. Traders are buying sugar only for day-to-day requirements and not for stocking up. This time, we expected them to purchase more at the seasons start (mills began crushing last month), given the overall tight supply position. Instead, they are waiting and watch. Without liquidity improving, we dont see prices going up, said a UP miller.Its worse with gur, where the business is entirely cash-based. The kolhus  which typically crush 10 tonnes per day of cane, as against the 5,000-tonnes or more capacity of sugar mills  were offering farmers rates of Rs 280-300 per quintal in the period immediately preceding demonetisation. But now, they are paying Rs 220-240/quintal.Many of them have shut down because they dont have the cash to run. Although the UP government has announced a state advised price (SAP) of Rs 305/quintal for this season, mills will be under no pressure to pay because there is no competition from kolhus to purchase our cane, noted Jitender Singh Hooda, a farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district.UP mills  basically those belonging to the UK Modi group, Simbhaoli Sugars, Mawana Sugars, Rana Sugars and Bajaj Hindusthan  are still to pay Rs 1,028.75 crore out of the Rs 18,003.21 crore worth of cane that they bought from farmers in the 2015-16 season at the SAP of Rs 280 per quintal. While the Akhilesh Yadav government has increased the SAP for the current season, keeping in view Assembly elections early next year, falling sugar prices can make it difficult for mills to pay.This has come at a bad time. We were looking for a good season because low sugar output in drought-hit states like Maharashtra and Karnataka should have benefited us. But with sugar and gur prices coming down, our hopes are dashed. Even if prices increase later with cash and demand returning, it will not matter, as we would already have supplied our cane by then, added Hooda.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58e53acba3d24b500504a850,A leap into the digital world,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-leap-into-the-digital-world/article16787197.ece,2016-12-10,"all things for all people:Common Services Centres are an organic response to the growth in demand for digitised government services that a static state machinery cannot keep up with and the free market has seemingly ignored. A Common Services Centre in Malegaon. (Below) Another in Uruli Kanchan near Pune, Maharashtra.PHOTOs: AJAJ SHAIKH & arunangsu roy chowdhuryThe first floor office in Malegaon, in Maharashtras Nashik district, raises its shutters. The only remarkable things about it are its address  it sits at Tension Chowk, perhaps named as counterweight for a nearby road, optimistically called Aman (peace) Chowk  and the board outside advertising it as an Aadhaar enrolment centre.By midday, on December 2, there is the usual bustle of small commerce and this office, which many people think is a government outlet of some kind, sees its usual group of 10 or 15 people gathered around. Inside, a rate board on the far wall informs people that this is not just a place where you can get an Aadhaar card. There are a range of services listed, from providing caste, nationality and domicile certificates, to facilities such as online railway ticket bookings and electricity bill payments. The other clue that it is more than a sleepy Aadhaar enrolment centre is a small board next to that one, with a Bank of Baroda logo.Behind a single desk with two computers, a young woman accepts withdrawal slips, asks customers to place their thumbs on a small fingerprint-reader, and dispenses cash from a small drawer beneath the desk once they are verified. In effect, this office is an informal mini bank. And since November 15  when the government increased the holding limit of cash that such centres can stock per day to Rs.50,000 so that money can be easily available  it has been a lifeline to a cash-starved populace. That is, to those of the citizenry who know its exists.The Tension Chowk Aadhaar Enrolment Centre, run by an entrepreneur, Sajid Shaikh, is just one of a vast network of Common Services Centres (CSCs) that you are likely to see in virtually every small town and thousands of villages across the country. The CSCs help people apply online for a range of services  passport registration, PAN cards and Aadhaar cards, and a whole host of other certificates  without them having to visit a government office. CSC operators scan documents and upload them through a portal to the relevant government office that will then send back a completed certificate or card. They are like cybercafes, except they connect only to Digital India.Over the past two or three years, a huge number of these centres have added services like banking and insurance to their offerings. In a sense, they are an organic response to the growth in demand for digitised government services that a static state machinery cannot keep up with and the free market has seemingly ignored.When this correspondent visited the offices of other CSCs who were banking correspondents, it became clear that awareness of their existence  leave alone that they had cash to dispense  was low. This while at the Bank of Barodas main branch in Malegaon, a sign in Marathi has been out at midday, informing people that the bank has run out of cash. There are hundreds of restive people waiting in line outside each formal bank. It was only yesterday that the bank manager put out a sign with the numbers of some Common Services Centres, who are also banking correspondents, asking people to come to us instead, Shaikh says. Since then, a few more people have turned up to open Jan Dhan accounts. In Malegaon alone, there are four centres like his affliliated with the Bank of Baroda while a few others are tied to either the State Bank of India or the Bank of India, he says.Bridging the gapThe concept of CSCs was approved in 2006 as part of the National e - Governance Plan. CSCs are set up in a public-private partnership mode, with a designated state agency being a franchisor of sorts for village level entrepreneurs (VLEs) to set up centres. While VLEs come from various backgrounds  Shaikh used to run a business selling stamp paper before he started his centre in 2014; another CSC operator in Malegaon, Deepali Lad, says she used to run a business providing BSNL connections  they must meet a set of minimum requirements. They must have passed a matriculation-level examination by a recognised board, be fluent in reading and writing the local language, and make arrangements for infrastructure (a room of minimum 100-150 sq ft with two personal computers and two printers).According to Union Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad, when he became Minister there were only about 80,000 CSCs and now there are close to 2,00,000 CSCs across India. The National Democratic Alliance government renamed the project CSC 2.0 and announced plans to scale up to the point that there is at least one centre in each of the 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in the country. At current growth rates, the number of CSCs could be over 3,00,000 by the close of 2017.A thriving ecosystemFrom conversations with CSCs across the country, the average cost of setting up a small centre, land and building costs included, ranges from Rs.2.5-3 lakh. VLEs usually record 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per month. While the geo-locator tool on the projects website has been under maintenance for the past week, other sites like apna.csc.gov.in list centres in virtually every district in every State, suggesting that this is a business growing very quickly.The world of CSCs and VLEs is now a separate ecosystem in itself, perhaps best captured by a monthly magazine called CSC Tarang: A Silent Revolution in Rural Entrepreneurship that was started in October 2015 by CSC e-governance services, the nodal agency in Delhi that administrates the project. The magazine is an excellent window to the profession, featuring profiles of successful VLEs from across India and stories of those who have successfully set up centres in villages that fall under the Maoist belt in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, or in remote areas in the Northeast. It even has a monthly counter for the top five VLEs of the month, based on the number of transactions recorded on the CSC portal. VLEs usually record 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per month. On a consistent basis, VLEs from Gujarat and Chhattisgarh feature in these lists.In the November 2015 edition of the magazine, Dr. Dinesh Tyagi, the CEO of CSC e-services (whose notes usually start each issue), writes that despite agreements being signed with all public sector banks and a few private sector banks for CSCs to become banking correspondents, only 30,000 across the country had done so. He encourages more to get on board so that they can create the largest network of banking outlets in the world.For this years December edition, a month after demonetisation, Tyagi says that CSCs have been assigned to participate in the digital financial literacy programme of the government by going out and training at least 10 merchants and 40 citizens each in the use of digital financial tools for transactions. He says the State team and district manager would soon get in touch with each CSC to explain more about the programme. Work on the whole project should be completed by the end of December, he adds.Intent versus realityOn the afternoon of December 6, in the small town of Uruli Kanchan near Pune, Baba Rao Sawant is having a conversation with the district manager about CSCs. Its not about the digital literacy programme but about a fresh rigmarole involving banking services for his CSC. The district manager is telling me that the banks are finding it really difficult after demonetisation and it would really help if some of the crowds can be diverted to centres like mine, he says. There is some confusion about who has to send the appropriate letter to whom and the process for now has been stalled.Eight years ago, Sawant helped his wife Ujjwala register for one of the first CSCs in Maharashtra. They started with the basic range of certificates and services before moving on to offering banking and insurance services. Ujjwala managed to recruit several other women to help out and they formed a self-help group, all of them operating as VLEs. From a collection of small centres, Sawant then opened a larger space in 2013. It was like a mini Mantralaya [the Maharashtra state secretariat] in a large space, with 13 different counters for various services, he says.Three years later, Sawant says that the government system is not evolving quite as fast as he would have liked his business to, and that he had perhaps tried too soon to be all things to all people: We tried to scale up but the problem now is that despite the government saying that all these services are online, much of the work had to be done offline. Even though we got documents uploaded and scanned copies back, they still had to be taken to a corporation in Pune to get an official stamp. The other problems, he says, are that there is little done to educate the public about what CSCs can do and that he feels that he is often in competition with the local government. Rather than organising, say, an Aadhaar camp on their own, if the local officials just informed people about centres like ours we could get every single person in our area registered for Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts in no time.As numerous as the VLE success stories are, there are many who believe they are on the threshold of something big but havent quite made it yet. The networks obvious potential to bridge policy and people is hampered by inconsistency in government mechanisms and the legal framework that it needs to rest on. The system works well at the moment because of a combination of good entrepreneurial skill and luck.In Chhattisgarh for instance, Krishna Kumar Sharma, who runs a centre in Dhamtari, says he is able to offer 34 types of certificates to his customers seamlessly. All the documents come with the digital signature of the officer and there is only a delay if he has been transferred or something, he says. Besides certificates and passport and PAN card registrations, his centre offers banking and insurance as well as a small cybercafe space where people are trained in digital literacy. Sharma, a former software engineer, says that since he started the centre in 2013, more than 15 members from his family have joined him in the venture.On the other hand, in an urban centre like Surat, Jagdish Baldania, a VLE who consistently tops the Tarang charts, says that he has consciously chosen to limit his offerings. People come to my centre mainly for PAN card registrations, mobile and D2H recharge, and election-related work like checking if their name is in the rolls, etc. If I started offering more services, there would be delays and people might stop coming. He says already four other CSCs in his area have closed down and his is the only one operating, a stroke of luck.One of the main reasons that Baldania doesnt print certificates is because of the possibility of having to do offline work. Here he alludes to an issue of privacy and regulation: People think of me as a government employee so I dont want to do services that require a process that is outside the online system. What if they have some difficulty a few years later and they come back to me?In Uruli, Sawant also expressed a similar concern, mentioning that though he was registered as a VLE through an Aadhaar registration, he hadnt actually signed a formal agreement with anybody, which left a niggling doubt about his legitimacy.A collection of CSC operators that this correspondent spoke to from other States expressed other concerns. Many say that they have applied to become banking correspondents but there has been a delay in getting permissions while others in States like Odisha and Uttar Pradesh mirror Sawants concern that there is not enough awareness and consequently not enough potential for growth.Reaching the ignoredThe CSC network remains an idea  and a network  with huge potential, but it needs work. To get a clear idea of how much difference a CSC run by a VLE with ties to the community can make, one has to look at the remoter villages.Take Hingangaon, a village about 15 km from Uruli. While it doesnt have a CSC, there is one a few kilometres away, at a junction called Pimpri, where two petrol pumps and a few shops line the road. One of these shops, the only one doing business by late afternoon, is an e-service kendra. There is an orderly queue of about six or seven persons inside, three of whom have come for Aadhaar registration.Two staff members sit behind a counter. In an inside office, Sameer Sawant, a wiry 25-year-old who runs this establishment, is tallying up some numbers. Three years ago, Sawant thought of starting this centre because it was a great business opportunity. While working as a computer teacher in Uruli Kanchan, he had seen hundreds of people come to register for Aadhaar cards at CSCs and thought of starting his own. He chose Pimpri since it was close to his village and could also service four other villages in the area.Sawant shows us a small flyer that he has made for his centre that he distributes in the villages. It is a rate card that lists about seven or eight digital services, banking facilities for the Bank of India, and a few other small services like printing visiting cards that he does outside of the CSC roster. Through all this, Sawant says his centre manages to make a monthly income of about Rs.25,000-30,000 a month. Its not much, but he is optimistic. Many of the services have to be done offline so we have stopped that. But if I was able to offer more services, my business would grow. If someone comes for Aadhaar, I would like to also get him registered for a PAN card. There is a school close by here and during admission time students may need domicile or caste certificates, he says.On a phone, we show him a letter from the Ministry of Information and Technology explaining how VLEs like him should educate people on digital financial transactions. As he goes through the letter, his eyes light up. This is what I have been talking about, he says. I met an old man this morning for whom I had enabled e-banking. He was going to go all the way to Uruli to see whether a cheque he had deposited had been credited to his account but I explained to him that he could check this on his phone.He continues: There are also some workers from U.P. and Bihar who work in the sugar factory close by and I have been talking to them about how they can transfer money back to their families without incurring bank transfer cost. That amount makes a difference to them so things like e-wallet should be an option.CSCs, it is clear, could have a much larger role to play in moving forward in the coming weeks and months. For now, theyre scratching the surface.Rather than organising an Aadhaar camp on their own, if local officials informed people about centres like ours we could get every single person in our area registered for Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts in no time -Baba Rao Sawant,VLE"

The committee would be meeting every month, an official said.A government resolution (GR) issued on December 7 had said that the committee was being formed as per the directive of the National Green Tribunal.One of the things the committee would deal with is the common practise of burning bagasse (the dry residue left after extraction of juice from sugar cane) and stubble in fields post-harvest.Burning is supposed to improve the productivity of the land, but the committee has decided to ask farmers to desist from it, the official said.The GR states that the committee should educate farmers about better ways of disposal of the stubble.The committee is also going to deal with the issue of road-sweeping, which pushes up the dust and pollutes the air.The GR has permitted the committee to invite experts and researchers as per their requirement for drafting the action plan.

Marathwada has, by far, seen the largest price rush with some millers announcing Rs 900 above their FRP as the first installment price.Sugar millers in Maharashtra have embarked on a price war in order to attract cane from growers as paucity of cane threatens to severely affect their sugar production this crushing season. Millers, especially from Pune, Solapur and the districts of Marathwada, have announced the first installment prices way above their normal fair and remunerative prices (FRP).With only 6.5 lakh hectares of cane area, the crushing season 2016-17 is supposed to be a short one. Paucity of cane has especially been acute in the districts of Marathwada, Pune and Solapur where millers are now hard-pressed to source cane.On an average, the first installments announced by millers are Rs 400-600 more than the FRP. In Pune, 10 mills have announced first installment prices above the FRP with the prices ranging from Rs 2,400- 2,550 per quintal of cane crushed.Mills in this area normally pay FRP in the range of Rs 2,200- 2,300 per quintal of cane crushed. The competition is fierce in Solapur, where millers have adopted the same formula even though the FRP of the region is between Rs 1,664-Rs 2175 per quintal of cane crushed. Millers here have announced the first installment at Rs 2,550 per quintal.Marathwada has, by far, seen the largest price rush with some millers announcing Rs 900 above their FRP as the first installment price. With just 26 out of 51 mills operational in this region, most of the mills are trying hard to attract cane before the season runs out.The price war is led by private millers in Marathwada, while both cooperative and private mills are in the price race in Pune and Solapur. The short season and paucity of cane had prompted Swambhimani Shetkari leader Raju Shetti to ask for Rs 3,200 as the first installment payment for cane during his Oosh Parishad (cane conclave) at Jaishingpur, Kolhapur district two months back.The cane growers had finally agreed to accept price of Rs 175, in addition to the FRP, as their first installment payment.Senior officials from the sugar commissionerate said the price war is basically to attract cane growers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has held discussions with officials from the RBI, Union finance ministry, DCCBs, national banks and Niti Aayog on the various modules that can be explored to move to cashless transactions.With the Centre aggressively pushing for a cashless economy, the state government is working on several measures to bridge the gap between urban and rural banking. Nearly 2 lakh volunteers are being deployed across urban and rural Maharashtra to study and suggest reforms in individual sectors to align them with a cashless economy. Eventually, the government feels, the farm sector, rural industries and village markets need to embrace cashless operations.Watch what else is making news:To begin with, directives have been issued to district collectors to register 76 lakh people who are in the non-banking sector to open individual accounts. It includes 48 lakh people in rural areas and 26 lakh people in urban areas. The total population of the state is 11.23 crore.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has held discussions with officials from the RBI, Union finance ministry, DCCBs, national banks and Niti Aayog on the various modules that can be explored to move to cashless transactions.While acknowledging it is a formidable task, the government has set a target to bring at least 50 per cent transactions into cashless mode. The government believes the biggest beneficiary of cashless transactions would be small and medium farmers, labourers, vegetable venders, small retailers and traders, micro and medium small-scale industries and women bachatgats.Efforts are also underway to bring the entire cooperative network in the state online. It would include DCCBs, cooperative dairies, sugar cooperatives, APMCs, etc.The process of direct subsidy transfer benefit to farmers has yielded good response.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58d7cf33a3d24b75f276ffe7,Record production of ethanol may cut fuel bill,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Record-production-of-ethanol-may-cut-fuel-bill/articleshow/55931249.cms,2016-12-12,"NEW DELHI: Sugar mills recorded the highest ever production of ethanol of more than 110 crore litres during 2015-16 crop year, over 50% more than what was produced during the previous year.According to food ministry officials, this resulted in achieving 4.4% ethanol blending in petrol, which was almost double of 2014-15. Government has set a target of increasing this blending of ethanol in petrol to 10% in its bid to reduce import of crude oil. Ethanol is produced from sugarcane molasses. Blending of ethanol in petrol helps in saving fuel , and consequently foreign exchange.""During 2014-15 crop year, a total of about 68 crore litres of ethanol was produced and in the previous year it was only 37 crore litres. During last crop year, we, in association with the petroleum ministry, developed a national grid to improve the supply of ethanol to oil marketing companies. Sugar mills close to the oil depots linked,"" said a food ministry official. In November 2012, the UPA Cabinet had approved 5% mandatory blending of ethanol with petrol, which was notified by the Centre under the Motor Spirits Act in January 2013. Oil companies had to record this target by June 2013.Earlier this year, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said that it was found that blending can be raised up to 15-20% for both ethanol in petrol and biodiesel without a major change in existing car engines.Sources said during this sugar season the ethanol production may be less than the achievement of last crop year due to less sugarcane production in Maharashtra."

Solely on the sale of milk, Gadekars family managed to marry off the daughters of the house, take and pay back the loans and do farming. In a nut shell, the milk money has helped Gadekar fight the vagaries of climate and market price for crops.But, over the last one month, Gadekar has found out that while this income  from selling 17 litres of milk daily  has not stopped, it has no value for him. Nearly, Rs 15,000 is sitting in Gadekars account with the Kanifnath milk co-operative society in his village in Raitewadi. The income is from the last two fortnightly payments from the Sangamner Taluka Co-operative Milk Producers Sangh made to the Ahmednagar district central co-operative bank and then transferred to his milk co-operative society. But, he has no access to this money.The withdrawal limit for the entire milk co-operative society that has an account with the Ahmednagar DCC, taken as one individual holder, is Rs24,000 for a week. In Gadekars village alone, there are more than 200 members linked to the Kanifnath milk co-operative society.We are trying to distribute the money in installments, giving more to those who are in dire need. But, its way too little. Most of the villagers now are living on credit, but how long can that last , asks Santosh Mandekar, chairman of the Kanifnath Milk Producers Co-operative Society.In adjoining, Khandgaon village, its the same story. Khandgaon with a population of 3,500 people has 786 members linked to the local milk dairy.I was counting on this money for my rabi sowing. Do you know how much investment is required to grow onions on one acre ? It can take as much as Rs40,000. I was counting on rotating some of the money got from milk and sugarcane payments for this, instead I am now running pillar to post to just get my own income in my hands, said Shivaji Misre, farmer from Khandgaon village. Misre has Rs25,000 as the first installment for his cane payment from the Bhausaheb Thorat Co-operative Sugar factory and Rs10,000 from the milk payment sitting in his account.On the whole, the Sangamner Taluka Co-operative Milk Producers Sangh that sells milk under Rajhans brand, has around 50,000 members (only from the taluka), organised under as many as 207 dairy societies. It collects nearly 2.30 lakh to 2.70 lakh litres a day and has daily payments worth Rs 70 lakh to the milk producers spread across 171 villages. All these transactions are carried out through the district central co-operative bank.The co-operative sugar factorys first installment to its 22,000 member farmers is to the tune of Rs34 crore. Our co-operative ecology is very strong. The issue is not cashless transactions; we started RTGS and cheque payments over a decade back. The problem is the cash crunch, which has affected the entire supply chain from our wholesale buyers to retailers across the state and even in Surat to our individual members, said Dr P J Ubalepatil, managing director of Sangamner taluka milk co-operative.To put this in perspective, one needs to understand the states co-operative sector. For instance, Sangamner in Ahmednagar district is one of the most successful models set up by co-operative doyen and Congress leader Bhausaheb Thorat, currently run by his son and former revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. In the taluka, everything from the sugar factory to milk dairy and even petrol pumps are run on co-operative basis, which means group of farmers are stakeholders in the business. All their transactions are in turn linked to the Ahmednagar DCC that has 286 branches in the district, with 39 branches in Sangamner taluka alone. When we ask for Rs 10 crore as our requirement, we get Rs25 lakh to Rs30 lakh in cash. How are we to disburse this among our 10 lakh account holders ? One understands that there has been mismanagement in various district co-operative banks but why paint the entire sector and all banks as bad ?, asks Raosaheb Varpe, Managing Director of Ahmednagar DCC.He added, Our bank has no such history, instead we have been very successful. We have been given our license by RBI. When one of our account holders wants to withdraw Rs24,000, we cant give him the amount. We offer Rs2,000 to Rs 4,000 and at the maximum Rs 10,000.The co-operative sector in Maharashtra has largely been in the hands of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, who have dominated the district bank, sugar as well as milk co-operative sector. Several banks, sugar factories have had to be liquidated following flagrant mismanagement of its accounts but many others run successfully and continue to hold the strings of the rural economy. For now, the demonetization decision has put a spoke in the wheels of this entire sector, affecting the livelihood of lakhs of farmers.The co-operative sugar factorys first installment to its 22,000 member farmers is to the tune of Rs34 crore.Our co-operative ecology is very strong.

On credible information that a huge pile of cash was lying in the apartment, the income tax (I-T) officials visited the condo on December 12 and found an elderly woman guarded by two dogs staying in the flat.The woman refused to chain the dogs and did not cooperate with us, an official said.The I-T departments investigation wing then visited the flat again on Tuesday, with police in tow, and found one of the rooms locked. With the elderly woman refusing to speak a word about the locked room, the officials enquired around and learnt that a man regularly visited the flat early in the morning. The sleuths discovered it was Manjunath, the owner of the flat.They summoned him and opened the room in his presence where the unaccounted-for cash was stashed.A consequential survey was conducted by the Income Tax Department. The assessee claimed that the cash was part of the net proceeds from the night club. A survey was also initiated immediately in the club, with whom the said person is associated, to verify his claims which turned out to be incorrect, the investigators said.On sustained interrogation, Gowda admitted that the money was part of his unaccounted income.The cash has been seized and further investigation is in progress, an official said.Rs 67 lakh found in Goa.In second such case at Panjim in Goa, the I-T officials seized Rs 67.98 lakh in new Rs 2,000-denomination banknotes from a few individuals in Banda, off Maharashtra-Goa border.The I-T department had specific information that a few people were engaged in exchanging demonetised currency with the new Rs 2,000 notes. A team of taxmen, pretending to get their old currency exchanged in a village called Kera, intercepted a two wheeler at around 11.30 pm.

He was let off at 9pm after a 12-hour-long interrogation by Thane income-tax sleuths. In the meantime, raids were carried out at his residence in Thane. Gawde (43) is believed to have told the investigating officers that the money is accounted for.Matoshree may have a tough time keeping a safe distance from Gawde, observers said.Although Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday sought to downplay Gawde's detention which took place earlier in the day at Nalasopara in a joint operation by crime branch's Vasai unit and Thane incometax officials, sources in the BJP said the issue could be a source of ""great embarrasment"" for the party. The deputy chiefship of the Thane district Sena unit is said to be a key post in the party's organizational hierarchy.Acting on a tip-off, a trap was laid for Gawde's car on Nalasopara-Virar Link Road since 5am. The car was intercepted around 8.30am. A total cash of Rs 1.1 crore was found in the car's boot. Nalasopara-based hotelier Sudarshan Shereghar (32) was detained with him.Gawde, a businessman, is house leader of the Sena in VVMC. The municipality is ruled by the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) party of MLA Hitend ra Thakur. Gawde has moved the Bombay high court against the BVA for not allowing the Sena to sit in the opposition.Meanwhile, speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a party function at Sena Bhavan, Thackeray recalled a similar case involving BJP minister Subhash Deshmukh on November 17 when a sum of Rs 91.5 lakh was found in a vehicle in Umergaon in the Osmanabad district. The car reportedly be longed to Deshmukh. The BJP minister later claimed that the cash was meant for payment to labourers of a sugar cooperative factory, which is affiliated to the Lok Mangal group.Continuing his attack on the Modi regime for scrapping high currency notes, Thackeray said while financial assistance was being sent to Kashmiri fundamentalists on a silver platter at their residence, hard-working and honest citi zens were being forced to queue up. Thackeray riled the Centre for banning district cooperative banks from carrying out financial transactions. ""Vijay Mallya didn't borrow from cooperative banks,"" the Sena president said, adding, ""I will not make the citizens stand in queues."" However, the BJP was quick to smell a political opportunity in Sena's trouble. ""Gawde's detention is a slap on the Sena's face,"" said a state BJP functionary ."

To add insult to injury, South Korean steel major Posco and ArcelorMittal have shelved their projects for setting up a 12 million tonne per annum (MTPA) steel plant at Paradip and 8 MTPA steel plant in Keonjhar, respectively. The admission has come at a time when the state is organising road shows both within the country and abroad to woo investors. To attract investments, the state has already organised road shows at Hannover in Germany, Taiwan, Singapore, Yiyamin in China, Tel Aviv (Israel), London and Santa Clara in US. It organised road shows in New Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore, Goa, Chennai, Hyderabad, Gandhi Nagar and Jaipur. It also took part in the Make In India week held in Mumbai in February and an investors' meet in Bangalore in September. The state government has spent more than Rs 8 crore to organise these shows. The state has around 2,393 industrial units across the state. In Khurda district, which has industrial estates at Mancheswar, Chandaka, Infovalley and Bhangabanpur, as many as 196 units have closed down. In Cuttack, 377 industrial units have shut down over the years. Of the 30 districts in the state, Deogarh, Nabarangpur and Malkangiri have no industrial units. Despite this dismal scenario, industries minister Debi Prasad Mishra said: ""We are emerging as the most preferred industrial destination. We have received good response in our Make in Odisha campaign in Mumbai and Bangalore and the recently held event at Bhubaneswar. We are closely monitoring each proposal so that they come to fruition."" Mishra said that to attract the investors, the Odisha Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha (Idco) had set up a land bank and reserved acres for the upcoming industries in the state. The state government claimed 14 companies pledged to invest Rs 70,058 crore at the Mumbai conclave. The proposed investment is likely to come in the fields of electronics, food processing and renewable energy, petrochemicals, food processing, infrastructure development, gems and jewellery, speciality chemicals, sugar refinery, expansion and downstream alumina, alumina refinery, power and aluminium industries. In Bangalore, the state government claimed to have received proposals worth Rs 90,000 crore. At the Make in Odisha conclave in Bhubaneswar, the state government claimed it had received investment intents worth Rs 2.03 lakh crore. The state government has received investment proposals in 10 diversified sectors, the minister said. Mishra said: ""The state has so far signed 92 MoUs with a proposed investment of more than Rs 5.68 lakh crore, of which 46 industrial units have started their production partially with an investment of Rs 2.53 lakh crore."" While the big industries are yet to become a reality, several small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) are yet to take off. To make matters worse, as many as 15,315 small and medium scale industries have been closed down, said MSME minister Jogendra Behera quoting an all-India survey. Behera expressed his helplessness in reviving the sick MSME units stating that his department had a meagre budget of Rs 50 crore."

To ensure transparency in their functioning and to prevent malpractices, the state made it mandatory for societies to audit their accounts every year, by firms empanelled by it. It has also made it mandatory to hold elections of the management committee every three years. While these rules help check malpractices in cooperative sugar factories or banks, for housing societies, complying with so many rules is often difficult, legislators said.There are 22,000 housing societies in Mumbai and it is not possible for residents who are members to take out the time to comply with the governments rules. The state should consider diluting certain provisions, demanded Mumbai legislator Ashish Shelar.Shelar said there should be provisions so that the procedure of holding elections and auditing accounts becomes easier for housing societies.The government is also studying how to protect the interests of particular castes or religions who have come together to form cooperative housing societies, Deshmukh said, in response to a demand by Shelar. Shelar had pointed out the members of Christian and Parsi communities are under pressure to change their bylaws to allow people from other communities to become members in some parts of Mumbai.Following discussions, the Assembly passed the bill that has a provision to allow cost accountants to audit accounts of co-op bodies. The bill was passed to amend the section 81 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act 1960 under which every cooperative society has to audit its accounts at least once in the financial year and within four months from the end of the financial year.The accounts are supposed to be audited by an auditor or auditing firm from a panel prepared by the Registrar and approved by the state government. However, each auditor is not supposed to handle audits of more than twenty coop societies in a year. Since the number of empanelled auditors is not sufficient considering the vast number of cooperative societies in the state, the government has included cost accountants to the list of auditors, on the lines of similar provisions made by neighbouring Karnataka state.READ MOREMum-Nagpur Expressway: CM Fadnavis dream project in land-grab controversy"

Binge eating without exercise have made Hyderabadi women the most obese in the country. They have overtaken their counterparts in other Indian cities on the BMI index. These shocking stats came after the National Family Health Survey-4 of 766 households comprising 830 women, which revealed 47.9% Hyderabadi women were obese in the 14-49 age-group.Zainab, a city resident, weighed 165kg on her 24 th birthday before she opted for bariatric surgery at city-based hospital in March this year. She could hardly move and her mammoth weight and short stature made surgical intervention extremely difficult. Now, she weighs 95 kg. Not just Zainab, several women like her can't climb stairs, have high blood sugar levels, feel ashamed to socialize and are sinking into depression. Also, Hyderabadi women have beaten men on the obesity chart. Only 33.7% men surveyed in the city were found obese. Those with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kgm2 are termed overweight.According to NFHS survey, obesity among women in other cities stands at 40.7% in Kolkata, 34% in Mumbai, 33.6% in Chennai and 33.4% in Bengaluru.Dr P Arokiasamy of Mumbaibased International Institute for Population Sciences, which conducted NFHS-4, said lack of balanced nutrition, especially in micronutrients also contribute to high obesity in urban areas. ""Past health surveys showed improper nutrition was not only found among urban poor, but even among the well-off,'' he said.""Part of the blame can be pinned on easy access to junk food and sedentary lifestyle. Whether it's ordering tasty , but unhealthy food or getting a cab at one's doorstep without the need to walk, more and more women are falling victim to obesity,"" said Dr V Amar, chief consultant, metabolic & bariatric surgery, Continental Hospitals.In fact, women in all five top Indian cities (except Kolkata) were obese when compared to men, making weight gain a trend among the fairer sex. This is being attributed to higher concentration of body fat among women on a height-and-weight scale.Pointing out that fe male hormones and birth control pills can raise fat deposition in women, Dr Amar said, ""Total body fat is controlled by gut hormones. Overeating and lack of exercise can influence these hor mones and trigger high fat deposition. If there is genetic ten dency, this influence is even more.""Another trigger for over-eating is psychological. Depression and anxiety, affects many housewives, said Sujatha Stephen, chief nutritionist, Maxcure Hospitals, Hyderabad.The consequences are disastrous as obesity is a getaway to diseases like diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, lung disorders and early arthritis. What's worse, there are no effective medication to reduce weight.""We cannot modify genetic predisposition to obesity, but lifestyle changes, dieting and exercise can help reduce weight. Those morbidly obese can opt for bariatric surgery after conservative methods fail,"" said Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu, consultant physician, Apollo Hospital, Hyderguda."

The move is being pushed by the strong ethanol producers' lobby in the state, which will benefit the most from producing more ethanol to meet the increased target.TOI had earlier highlighted the issue of ethanol in petrol getting converted into water, and even the Vidarbha Petroleum Dealers Association (VPDA) had taken it up with the district administration after their complaints were ignored by the public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).MP and union minister Nitin Gadkari had then spoken of centre's plan to take the blending proportion up to 22.5% in the near future.The data available with VPDA shows that total ethanol blending percentage in petrol across the nation is less than 3%, even though the mandatory norm is 10%. This is attributed to the less availability of ethanol.""Around 10% ethanol is being blended in petrol throughout the state. Uttar Pradesh leads in sugar cane production. But Maharashtra leads in ethanol production. There are 61 ethanol producing units in the state and only 34 in UP. Some 96.37 crore litres of ethanol is produced in the state while the figure is 91.85 crore litres in UP. The ethanol producers, who had earlier pushed for raising blending percentage from 5 to 10%, are now pressing for increase up to 22.50%,"" VPDA office bearers told TOI.Selling ethanol to OMCs is very profitable since they are bound to purchase it at Rs 49.50/litre against a production cost of Rs 36.20/litre. Ethanol producers do not sell their production to chemical industries, which are clamouring for supply, because they pay a lower rate.In a question hour reply in Lok Sabha during the March budget session, OMC ethanol procurement was said to be 39.81 crore litres per year in the state. This is far less than the production in the state, which is 96.37 crore litres. Even if the blending percentage is increased to 22.50%, the requirement will rise to around 48.76 crore litres, which can be easily met from the state's production.Petroleum dealers, however, see this as a setback. The ethanol in petrol in underground tanks at petrol pumps is bound to convert into water due to various reasons, which will result in higher financial loss for dealers and consumers alike, they say.""After the blending percentage was upped from 5% to 10%, we received several complaints from consumers. As such, 22.50% blending of ethanol during rains can pose a major problem,"" said a dealer on condition of anonymity.VPDA has taken up the issue with the OMCs, and a meeting is scheduled on this issue in December-end."

In comparison, in the best performing block, Harsul in Nasik, 27.3 per cent suffer from malnutrition, down from 42.3 per cent in 2012.Just 24 hours before the report was presented, in reply to a calling attention motion moved on Thursday by 86 MLAs in the Assembly  citing around 8,000 child deaths due to malnutrition between April and August 2016  the State had claimed that its preventive approach on malnutrition is working.The report, titled Malnutrition Status in Tribal Belts, highlights shortcomings such as supply of grains infested with insects, worms and other contaminants to meal schemes, and children getting neither entitlements under the Public Distribution System (PDS), nor sufficient calories under the Supplementary Nutrition (SN) and Take-Home Ration (THR) schemes. Also, the report says, other contributing factors are poor health care facilities and constant migration. The report was prepared by the Rest of Maharashtra Legislative Development Board, and presented last week to Governor C.V. Rao. The Hindu has a copy.Senior officials told The Hindu the caloric requirement provided under both the SN and THR was questionable. In one such visit to a THR production unit, it was found care was not taken to clean grains before milling. Insects, small stones and unwanted material were found in the grains, the report says.The team found that food scarcity did not seem to be a contributing factor as much as poorly balanced diets. Except for carbohydrates and proteins, other food groups  milk and dairy products, fruit and vegetables, and fats and sugars  were missing from the diet. The Rs. 5.92 per child provision under the SN scheme was insufficient.THR food given to children was bitter / smelly / salty / raw / coarse. Even that was not given to deserving beneficiaries. Some ration was fed to livestock.Systemic faultsIn Nandurbar, PDS was irregular, delivered with two-month gaps, and the quota was not as per entitlement. Grain was of poor quality, and often sugar and kerosene were not delivered at all. In addition, the recipients were overcharged. Twenty per cent of families did not have ration cards, and many had to walk several kilometres to get their quota.Of the self-help groups (SHGs) surveyed, 63 SHGs received grains only once every three months during the five-month survey period (Jan 2016 to May 2016). In 44 Anganwadis Centres (AWCs), the team found either snacks were not served with meals or of poor quality and quantity. Also, 47 AWCs did not have toilets or had toilets in unusable condition.A silver liningOne area did show signs of improvement: health.There has been a dramatic increase in the use of health centres, regular counselling, increased awareness of pre-natal and ante-natal care, breast-feeding norms being followed, and immunisation schemes implemented. Kakarpati and Mungabri blocks, the worst-performing regions on other parameters  1.24 on AWC, 1.39 on THR, 1.50 on PDS, 1.67 on nutrition  scored a greatly improved health score of 2.63.Milind Thatte, member, Tribal Advisory Council of the Maharashtra Government, says, This report proves government is not facing up to the real problems to tackle tribal malnutrition; it is just looking to reduce the annual death count by trying to force feed tribal children artificial food under THR/SN schemes.."

The Nizam Sugar Factory requires 10 lakh tonnes of sugarcane for crushing. Now, only one lakh tonnes of sugarcane is available, the CM said.State will pay interest amount on crop loansWhen Congress MLA N Uttam Kumar gave instances of banks collecting interest on crop loan, which was waived by the state government, Rao gave an assurance that the interest collected by banks would be reimbursed by the government to the farmers."

Chandrasekhar Rao has announced that the State government was prepared to take over the Nizam Sugar Factory if farmers were willing to take up operation and maintenance of the factory.The government was prepared to spend on refurbishing the three units of the NSF before handing them over to farmers provided they were willing to take over the operations of the unit. We made sincere efforts to take over the unit and handover a fully refurbished industry to farmers. But farmers are not willing to take the responsibility, he said.Mr. Rao, who initially said it (taking over the NSF) was a closed chapter. He, however, said that the government was prepared to spend the amount required for taking it over and refurbishing it, if the farmers were willing to take over the operations after Congress member K. Jana Reddy said farmers were willing to take over the unit.The Chief Minister was participating in a debate on modernisation of agriculture, crop loan waiver and payment of input subsidy which came up as a short discussion in the Legislative Assembly . The Congress, however, staged a walk out from the Assembly alleging that the government had failed to give concrete assurances on the implementation of the promise made by the Chief Minister on reviving the unit. To repeated queries from the Congress about his assurance before the elections to take over the unit and revive it, the Chief Minister said the government was willing to constitute an all-party committee to work out modalities relating to the takeover, including the payment that should be made for the current owners. The all-party committee could interact with the sugarcane farmers under the NSF and convince them to revert to sugarcane cultivation for reviving the plant. He said the government was keen on handing over the operations to farmers as the revived unit should not pose financial problems if the government took over its maintenance. He explained that several farmers who hitherto supplied cane to NSF shifted to alternative crops after the unit was handed over to private parties by the erstwhile TDP government. He explained how his government had made efforts to convince farmers to take over the industry on the lines of the sugar units operated by farmers cooperatives in Maharashtra. A delegation of 400 farmers was sent to study the situation in Maharashtra, but it refused to accept the governments offer for taking it over. Reopening the factory alone does not suffice. The units would need raw material and that is why the government is keen on ensuring that operation and maintenance of the industry is taken over by the farmers, he said."

Though the state government was willing to foot the bill for overhauling all the machinery in the factories and hand them over to farmers, they (farmers) were not coming forward to form a cooperative to run the units, the chief minister said.Speaking in the legislative assembly during a discussion on agriculture, KCR said NSF units should be run by a farmers' society as in Maharashtra and if the farmers were ready to do so, the government was ready to settle the payments to the private operator and take over the sugar plants. He asked Congress leader K Jeevan Reddy to take lead on this issue.""For running the factory, about 10 lakh tonnes of sugarcane is required for crushing every season. But sugarcane growing has come down in the state and 95% of farmers in Bodhan have shifted to alternative crops,"" he said. He also recalled that he was the one who fought for farmers dependent on NSF and demanded that the factories should not be privatized. But due to various reasons, the factories were now locked out. The CM said as part of the effort to educate farmers on the possibility of forming a cooperative and running the NSF units, about 400 farmers were taken to Maharashtra to see how the farmers' societies there were running profitable sugar factories.On the issue of farm loan waiver scheme, Chandrasekhar Rao said the government would release the fourth and final instalment of loan waiver amount as per schedule next year. He said the government had always maintained that the loan waiver amounts would be released to the banks in four instalments. ""The government waived 16,500 crore in bank loans benefiting about 35 lakh farmers. If there are farmers facing problems with bankers, MLAs can bring these to the notice of finance and agriculture ministers who will sort out the issues,"" he said. He declared that the government would bear additional 100 crore to 200 crore towards interest on loans due from farmers to banks.With the state government not relenting for immediate payment of the fourth instalment to banks, the Congress walked out of the House in protest.Earlier, Congress leaders K Jana Reddy and N Uttam Kumar Reddy brought the plight of farmers in the state to the notice of the government.

The production and transportation cost of sugarcane has also increased. But, the state government has fixed a lower purchase price, Rs 1,700, this year. It has not kept its words of announcing the FRP at Rs 2,300.

The State has taken this stand despite the repeated demand by farmers to fix a higher price for sugarcane.The procurement price would include the fixed remunerative price (FRP) of Rs2,300 announced recently by the Centre, and the State Advisory Price (SAP) of Rs550 which includes Rs100 for transportation charges.However, the Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said that a panel, comprising of senior officials of the State, representatives of farmers and sugar mills, would be formed to suggest to the Government a sugarcane price which would be remunerative to farmers and facilitate an appropriate share in the profit netted by the sugar mills.This decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by OPS on Monday. In a statement here, OPS said the Central government had not hiked its FRP for sugarcane for the current crushing season. Further in neighbouring Karnataka, a majority of sugar mills were giving only Rs2,600 per tonne while many mills in Maharashtra were paying less - Rs2,475 a tonne.He also recalled that whenever the Centre hiked the sugarcane price, the State government fixed a higher State Advisory Price for sugarcane, keeping in mind the farmers welfare.To maximise the sugarcane production in the State, the Government is implementing various technologies such as sustainable sugarcane initiative, drip fertigation etc, Panneerselvam said, adding that he had directed officials to implement these measures fully.Meanwhile, in a statement here, the PMK founder S Ramadoss said the refusal to hike the sugarcane procurement price had betrayed the farmers in Tamil Nadu. While Uttar Pradesh government had fixed an SAP at Rs3,050, Haryana and Punjab too have announced a higher price for sugarcane. He said the Tamil Nadu should increase the SAP to Rs4,000 a tonne and to take immediate steps for payment of Rs1,659 crore dues from the sugar mills to farmers.Expressing shock, D Ravindran, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said the meagre procurement price had come at a time when farmers were expecting at least Rs4,000 a tonne. The members of the association would protest in front of sugar mills from January 3, demanding Rs4,000 a tonne as well as immediate disbursal of dues from the sugar mills, he added."

Despite the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harsh 40-day winter spell, there is a hubbub. Some are playing cricket, the rest looking on. Soldiers from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in mobile bunkers stand guard on the boundary wall; fingers locked on the trigger which, at the hint of any trouble, can spray pellets or tear gas. Three newly dug graves in the Martyrs Graveyard bear testimony to the violent and troubled times of 2016.Just metres away from the graveyard, Nousheen Baba and her sister Iqra Baba recall how they could not hold themselves back from watching the funeral procession of 12-year-old Junaid Ahmad on October 9. Security forces allegedly emptied an entire pellet cartridge from close range at Ahmad and the Valley exploded in anger and sadness at the loss of a young life. Do you know how it feels to stay cooped up inside your room for five months with shattered window panes reminding you of the constant presence of violence, asks Nousheen, a second-year science student of Government College for Women, Nawakadal and aspiring chartered accountant. The windows of the Baba household bore the brunt of the clashes which erupted between security forces and protesters.But Nousheen is eager to put the painful year behind her and even manages a shy smile. As a warren of houses in the highly congested Narwara locality in downtown Srinagar greets the eye, a tiny silhouette in a shiny grey cover makes its presence felt in the small courtyard of the Babas. Beneath the cover is the familys first motor-driven two-wheeler. Courtesy Iqra, a Bachelor of Commerce student at the same college her elder sister goes to, who was rewarded by the State government for securing 85 per cent marks in her Class XII exam. Its our first scooter in the family. We are all learning to drive it, says Iqras father Mushtaq Baba, a weaver. The Scooty is Nousheens constant companion too ever since Iqra brought it home nearly two months ago. From college to market, to visiting her friends, it is her lifeline to a future she dreams about.Dreams on wheelsIn the first phase of the two-wheeler scheme, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti handed over the keys to 450 scooters to graduation-level students of Government College for Women, Nawakadal and Government Womens College, Baramulla on November 6. Only meritorious students whose family income is under Rs.4 lakh per annum are eligible for the scheme, which is being extended to all degree colleges of the State. In Jammu, 300 scooters were handed over to eligible students.Mufti sees the Scooty as a game changer in improving the education of girl children who come from economically weaker sections. I have lived a common mans life and gone to college on a bus. I know the difficulties women face while using public transport. You feel it is safe sitting next to an old man, till he starts nudging you in the elbow; the unwelcome attention can be harrowing for any woman, says Mufti, explaining the rationale behind her scheme. She recalls a young woman she spotted riding a scooter in Srinagar earlier this year while on her way to the State Assembly. This girl was short and slim but it was her confidence that was striking. The idea took shape right there. We took the decision to bear 50 per cent of the cost of the bike, she says.The government has dovetailed many Central schemes meant for women empowerment to provide these scooters. I wish I had one and could ride it freely. A girl who owns a Scooty now will never have to request her brother or father to go places. The two-wheelers give women a sense of control of things, says the Chief Minister, adding, Women are the first casualty of violence. Investments must be made to empower women.Iqra, for one, feels empowered, never mind the taunts of the local boys as she drives past: The two-wheeler has earned me azadi (freedom) enough to go to tuitions late in the evening. Five km away from the Baba household, Nargis Rasool, the eldest of four sisters and a brother, borrowed money to avail the Scooty scheme. My father treats me like my brothers equal now since I started driving the Scooty. It is like taking part in a revolution. Though many elders did object to my driving saying how can a girl ride a Scooty on the street?, my parents supported me, says Nargis, a final-year Arts student of Government College for Women, Maulana Azad Road. Her 90-plus percentage in the Class XII exam helped this civil services aspirant to bring the first-ever vehicle to the Rasool household, a family of shawl weavers. Nargis has become an inspiration for the extended family, including six female cousins. Their parents are now forcing them to study hard to secure a Scooty on merit, she says.Reviving an old craftNamda, a carpet made through the process of felting by hand, needs both muscle and money. For Arifa Jan, 31, who completed in 2010 her Craft Management Entrepreneurs Leadership Programme from the Craft Development Institute, Srinagar, the challenge was to turn around the fortune of this dying craft at a time when exports of the once-world-famous Kashmiri carpet had plummeted. According to a government survey, the total production of handicrafts rose to Rs.1,614.59 crore by 2008 against Rs.200 crore in 1990-91 but Namda exports had gone down 97 per cent and amounted to less than Rs.40 lakh annually.The use of cancer-causing dyes and poor cotton mix pushed Namda to the verge of extinction, says Arifa. She infused science and healthy processes back into the craft to make it market-friendly. In 2010, she had to brave prolonged curfew spells to reach her unit to weave the first-ever assignment of 300 Namdas, meant for an exhibition in New Delhi by Dastkar, an NGO working with craftspeople across India.Eight-five per cent of my Namdas were sold. I still remember the taunts of a German buyer who kept saying we were producing fake Namdas, says Arifa, who credits an unknown buyer from Delhi for her first brush with success. The buyer later turned out to be Gulshan Nanda of the Crafts Council of India. Nanda reposed faith in Arifa and the money flowed. Ms. Nanda would come to me and ask serious questions about the craft, says Arifa.In 2013, the Crafts Council of India selected Arifa for a trip to Kyrgyzstan to study their processes of carpet-making. Back home, she scouted for an Australian merino sheep hybrid that was introduced in the Valley in the 1960s. Its wool is what goes into exquisite Namdas, she says.For the first time, Arifa introduced pre-processes to weed out hazardous particulates from the wool and ensured no cancer-causing dyes make their way into it. Even artisans whod make chain stitches on the carpet used to complain of chest pain earlier due to the use of synthetic ingredients, she says.The daughter of a retired State Road Transport Corporation employee, Arifa is now eyeing business opportunities in the U.S. even as her stable has expanded to 27 artisans, 17 of them women. I am rooted in Kashmiri art and culture. I want wages and artworks of women to shift to a competitive level. Artisans have suffered a lot in Kashmir  we have to bring them on a par with sellers, she says.Weaving a new formulaIts 4.30 p.m. The rolling wooden bobbins with multi-coloured fine threads and the neatly thrown over-and-under shuttles meant for woofs and warps are showing no signs of the days tiredness. Bollywood music from the 1980s breaks the monotony of the shuttles at work. Its the first loom in Kashmir where a woman is at the helm, and an attempt is underway to replicate the famous floating garden on Dal lake, Char Chinari, as a design relief from traditional motifs in Kani shawls, a fine handwoven mix of pashmina and shahtoosh wools. We have developed a new formula for shawls. No one can steal it. Its original and a major departure from the past. My work drives my clients to my loom  I have requests pending from many exporters, says Shaheena Akhtar, 31. Like Arifa, Shaheena, a resident of Srinagars Nowshera area, too comes from a humble weavers family, but in just five years, she is being credited with giving a new identity to the Kani shawl, picking up the States Best Entrepreneur award along the way three years ago.Shaheenas journey to finding acceptability in markets in Italy, Germany and Dubai has been anything but easy. Not everyone treats you as a daughter or a sister when you start something like a shawl business. My character was questioned because I used to meet officials. I struggled to have bank guarantors because my father was just a small-time weaver. It was not easy to raise money, she recalls.Following a training stint at the Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Pampore, in 2011, Shaheena was able to start with an initial investment of Rs.8 lakh. In a year she counted her first one lakh rupees in earnings. My father had never counted Rs.1 lakh at a time. I am good at counting money. But that Rs.1 lakh was something I could not count for a while. A girl from Kashmir, counting money, and all the men around looking in awe. A strange feeling seeped in, she recalls. As business grew, she enlisted her brothers help. Of the 18 workers at the loom, 12 are relatives. I am proud that in such a short span I have a turnover of Rs.1 crore, she says.Roh-i-Kashmir (Soul of Kashmir), Shaheenas company, has tie-ups with six major exporters for the 60-70 shawls her loom produces annually. My thrust is quality. My shawl sells for Rs.4.5 lakh in the international market for its intricate and exquisite work. It takes more than nine months and two labourers to finish one intricately woven Kani shawl, Shaheena adds.An English tea room in SrinagarHistorically, Kashmir has drawn its taste buds from Central Asia, including the famous kahwah (a traditional green tea preparation) and multi-cuisine wazwan . Roohi Nazki, a former employee with Tata Interactive Systems, is trying to get Kashmiris hooked on something very different: the tea room. Its been worth the effort, if increasing footfalls at her small joint, Chai Jai  modelled after tea rooms in England  are anything to go by.It was a solo holiday trip to England in 2013 that changed Roohis life and introduced her to the niceties of tea rooms. In the Cotswolds villages of south-central England she saw mirror images of the Kashmir Valley. Moving back to the Valley after living in Mumbai for 22 years, Roohis parents initially persuaded her to stay on in a corporate job, but she just knew what she wanted to do next.As one walks down the British-era manicured embankment of the Jhelum river in Srinagars Polo View area, Roohis little England, complete with castle-room interiors and cobblestone floors, is hard to miss in the age-old Mahatta Building.Launched in July this year, Roohi is reviving teas from bygone times like Daam Tyooth (a herbal tea), Bunafshan tea (flower tea), Qadri tea (a herbal tea with sugar mix), Nettle tea and Gulkand kahwah (mix of saffron and sun-dried rose petals). I have 28 varieties as of now and I am working on a collection of 200 varieties, she says.Small steps to giant stridesWhile it is too early to see these women as enduring successes, having a woman Chief Minister at the helm seems to have given a fresh impetus to a more inclusive society in a State which has primarily been in the news this year for its mind-numbing violence. A slew of measures initiated by Chief Minister Mufti  including reservation of 10 per cent land in industrial estates for women entrepreneurs, the Ladli Beti scheme aimed at the economically poor, an all-woman entrepreneurs market, all-woman buses and all-woman police stations  are aimed at women.The opposition National Conference spokesperson Sarah Hayat Shah acknowledges that every step towards empowerment of women is always appreciable, but simultaneously points out the troubled ground reality in Kashmir where even young girls have been killed or blinded in the wave of protests since July. I am afraid the scooters may not be able to heal the wounds, she says.Ultimately, beyond the overhang of violence, a lot of the contestations with patriarchy are essentially atomic. Every time I watch a fisherwoman of Srinagar, I can see her making her own rules as she negotiates her space and life, says Roohi, now in her 40s.Just like she fights her own little everyday battles, such as taking trolls  who were outraged at her bringing a feel of Christmas to Chai Jai with cakes and candies from Mumbai  off her Twitter feed, one resolute click at a time.I am rooted in Kashmiri art and culture. I want wagesand artworks of women to shift to a competitive level.Arifa Jan, 31Owner, carpet manufacturing unitpHoto: V. V.

58d7a04da3d24b75f276d84d,Calorie is new MRP for packaged food,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Calorie-is-new-MRP-for-packaged-food/articleshow/56264147.cms,2016-12-31,"MUMBAI: As consumers become more mindful about what they eat, 'calorie' count is the new 'MRP' for packaged food products. Traditionally, nutritional information is printed on the back of a product pack, while MRP (maximum retail price) is used as the unique selling proposition for the price-sensitive consumer.Now, to engage with the new-age, calorie conscious consumer, marketers are turning conventional wisdom on its head and displaying nutritional information on front of the pack. Some players are highlighting low calorie count to promote products.For instance, take the packaging of recently launched Kosh oats. It is designed in such a manner that back of the pack with nutritional information is actually the front side, while MRP appears on the reverse side. On the other hand, the new Coca-Cola pop can advertisement highlights 'less than 100 calories ' prominently to grab the attention of cognizant consumers.Devendra Chawla, group president  food FMCG , Future Group, said: ""When consumers interested in health, pick up a pack of food product, they turn to back of the pack first to get vital information regarding calories and nutrients. We have applied this insight to launch Kosh oats, where such key information is highlighted in bold on front of the pack. Price is not as boldly displayed. Today, calories and other nutritional information are the new denomination for a set of consumers,"" said Chawla.The decision on Kosh's packaging is no doubt risky, but Chawla believes it's going to change the way India eats. The sales target for Kosh is Rs 75-80 crore for the first year.The trend could become more pronounced in impulse-driven categories, triggering innovation. In a global announcement, Swiss foods and drinks multinational, Nestle spoke about a scientific breakthrough of nearly halving sugar content in its chocolate, while keeping the taste intact. As and when Nestle launches this product, calories could, in all probability, be the selling point.According to Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India, calories are just one manifestation of the 'nutritional value' of a product. Since the consumers today are keen to know what ""goes into"" their products, Narayanan said, declarations must include clear and simple indications on amount of energy (calories), protein, carbohydrates, fat, sugar and other important nutrients that the product provides, like fibre, vitamins and minerals. ""Consumers today look for transparent information on packs or via other modes like QR codes or company websites, which helps them in choosing food on basis of their nutritional need. The days when MRP and price points were almost sole vectors of consumer choice are fast fading away to an era where soul of the brand is taking primacy,"" said Narayanan.Food products, which were hitherto marketed by highlighting the price among other 4Ps (product, price, place and promotion) of marketing, are now being sold on the basis of their nutritional value including calorie counts. Lower the calories, better the prospects of a brand to gain consumer acceptance.Cutting calories in soft drinks is also a challenge faced by cola drink majors, as they witness consumers shifting to healthier alternatives. The Coca-Cola pop can ad is just a case in point. Going forward, more ads pivoted around calorific information cannot be ruled out."
