Protests from the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Dalits and Muslims became more vociferous. Devendra Fadnavis was under constant covert scrutiny as only the second Brahmin CM of Maharashtra.The resignation of a senior minister and the imprisonment of a former minister on corruption charges triggered loud voices of protests that drowned questions whether the graft allegations were valid.All in all, the year that went by brought to the fore the fissures in Maharashtras social and political fabric.This one year has set Maharashtra back by at least 50 years as far as social reform goes, says Surendra Jondhale, head of Mumbai Universitys department of civic and politics. Elaborating, he pointed out that Maharashtras social leaders always used to critique their own communities even as they strove for development. But this time, communities chose to press their demands by targeting each other. It is a great setback to Maharashtras legacy, Jondhale said.The fault lines could further deepen and widen in 2017 as political parties ratchet up social tensions further ahead of polls to major municipal corporations and zilla parishads.The Maratha protests, though without party affiliation on the surface, drew massive support from Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) heavyweights wary of losing their votebank to the BJP.The protests were for reservation in government jobs and education and changes to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which sections of Marathas felt was being misused to target them. But, with Maratha politicians across parties showing solidarity, the protests also came to be seen as a response to the perceived sidelining of the community in decision-making and power structures. Some pointed to the BJP-led governments systematic attempt to break down existing power structures of cooperative banks and sugar cooperatives. Others to the dwindling political representation of the Maratha community, comprising 32 percent of the states population, in the government, with a Brahmin chief minister and less than 50 per cent of the cabinet comprising Maratha leaders, against the historical average of 60 per cent.Moving to the OBCs, the resignation of Eknath Khadse as revenue minister for alleged irregularities in the purchase of a Pune plot was painted by some within the BJP itself as a move against the coomunity. Khadse, mentored by the late BJP stalwart Gopinath Munde, was from the Leva Patil community and one of the BJP leaders in the state with a mass base, especially in North Maharashtra.After Mundes death, though his daughter Pankaja is in politics and in the government, the mantle of OBC leadership among senior leaders was passed on to Khadse. Some of us were definitely worried about the caste ramifications of his resignation, a senior BJP leader said.The social polarisation got graver as members of the Dalit and OBC communities joined hands to protest too, insisting that their share of reservation should not be touched while accommodating the Marathas demands.As the OBCs consolidated, several such protests turned into a show of strength in support of jailed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Chhagan Bhujbal, an OBC leader, with Mundes supporters also walking along. They alleged that Bhujbal was imprisoned on trumped-up charges and this would never have happened if Munde had been alive.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen too jumped into the fray, joining the Dalits and OBCs, and demanded that the government work towards setting aside quotas for Muslims if it can consider the same for Marathas.Besides political machinations, adding to the social tensions was the agrarian crisis in Marathwada, parts of Vidarbha and Khandesh that deepened in 2016, first with a dry spell and then excessive rain, causing massive crop losses and ballooning debts. It was instrumental in pushing the distressed farmers and agricultural labourers, many from the Maratha community in Marathwada, to pour their anguish on the streets.Senior Congress leader Manikrao Thakre said, The farmer was the biggest political victim of 2016. Just coming out of a drought, he had to face losses from excessive rainfall and then plummeting prices of his produce due to demonetisation.By the end of the year, however, Fadnavis and the BJP had managed to navigate through these fraught situations, including constant pinpricks from ally Shiv Sena, and emerge clear leader in municipal council polls across the state. The Shiv Senas MP Sanjay Raut, has, however, that alleged misuse of administrative resources was behind the BJPs success.Matters look set to remain fraught in the coming year as 10 major municipal corporations, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Nagpur, and zilla parishads and panchayat samitis in more than 20 districts go to polls. The impact of the social polarisation will play out more clearly in rural elections, and we will have to wait and watch how it alters the political scenario in Maharashtra, Jondhale said.READ MOREUddhavs reply to CM jibe: BMC among cleanest civic bodies in IndiaMaharashtra govt to get its hawker policy ready before pollsWhat 2017 means for parties in Maharashtra"

What has happened is unfortunate.... what he (Parameshwara) said is harsh reality, he added. Azmi thus came out in support of Parameshwara, who reportedly said: We had deployed 1,500 police personnel in the area for New Years Eve celebrations. Such incidents do happen on New Years Day and on Christmas. We take a lot of precautions.Azmi, whose businessman-hotelier son Farhan is married to actress Ayesha Takia, said that he stands by his views and what he can do is only advise so that such incidents do not recur. You have to keep petrol away from fire. And if there is sugar, ants will come automatically to it,"" said Azmi, following which there was widespread condemnation.In today's world, the more scantily she is dressed, the more modern and educated she is considered. Such a trend is gaining ground. Western culture is a black spot on the country's culture and it should be stopped. And we need to focus on our famous Indian culture, he said and advocated burqa and purdah.If my sister or women from the family go out after sunset with a boy to celebrate New Year, we cannot expect people to behave with her in a respectable manner. I am sure several people would be disappointed with my remarks but I don't care....what I am saying is that no police (force) in the world can stop such incidents (fully)...ladies need to be properly dressed, he said.Azmi made similar comments in 2014: Women should not venture out with men who are not relatives...what is the need for roaming at night with men who are not relatives? This should be stopped..."

ExpressA 20-day long foot-march by farmers under the banner of Khedut Samaj Gujarat (KSG) concluded Monday near Tarapur village on the outskirts of the state capital after police stopped them from entering the city owing to preparations of Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit. A mamlatdar received their memorandum and assured them to arrange an appointment with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in the coming days.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe march named as Khedut Vedna Yatra (aimed at highlighting farmers distress in Gujarat) covered around 450 km, passing through six districts  Gir-Somnath, Junagadh, Rajkot, Botad, Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. The foot-march was spearheaded by general secretary of KSG Sagar Rabari.In its memorandum, the organisation made 25 demands before the Chief Minister, seeking to redress the issues at the earliest.One of the major demands raised by the farmers body was to waive off all loans to farmers and declare a date for disbursal of 100 per cent amount of crop insurance. It has also demanded that each farmer should get Rs 50,000 financial aid per acre.Other demands of KSG included announcement of an Agriculture Policy, 100 per cent increase in the minimum support prices of crops, cancellation of all changes made to the Gujarat Agriculture Land Ceiling Act and law for land acquisition, immediate stopping of land acquisitions related to Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and related projects, a white paper on the status of Kalpsar project, re-commanding all de-commanded areas from various irrigation projects including Narmada, no land acquisition for polluting industries, 24-hour power for farmers and waiving the tax being levied on the sale of sugarcane.The farmers also demanded that since vegetable farmers and horticulturists have faced a lot loss owing to the demonetisation decision of the Centre, a neutral team be formed to assess their loss and accordingly a package be announced for them. They have also demanded the government to make provision so that the village gauchar land was not given for any purpose.Speaking with The Indian Express, Rabari said, In last five years due to natural calamities, scarce rain and lower price-band of agriculture produce, agriculture sector in Gujarat is on the verge of collapse. In India, Gujarat comes 12th in terms of per hectare food production and the major reason for it is lack of irrigation facilities.We carried the foot march and have been given an assurance that a meeting with the Chief Minister will be fixed in some days. If, we do not get a sincere redressal of farmers issues then will give a call to farmers across the state not to vote for BJP in the Assembly elections, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The bureau will scrap the use of wood-based paper made out of tree pulp for printing textbooks.A professor from Nagpur, Arvind Sovani, had filed a petition in the high court in October stating that the pulp paper used by Balbharati to publish textbooks was not eco-friendly and that they should be using more eco-friendly ways of printing text books.The court ordered Balbharati in November to stop the tender process and issue a fresh one for environment-friendly paper.Based on this court order, Balbharati decided to use agro-waste based pulp to make paper for printing nearly 10 crore text books. Sunil Magar , director of Balbharati stated, ""We have issued an all-India level tender to procure agro-waste based pulp paper. Textbooks, including the cover page of every book, will be printed using this paper following court orders.""Magar added that the bureau requires 30,000 tonnes of paper every year to print the textbooks. Balbharati has so far been using 'virgin pulp paper' for printing textbooks and Sovani, in his petition, stated that this paper was hazardous to the environment and not eco-friendly since it required cutting of trees.Considering the number of textbooks printed every year by Balbharati and the virgin paper used for printing, there was a lot of damage done to environment, Sovani said in the petition. Magar said, ""We would be using the agro-waste based paper from wheat and sugar cane waste from the 2017-18 academic year itself.""Currently, the books are available in eight languages  Marathi, English, Hindi, Urdu, Kannada, Telugu, Sindhi and Gujarati."

58e542dd7be9e05a951f6b2f,Cane scarcity sours sugar mill mood,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170104/jsp/business/story_128388.jsp,2017-01-04,"New Delhi, Jan. 3: Over two dozen sugar mills in Maharashtra have stopped crushing cane following back-to-back droughts. Also, a majority of 147 mills in the country's leading producer are likely to shut down by the end of March, which can impact the price of the sweetener this year.Sugar mills in the state operate between November and April. But this year, cane supplies have fallen because of the droughts. Of the 147 mills which started operating this year, 25 have stopped crushing by the end of December, Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) said.Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara form Maharashtra's main sugar belt. Most of the mills in these regions will continue to operate till the end of March. The mills in Pune and Ahmednagar are likely to operate till February, Isma said.The country produced 8.09 million tonnes (mt) of the sweetener between October and December, 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier.Overall production of India - the world's second-largest producer and the biggest consumer - is pegged at 22.5mt in the 2016-17 sugar year (October-September), lower than 25.1mt a year ago.There was a big fall in the sugar offtake in the first quarter of 2016-17 marketing year because of a cash crunch after demonetisation, ISMA said.""There has been a demand destruction of almost five lakh tonnes of sugar. Offtake during October-December has, therefore, been significantly lower than last year.""On prices, ISMA said ex-mill rates had started improving and the rates were just enough to cover the cost of production."
5903fbdc7be9e02646bda651,Call centres swindling Americans,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/589844/call-centres-swindling-americans.html,2017-01-04,"Ellen Barry Jan 05 , 2017, International New York Times 0:04 ISTSince 2013, Americans - many of them recent immigrants - have lost $100 millionBetsy Broder, who tracks international fraud at the Federal Trade Commission, was in her office in Washington last summer when she got a call from two Indian teenagers. Calling from a high-rise building in a suburb of Mumbai, they told her, in tones that were alternately earnest and melodramatic, that they wanted to share the details of a sprawling criminal operation targeting Americans. Broder, who was no stranger to whistleblowers, pressed the young men for details.He said his name was Adam, she said, referring to one of the pair. I said, Your name is not Adam. What does your grandmother call you? He said, Babu.' Babu was Jayesh Dubey, a skinny 19-year-old with hair gelled into vertical bristles, a little like a chimney brush. He told her that he was working in a seven-story building and that everyone there was engaged in the same activity: impersonating IRS officials and threatening Americans, demanding immediate payment to cover back taxes.If they reached a person who was sufficiently terrified or gullible  this was known in the business as a sale  they would instruct that person to buy thousands of dollars worth of iTunes cards to avoid prosecution, they said; the most rattled among them complied. The victim would then send the codes from the iTunes cards to the swindlers, giving them access to the money on the card.As it happened, the US government had been tracking this India-based scheme since 2013, a period during which Americans, many of them recent immigrants, have lost $100 million to it. Though India had no reputation as a large-scale exporter of fraud in the past, it is now seen as a major centre for cyberfraud, said Suhel Daud, an FBI agent who serves as assistant legal attach at the embassy in New Delhi.Several trends have converged to make this happen, he said: a demographic bulge of computer-savvy, young, English-speaking job seekers; a vast call-centre culture; super-efficient technology; and what can only be described as ingenuity. They have figured all of this out, Daud said. Put all of these together, with the Indian demographics in the US, and its a natural segue. Whatever money youre making, you can easily make 10 times as much.Pawan Poojary and Jayesh Dubey, best friends and college dropouts, were impressed with the Phoenix 007 call centre in Thane, a suburb northeast of Mumbai. The monthly salary was average for call centres, Rs 16,000, they said, but the bonuses were double or triple that, based on sales. The two friends had been playing a video game for up to eight hours a day, pausing occasionally to eat.At that time, in my mind is that I want money, Poojary, 18, said. Thats it. I want money. Thats why. They said they showed up for training in a room of young Indians like themselves, the first in their family to be educated in English. They were a slice of aspirational India: Poojarys father, who owned two welding shops, was adamant that his son would rise to a higher place in society, an office job. Poojary was afraid to tell him he had dropped out of college.The trainer assigned them names, Paul Edward and Adam Williams, and handed out a six-page script that started out, My name is Shawn Anderson, with the department of legal affairs with the United States Treasury Department, the teenagers said. We read the script, and I asked, Is this a scam?' Poojary said. He said, Yes. At that time I am money-minded. I thought, OK, I can do this, he said.Inaben Desai, of Sugar Land, Texas, came home from grocery shopping, and her mother handed her the phone, eyes wide with alarm. Someone was on the line from the government, her mother said. They had called three or four times while she was out. Desai, 56, worked as a cashier at Wal-Mart.When she picked up the phone, a gruff-voiced man told her that she had failed to pay fees when she got her US citizenship, in 1995, and that unless she did so she would be deported back to India, she said. When Desai said she needed to call her husband, a woman got on the phone, speaking sympathetically, in her native Gujarati.She said, If you involve your husband, theres going to be more problems,' Desai said. 'Your husband is going to get in trouble, too. Dont involve your husband.' Desai had begun to cry. Still on the line with the woman, she took all the cash she had on hand and drove to a nearby grocery store, where she bought $1,386 in prepaid debit cards. Then the woman instructed her to go to her bank, transfer close to $9,000 to the account of someone named Jennifer, in California, and then fax confirmation and confidential details about her account.Accessing personal infoThe bank lady tried to stop me, and she said, This is your personal information,' Desai said. But Im scared, and I faxed it to them because Im scared of what would happen to my family. The swindlers, who now had access to her bank balance, called back to demand another sum close to $9,000. Desai had to drive to another bank branch to make the transaction. The total amount she transferred, $17,786, was nearly all her savings.Poojary was not the person who called Desai, whose case dates to 2014. But a similar conversation prompted him to contact the US government. He recalled the womans name as Regella, and said that when she begged him to give her a little time, Poojary felt so sorry for her that he went to his supervisor, who told him to push harder. I just feel guilty at that time, he said. We are also Indians. We also dont have money. They also dont have money.The so-called Mira Road scam, named for the buildings neighbourhood, had moved into a single floor of the seven-story high-rise in early 2016. By summer it filled the whole building. Nitin Thakare, a senior police inspector at the crime branch in Thane, will not say much about the person who contacted him in September with a tip about Mira Road.But he will describe the raid, in loving, cinematic detail: How at 10 pm, after the last of the call centre staff had arrived for the night shift, 200 police officers streamed up the main staircase, blocking every exit and detaining all 700 people who worked inside.The officers interviewed and released 630 of the call-centre workers, arresting the 70 highest-ranking employees. What they had stumbled on, it became clear, was a branch of a much larger network, the police said. Five days later, the police organised a second raid, of facilities in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, which they believed to be a nerve centre. The US Justice Department had come to the same conclusion: It has since released an indictment tracing 1.8 million calls targeting US residents to five call centres in Ahmedabad that used various schemes to defraud more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars.By the time the police arrived at the Ahmedabad location, though, the syndicate was gone. The place where we raided, it was a thousand-seat call centre, Manere said. When we got there it was empty. Empty. Nothing. Not a piece of paper. Empty halls. Empty halls."

The State could end up with production of around 4.5 million tonnes,"" B.B. Thombre, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA) told Reuters on Thursday.The WISMA was earlier expecting the country to produce 23 million tonnes of sugar in the 2016/17 crushing season that started on Oct. 1, anticipating Maharashtra will churn out 5.5 million tonnes.As Maharashtra's output has been revised down, the country's total production could fall to 22 million tonnes, Thombre said.Maharashtra had produced 8.41 million tonnes of sugar in the 2015/16 season, while India's total output was 25.1 million tonnes.Sugar mills in Maharashtra typically operate between November to April, but this year so far 25 mills have stopped crushing due to lower cane supplies.""Some sugar mills have already closed operations due to cane shortage and most mills will close operations by February end,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, on Wednesday.Local sugar prices are moving up on an expected shortfall in output and could prompt the government to allow duty free imports of the sweetener, a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm said on Wednesday.""Ahead of state elections the government will try to keep a lid on prices. Right now it is more interested in protecting consumers than farmers,"" the dealer said.India's election commission on Wednesday scheduled five state polls for the next two months that will test support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's gamble to abolish high-denomination banknotes."

Presently I am taking a legal opinion in this matter. I am mentally prepared to file a criminal and civil case against him. He himself has given me this opportunity. Earlier, he had alleged that the scam was worth Rs. 15,000 crore and now he says it is worth Rs. 25,000 crore. I do not know how, as I am not so good at mathematics, Mr. Pawar said at a press conference in Thane, held at the residence of NCP MLA Dr. Jitendra Awhad. Mr. Pawars stand comes ahead of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) polls.Mr. Hazare has approached the Bombay High Court claiming the scam has pulled Maharashtra back by 50 years and has put the State under financial debt to the tune of hundreds of crores. The criminal petition is likely to be heard on January 6.Condemning the recent incident in Pune in which the statue of legendary Marathi author Ram Ganesh Gadkari alias Govindagraj was damaged, Mr Pawar said no one would support such an act. Gadkari has made tremendous contribution to Marathi literature. I have never come across any objectionable writing by him on Chhatrapati Sambhaji and neither do I know of it. However, whoever wants to oppose someones thinking should do it by rational arguments and not by vandalism, Mr. Pawar said.Taunting BJP ally Shiv Sena for its continuous stand of opposing the governments policies, Mr. Pawar said both parties are together for the sake of power. The Opposition will take a united stand on whether to ask the President to stop the Central government from presenting the Union Budget.

I am at present consulting my lawyer and will file both criminal and defamation suits against him. I dont know from where he got the figure of Rs25,000 crore. Hazare, though a social worker, cannot defame anyone and everyone.The petitions alleged that the fraud had been committed in governance by first burdening sugar cooperative factories with debts and thereafter selling these sick units at a throwaway price, causing loss of Rs25,000 crore to the government, cooperative sector and people.Pawar clarified, In all the cases, tenders were floated as per the procedure several times. Moreover, the alleged scam took place when I was a minister at the Centre and not connected to decisions taken by the state goovernment.Pawar also said there was no need to spend Rs3,600 crore on the Shivaji memorial. We are not questioning the greatness of Shivaji, though there was no need to spend so much money on a third statue. He added it was his government who had approved the statue but could not compete it due to a lower budget.Gujarat pattern of budget announcementWith the announcement of elections in five states, the question of violation of code of conduct guidelines by declaring Union Budget has cropped up. Pawar said, The Budget will anyways be over in four to five days from January 31 to first week of February. In our time, Budget discussions and approvals used to take a minimum of 22 days. I have heard it merely takes three to four days in Gujarat and I can see the same pattern replicated in the Budget.On Shiv SenaSeconding Uddhav Thackerays views against releasing Budget amidst elections, Pawar said a decision whether to join hands with the Shiv Sena on the issue will be taken after a discussion with his party members. Thackeray said the opposition should come along with the Sena to demand a cancellation of the budget as it may influence voters. Pawar said, Uddhavs statement reflects that our opposition is agreeing with our way of thinking. The Sena and BJP have come together only for power.On demonetisationPawar claimed that although the Centre has performed the surgery, the after-care was botched up. Fifty days are over but there is no change in the situation. Farmers have stopped getting loans as the co-operative banks have suffered. The real estate is affected. The growth of various sectors is affected due to demonetisation which will also affect our GDP.ReadDemonetisation failed to check black money, rural economy collapsed, says Pawar"

It is a condition in which, the pancreas, an organ located near the stomach, does not produce enough insulin, leading to uncontrolled sugar levels in the body.Although Gandhi recovered in a couple of days, he said that over the years, the ordeal of daily insulin jabs, blurry vision and weight gain has been a traumatizing experience. What is surprising is that I have no family history of diabetes. My condition continued to deteriorate after going into coma, said Gandhi.He added, My body was retaining excess water and my weight increased from the usual 82 kilogram to 105 kilogram.While Gandhi was put on dialysis, the doctors treating him said that over the years, the diabetes had let to the failure of both his kidneys. The sugar level in his blood fluctuated uncontrollably which damaged his kidneys. It also led to retinopathy which made his vision blurry, said Dr Bharat Shah, consultant nephrologist, Global Hospital, Parel. His mother turned out to be a match and donated one of her kidneys, added the doctor.Gandhi underwent a kidney transplant on December 26, and was registered for pancreatic transplant two weeks before that. Doctors said that in his case, a pancreatic transplant is required urgently to prevent damage to his new kidney.In type one diabetes patients, a pancreatic transplant is required along with the kidney transplant. The new pancreas will produce insulin immediately and will control his sugar levels. With this, the complications related to diabetes will be solved, said Dr Somnath Chattopadhyay, consultant, hepato pancreato biliary and transplant surgery. He added that so far, only one such transplant has been done in Maharashtra.While there have been donations in the last two weeks, the doctors have not found a suitable organ yet. On December 22, we received the pancreas of a brain-dead patient for a transplant. But, on further examination, the organ was found unfit for the procedure, the doctor added.Meanwhile, as Gandhi recuperates in the Intensive Care Unit at Global Hospital, Parel, he prays that he finds a donor soon. Every day, I wait for one call, telling me that there is a donor available, he said.READ MOREWhy Mumbai, Delhi dont have a healthy rate of heart transplants"

This year, 32 mills have not commenced crushing due to paucity of cane, among other issues.In anticipation of increased cane area for 2017-18, the state government plans to take steps to restart the sugar mills that have ceased operations. State Cooperation Minister Subhash Deshmukh announced the decision, adding that the government will extend all necessary help to speed up the process.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeshmukh, speaking to The Indian Express, said the decision was taken to avoid collection of unharvested cane in the fields. Due to the drought last year, cane area across Maharashtra had seen a sharp dip with only 6.33 lakh hectares of farm land reporting cultivation. Good monsoons and successful water retention schemes under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan in various parts of the state will see an increase in cane area for the crushing season of 2017-18. It is expected that the cane area for the next season will be around 10 lakh hectare and a bumper crop of cane is expected.It has been observed that in many cases, due to shortage of mills, cane remains unharvested. To avoid this, non-operational mills in those areas will be restarted, he said, adding that a preliminary survey to identify such mills has already started.The state will explore all possible means to help interested parties in running the mills. We are drawing up a detailed plan and will seek bidders for the mills, he said. The state government is ready to bear the working capital, if needed. Defunct mills in Marathwada, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Pune districts are being checked for the purpose.This year, 32 mills have not commenced crushing due to paucity of cane, among other issues.The governments decision comes at a time when the sugar sector in the state is reeling under cumulative effect of low prices and under-utilisation of their capacities. Several mills fear that their accounts with various banks will be deemed as a Non-performing asset (NPA) and it would be difficult to start operations next year. Estimates by the millers show that about 60 per cent of the mills might not be able to start operations.A delegation of the millers, led by former Union Minister Sharad Pawar, had met Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely on Tuesday to press for the restructuring of repayment of various loans levied on them. Deshmukh said the chief minister is likely to meet the finance minister to discuss the matter.As of December 31, 82 per cent of fair and remunerative price (FRP) have been paid in the state.

Cyclic nature of the business has resulted in sugar sales being affected across the supply chain, which leads straight to the sugar mills.

He also claimed that the move put the state under a debt of over Rs1 lakh crore.According to the PIL, most of the CSFs  31 of the 47 have been sold by the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank. In 2011, the Reserve Bank of India scrapped the board of directors of the MSC bank, and appointed two administrators. The move came after the bank in 2009-10 reported net loss of Rs 775.98 crore and bad loans of over Rs 500 crore  about 30 % of its total advances, and the net worth of the bank had gone below zero - at minus Rs140 crores.Thereafter, the Commissioner for Cooperation had appointed a senior official to enquire into the affairs of the bank and enquiry officer in his report of January 2014 concluded that the sale of the CSFs was illegal, causing losses of about Rs2,000 crore to the bank. Besides, 77 directors of the bank are facing charges of misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 1,076 crores, stated the PIL.Anna has alleged that all the strings were pulled by Shri Sharad Pawar, who was holding the portfolio of the Union agricultural minister at Centre at the relevant time and also the ex-officio chairman of Vasantdada Sugar Institute. His PIL further alleges that most of the sugar factories have been sold to the associates of Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar, the then deputy chief minister, has purportedly played a role in his capacity as the then chairman of Pune District Central Cooperative Bank and as director of the MSC bank.Read more: Sugar scam: Sharad Pawar to file suit against Anna Hazare"

(Below) A woman entrepreneur displays her implements to fashion rolling pins. Express Photo Kavitha Iyer. (File)FOR SNEHA Devgirikar and women running the 59 other stalls at the Mann Deshi Mahila Festival for rural women entrepreneurs, demonetisation is no longer a hurdle. Ever since she took her first loan of Rs 12,000 from the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, nearly a decade ago, to launch her business selling homemade papads, Sneha has learnt to upgrade her skill set at every milestone. The Satara resident had in six or seven years learnt how to market her business, burnish her brand called Renuka Masalas, package her organic products so that they appeal to urban consumers and more.So, when Mann Deshi Foundation decided to move its annual festival, showcasing farm produce and rural women entrepreneurs products from Satara to Mumbai for the first time, Sneha and the others simply got acquainted with the mobile wallet technology and downloaded the apps necessary.In Prabhadevis Rabindra Natya Mandir, each one of the 60 stalls selling farm produce  ranging from bajra, jowar and millet to freshly-handcarved wooden rolling pins and homemade pickles  comes with a story not unlike Snehas. Every stall is run by a woman who has built assets by developing her potential as an entrepreneur and a leader. All these women are associated with the Mann Deshi Foundation, which is headquartered in Mhaswad, Satara, and had been active in the drought-hit district since 1996.Vanita Pise, 42, a resident of Mhaswad, never completed her Class X. Chaperoning her daughter and daughter-in-law at her stall where shes selling organic moong and flour, Vanita talks confidently about the drought, market fluctuations and the dipping demand that affects her multiple businesses. She further explains how a drought year hits farm economy and how she had tried to focus her business ideas on areas that are not water dependent.I had been in touch with the Mann Deshi Foundation since 2003, when I started small savings in a bachat gat. Through my association with the women at the foundation, I started a business making paper cups. I bought a machine and started making cups, working hard to make sure not to let loadshedding hours affect my output, she said. The idea of a paper cup-making machine came from the foundation as did the training in marketing and sales, but Vanita added to it her own chain of raw material suppliers and the buyers of her finished products, along the way employing women who she paid weekly. I also managed to give employment to one young girl, who was disabled, she added.Vanita is now a director of the board of the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, and though she never completed her matriculation, she made sure her children get the best education she could afford. Even as she expanded her business to also make premium paper plates, she saw one daughter complete her MCA degree while the younger girl is studying to be a civil engineer.That sense of empowerment alongside willingness to work hard and beat the odds is common among all our women, says Vanita Shinde of the foundation. And so, at the exhibition is Sanjana Salunkhe, who grows sugarcane in a small three-acre patch of land. She cut the cane herself and had it loaded into a tempo to bring to the exhibition where shes selling freshly-crushed sugarcane juice in disposable tumblers.Also at the exhibition is Kantabai Salunkhe, one of the first women to have approached the founders in the mid-1990s, complaining that banks denied her a applications for loan because, at her daily savings rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3, she was just not an affordable customer for any nationalised bank.Chetna Sinha, 58, the founder of Mann Deshi Foundation, is thrilled at the success of their first attempt to bring their annual exhibition to Mumbai. Even though there are only 60 stalls here, compared to the much larger 200-plus stalls and exhibition grounds in Satara city, business is booming at each of these stalls. There is still work to be done and improved upon, she says. For one, access to credit for rural women remains an area that needs sustained research by banking institutions. Mann Deshi offers a model, but there is still so much to understand about a range of possibilities between microfinance and the Mudra loans for micro units.Theres one more thing Sinha believes is the need of the hour. More promotion and more recognition for men and families who really support women entrepreneurs, without that, this movement will find it difficult to move forward. The Mann Deshi exhibition by rural entrepreneurs concludes on Sunday at Ravindra Natya Mandir, Prabhadevi; 9.30 am to 8 pm)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangavikar, the social activist has alleged that the cooperative sugar factor scam has engulfed Maharashtra and pushed the state back by at least 50 years by causing loss of over Rs10,000 crore to the state exchequer. He also claimed that the move put the state under a debt of over Rs1 lakh crore.According to the PIL, most of the CSFs  31 of the 47 have been sold by the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank. In 2011, the Reserve Bank of India scrapped the board of directors of the MSC bank, and appointed two administrators. The move came after the bank in 2009-10 reported net loss of Rs 775.98 crore and bad loans of over Rs 500 crore  about 30 % of its total advances, and the net worth of the bank had gone below zero - at minus Rs140 crores.Thereafter, the Commissioner for Cooperation had appointed a senior official to enquire into the affairs of the bank and enquiry officer in his report of January 2014 concluded that the sale of the CSFs was illegal, causing losses of about Rs2,000 crore to the bank. Besides, 77 directors of the bank are facing charges of misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 1,076 crores, stated the PIL.Anna has alleged that all the strings were pulled by Shri Sharad Pawar, who was holding the portfolio of the Union agricultural minister at Centre at the relevant time and also the ex-officio chairman of Vasantdada Sugar Institute. His PIL further alleges that most of the sugar factories have been sold to the associates of Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar, the then deputy chief minister, has purportedly played a role in his capacity as the then chairman of Pune District Central Cooperative Bank and as director of the MSC bank.Read more: Sugar scam: Sharad Pawar to file suit against Anna Hazare"

The PIL also claimed that the scam pulled Maharashtra back by 50 years and put the State under a financial debt.The PIL that was filed on December 8, 2016, also sought an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation into misuse of government funds. The Bench noted that the court cannot order a CBI inquiry without a police complaint.The advocate appearing for Mr. Hazare sought time to register a complaint with the police and the court adjourned the matter to February 13."

Since sugarcane has an 18-month crop cycle, crop sown in early 2015 was ready for harvest in November 2016.So far, 32 of 147 mills have shut the crushing operation. Experts say more than 50% of the mills will stop functioning by mid-February--45 days before the usual cycle that ends in March. Most mills are situated in the sugarcane belt of Western Maharashtra and Marathwada . Most mills are facing a difficulty in functioning due to a dearth of the raw material sugarcane. Maharashtra is one of the largest producers of sugar in the country.This situation has hit sugarcane farmers as factories are unable to pay their bills in accordance with fair remunerative price (FRP) rules. This has further delayed farmers' loan repayment plans.""According to the business model on which these cooperative mills run, they need to be operational for at least 160 days to break even this year. But not many industries will be able to run for that long this year,"" said a senior official from the sugar mills association.Last year, a total of 178 factories were operational, this year 31 didn't even start operations.The area under sugarcane cultivation shrank to 6.3 lakh hectares in 2015-16 due to the drought from close to 10.3 lakh hectare the year before. Not only did the area reduce, productivity was also affected.So far, 26.5 lakh metric tonnes of sugar has been produced; the quantity at the same time last year was 33.7 lakh metric tonnes. Officials said the reduction will impact sugar prices as the year advances. While there is sufficient stock for now, as production dips further, the demand-supply gap with widen.""Sugar mills are luring farmers to sell sugarcane by promising a higher price. Hopefully, they are able to pay what they promise,"" said another official.Some mills have declared a price of Rs 2,850 per tonne of sugarcane to farmersRs 300 higher than the usual price.The state's sugar industry is going through a rough patch. It has accrued cumulative losses of Rs 2,500 crore over the past few years. The industry has asked the Central government to restructure term loans worth Rs 6,500 crore for 10 yearswith a moratorium of three years and seven years for repayment.This year, sugar production is estimated at 445 lakh tonnes compared with 742 lakh tonnes last season."

For, the city's consumption of honey is 80 times more than the country's average, which is a mere 8.4 gm, according to figures given by the city-based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).""People in this city are health conscious, and it seems they have added honey to their daily diet,"" says Donald Tais, in-charge of the CBRTI parlour at Shivajinagar here.High school teacher Sandip Pokale has replaced jam with honey while enjoying a slice or two of bread. A regular visitor to the CBRTI parlour, he says, ""I have added honey to my regular diet because of its multiple medicinal properties. It has given me positive results.""General physician Neelesh Wadnap also vouches for the health benefits of consuming honey. ""Honey can be used for curing certain coughs. The pure form of honey can be used as a natural sugar but many a times the quality of the honey is not up to the mark. Honey with warm water has multiple benefits like cleaning the bowels.""Enthused by the health properties of the sugary food substance, Puneities have been making a beeline for the CBRTI honey parlour, forcing the authorities to ask for replenishments.""Our sale has been consistent for the last two years,"" says Tais. Experts say the reason people prefer buying honey from the CBRTI parlour is because it is certified by Agmark, a government agency , which caters to a set of standards approved by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection. ""We take conscious efforts to maintain the quality of honey as per stan dards,"" says CBRTI assistant director R K Singh. The parlour keeps four different types of honey which mainly come from Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and the Melghat tribal areas in Maharashtra.Pune's voracious appetite for honey is borne out by these figures. In 2015-16, the per capita consumption of honey was 430gm, while this financial year (till December 2016) it rose to 686gm. In comparison, the per capita consumption of honey in developed countries is 1,200gm.In 2015-16, Puneites consumed 12,766 kg of honey worth Rs 46.52 lakh. While from April 2016 till December 2016, the consumption was 8,007 kg valued at Rs 29 lakh, according to CBRTI."

The center acts as a transit home for injured cats or others trapped after they were found in human habitations.According to the forest department, there is an increase in leopard sightings during the harvest season. Female leopards find these tall dense fields a suitable shelter for giving birth and rearing their cubs but since farmers fear for their life, they scare away the mother, said a local forest official from Nashik. We have observed numerous instances where the mothers abandon their cubs, never to return.On early morning December 26, the cub was spotted by farmers from near Chapadgaon village, Nashik while they were harvesting their crop. The cub was shivering when we found him and immediately informed the forest department, said Vilas Darade, sugarcane farmer from Chapadgaon.Veterinarians from Wildlife SOS and forest officials spent a week waiting for the mother to come back to the spot by isolating the cub, especially at night. However, she did not return, said officials. Young leopards, especially less than six-months old, cannot survive on their own. The chief wildlife warden of the forest department decided to place it under the permanent care of Wildlife SOS, said Yuvraj Mohite, assistant conservator of forest, Nashik.The baby leopard is quite active, said Ajay Deshmukh, veterinarian, Wildlife SOS. A preliminary medical examination was conducted and she was checked for external parasites and injuries.He added that she was lucky to have completed the cycle where she required her mothers milk on a daily basis. We have currently kept her on a solid diet and she loves eating chicken. We will continue to monitor her health as baby leopards are very susceptible to various health issues and are quite delicate at this age, said Deshmukh. We will have to hand-rear her as she cannot be returned back to the wild.Past instances of leopard cubs being reunited with their mothersNovember 14, 2016 - In a 13-hour rescue operation, three two-month-old leopard cubs were successfully reunited with their mother by forest officials on Sunday at a farm near Vadgaon Rasai village, in Shirur district of Maharashtra, almost 80 kilometres away from Pune.September 17, 2016 - A one-and-half-month-old male leopard cub, separated from its mother, was rescued and reunited from a sugarcane field near Sangamner, Ahmednagar district, by forest officials.July 5, 2015  Forest officials rescued a three-month-old leopard cub from a dry well at Vadgaon, Anand village in Junnar taluka, Pune district and reunited it with the mother after a 10-hour rescue operation.May 4, 2015 - Wildlife authorities at Narayangaon range in Junnar in Pune district reunited four leopard cubs separated from their mother early, after treating them at a local rescue centre.(Source: Maharashtra Forest Department)Also read: At 14.4C, Wednesday was coldest day in Mumbai this winter"

The logic: Taking catering trays, say on a Delhi-Kochi-Delhi flight, for the return flight from Delhi adds to the weight of the plane on the Delhi-Kochi sector and increases fuel burn.""It is not just about savings. When we uplift food from other destinations, our passengers will get to savour the local flavours. We are now uplifting catering from Kochi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. We will do so in whichever city we can uplift catering from without compromising on our high standards of passenger service,"" Vistara CEO Phee Teik Yeoh told TOI, just ahead of the airline turning two.Vistara, which is yet to break even, is looking at several areas of cost reduction and revenue augmentation. However, Phee Teik emphasies all this will be done without compromising the onboard passenger service which the airline prides itself on.""We are open to course correction and did that in the first year itself by deciding to alter the number of seats in business, premium economy and economy cabins of our planes. In many of our cities we fly to, the check-in process was outsourced. Now to reduce expense on that front, we have made that an in-house function in seven of the 18 cities we currently fly to,"" he said.""We have re-negotiated many of our contracts with suppliers. On catering too, we are doing direct procurement of certain items. We are doing competitive bidding for certain things which will be on board, like say sugar sachets,"" Phee Teik said.The airline has started offering the services of its security personnel at airports, who are posted at various places like check-in counters and at aircraft entry gates, to international airlines. As a revenue augmentation move, it now allows economy class passengers to use its airport lounges by paying Rs 1,000 at the check-in counter. It is increasing the options for generating ancillary revenue from passengers.The CEO favors the complete abolition of any preconditions for Indian carriers to fly abroad including the diluted 0/20 which requires a carrier to have at least 20 planes in its fleet to go overseas. ""For now we accept 0/20 but even this should go eventually for the good of Indian aviation. We are not saying this for our benefit but for aviation in the country. Any airline that is perfectly safe to fly and operationally efficient should be allowed to go abroad without any restrictions,"" he said.While Vistara is scheduled to get its 20th plane in June, 2018, the airline may pre-pone the delivery to become eligible to fly abroad earlier. The CEO, however, did not give any time frame when Vistara will start overseas flights. ""We are working out the long term plan. Going overseas will require fund infusion. All these things are being worked out and we will launch foreign operations as soon as we are prepared,"" he said."

58fee86a7be9e0429666b3ac,Can BJP breach Congress-NCP's rural bastions?,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-bjp-breach-congress-ncp-s-rural-bastions/story-5PCaZozwG9o5TGRx1YZiEN.html,2017-01-11,"Next month, 25 district councils, or local government bodies that administer rural areas, will go to the polls.For the first time the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will make a serious bid for the rural vote bank across Maharashtra.In the states polity, the Congress and its offshoot, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), have traditionally been the parties with a rural base, while the saffron alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena are strong with the urban voter.This premise may be challenged this time, if the saffron alliance dents the Congress-NCP. After all, after the 2014 Assembly polls, the BJP and the Sena effectively control nearly two-thirds of the state through their elected legislators.More than the results of the municipal corporations or municipal councils that administer big cities and towns, the district council polls will indicate if the Congress and NCP bastions can be breached. At stake is more than 75% of the states rural population.The Congress-NCP have dominated rural politics as they control the agrarian economy through a network of sugar and credit co-operative societies and co-operative banks.The control of these co-operative structures gives the parties direct access to lakhs of farmers, who form their support base. Over the years, while the saffron parties have tried to make headway in these rural structures, the power has stayed squarely with the Congress and NCP.This time round, however, this status quo may change. And, if it does, the Opposition will find it difficult to make a comeback in the 2019 Assembly polls.Apart from local issues, the Centres demonetisation decision is also likely to have an impact, as the rural economy was hit worst by the cash crunch. Will this result in a vote against the BJP or only strengthen the Prime Minister? Can the Opposition leverage the issue to its advantage?The Congress is hopeful of covering lost ground.In the ZP polls, we will do well, as both demonetisation and the anti-farmer policies of the government will hurt the BJP. We expect a better show than in the municipal council polls, where we managed to come second and retain most of our seats. These elections, however, have to be seen from the prism of the 2014 polls, which give the BJP the advantage, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.The BJP concedes it will have a more difficult time in the Zilla Parishads, than in the municipal corporations.Our assessment is that like in municipal councils, we will vastly improve our tally in these polls and emerge as the number one party. We will do well in Zilla Parishads also, where we currently rank last. But here, our success may not be as big as in the cities. In the Zilla Parishad polls, local equations such as control of banks, sugar co-operatives and panchayat samitis matter. And, they (Opposition) have more of a presence in this network, admitted BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Going just by the results of just the 2012 polls in these 25 ZPs, the BJP has an uphill task.The party ranks last in terms of presence in these ZPs, with just 165 of the total 1,516 seats in its kitty. It has a lead only in Jalgaon and Jalna. In several ZPs, especially in Western Maharashtra, like Satara, Sangli and Solapur, the party has no presence.The NCP leads with 511 seats, in 10 ZPs and as such, has the most at stake in the upcoming rural bodies polls. The Congress too has a considerable presence (419 seats) and the partys challenge will be to maintain this advantage.The Sena ranks third with 233 seats. For both the main alliances, contesting these polls together may help. But, given the lack of trust between the Congress-NCP and BJP-Sena, such a tie-up may not work out across the state.A lot rides on these elections for all the four main political parties, and the mandate has not been so interesting for the state as a whole in a long time.Also readCongress, NCP to tie up for elections?Congress, NCP will go solo for BMC elections in 2017"

Each packet containing 140gm is given to mothers to prepare porridge (using milk or water) and feed child four-five times a day. Each packet contains 500 calories of energy and 12-15gm protein. There are 88,272 anganwadis under the scheme and over 86 lakh children are covered under it, according to the 2001 census.Workers allegedly tampered with expiry dates and batch numbers, using paint thinners. ""We have seized the packets and sent them to the laboratory for testing. We will take action based on the report,"" said food safety officer Rahul Takate. He said that while it was premature to say if the quality of food had been compromised with, workers were seen wiping batch numbers and putting fresh stamps.Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) staffers had gone to the industrial estate to collect house tax when they noticed this. Milind Patil, a staffer and eyewitness, said, ""We got suspicious on finding the gala shutter down. We saw workers using paint thinners to wipe out expiry dates on food packets."" He said a number of packets had December expiry dates. The workers were using rubber stamps of January 2017 on the packets. Many packets did not have manufacturing and expiry dates.Yogesh Mane, a representative of the mandal, said the food packets were manufactured this month but the December expiry date stamp had been wrongly put.ICDS commissioner Vinita Singhal said she would look into the issue. She said the packets go directly to anganwadis from the manufacturers. They are, however, inspected by a child development project officer. She said though there should be a project officer for each of the 533 projects, they was a shortage.Pankaja Munde, minister of rural development, women and child welfare department, which monitors the scheme, was not reachable."
5b2e1fee9855b7245313e596,Can BJP Breach Congress-NCP's Rural Bastions?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-bjp-breach-congress-ncp-s-rural-bastions/story-5PCaZozwG9o5TGRx1YZiEN.html,2017-01-12,"Next month, 25 district councils, or local government bodies that administer rural areas, will go to the polls.For the first time the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will make a serious bid for the rural vote bank across Maharashtra.In the states polity, the Congress and its offshoot, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), have traditionally been the parties with a rural base, while the saffron alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena are strong with the urban voter.This premise may be challenged this time, if the saffron alliance dents the Congress-NCP. After all, after the 2014 Assembly polls, the BJP and the Sena effectively control nearly two-thirds of the state through their elected legislators.More than the results of the municipal corporations or municipal councils that administer big cities and towns, the district council polls will indicate if the Congress and NCP bastions can be breached. At stake is more than 75% of the states rural population.The Congress-NCP have dominated rural politics as they control the agrarian economy through a network of sugar and credit co-operative societies and co-operative banks.The control of these co-operative structures gives the parties direct access to lakhs of farmers, who form their support base. Over the years, while the saffron parties have tried to make headway in these rural structures, the power has stayed squarely with the Congress and NCP.This time round, however, this status quo may change. And, if it does, the Opposition will find it difficult to make a comeback in the 2019 Assembly polls.Apart from local issues, the Centres demonetisation decision is also likely to have an impact, as the rural economy was hit worst by the cash crunch. Will this result in a vote against the BJP or only strengthen the Prime Minister? Can the Opposition leverage the issue to its advantage?The Congress is hopeful of covering lost ground.In the ZP polls, we will do well, as both demonetisation and the anti-farmer policies of the government will hurt the BJP. We expect a better show than in the municipal council polls, where we managed to come second and retain most of our seats. These elections, however, have to be seen from the prism of the 2014 polls, which give the BJP the advantage, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.The BJP concedes it will have a more difficult time in the Zilla Parishads, than in the municipal corporations.Our assessment is that like in municipal councils, we will vastly improve our tally in these polls and emerge as the number one party. We will do well in Zilla Parishads also, where we currently rank last. But here, our success may not be as big as in the cities. In the Zilla Parishad polls, local equations such as control of banks, sugar co-operatives and panchayat samitis matter. And, they (Opposition) have more of a presence in this network, admitted BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Going just by the results of just the 2012 polls in these 25 ZPs, the BJP has an uphill task.The party ranks last in terms of presence in these ZPs, with just 165 of the total 1,516 seats in its kitty. It has a lead only in Jalgaon and Jalna. In several ZPs, especially in Western Maharashtra, like Satara, Sangli and Solapur, the party has no presence.The NCP leads with 511 seats, in 10 ZPs and as such, has the most at stake in the upcoming rural bodies polls. The Congress too has a considerable presence (419 seats) and the partys challenge will be to maintain this advantage.The Sena ranks third with 233 seats. For both the main alliances, contesting these polls together may help. But, given the lack of trust between the Congress-NCP and BJP-Sena, such a tie-up may not work out across the state.A lot rides on these elections for all the four main political parties, and the mandate has not been so interesting for the state as a whole in a long time.Also readCongress, NCP to tie up for elections?Congress, NCP will go solo for BMC elections in 2017"

""We have fixed the reserved price at Rs 473 crore. Once the offers are received, they are evaluated by a high-level committee. We had no option, but to reject all the offers since they were much below the reserved price,"" he said.A state cooperation department official said an attempt was made to sell the land to some leading industrial houses as well as the state-run industrial development corporation, but there was no response on the grounds that there is no policy to procure land by a tendering process.Most of the cooperative sugar factories are directly or indirectly controlled by leading politicians, mostly belonging to Congress or NCP. ""The state cooperative bank was directly controlled by NCP, as a result, loans were disbursed quite liberally and it was not evaluated if there will be repayment within the stipulated period,"" he said.In the wake of a key report of the Reserve Bank of India and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had appointed veteran bureaucrats to streamline the bank.

Farmers say they have been unable to withdraw the money as rural banks do not have sufficient cash even two months after demonetisation was announced.Angry at not being able to withdraw their money, a large number of farmer leaders are squarely blaming BJP for the crisis.Farmers had hoped to earn better returns on their crops last year bouyed by an upward swing in the market for sugar. In fact, for the same reason, most of the sugar mills paid cane dues on time.According to the data provided by cane department, there are nine sugar mills in the district. Most of the mills have been paying cane dues on time. Officials confirmed that a sum of Rs 800 crore had been transferred into the bank accounts of the farmers.Talking with TOI over this issue, state secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union Rajendra Singh said, ""The central govt has rattled the farmers by enforcing demonetisation. In this season, farmers had to face an economic crisis due cash crunch. Owing to this, they could not sow the wheat crop on time.""Singh added, ""Two months have passed but the situation remains the same. Most of the rural banks are providing only Rs 1,000 or Rs 2000 cash a day. To withdraw this small amount, some banks are making farmers wait for a day.Many farmers also complained that they had to stand in long queues for cash rather than tend to their crops.

We also want that black money should be unearthed but govt should have made proper arrangements to deal with cash crunch problems. If the situation is not improved, farmers will go against BJP in the assembly polls. We will teach a lesson to BJP.""When TOI contacted district cane officer OP Singh, he said, ""Around Rs 800 crore have been deposited in the farmers' bank accounts. I have written a letter to the lead bank to pay special attention to rural banks. Banks are also trying to resolve the problem of farmers.""Talking with TOI, Bijnor BJP MP Bhartendra Singh said, ""To unearth the black money and stop the corruption, central govt had demonetized the old big currency and the results are fantastic. The public of India supports the move of demonetisation wholeheartedly despite faving some economic hardships. The people want to root out the corruption from India. As a result BJP performed well in the recently held 'sthaniya nikaye chunav' in Chandigarh and Mumbai. People are with BJP and our party will get a majority in the upcoming polls at UP."""

To discourage people from eating junk food, we have recommended imposition of an additional tax on such food items, said a member of the group.A final call will be taken by the Prime Minister.The recommendations are likely to become government policy because a similar groups suggestions such as making Aadhar a money bill and advancing the Budget cycle were adopted last year.Read | Are you a millennial who binges on junk food?

Source: Ganesh Shirsekar, Deepak JoshiWith surprisingly good weather, the city on Sunday was kind to the 42,000-odd people who participated in the 14th edition of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon. This year saw fewer cases of dehydration, with 11 people requiring hospitalisation and around 2,500 needing medical help.In 2016, 18 runners had to be hospitalised due to high blood pressure, dehydration and sugar levels, and 4,000 others needed medical aid.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThis year, there were multiple factors for such a healthy run. People are more aware about their health, and we saw no case of cardiac problems. The cooler weather brought down dehydration complaints, said Dr Vijay DSilva, medical director of Asian Heart Institute.Among the 11 persons hospitalised, six were taken to Bombay Hospital, two to Lilavati and Hinduja Hospital each and one to the Jaslok hospital to be treated for dehydration. A few others were treated with IV drips at medical camps set up for the event, DSilva added.Runners also reported problems such as muscle cramps, limb ache, nausea, exhaustion and back pain. At various medical camps dotting the route, physiotherapists and volunteers massaged runners or administered them medicines.There were a total of 60 beds put together with 11 medical aid camps along the stretch of 42 km. In addition, 11 ambulances and seven doctors on motor bikes covered the route to help runners.While a training of emergency cardiac relief and CPR was given to 40 volunteers and over 1,000 policemen, not a single case of cardiac arrest or even irregular heart beats surfaced this year.At Bombay hospital, three runners were discharged by Sunday afternoon.Three others, Mahesh Pillai (32), Vishal Adhav (30) and Dinesh Victor, who were part of the full marathon, remained admitted.All of them suffer from dehydration but are stable. The treatment given to them is of IV fluid and lots of electrolyte, said Dr Sagar Sakle, spokesperson of Bombay Hospital.About 85 cardiac patients also participated in the half as well the full marathon this year after undergoing a series of health check-ups and stress tests. They did not need any medical treatment (during the marathon) in spite of having undergone heart procedures. This shows that conditioning and preparation under medical supervision can avoid any problems during long runs, said Dr Ramakanta Panda, Vice-Chairman of the Asian Heart Institute.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A division bench presided over by Justice Abhay Oka asked Hazare to first approach the police for a probe into the transactions and come to the court only if there was no response. Pawar was in the process of filing a defamation suit against Hazare, since the PILs were filed just a month ago before the civic and zilla parishad elections.Kelkar too was taken to task by the court over a PIL filed by him demanding a probe against 346 engineering colleges for submitting bogus documents to All India Council of Technical Education. The court said Kelkar should have first approached the police. The court also pointed out that as Kelkar was an elected representative, he should have raised the issue on the floor of the house for a probe against the erring colleges.A Mahalaxmi Saras exhibition, organized by the rural development department for promotion and sale of rural arts and crafts, recorded many cashless transactions. Rural development secretary Aseem Gupta and senior bureaucrats Kishore Raje Nimbalkar and R Vimala roped in a nationalised bank and swipe machines were provided to most of the 511 stalls free of cost along with brief training on the operation of the machine. Since it was not possible to provide bank accounts to all individual stall owners within a short span, it was proposed that money from all sales would be deposited in a single account and payments will be later distributed to them on the basis of transaction records. Authorities are hoping at least 50% of total transactions will be cashless.Partner in crimeMore than two decades ago, BJP leader Gopinath Munde had caused a stir when he disclosed that a close aide of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim had travelled in a private plane of a leading politician.The BJP made the politician-criminal nexus a poll plank in the 1995 assembly elections. Munde made several disclosures, resulting in a huge embarrassment to the Congress. Now decades later, BJP is facing a similar situation during elections to municipal corporations and zilla parishads owing to the entry of hardened criminals into the party. In the recent past, many individuals facing criminal charges have joined the party in the presence of cabinet members. A few days ago, an accused under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, joined BJP in the presence of food and civil supplies minister Girish Bapat.

If the demand during the summer is within 4,300 MW, there will be no problem. But if the demand exceeds that, we will have to buy power, K Siddaraju, director (technical), Bescom, told DH.To address the shortage, Bescom hopes that from April 2017 onwards, most government buildings will start generating solar power so that pressure on the grid is reduced, he added.The Energy Department has invited tenders for installing solar panels of at least one MW capacity in state and Central government buildings under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IDPS) and the 13th Finance Commission.Presently, only 30 MW to 40 MW of solar power is generated in all Bescom divisions, and just 6 MW from 448 connections in Bengaluru. This is a small number. Wind power generation is uncertain and ranges from 30 MW to 1,800 MW, the official said.In the first phase, Bescom has identified 83 state and 200 Central government buildings in all its divisions for installation of solar panels.In Bengaluru, all Bescom offices, Vidhana Soudha, Vikasa Soudha, Legislators Home, Central government offices and schools and panchayat offices have been listed.Bescom is buying power from various sources and has left hydel resources untouched so as to use them during the summer.We are purchasing600 MW under the short-term open access. Another 450 MW is being purchased from Jindal Power Ltd and other power-trading corporations. We have procured 300 MW from Maharashtra; Bescoms share in it is 47.9%. We have also signed agreements with sugar factories for power generation which will start in a week. Water resources are being conserved to the maximum. The present capacity of hydel power is 15 million units against the installed capacity of 40 million units, Siddaraju said."

The Spanish company that goes by the name of Gik Blue tells City Express that they have received more than 500 emails from India and interested importers and distributors have approached them for bringing blue wine to the country.We would like to start with the biggest cities in the country: New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. All of them during the current year 2017, says Aritz Lpez, co-founder of Gik.Makers of the blue are six Spaniards all under the age of 30, who started the blue wine to shake things up in a country where wine is an established tradition. Currently operating in 20 countries, it took two years to develop the product and it was done in collaboration with University of the Basque Country. We wanted to shake things up a little bit and have fun. Wine felt like the best industry to shake things up, says Taig Mac Cathy, creator of Gik Blue Wine.Trouble StartsHowever, the electric-blue colour of the wine, has landed them in controversy. Spain has called for the product to be relabeled, on the grounds that wine cannot be blue, only red or white. Spain identifies 17 types of wine and blue is not on the list.The makers say the blue drink is more of a beverage than a wine, but it is a wine.How is it made blue? Its pretty straight forward, says Mac Cathy. First of all, a mixture is created from five different varieties of red and white grapes. Two organic pigments, anthocyanin, from the red grape skin, and indigotine, an organic salt commonly used as a reddish-blue food colourant is used to turn the drink into blue. The drink is 99 per cent wine and 1 per cent grape. A process to combine natural and chemical pigments were developed.It has the aroma of a ripe fruit and is slightly acidic with a sweet bubbly burst. The drink carries no added sugars to ensure it is a non-caloric and not alcoholic (since sugar ferments into alcohol)."

58f4fdbfa3d24b0b70c1be9a,Focussing on the marginal farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Focussing-on-the-marginal-farmer/article17057550.ece,2017-01-19,"The sluice gate on the Bhakra main line canal in Khanauri-Kalan village in Sangrur district, Punjab, has become infamous. According to reports, it is a suicide point for farmers and their families. Typically, 30-45 corpses are found in the canal on average every month. Farmers suicide in Punjab is a major worry: over 2,632 farmers are reported to have committed suicide between 1995 and 2015,in the land famed for its Green Revolution, according to State government records. Mansa district alone accounts for 1,334 suicides. Adding farm labourers raises the total to 4,687 reported suicides. The reasons for this vary: cotton crop has been whittled by whiteflies, basmatis market price has declined, the local moneylender has hiked up rates to 20 per cent. The farmer ekes his way to penury.Farmer suicides are not a new trend. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 2,195 marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in 2015 (of which 834 were in Maharashtra), while 3,618 small farmers undertook such drastic steps, with Maharashtra alone seeing 1,285. More curiously, a larger number of small farmers rather than marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in States like Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. Somehow, small farmers are also bedevilled by the agricultural crisis, and this is not the case in just the traditional drought-stricken States.On input costsAgriculture in States like Punjab is typically a monoculture of wheat and paddy. When input costs associated with fertilizers, crop-protection chemicals and seeds rose, along with fixed costs associated with agricultural equipment such as tractors and submersible pumps, agriculture became economically unviable. Prices have risen  of arhar seeds and staple crops like paddy and sugarcane, of fertilizers and plain barley. The old days of farmers handing seeds as family heirlooms to their sons are long gone. Hiring labourers and animals is expensive. With an increase in application of crop-protection chemicals, soya bean has seen a massive jump in pesticide cost. Given a jump in input costs, cultivation costs have gone up in multiples. The total cost of cultivation for wheat rose three times from 2004-05 to 2012-13.While traditionally the blame is cast on the usurious local moneylender, NCRB data highlight that 2,474 of the 3,000 farmers who were reported to have committed suicide in 2015 had loans from local banks, while those who had loans from moneylenders were just 9.8 per cent of the total. Maharashtra reported 1,293 such suicides for indebtedness, while Karnataka had 946. Meanwhile, farmers in Punjab are estimated to have an outstanding debt of Rs. 69,355 crore. Somehow, the traditional moneylender is seemingly more flexible than local banks.Retailoring agricultureSolving this crisis requires an inclusive approach. Our policies should encourage integrated pest management, an approach that focusses on combining biological, chemical, mechanical and physical means to combat pests with a long-term emphasis on eliminating or significantly reducing the need for pesticides. In Vietnam, over 2 million of the Mekong Deltas rice farmers adopted a no spray early rule, curbing insecticide applications within the first 40 days of rice planting. Predatory beetles that commonly prey on rice pests were sustained, encouraging the crop while cutting pesticide use by over 50 per cent.The local fertilizer industry needs support  timely delivery of subsidies would improve working capital requirements, enabling them to manage costs through internal sources rather than external loans. Delayed payments can cause an interest outgo of Rs. 3,500 crore for fertilizer firms annually. State seed policies should focus on encouraging contract farming, along with identification of new genotypes for treating pest and disease syndromes, as well as adverse weather conditions. Precision-farming techniques like Systematic Rice Intensification can help increase seed production in this regard.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment and implements that are currently imported. Subsidies should be rerouted to ensure lower collateral requirements, longer moratoriums and payback periods for farmers seeking to buy equipment and entrepreneurs seeking to setup Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) for agricultural equipment. Companies with a corporate social responsibility focus on agriculture can be further encouraged to invest in capacity-building initiatives, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.We need to ensure that institutional financing is available and accessible and benefit provision is simplified while disbursed funds are effectively monitored. States should seek to establish early warning signals, monitoring farmers who go past set limits and seek unsustainable loans. Village-wise lists of deeply indebted farmers must be prepared annually to identify farmers on the flight path to penury and potential suicide. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, along with the local administration, should be tasked with analysing such lists for macro and local policy interventions, along with devising timely loan restructuring initiatives, insurance claim settlements and better counselling.Finally, such individuals must be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Given the hard struggle of making a living in agriculture these days, such farmers face big odds for sustaining their families and educating their children. Travelling through the by-lanes of suicide-stricken villages in Bijnor, Bahraich, Kheri, Allahabad, Aligarh and Moradabad is a humbling and disconcerting experience. Even distributing Rs.50,000 per distraught marginal farmer family has had little impact; so deep is the scale of agrarian distress. Our efforts in crowdfunding have been a palliative for over 3,000 farmers, but only systemic change can transform their situation. The marginal farmer requires more than just hope now.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency for the BJP.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment that is currently imported"

Express Around Rs 4,700 crore, in withdrawn notes, was collected from the DCCBs, which needs to be remitted. ExpressThe Pune District Central Cooperative Bank (PDCCB) is planning to seek legal redressal from the Supreme Court to highlight the failure of both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Nabard in initiating the process of remittance of old currency notes deposited at the bank. Ramesh Thorat, Chairman, PDCCB, said they will be consulting their lawyer soon to decide the next course of action.Watch What Else is Making NewsRemittance of the demonetised currency has been a major cause of concern with the RBI consistently deferring the process. It might be recalled that on November 11, the RBI had barred the DCCBs from depositing or exchanging old currency notes, following which 31 DCCBs across Maharashtra were stuck with old notes.DCCBs, thanks to its extensive rural coverage, act as bankers to cooperative institutions like cooperative milk dairies, credit societies and sugar mills. With over 2,900 rural branches, the DCCBs are often the only banks in remote regions.Around Rs 4,700 crore, in withdrawn notes, was collected from the DCCBs, which now needs to be remitted. The DCCBs had, in fact, moved the apex court seeking legal redressal from RBIs directions.The RBI, while defending its decision, had claimed that the DCCBs had failed to abide by the 100 per cent KYC compliance norms for its account holders.The apex court had then allowed remittance of withdrawn notes, while ordering for 100 per cent KYC compliance of both individual account holders and primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS).Following the verdict, Nabard had asked DCCBs to submit detailed reports regarding the KYC details of the accounts.Barring a few DCCBs from the Vidharbha area, all other DCCBs from across Maharashtra have submitted the required reports. Also, of the 370 DCCBs in India, 305 have submitted the voluminous reports too.Nabard officials said they are yet to receive any instructions from the RBI on how to go about the KYC verification, given the laborious nature of the job. Other than the KYC details, Nabard had also sought details of currency notes held by the DCCBs as on November 7, which most of the DCCBs had submitted.Meanwhile, DCCBs are stuck with stacks of old notes, resulting in excess expenditure on their part. Besides PDCCB, which has old notes worth Rs 574 crore, other banks stuck with a significant amount of such notes include Aurangabad DCCB with Rs 290 crore, Rs 315 crore with Sangli and Rs 102.37 crore with Solapur.Security expenses apart, Thorat said, the non-remittance of the notes is causing a severe loss to the bank. Various agencies like the Income Tax, CBI, ED have also visited the DCCBs for inspections.In view of the inaction by both the RBI and Nabard, Thorat said they are left with no option but to move the SC. Former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram had represented us in the Supreme Court earlier and we will be consulting him again. By next week, we hope to finalise our future plan of action, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Dominic Rivard with Vikas Pujari in the wine production unit.VISITORS TO this years Chikoo festival in Bordi village in Palghar district have something new to look forward to. A resort in the area has begun producing the worlds first ever chikoo wine  the product was launched earlier this month. One of the attractions at the festival will be a wine tour followed by a wine-tasting session.Watch what else is making newsGiven the brand name Fruzantte, the fruit wine began as an experiment by Shrikant Save, a hotelier from Bordi, to boost the declining sales of the fruit in the traditional chikoo-growing belt of Dahanu-Gholvad. With the support of his daughter Priyanka Save, a trained sommelier (wine taster), the family began experimenting with the fruit and began making chikoo wine at home. Soon they roped in Dominic Rivard, a Canadian wine-maker, to prepare a recipe for the wine and imported machinery from Italy for large- scale production.Chikoo has all the qualities required for wine  the right acidity, sugar and Ph value. Since the fruit in its original form perishes quickly, we felt making it into wine would be a good way to boost its market value, said Save.After almost a five-year struggle for licences, they began production in a small area of Saves Bordi resort in August last year. By January, they were ready with close to 10,000 bottles of wine.Cartons of the wine. Cartons of the wine.Despite being pioneers of this product, the Saves do not plan to patent their fruit drink.We want more people to get into this business as it will help us create a market for the product. Chikoo wine will get more popular and have wider distribution only when there are more producers, explained Nagesh Pai, Saves son-in-law.Priced at Rs 255 a bottle, the chikoo wine is a fresh bubbly drink with only eight per cent alcohol content. Presently, it is distributed only in the surrounding areas of Bordi, and a few pubs and hotels in Mumbai.The wine can be kept for two years. However, if the sap from the fruit remains, its life is reduced drastically. While wines are known for their longevity, a lot of care is needed for ageing fruit wines. Getting rid of the sap from the chikoo fruit was one of the greatest challenges we had to overcome. If it is not removed properly, the wine gets ruined in six months, said Vikas Pujari, assistant wine maker in the unit. After the juice is crushed out, the remaining fruit is used as manure in their farms, mixed with cow dung.Taking the idea of fruit wines further, they plan to begin making wine from other fruits including litchi, mango, black plums and even star fruit by April. They will also experiment with mixing fruits, such as chikoo and grapes, to make new forms of wine.The Theme: Celebrating entrepreneurshipKey Attractions: Warli Art and handicraft, products such as chikoo pickle, chocolates, chips, bird exhibition, cultural programmes organised by various communities, local food stalls, a chikoo runWhen: January 21-22Where: Bordi village in Palghar districtHow to reach: Take an express train to Gholwad station and from there, take an auto to Bordi.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Every one wants the tilgul (a traditional sesame sweet) of power, but the BJP should be careful, the Sena said in the editorial.The Shiv Sena acknowledged that it was in seat-sharing talks with the BJP, and people have equated the process to the crushing of sugarcane. We feel that the crushing will yield more sweet than molasses, but as a ruling party there are several who have lined up at the BJPs footsteps to have a share of the tilgul.Both the Sena and BJP are preparing ground to contest independently in case the seat-sharing talks fail, and are already training their guns against each other ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.The Sena added, the BJP has never let go a single opportunity to criticise parties such as the Congress, the NCP, Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, Lalu Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress and so on for harbouring people with criminal records.People think it is the BJP that can clean the murky Ganga of national politics, and the Modi-led party will cleanse the countrys political system.

Every one wants the tilgul (a traditional sesame sweet) of power, but the BJP should be careful, the Sena said in the editorial.The Shiv Sena acknowledged that it was in seat-sharing talks with the BJP, and people have equated the process to the crushing of sugarcane. We feel that the crushing will yield more sweet than molasses, but as a ruling party there are several who have lined up at the BJPs footsteps to have a share of the tilgul.Both the Sena and BJP are preparing ground to contest independently in case the seat-sharing talks fail, and are already training their guns against each other ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.The Sena added, the BJP has never let go a single opportunity to criticise parties such as the Congress, the NCP, Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, Lalu Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress and so on for harbouring people with criminal records.People think it is the BJP that can clean the murky Ganga of national politics, and the Modi-led party will cleanse the countrys political system.

They were killed in a road accident near Sarodhi village on NH-8 in Valsad when they were going to their hometown in Navsari in a car along with their three relatives, including their soon-to-be daughter-in-law.The NRI couple had arrived at Mumbai's Chattrapati Shivaji International Airport on Thursday night. The NRI couple was received by their close relatives who then started on their journey towards Navsari. The accident occurred at about 4 am when the car driver lost control on the wheels. The car went in the opposite direction after jumping the divider and rammed into a tempo going toward Vapi. The collision was so gruesome that all the six people, including the NRIs, were killed on the spot.The deceased were identified as Ankita Hasmukh Gandhi, 23; Mansi Anand Gandhi, 20; Anand Thakorlal Gandhi, 47  all residents of Billimora  Prakash Pastagiya, Meenakshi Pastagiya and car driver Milan Hasmukh Patel, 23, a native of Navsari.The NRI couple was visiting Navsari for the second time in the past few months. Earlier, they had come to fix the marriage of their son Mickey Pastagiya, an NRI from Canada, with Ankita Hasmukh Gandhi. The marriage of their son was scheduled in February.Police sources in Valsad said the car driver lost control on the wheels and rammed his vehicle into the tempo which was coming from the opposite side on the highway. At least four bodies were removed from the badly damaged car with the help of a gas cutter.""The bodies were shifted to Valsad Civil Hospital for postmortem.

58f6bfb07be9e031f13bb149,Sugar prices climb as drought hits supply,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sugar-prices-climb-as-drought-hits-supply/articleshow/56697654.cms,2017-01-21,"The two years of drought and climate-related challenges are creating a whiplash in sugar prices as largest producer Maharashtra struggles to supply the nation. And though as households, we spend only 3% of our monthly food budget on sugar, eventually we also pay for the more expensive sugar in ready-to-eat foods, ice creams, sweets, snacks, cold drinks, confectionery, and restaurant meals. The food and hospitality industry, which buys 65% of the country's sugar, passes on the price increases to us.Maharashtra, which contributes a third of India's total supply, is expected to produce 40% less sugar in 2016-17. In Karnataka, production is down 44% due to the drought. Together, that is loss of sugar enough for two months consumption.Due to the acute water scarcity, farmers in these two states did not plant new sugarcane crop in 2016-17. The ratoon crop also yielded less juice. At least 45 sugar factories in Maharashtra shut operations early because no cane is available. The rest will shut in the next one-and-a-half months. Since the slack in Maharashtra and Karnataka will not be compensated by the increased production in Uttar Pradesh, India may fall short of sugar to meet demand. By September end, when the 2016-17 sugar marketing closes, we are likely to be left with stocks enough for only 47 days. This will be the lowest in several years.In Uttar Pradesh, mills have produced 10% more sugar than last year and sales are brisk. As a result, farmers are being paid at least 75% of their bill within the 15-day deadline. The delayed payments are mainly by corporate groups with high debt and poor cash flows.While farmers and mills are coping well, consumers are less fortunate. The tight supplies have pushed up retail prices to above Rs 45kg in the metros just four months into the new sugar marketing year. Industrial consumers are also paying more in the wholesale markets. Sugar was 28% more expensive in December compared to the same month in 2015, shows latest Wholesale Price Index data.Luckily, ample sugar is available in Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter. If customs duty is removed, raw sugar can reach India at Rs 40kg. That should provide much-needed relief to consumers.But the window of opportunity to import affordable sugar is small since global prices have risen 15% in the last one month and 41% in last 12 months.These tactical actions will not, however, address the stark reality that India will remain in this hand-to-mouth situation for several years ahead due to the combined challenges of rising consumption, water scarcity and climate change. Political intervention has further queered the pitch by distorting market signals that would have otherwise ensured more efficient water, land and capital utilization. And consumers aren't the only ones affected. Sugar industry is a key source of rural income and jobs.So making the industry more competitive overall is the only way to spread sweetness and light."

They were asked not rely solely on agriculture ministry's cane output data.""The states have been told to collect mill-wise sugar yields instead of taking the states' average while estimating the sugar output so as to check if mills are under-reporting, the official said.""There are possibilities that mills may be underreporting production figures... The mill-wise sugar yields will help get the accurate picture,"" the official added.Sugar production of India, the world's second-largest producer and biggest consumer, is estimated to be lower in 2016-17 due to a possible sharp drop in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to drought. The output stood at 25.1 million tonnes during 2015-16 marketing year."

Floated by Mumbai businessman Dattatrey Mahiskar, IRB Group has a major stake in infrastructure business and had built the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. The promoters are known to be close to union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari Global Vision Safety , a company in which Mahiskar is a director, was in the news four years ago as a loan by it of Rs164 crore was found in the books of Purti Group, formed by Gadkari. Mahiskar also has subscribed shares in Purti Power and Sugar Limited too.In October 2016, six companies had responded to the request for qualification (RFQ) called by Mihan India Limited (MIL), the current operator of Nagpur airport. These included Essel Group, IRB, GVK, GMR Tata Realty, and PNC Infrastructure.RFQ is the process of shortlisting the candidates. Based on the documents submitted by contenders in a RFQ, firms are chosen to offer financial bids under the request for proposal (RFP).Before going for the RFPs, a clearance is required from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) for the bidding companies and its directors. All the bidders for the RFQ, except IRB Group, have submitted their documents for MHA verification.Sources following the developments said the company was given repeated reminders to submit the documents, but it did not respond. Finally, MIL sent the documents of the other five companies for MHA clearance. IRB has been intimated that now it is out of the race for Nagpur airport.The company did not respond even when it was informed that it is now out of the race, said a source. Officials of IRB have admitted in informal discussions that the company is no longer interested in the project, sources said.MIL is expecting to get the draft document for RFP from the consultants by next week. The bids will be called for soon after the MHA clearance. The clearance is mandatory, which includes verifying credentials of all directors of the company, said a source.MIL, which is a joint venture of state government-owned MADC and Airports Authority of India (AAI), plans to offload its 74% stake to a private player. The bids will be based on the revenue share offered to MIL for running the airport."

ISMA projected sugar production at 234 lakh tonnes for 2016-17 during its first advance estimates of the crop in September last year""Considering that some sugar mills have closed their operations in the drought affected areas mostly in Maharashtra and Karnataka and field reports that sugarcane availability in these two states is lower than earlier expectations, ISMA decided to revise its estimates of sugar production for 2016-17 sugar season,"" the association said.Sugar recoveries and yields have also gone down in parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Sugar production in the current season (till January 15) has been pegged at 104.8 lakh tonnes, around 5% lower than the same period the previous year.ISMA, however, said that there would neither be any shortage of sugar nor any need to import sugar. ""There is enough sugar to meet the domestic requirement and yet leave a healthy balance for the next sugar season,"" it said.Despite the decline in production, a high opening balance of 77.5 lakh tonnes in the 2015-16 season would enable the sugar industry to end the season with a closing stock of 48.5 lakh tonnes, which is equivalent to at least 2 months of sugar consumption.""Now that sugar mills, in the drought affected areas, have started closing down, the difference (in sugar sales) from last year will be higher as the season progresses,"" ISMA said. Sugar sales during the first quarter of the 2016-17 season (October-December 2016) has declined 8.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) or by 5.5 lakh tonnes.Total sales by mills was pegged at 248.5 lakh tonnes in the 2015-16 season. As per the field reports, it is certain that sales during the 2016-17 season will be lower than that of last season, ISMA said. Sales in January is also projected to be lower compared to last year when sugar mills had sold 25 lakh tonnes.""Assuming that in the balance eight months of the current season i.e. from February to September, there is similar sugar sales in comparison to last year and assuming that the sugar sales/despatches are similar to last year, sugar sales in the current season will be around 242 lakh tonnes,"" ISMA said."

Let them take a call and come for discussions. We will take a call.""He said he was 'pained' with Thackeray's announcement that his party was parting ways with the BJP. He refused to answer questions on any possible NCP-BJP tie-up in the state.In the 2014 assembly polls, the BJP had won 122 seats. It fell short of 23 MLAs to reach the magic number of 145. Pawar then announced unilateral support to the BJP saying that the NCP's 41 MLAs will back the BJP on the floor of the House. This move had pushed Shiv Sena into a tight corner and Thackeray agreed to join the BJP government to keep the NCP away from the power.With new political developments, Pawar has once again played his old cards. The Shiv Sena has 14 ministers in the state cabinet and 63 MLAs in the House. With its own strength of 122 MLAs and support of 41 NCP MLAs, Fadnavis's government can get a clear majority in the House even if the Sena decides to quit.State BJP leaders, including guardian minister Girish Bapat, were at Pawar's residence in Pune to congratulate him after the central government announced the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour for Pawar for public affairs, besides six others.However, no BJP leader was ready to comment on a political fallout of the Shiv Sena's announcement to break the alliance. Senior party leaders said the Pawar-Modi bonhomie has already safeguarded Fadnavis's government in the state.Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was at Vasantada Sugar Institute in Manjari recently on an invitation from Pawar, had praised the NCP president as an ""example"" for others in public life.""I have personal respect for Sharadrao. I was Gujarat's chief minister. He helped me walk by holding my finger. I feel proud to pronounce this publicly,"" he had said while congratulating Pawar on completion of 50 years in public life in 2017. The NCP chief, in turn, had praised Modi for his commitment towards the nation."
58f4d31060de470aa339c4a5,jab at PM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170128/jsp/nation/story_132757.jsp,2017-01-28,"(From left) Pawar, Uddhav and ModiNagpur, Jan. 27: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has been wondering whether conferring the Padma Vibhushan on Sharad Pawar was a "" gurudakshina"" of sorts to him from the Prime Minister. ""I don't know if awards can also be offered as dakshina,"" Uddhav said caustically at a rally on Thursday while launching the Sena campaign for the BMC elections scheduled in mid-February. Uddhav is being seen as taking a jibe at Narendra Modi, who had referred to Pawar as his ""political guru"" at a November 2016 event organised by an autonomous sugarcane growers' body in Pune. Modi had recounted at the Vasantdada Sugar Institute how the NCP chief helped him in the early phase of his political career. Pawar, who heads the institute, had in turn praised Modi's demonetisation decision. Pawar had then termed demonetisation a radical move to weed out black money. He has since gone back on his words, saying the decision had hit farmers hard. Uddhav brought up the issue while announcing the break-up of the 25-year-old Sena-BJP alliance for the BMC elections. As he dug his claws into the BJP, he also took a swipe at the Modi-Pawar bonhomie, wondering if an award could be offered as "" dakshina"" to a ""guru"". Pawar has yet to react to Uddhav's jibe. But he said the Sena could consider taking a decision on exiting the Devendra Fadnavis government, if it was so opposed to aligning with the BJP for the local body elections. Both the Sena and the BJP have, however, made it clear that the decision not to contest the local body elections together would not impact the BJP-Sena government in Maharashtra. Modi and Pawar have shared the dais on a few occasions in Maharashtra, despite the Prime Minister having dubbed the NCP a ""naturally corrupt party"" in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. Last December, the two leaders had shared the stage in Pune during the foundation-stone ceremony for the Pune Metro. The NCP has been having a tacit alliance with the BJP in many local bodies, a fact not hidden from either the Sena or the Congress. The Padma award for Pawar has given the parties a chance to take potshots at the BJP ahead of the February 21 elections. Today, Sena cadres burst crackers and distributed sweets at the decision to go into the polls alone, saying they were finally free of BJP subjugation. But the BJP was more guarded in its reaction, calling Uddhav's decision unfortunate. ""You could have broken the alliance but been a little more decent about your words,"" Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari said in New Delhi today. Uddhav's style of politics and speech stands in contrast with that of his father, the late Bal Thackeray. He was apparently vitriolic in his attack on the BJP yesterday, much in line with that party's aggression in Mumbai."

Bujarbaruah addresses the gathering on Saturday. Telegraph pictureJorhat, Jan. 28: A brainstorming session held at the Assam Agricultural University here today discussed which crops were best suited to the ecology of a particular area, soil fertility and climate change.The session was on Regional Crop Planning for Improving Resource Use Efficiency and Sustainability project, which aims to prepare a crop map for the Northeast by March.The project under National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research-ICAR is being conducted by the department of agricultural economics, AAU, since July 2013.AAU vice-chancellor K.M. Bujarbaruah said while preparing the road map, scientists should hold discussions with farmers. The outcome ultimately depends on the farmer, who has to get maximum return with minimum cost and inputs, he said.Regarding climate change, Bujarbaruah said in the last two years heavy rainfall had occurred in March and April and this could indicate that sowing season should start from May instead of July.He asked the National Bureau of Soil Sciences to come up with a land use plan based on soil survey.Rajni Jain, principal investigator, NIAP-ICAR, while highlighting its work, said in Punjab and Maharashtra groundwater and soil fertility had declined sharply.""Due to heavy use of fertilisers and groundwater, agriculture in Punjab is staring at a crisis,"" she said. Farmers in the state have taken to sowing paddy instead of traditional crops like gram, wheat and groundnut, she added.In Maharashtra, the largescale sugarcane plantations are facing threats from pests and outside sources.K.C. Talukdar, head of department, agricultural economics, said the vastness of the Northeast could be gauged by the existence of 40 ecological situations. Expressing concern over shrinking land and climate change, he cautioned against overuse and misuse of resources.Nivedita Deka, principal investigator and scientist of the project, said a specific plan had been prepared for Assam and the region had been divided into six zones - north bank plain, upper Brahmaputra valley, central Brahmaputra valley, lower Brahmaputra valley, Barak valley and the hills.G.N.

In less than a year, the total number of applications for farm ponds in Maharashtra has crossed one lakh and is still rising, the CM said.Taking a cue from the Centre, the Maharashtra government has decided to do away with the distinction between plan and non-plan expenditure in its budget for the fiscal 2017-18, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said Wednesday.The Union Budget this year saw a merging of the general and the railway budget, as well as scrapping of the plan and non-plan categories. Under non-plan expenditure, the government would earmark funds for salaries, subsidies, loans and interest, whereas plan expenditure was allocated for developmental projects and capacity building, areas likely to bring in returns later.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe objective of the reform is to curtail wasteful expenditure and inculcate greater fiscal discipline, said Fadnavis. Fiscal prudence is specially important for Maharashtra, with a whopping Rs 3.25-lakh-crore debt. Fadnavis had discussed the issue with the NITI Aayog during a meeting in Delhi. The Centre formally decided to merge the plan and non-plan expenditures last September.The matter had been conveyed to state governments. Maharashtras budget in 2016-17 was Rs 2.57 lakh crore. At successive meetings in the past two years, Fadnaviss directive was that the increasing non-plan budget was detrimental for the growth and development of Maharashtra, as it indirectly shrinks capital investments. The state finance departments projection of capital investment for the year 2016-17 was Rs 32,000 crore. A year ago (2015-16), it was Rs 28,000 crore.The states Gross Development Product last year was 8 per cent.Describing the Centres Budget as path-breaking and addressing concerns of the poor, middle-class and farmers, Fadnavis said, Higher allocations in infrastructure, agriculture and housing sectors would lead to inclusive growth.Maharashtra has had positive takeaways from the Budget, he said, in the form of increased work on farm ponds  from 5 lakh to 15 lakh  under MGNREGA. The state, which has 24,000 drought-prone villages, has the largest demand from farmers for farm ponds.In less than a year, the total number of applications for farm ponds in Maharashtra has crossed one lakh and is still rising, the CM said. The decision to include a separate textile policy with employment and investments could work to the states advantage in bridging the rural-urban divide, said Fadnavis, whose government has already given its nod to set up 11 textile parks, mainly in Vidarbha, Marathawada and parts of North and Western Maharashtra. The farm-to-fashion policy of the Centre is also being pursued by Maharashtra.Jaitleys decision to set up a Rs 5,000-crore corpus fund for micro irrigation has been welcomed by the state.Fadnavis said, In Maharashtra, we have declared that water be treated as essential commodity. Drip irrigation, which was confined to 3 lakh hectares of sugar cane crop, is being extended to all crops to double their productivity with lesser investment.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58f54a657be9e01a17c9688e,Why dengue turns fatal for patients with second infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/why-dengue-turns-fatal-for-patients-with-second-infection/articleshow/56931466.cms,2017-02-02,"MUMBAI: American scientists have made a research breakthrough in their study on dengue, a viral disease that wreaked havoc across India in the last two years, that could help treatment of the disease at a future date.Dengue emerged as one of the biggest public health problems of India in the recent past. Data available with India's National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme show that dengue cases more than doubled between 2014 and 2015; the central agency noted 40,571 cases in 2014 that increased to 99,913 in 2015. While 137 people died in 2014, 220 died in 2015. In 2016, the increasing onslaught of dengue resulted in 1,1,880 cases and 227 deaths.Now, a press release from the Rockefeller University on Wednesday, claims to have nailed why certain people are more vulnerable to dengue than others.Dengue, essentially a viral infection spread by the Aedes egypti mosquitoes, is a relatively mild-mannered disease the first time around. But a second infection by the virus is known to have severe symptoms, including death.""Patients with severe secondary disease have high levels of a particular type of antibody that triggers a forceful immune response. This distinctive signature did not show up in patients with more mild illness,"" said senior author Jeffrey V Ravtech of the Rockefeller University.Their work essentially says that shows how the dengue virus ``co-opts antibodies produced as a result of the previous infection, using them to inflict more damage the second time around.""Among patients with a second dengue infection, patients can develop hemorrhagic fever, which causes them to bleed abnormally from the nose, gums or under the skin. Less than 15 % people who catch dengue for the second time develop such hemorrhagic fever or shock.""Previous work in Ravetch's lab suggested differences in antibodies might account for why only some develop severe secondary infections. These Y-shaped proteins help the body defend itself against viruses and other intruders by latching onto infected cells with their arms,"" said the press release. Their stems, known as Fc regions, bind to immune cells and tell them how to respond. Ravetch's lab has shown that the structure of the Fc region can influence an immune response by, for example, promoting inflammation versus calming it.In the current study, first author Taia Wang took a close look at the Fc regions of antibodies in blood collected from patients at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. They found the dengue patients with more serious disease had high levels of antibodies whose Fc regions lack a particular sugar, a variation known to strongly activate immune cells.""In experiments, the researchers showed that activating signals from these antibodies aggravated the disease by leading to the destruction of blood-clotting cells called platelets. When their platelet levels plummet, patients bleed abnormally-a hallmark of hemorrhagic fever. The lower a patient's platelet count, the more of these distinctive antibodies he or she tended to have,'' added the press release. The discovery of this antibody signature could help fight the disease in a number of ways."

In Rajasthan, by executing simple techniques, Singh's Tarun Bharat Sangh has rejuvenated 7 rivers that had almost died.""It doesn't need big engineering to save water bodies but simple common sense can work. If academicians are really serious about conserving wetlands they should ask students to respect nature,"" Singh said at a packed gathering of students, teachers and officials.Wetlands are linked to our lives and to face the 21st century challenges, teachers should sow the seeds by taking students' yatras to wetlands to know about their plight. ""Today, encroachments, pollution and over exploitation are biggest problems wetlands are facing. People need to come forward to fight injustice. Sadly, no education teaches to fight against injustice,"" the water conservationist said.Despite best irrigation facilities since independence, country is facing floods and droughts. Even today, 54% of India faces high to extremely high water stress.He blamed lack of political will for the mess. Citing example of Marathwada where leaders encouraged to grow sugar cane despite drought, Singh appealed to the farmers to link crop pattern with rain pattern.""Sustainable watershed management, groundwater recharge and stopping soil erosion were the main factors to save the situation. In Rajasthan, we showed the way by creating over 11,000 check dams and water conservation works in 10,840 sqkm area,"" said Singh.The water conservationist cited example of Maharashtra, where country's 40% large dams were built but the flip side is that it tops the list of farmers' suicides.

(File Photo) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. (File Photo)The BJP-led government in Maharashtra has revoked the action that the Excise department had launched against two Marathwada-based distilleries accused of taking part in alleged illicit liquor frauds. Sugar baron Ratnakar Gutte owns one of the distilleries being probed. NCP sitting MLA Babanrao Shindes family controls the other. Gutte had unsuccessfully contested 2014 Assembly polls from Parbhanis Gangakhed as candidate of BJP-led alliance.Last October, state Excise Commissioner V Radha had permanently revoked the licences of both distilleries for their alleged role in separate illegal liquor nets. Her department had also lodged criminal complaints in both cases.On January 10, state Excise Minister Chandrasekhar Bavankule issued separate orders ordering restoration of the permits and cancellation of the Excise Commissioners orders. The Sunday Express possesses copies of both orders. The governments intervention comes at a time when proceedings in related matters are on in Bombay High Court.Bavankule has remarked that his orders were interim in nature and will be subject to the outcome of court matters. Both firms had filed appeals to the ministers office challenging the departments action. While deciding the appeals, Bavankule has gone with evidence put forth by Excise officials in justification of the action against the firms, but has cited long-term social impact that a permanent closure of these units may have on the backward Marathwada region as the main reason to upturn the revocation.Production was shut in both distilleries for three months; no further penalties have been imposed in the ministers orders.The firms should pay up the full extent of evaded duty on the goods, Bavankule has observed. The department must continue the legal process in criminal complaints filed in this respect.In Guttes case, licence of his molasses-based distillery  Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Pvt Ltd (Parbhani), which has a capacity of 60 kilolitres per day  was revoked on October 21, 2016. The department accused the firm of illegally supplying ethanol or rectified spirit for manufacture of illicit liquor. The firm was also charged with unauthorised transportation of intoxicants, unauthorised sale of duty-evaded intoxicants and violation of norms.On September 6, 2016, the departments enforcement division claimed that it had intercepted a tanker (MH04 DS 9808) containing 20,000 litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Pathardi. Investigators said driver and cleaner were arrested and revealed that the consignment had originated from Guttes distillery and was being transported to an illicit alcohol maker, a contention Gutte has denied.Gutte contended that all processes in the distillery were carried out under the supervision of the excise officials.On October 17, 2016, V Radha had revoked the country liquor licence of Osmanabad-based Vitthal Distilleries Private Limited, run by Shindes family, in a two-year-old case where Excise investigators had accused the firm of illegal sale and disposal of 23,227 litres of country liquor. The firm challenged the contention. The minister sided with the investigators but granted relief, making similar grounds as in Guttes case.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f527e27be9e01a3579aa1c,Urban village Versova turns fishing into Rs 400 crore business,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/urban-village-versova-turns-fishing-into-rs-400-crore-business/articleshow/56978789.cms,2017-02-05,"MUMBAI: A typical working day starts at 2pm for Sandhya Bhanje. She arrives at the jetty to oversee the unloading of the catch and stays on to supervise sales to customers from all over the city until sunset. Finally , the fish left over is hauled onto trucks bound for Crawford Market from where it's shipped out by seafood exporters. Now for the economics. Her family owns seven trawlers that bring in crates of shrimp, pomfret and Bombay Duck. Each makes two to three trips a month, with a haul worth about Rs 3 lakh every time, going by industry estimates.Welcome to the koliwada in Versova. Situated on a palm-fringed edge of the western coast, it belies conventional ideas of a coastal hamlet dependent on a traditional activity for its livelihood. The industry of fishing has transformed this once semi -rural settlement of kolis, considered a Backward Community, into an affluent quarter of packed, multi-storey buildings lining narrow streets. Business is booming in Versova koliwada. With over 300 trawlers, the approximately 4,000 households here record an annual turnover of approximately Rs 400 crore, says Rajhans Tapke, general secretary, Koli Mahasangh. ""The fishing business we see today is thanks to the co-operative movement. In fact, former chief minister Sharad Pawar always cited us as an example for the sugar industry to emulate,"" said Tapke. The village was the first in the city to boast of a cold storage and its own ice factory .The Tapkes themselves operate a couple of trawlers.A clan of three brothers, they own houses spread out over a couple of multi-storey structures in the village.Currently , there are four co-operative societies in the village, but the Vesava Machchimar Vividhkaryakari Sahakari Society Ltd is the largest with 4,000 members and 271 trawler owners affiliated as members.""Till 15 years ago, the society was responsible for the sale of fish. But now every individual trawler owner strikes his own deals. The society provides the diesel needed for the vessels and ice to store the fish. Most importantly, it regulates the floor price below which no one is allowed to sell. This is to ensure that there is no unhealthy competition,"" said Jitendra Chinchay , a director of the society .The affluence shows in the changed skyline of the koliwada. It is home to several three and four storey-buildings packed so close to one another that one can reach into adjoining structures through windows. The lavish use of marble and granite and the gadgets on display in homes tell how lucrative the business is.Rajendra Kale, chairman of the Vesava Society , said Versova has 3,000 active fishermen and employs about 5,000 people in ancillary activities. While the business of fishing is mostly a male domain, nearly 80% of those who hawk it are women. They handle wholesaleretail trade as well as negotiate long term deals with exporters.""On an average 25-30 trawlers return to the village with fresh catch daily. A trawler returns with fish worth nearly Rs 3 lakh,"" said Kale. Each trawler makes about three trips every month, spending a week out at sea.Tapke, however, says trawlers are forced to foray further out every time in search of fish and laments government's indifference to the trade. ""The sea is treated like a dumping ground. There is no proper treatment of sewage before it is released in the sea. The waters around Versova are so dark we stopped fishing here nearly over 25 years ago,"" he said.Versova creek is the largest of the inlets along Mumbai's coast. Several streams from Malad, Goregaon, Kowte, Erangal, Amboli and Oshiwara empty into it and, in turn, it opens into the sea at Juhu. Efforts to divert sewage and effluents away from the natural channels are limited or still in progress. The large volumes of waste flowing through the drains in the western suburbs eventually make their way into the Versova creek.""Even the Mithi river seems cleaner,"" said Tapke. Most of the flotsam gets washed up on the shore eventually . The boats now travel almost 50 nautical miles into the sea, said Pradeep Tapke , who owns two of them. The fishermen venture as far as Jaffrabad in the Kathiawar peninsula and Ganpatipule in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district.Along with growth in fishing activity , village elders have taken the lead in backward integration to minimize waste and improve profitability. Fish waste is converted into manure after it's dried on the beach or used as chicken feed by poultry farms. ""The tiny fish which have no market are sold to the food processing industry through suppliers,"" said Raj hans Tapke.Among other sources of revenue are a three-day Versova Fish Festival which Tapke has been organizing since 2005. This year, the village set up 60 stalls and each earned around Rs 5-6 lakh.The total business in those three days amounted to nearly Rs 4 crore.Recently , residents of highrises in the vicinity took the lead to rid the beach of plastic waste. Now that the stretch looks cleaner, Tapke senses an opportunity . He hopes to use a part of the beach to put up stalls on a permanent basis, provided the authorities are willing."

Major landmarks of the town including the railway station, bus stand and the police station are located on this stretch.Among local people, unemployment is a major issue particularly after the numerous mills and private industries that used to operate out of the township closed down. In the past, there were industries run by the Modi group which used to produce cloth, oil, tyres and lanterns apart from dozens of other products.""The local youth are unemployed after the mills closed down. Only a sugar mill runs in the township. But that's not enough to provide largescale employment. Successive governments have failed to generate employment opportunities in the region,"" said Jitender Kumar Chaudhary, a local trader.The farming community in Modinagar is largely dependent on cane production. However, cane farming has also been hit due to lack of timely payment of dues. In the past two decades, several private educational institutes have cropped up in Modinagar making it an education hub.A plethora of private higher educational institutes offering engineering, dental and management courses dot the Modinagar township.""Farmers and those who lost their livelihoods from the mill closures cannot afford to send their children to these private colleges. Not a single government has ever thought about providing adequate educational facilities for the local youth in Modinagar. The mills should be revived to garner more employment opportunities,"" said Kanchilal, a local resident.Demonetization seems to have had an impact on the petty traders who were dealing only in cash till late. Only one of the seven ATMs in the main market had cash when TOI visited the township.A section of traders was nonetheless all praise about Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Modi has a huge following here. The Samajwadi Party does not have enough confidence to win the polls. That's why they have teamed up with Congress,"" said Shiv Kumar, a local resident.Voters in the assembly constituency said issues surrounding cane cultivation have always decided the outcome of elections in Modinagar. The Chaudhary Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has a strong political base in the region given its politics over the plight of cane farmers.Out of the eight assembly seats in NCR, Modinagar was the only one in which a candidate belonging to the RLD had won the elections in 2012. Sudesh Sharma of the RLD had trounced his nearest rival, Rajpal Singh of the BSP, by 13,949 votes.The assembly segment of Modinagar is under Baghpat parliamentary constituency. In the last Lok Sabha elections, former Mumbai police commissioner Satyapal Singh won from the area on BJP ticket. RLD supremo Ajit Singh trailed at third position in Modinagar.This time, Modinagar is the only seat in NCR from which a major political party has fielded a woman candidate. The BJP has fielded city-based gynecologist, Dr Manju Siwach, as its candidate from Modinagar."

The retail price of sugar, which was at an average of Rs 28Rs 38 per kg at the end of last year, now costs between Rs 38 and Rs 45 per kg.There is expected to be a shortfall of 40% in sugar production by April when the new season begins, officials said. Figures from the state cane development suggest that production in Karnataka has hit below 40 lakh tonnes from an average of 50 lakh tonnes a year.Thirty-five sugar factories, largely in Belagavi and Bagalkot region, have stopped functioning owing to poor supplies,'' said Kurubur Shantha Kumar , president of the State Sugarcane Growers' Association.Shantha Kumar doubts whether farmers will get better prices owing to decrease in sugarcane yield. This is because the poor quality of produce this year might result in lesser prices since it is linked to the sugar recovery rate (percentage of production from a tonne of sugarcane).""Prices are going up because of high demand as traders are stocking for the festive season."" he added."

Shetti, during his first Assembly election, had coined the phrase Vote Daya Note Daya (Give me your vote also give me a note).Watch What Else is Making NewsIn 2015, Ingole had made the headlines for his public interest litigation (PIL), seeking payment of interest to cane growers on late fair and remunerative price (FRP). The Aurangabad bench of the Mumbai High Court had directed the sugar commissioner to look into the matter and repeated hearings were held. Notwithstanding low sugar prices, millers had raced to clear the dues in fear of payment of interest.Talking about his debut in electoral politics, Ingole said, Being a small-scale farmer, Shetti had managed to take on the ruling elite and fight elections through crowdfunding. When I decided to throw in my hat for the electoral battle, I decided that my campaign too, would be crowdfunded.Ingole is seeking election from the Malegaon Panchayat Samiti ghat, which has 10 villages in it.Ingole said the response to his decision was overwhelming. Till Monday, I had already managed to collect Rs 15,000. Every village I went to, people went out of their way to help me, he said.At a few places, Ingole confessed, he could hardly control his tears. Farm hands went out of their way to donate for my election. Even though they are not voters in my constituency, he said.The villages, Ingole aims to represent, are from the arid regions of Ardhrapur taluka of Nanded district. Other than cane and soyabean, pulses are major crops in the area. The region has seen a rise in farmer suicides over the last few months.

The money was sent by Zezvda, a Bulgarian company, said ED officials.Georges company, Trade International, had been operating with a valid licence. Within a few days of the transfer, George withdrew `30 crore from the account and deposited it in the accounts of his relatives. A Customs Department scrutiny of documents submitted by George to show details of goods shipped to Zevzda, found that no commodity was exported against the LoC.

Most schools sample checked in the audit were lacking in infrastructural facilities like kitchen sheds, proper utensils, availability of drinking water facility etc. There were several instances of food being cooked in the open in unhygienic conditions, the report found.Few lessons seem to have been learnt from the shocking case of negligence that left 23 children dead and dozens others seriously ill after they ate a pesticide-laced midday-meal at a primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman in the Saran district in Bihar in July 2013. A month later, 30 children fell ill in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh; and in November 2014, 25 children fell ill after eating their mid-day meal at a government school in Gaya district in Bihar.In July 2016,40 students fell ill in Chincholi village of Adilabad district of Telangana after eating food prepared in the school kitchen for a farewell party for seniors. In September that year, 25 students were hospitalised in Kolar district in KarnatakaIn September 2015, about 150 students in Chandoor town and Ilapuram village in Telangana started vomiting after their mid-day meal.Such cases of food poisoning are very rare and take place in remote areas due to lack of proper supervision and maintenance of kitchen. Otherwise, there is a periodical check on the quality of food by officials, parents committees and teachers. Even we eat the same food regularly to ensure the quality, said L Ravinder Rao, a senior headmaster in a government school in Ranga Reddy district of Telangana."

This year, a 10-kg lump cost Rs. 370 during the festival season. After that, much against market wisdom that the price might dip to Rs. 350 or Rs. 340, it had risen and touched an unprecedented Rs. 370 for lowest quality. For the best variety it went up to Rs. 400.Usually we get around 15,000 to 17,000 lumps a day on an average around this time of the season. But having never seen such a price, farmers are bringing in more and more quantities and at present it is 27,000 to 29,000 lumps, says president of the Anakapalle Merchants Association K.V. Sarat Kumar.For one pakam (traditional measure for nine lumps of 15 kg each), farmers used to get a take home profit of Rs. 1,500 but now it has more than doubled, he analysed, adding farmers had never seen such a high price.Crop failure inMaharashtraThe buying spree is attributed to the interest shown by traders from Krishna district. The reported sugarcane crop failure of almost 60 % in Maharashtra could be a contributing factor.However, as against the usual market condition of 50% each going to direct sale and storage, only 20 % is going to sale and 80 per cent to cold storage, he says. Stocks account for about 6750 tonnes so far at the Anakapalle market with an annual turnover of about Rs. 130 crore. Another reason for low direct sale is that the Uttar Pradesh market is quoting at about Rs. 60 less than that of the Anakapalle price. The gap generally used to be Rs. 20/Rs. 30, Mr. Sarat Kumar points out."

Majority of the sugar mills are shut and distressed and indebted cane-growers are reportedly facing near starvation.The highest ever production estimation was revealed by a state delegation at a high-level meeting called by the Centre in Delhi two days ago to assess sugar production in the country. UP's figures of around 80 lakh tonne surprised the Centre and representatives of other cane growing states as with this the state is all set to record the highest ever sugar production.Talking to ToI, secretary general of UP Sugar Mills Association, Deepak Guptara said that the farmers deserve special mention for introducing varietal changes in the crop and researchers for the new high yielding crops, while the state government played a key role in implementation of the plans and programmes which resulted in another feather to UP's cap. He, however, added that the climatic changes in Maharashtra were also a factor in sharp decline in sugar production in that state.With the highest sugar production in UP this year, to be declared officially by March end, the sugar industry is all set for a revolution as cane and related activities are to get a boost and its benefits are to be harvested by the farmers, mainly nearly 35 lakh sugarcane growers.The record production of sugar will not only stabilise the price of the product in the market, but would also result in timely payments to cane-growers, even as sugar mills would profit from selling more. In the previous cane year, the state had produced 68.55 lakh tonne. Guptara shared, ""We are selling the sugar substantially in sugar deficient states this time.""The record production in sugar is linked to increase of sugar recovery in sugarcane from around 9 per cent till last year to more than 10 per cent this year. It also got a push with growth in productivity from 59 tonne per hectare to 67 tonne per hectare. Moreover, the government has been able to overcome the barrier of transfer of hybrid and high quality seeds of sugar from lab to land.The government is confident that a record sugar production will not only invite more investment in sugar mills' expansion and modernization programmes, but also restore the faith of cane-growers in cane cultivation."

Dr Ketan Khurjhekar with 97-year-old Bhanudas.BHANUDAS Mane Deshmukh asks his sons to help him sit up so that he can show them he can move his legs. Lending his father a hand as he proceeds to stand up, Vinayak admonishes, smiling, Dont shake them too much!Deshmukh is 97, and currently recovering from a surgery to repair a severely crushed spine that paralysed him last year. A follow-up visit on February 1 this year showed he had made remarkable recovery.Dr Ketan Khurjekar, Head of the Department of Spine Surgery at Sancheti hospital here, who led the operation, told Deshmukhs sons, He will be able to walk after regular exercises.Watch what else is in the newsAround June last year, Deshmukh started getting pain in his legs, rendering him almost immobile. Doctors found that he was suffering from tandem spinal stenosis, in which neurological compression in numerous areas of the spinal cord leads to functional loss.Vinayak admits that his father, a farmer from Bondle village in Maharashtras Solapur district owning 70 acres, who had been active all his life, found it impossible to lay inert in bed. They are a large family, comprising Deshmukhs nine children, including two daughters, and several grandchildren.Says Vinayak, My father could not lift his legs, passed urine without realising it and was heartbroken over the fact that he could no longer go to the temple and sing bhajans. His elder brother was a freedom fighter and was fit till he died at the age of 99. Deshmukhs wife too lived to old age, dying five years ago.Deshmukh pressed his sons for a surgery. The family also explored a hospital in Solapur and read about the disease on the Net before zeroing in on Sancheti Hospital.Dr Khurjekar admits that when the family first approached him for the operation, he was sceptical. Bhanudas had slipped vertebrae, bony outgrowth pressing over the spinal cord, and we were unsure whether a 97-year-old man could sustain anaesthesia.Apart from that, repairing the compressed spinal cord in the upper and lower back in a double surgery, over one sitting, was a challenge. The doctors only gave the go-ahead after experts monitored Deshmukhs vital parameters and found him fit for his first ever surgery.Vinayak points out that Deshmukh has never suffered from anything more major than fever or cough. The local ayurvedic doctor would manage all that. He doesnt have diabetes or hypertension etc, and doesnt even need spectacles.Dr Khurjekar told the family that after surgical decompression, there could be complete recovery of bowel function, and with therapeutic exercises, the patient could walk. That was all the 97-year-old wanted to hear.After pre-operation procedures that reconfirmed that Deshmukh was in excellent health, he underwent the two-hour-long operation on December 8 last year. While he was discharged after 10 days, a medical team including chief anaesthetist Dr Bharati Adhye and several others monitored him constantly.Deshmukh, who still enjoys his milk, sugar and bhakri made of jowar or bajra, is now waiting to resume his monthly visits to the temple town of Pandharpur, a distance of 30 km, which he used to cover on foot. I have missed going there for six months. My time has come again, he says, flashing a wide smile.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The post-Partition face of the Indian Muslims, Maulana Azad, was keen to contest an election from a constituency with a sizeable Hindu population to prove his secular credentials when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insisted he contest from Muslim-majority Rampur district instead. Nehru didnt want to take a risk with the electoral fortunes of one of his key lieutenants. A reluctant Azad eventually agreed, and although he managed to have his way by contesting from Gurgaon in the 1957 elections, the die had been cast: a Muslim politician in UP was seen to need the crutches of his co-religionists to win an election.Azad at least had the stature to be seen as a genuine ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Azam Khan, the Samajwadi Partys (SP) most-prominent Muslim face and its MLA from Rampur, typifies a dangerous brand of aggressive Muslim-first politics masquerading as secularism. His strident rhetoric is designed to consciously appeal to his Muslim constituency: Rather than speak of how he intends to lift the community from the morass of under-development, his focus is on stoking their worst fears and insecurities. In the Azam Khan worldview, the way to win elections is to portrait Narendra Modi as an ogre, someone Muslims should be very frightened of.Read: My India My Vote: Uttar PradeshAnd yet, despite his abominable public utterances (one of the worst was when he suggested that the Kargil war was won by Muslim soldiers), the SP has chosen to stick with Khan because it suits their political agenda of wooing the states 18% Muslim vote. The partys original vote bank was built in the early 1990s on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, with Mulayam Singhs shoot-at-sight orders against kar sevaks at the height of the Ram Mandir movement conferring him the honorific Maulana Mulayam. The standing joke in Lucknow was that if any influential Muslim cleric approached Mulayam, he would be rewarded with an official post.Truth is, the SP has failed to offer the UP Muslim genuine security or social uplift: Patronage of Muslim elites or donations to madrasas have had almost no impact on the lives of citizens. The numerous small and large riots that have occurred in UP in the last five years are indictments of the claim to have ensured communal peace: The worst example being the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots where the local administration clearly failed to act swiftly or in a non-partisan manner.Perhaps, sensing an opportunity, the BSP leader Mayawati has attempted to challenge the MY alliance with her own DM (Dalit-Muslim) social engineering. By giving tickets to 100 Muslims including mafia dons like Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati has made an attempt to break the Yadav stranglehold over the Muslim vote. There have been previous attempts to create a Dalit-Muslim unity, most notably in Maharashtra, but never has it been tried on the scale that Mayawati is now seeking. It is this fear of a divided Muslim vote rather than any principled commitment to secular values that has spurred the Samajwadi-Congress alliance.Read: UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe BJPs response is even more troubling. Despite the PMs promise of sabka saath, sabka vikaas, on the ground there has been a concerted attempt by the local BJP leadership to identify issues that will create a Hindu-Muslim polarisation. If in 2014, the party exploited the Muzaffarnagar riots, this time, issues like a proposed ban on slaughter-houses, a national debate on triple talaq, the alleged flight of Hindus from Kairana in western UP, have been raked up on election eve with the sole intent of consolidating a Hindu vote. The pernicious love jihad campaign of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and the hate speeches of BJP MPs like Sakshi Maharaj and MLAs like Sangeet Som expose their bigoted mindsets.Trapped then between the opportunistic politics of the so-called secular parties and the demonisation by Hindutva forces, the average UP Muslim voter is left feeling angry and frustrated. They dont want to embrace the self-appointed thekedars of the community like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid who pops up just before elections despite his growing political irrelevance.They may be attracted to a more articulate leader like Asaduddin Owaisi but are also acutely aware that the Hyderabad MP is only a spoiler at election time. Indeed, if the Muslim voter prefers the SP-Congress alliance today, its because of a visible lack of options, and the fear that he will be soon left without any political voice in the state when confronted with the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the first when not a single Muslim was elected MP from UP.Read: Why UP matters: Can Indias most populous state decide the fate of Delhi?The answer to the Muslim dilemma does not lie in the growing radicalisation of the young who want to express themselves in more violent terms. Nor is it in seeking sops from the state, which are seen as token appeasement. It must lie, at the very core, in the recognition of the economic inter-dependence of communities: A Jat land owner in a sugarcane field in Baghpat must make common cause with the Muslim agricultural labourer as must a Muslim weaver in Banaras with a Hindu sari shop owner for mutual benefit. This can only be enabled by a leader with vision and credibility who enjoys the trust of both communities: Uttar Pradesh is crying out for a 21st century Azad and Nehru.Post script: In the aftermath of the post-Ayodhya riots, Lucknow was remarkably free of any bloody communal conflict. An elderly gent explained it to me with a poetic touch: In this city, Hindu and Muslim are like taala and chabi (lock and key), one cannot do without the other.What Lucknow thinks today, hopefully India will think tomorrow.The writer is senior journalist and authorrajdeepsardesai52@gmail.com"

History shows us a different picture and the department is committed to finish the work within two years.""Shivnath Biyani, member of road and railway passengers association, said, ""We had been demanding this project for last many years. The doubling of existing track would increase the number of trains from Miraj to other destinations.""He added, ""The South-Central Railway has completed doubling of track till Belgaum and would soon reach Gonda. Therefore, work should be completed within two years. But the railway is known to not follow deadlines. The biggest beneficiary of this project is industries in western Maharashtra. It would boost sugar, bauxite, coal, jagery, grains and textile transportation.""Vijay Bhosale, member Pune divisional railway consultant committee, said, ""The doubling of track will boost passenger transportation. The citizens in western Maharashtra heavily rely on road transportation. The projects could reduce the time to reach Pune and Mumbai. Even double track help in transport of perishable goods."""

We are big pranksters and love to whip up offbeat, path-breaking recipes, the 32-year-old Dhopatkar tells us. He met his partner-in-crime, 31-year-old Lakhani, in 2015 at a pastry demonstration in Delhi. Just before the event, she had cut her finger and there was no first aid. I jumped in to help her set-up makeshift cake stands as some of her equipment had not arrived. I got to eat her cake too, he laughs. Lakhani later visited his kitchen, and the two were appreciative of each others talent. Though Ashay and I are like yin and yang in the kitchen. Sugar and salt! says Lakhani.Although Dhopatkar always wanted to be a chef, hes given his medical entrance examination and passed it too. But that was, he says, Just to prove to my parents that I could. I didnt take up the course, and moved [instead] to Goa to pursue hotel management. Hes also graduated with an MBA from University of Wales and a culinary arts course from Hammersmith and West, London. Luckily, his career landed him at several restaurants run by Michelin star chefs, including Herbert Berger, Mark Hix and Gordon Ramsay.Lakhani on the other hand, joined Le Cordon Bleu, Canada, after she reached a stagnating point in her job at a garment export company. She later joined ITC Maurya in Delhi as a kitchen executive chef, and also trained under pastry stars like Pierrick Boyer and Peter Yuan.For their Mumbai meal, the duo has planned a meal with deep European influences. Our food is European, but with an amalgamation of global flavours. For example, we do a hedgerow garlic dumplings with wasabi mayo. In this dish, the hedgerow is British, mayonnaise is French and wasabi is Japanese, says Lakhani, who in the past has also consulted at Le Bistro Du Parc, Noida.When queried on the use of molecular gastronomy, Dhopatkar says, [Using it] helps enhance the experience by assisting in achieving impossible textures and flavour combinations. But it shouldnt be used as a sheer gimmick.For their Mumbai pop-up, their menu includes interesting dishes, including whipped cauliflower  cauliflower espuma (foam) with candied walnuts, pistachio crumb and white truffle oil  saffron risotto with prawns and chorizo with parmesan air, and a salted caramel Magnum bar. We attempt to turn simple, everyday ingredients into a refined avatar, without adding too many flavours. Most of our dishes are inspired by our experiences, travels and mother nature, he says.To book the eleven-course tasting menu (Rs. 4,200 for vegetarians and Rs. 4,700 for non-vegetarians) by the Troublesome Duo at Magazine Street Kitchen at 7.30 p.m. on February 18, see insider.inOur food is European, but with an amalgamation of global flavoursNeha LakhaniChef"
58ff14ba7be9e0429666d485,"UP Election: If Muslims Prefer the SP-Congress Alliance, It's Due to Lack of Options",http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/if-muslims-prefer-the-sp-congress-alliance-today-it-s-due-to-lack-of-options/story-CTv2wOpHGl28Kye3ILttQP.html,2017-02-17,"The complicated and controversial notion of a Muslim vote bank stretches back to the first general elections in 1952. The post-Partition face of the Indian Muslims, Maulana Azad, was keen to contest an election from a constituency with a sizeable Hindu population to prove his secular credentials when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insisted he contest from Muslim-majority Rampur district instead. Nehru didnt want to take a risk with the electoral fortunes of one of his key lieutenants. A reluctant Azad eventually agreed, and although he managed to have his way by contesting from Gurgaon in the 1957 elections, the die had been cast: a Muslim politician in UP was seen to need the crutches of his co-religionists to win an election.Azad at least had the stature to be seen as a genuine ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Azam Khan, the Samajwadi Partys (SP) most-prominent Muslim face and its MLA from Rampur, typifies a dangerous brand of aggressive Muslim-first politics masquerading as secularism. His strident rhetoric is designed to consciously appeal to his Muslim constituency: Rather than speak of how he intends to lift the community from the morass of under-development, his focus is on stoking their worst fears and insecurities. In the Azam Khan worldview, the way to win elections is to portrait Narendra Modi as an ogre, someone Muslims should be very frightened of.Read: My India My Vote: Uttar PradeshAnd yet, despite his abominable public utterances (one of the worst was when he suggested that the Kargil war was won by Muslim soldiers), the SP has chosen to stick with Khan because it suits their political agenda of wooing the states 18% Muslim vote. The partys original vote bank was built in the early 1990s on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, with Mulayam Singhs shoot-at-sight orders against kar sevaks at the height of the Ram Mandir movement conferring him the honorific Maulana Mulayam. The standing joke in Lucknow was that if any influential Muslim cleric approached Mulayam, he would be rewarded with an official post.Truth is, the SP has failed to offer the UP Muslim genuine security or social uplift: Patronage of Muslim elites or donations to madrasas have had almost no impact on the lives of citizens. The numerous small and large riots that have occurred in UP in the last five years are indictments of the claim to have ensured communal peace: The worst example being the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots where the local administration clearly failed to act swiftly or in a non-partisan manner.Perhaps, sensing an opportunity, the BSP leader Mayawati has attempted to challenge the MY alliance with her own DM (Dalit-Muslim) social engineering. By giving tickets to 100 Muslims including mafia dons like Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati has made an attempt to break the Yadav stranglehold over the Muslim vote. There have been previous attempts to create a Dalit-Muslim unity, most notably in Maharashtra, but never has it been tried on the scale that Mayawati is now seeking. It is this fear of a divided Muslim vote rather than any principled commitment to secular values that has spurred the Samajwadi-Congress alliance.Read: UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe BJPs response is even more troubling. Despite the PMs promise of sabka saath, sabka vikaas, on the ground there has been a concerted attempt by the local BJP leadership to identify issues that will create a Hindu-Muslim polarisation. If in 2014, the party exploited the Muzaffarnagar riots, this time, issues like a proposed ban on slaughter-houses, a national debate on triple talaq, the alleged flight of Hindus from Kairana in western UP, have been raked up on election eve with the sole intent of consolidating a Hindu vote. The pernicious love jihad campaign of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and the hate speeches of BJP MPs like Sakshi Maharaj and MLAs like Sangeet Som expose their bigoted mindsets.Trapped then between the opportunistic politics of the so-called secular parties and the demonisation by Hindutva forces, the average UP Muslim voter is left feeling angry and frustrated. They dont want to embrace the self-appointed thekedars of the community like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid who pops up just before elections despite his growing political irrelevance.They may be attracted to a more articulate leader like Asaduddin Owaisi but are also acutely aware that the Hyderabad MP is only a spoiler at election time. Indeed, if the Muslim voter prefers the SP-Congress alliance today, its because of a visible lack of options, and the fear that he will be soon left without any political voice in the state when confronted with the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the first when not a single Muslim was elected MP from UP.Read: Why UP matters: Can Indias most populous state decide the fate of Delhi?The answer to the Muslim dilemma does not lie in the growing radicalisation of the young who want to express themselves in more violent terms. Nor is it in seeking sops from the state, which are seen as token appeasement. It must lie, at the very core, in the recognition of the economic inter-dependence of communities: A Jat land owner in a sugarcane field in Baghpat must make common cause with the Muslim agricultural labourer as must a Muslim weaver in Banaras with a Hindu sari shop owner for mutual benefit. This can only be enabled by a leader with vision and credibility who enjoys the trust of both communities: Uttar Pradesh is crying out for a 21st century Azad and Nehru.Post script: In the aftermath of the post-Ayodhya riots, Lucknow was remarkably free of any bloody communal conflict. An elderly gent explained it to me with a poetic touch: In this city, Hindu and Muslim are like taala and chabi (lock and key), one cannot do without the other.What Lucknow thinks today, hopefully India will think tomorrow.The writer is senior journalist and authorrajdeepsardesai52@gmail.com"

From here, it traverses 1,312 kilometres through three states  MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat  before finally emptying into the Gulf of Cambay. Tashi Tobgyal The Narmada, the fifth longest river in the country, rises near the Amarkantak range of mountains in Madhya Pradesh. From here, it traverses 1,312 kilometres through three states  MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat  before finally emptying into the Gulf of Cambay. Tashi TobgyalAt Chikalda village in Madhya Pradesh, the Narmada flows quietly. Its hard to gauge the river here  only the locals who dive in to collect coins thrown by devotees from the bridge nearby know its exact depth. This stretch of the river, said to be one of the spots where Mahatma Gandhis ashes were immersed, has witnessed many an agitation over a dam, the Sardar Sarovar, over 150 km away, in Kevadia colony of Gujarat. On February 8, the countrys apex court scripted what may well be the final chapter in a decades-old legal battle over the river and its waters.The Supreme Court directed the Centre and the Madhya Pradesh government to pay the final compensation of Rs 60 lakh to each of the 681 project-affected families which had refused the aid offered by the government. While giving the government two months to make the payment, the court set a deadline of July 31 for the families to vacate the area, failing which, the bench said, they would be evicted.Watch what else is making news:The court order paves the way for the Sardar Sarovar dam, among the most ambitious multi-purpose projects in the country, to be operated at full capacity. The Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), had, among other things, wanted the court to stop the government from using the dam to full capacity until all the project-affected were rehabilitated. While the Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal had in 1979 ruled that people affected by the project should be given land in return for what they stood to lose, the Madhya Pradesh government soon ran out of agricultural land it could offer. So far, only 239 people have got land in the state. More than a decade ago, the government drew up a financial package, the Special Rehabilitation Package (SRP), with the compensation to be paid in two installments.While 3,366 families accepted the second and final installment  they are now out of the purview of the apex court ruling  1,358 families accepted only the first installment but turned down the second. These families will now get Rs 15 lakh as ordered by the court.Rukadiya Dhangar, 47, Chikalda village, Badwani districtDhangars is among 681 families who sought land in exchange for land acquired and rejected all compensation packages offered by government. With SC order, he now stands to get Rs 60 lakh, the only one in his village to get the amount. Tashi Tobgyal Dhangars is among 681 families who sought land in exchange for land acquired and rejected all compensation packages offered by government. With SC order, he now stands to get Rs 60 lakh, the only one in his village to get the amount. Tashi TobgyalIt wasnt easy to hold on, but Rukadiya Dhangar did  for over 30 years. The 47-year-old from Chikalda village in Badwani district and his family are among 681 in Madhya Pradesh who steadfastly refused any compensation in lieu of the land they stood to lose if the Narmada rose and swallowed their fields. Dhangar says he only wanted land in exchange for his four acres, where he grows wheat and maize; not the cash the government offered him.One by one, people in Chikalda and those in neighbouring villages accepted, willingly or unwillingly, what the state government had to offer. Across the state, 3,366 people accepted the governments financial compensation. For, what was certain was that some day, the river would rise and their fields would submerge. While some people got land and moved out of their homes, others took the money they got and bought land elsewhere.A few kilometres before Chikalda, a village of 700-odd families on the banks of the Narmada, villagers talk about Dhangar, of how lucky he is. He is the only one in the village eligible for the Rs 60 lakh compensation; 15 others took the first installment but turned down the second  they now stand to get Rs 15 lakh.Dhangar is glad he held on. People in the village are jealous. They say I am lucky; it was no luck. Hamne himmat rakhke patak rakha (I showed courage and refused to give up the land), Dhangar says. It was not easy for me all this while. My family suffered because we had no money for my sons treatment: he met with an accident and I had to spend Rs 4.5 lakh. There were times I wondered if I was doing the right thing what if everyone accepted what was given to them and I would be left alone with my worries, he says.Women on their way to fetch water from the Narmada. Many villagers fear that if they give up their fields along the river, they would end up with land that has no irrigation. Tashi Tobgyal Women on their way to fetch water from the Narmada. Many villagers fear that if they give up their fields along the river, they would end up with land that has no irrigation. Tashi TobgyalThrough all these 30-odd years, as Dhangar travelled to Delhi and Bhopal, among other places, to take part in NBA-led agitations, he married, fathered four children  one son and three daughters  but didnt give up the fight.Though his fight was for alternative land  Medhaji (NBA leader Medha Patkar) had said we should not settle for anything else  the compensation of Rs 60 lakh was something he hadnt expected. Though he is still waiting for details of the apex court judgment, he believes each of the five members of his family will get Rs 60 lakh. Wont we, he asks.His hut, which is off the main road, does not fall in the government-notified area that will be eventually submerged but his four-acre agriculture land in Gelgaon, a couple of kilometres away, will go under when the gates atop the dam in Gujarat are complete.Anyway, I am glad I waited. Now I will decide what to do once I get the money. Until then, I am not moving out of here, he says.Ramesh Solanki, 40, Chikalda village, Badwani districtPolice arrested Kalabais husband, Ramesh Solanki, because he allegedly produced fake registration papers for land he never bought.

Tashi Tobgyal Police arrested Kalabais husband, Ramesh Solanki, because he allegedly produced fake registration papers for land he never bought. So far, police say, nearly 3,000 fake registries have been detected in Badwani, Khargone and Dhar districts. Tashi TobgyalSitting inside her house in Chikalda village, Kalabai, 35, breaks down at the mention of her husband. They came and took him away as if he was some criminal. They took away some papers from here and did not explain anything. I have no idea how my two children and I will survive this, she says.As villagers try to calm her, she says, You wont understand. Only a woman who has gone through something like this will knowOver 45 days ago, her husband, Ramesh Solanki, 40, was arrested by the Badwani police for his alleged involvement in a fake registry scandal. The scandal, which first came to light in 2007, had farmers in Badwani, Khargone and Dhar districts allegedly colluding with brokers and government officials to strike land deals that existed only on paper. In order to get the second installment of the Special Rehabilitation Package, farmers had to buy land and produce registration papers as proof. But many allegedly produced fake documents and claimed the money.Ramesh had taken the first installment of a little over Rs 2.80 lakh. The family of three brothers owned 7 acres in all and each adult male member was eligible to claim compensation. While his brothers bought nine acres, Ramesh didnt. He claimed the second installment of around 2.79 lakh after allegedly producing fake registering papers for a plot of land he bought in Bagli, Dewas district.Over six years ago, the government instituted a judicial inquiry into the scandal. The final report of the Justice S S Jha Commission is yet to become public.Kalabai and her relatives claim brokers and government official cheated poor, illiterate farmers by getting them to put their thumb impressions on papers. Ramesh is now in Bagli jail in the states Dewas district. I have not met him since they took him away. I dont even have money to go there, she says. She has one other regret. He was hungry when the police came but they did not even let him have food.Tulsiram Yadav, 51, Chikalda/Nanakbedi village, Badwani districtTulsirams family got Rs 13 lakh as compensation for their 13 acres. They used that money to buy land in another village and now cultivate both these plots. They are among 2,033 project-affected families in MP who bought alternative land. Tashi Tobgyal Tulsirams family got Rs 13 lakh as compensation for their 13 acres. They used that money to buy land in another village and now cultivate both these plots. They are among 2,033 project-affected families in MP who bought alternative land. Tashi TobgyalI was in school when I first heard of the dam in Gujarat and how we could lose our land some day. But it was only some decades later, in 2001, when we received a notice saying that our land would be acquired, that it hit home, says Tulsiram Yadav, standing in his field in Chikalda village.The land he stands on 13 acres of the family-owned 16 acres  was acquired by the government in 2004. Back then, the two brothers got a little over Rs 13 lakh as compensation, which they used to buy 16 acres in Nanakbedi, a few kilometres away. We put in some money of our own, Yadav says. They also returned the residential plot they were given by the Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) and invested the Rs 50,000 they received for it to buy more land.He says he is glad he took the compensation. I now grow crops on both my plots  the one in Chikalda and in Nanakbedi, he says, adding that the family lives in Chikalda. Rules allow land owners to cultivate their original land until it is submerged. In some cases, land gets submerged only during the monsoon and farmers often go back to cultivate once the water recedes. While the family grows wheat on the Chikalda land, in Nanakbedi, they now grow sugarcane after a new sugar factory came up nearby a couple of years ago.I keep shuttling between the two plots because both require attention, says Tulsiram, adding that one of his two sons helps him in the field; the other works for the state electricity board. He thinks he can do this for another five years, maybe even more. I think it will take another five years before the dam reaches its full height. Until then, I will get to keep both my plots, he says.Jahriya Mania Solanki, 58, Khalbujarg village, Dhar districtJahriya and family moved out of their submerged village to land offered by government. Of the 4,621 families entitled for land compensation, 239 got land. Tashi Tobgayal Jahriya and family moved out of their submerged village to land offered by government. Of the 4,621 families entitled for land compensation, 239 got land. Tashi TobgayalSPORTING a big headgear and a bigger smile, Jahriya Mania Solanki says he doesnt know how far he is from what had been his home for generations but now, he says, this is home. Five years ago, Jahriya, his wife and 10 children, along with the families of his four brothers, moved from their village Bhadal, in Badwani district, to Khalbujarg in the states Dhar district, where they got adjacent plots spread over 5 acres and where they now grow cotton.We dont how how far we have travelled because we are all illiterate. All we know is that its a long way from here. We have to change three buses to reach the Narmada and then cross the river to go to the other side, says Jahriyas nephew Devji.It was in 1998 that the government acquired the familys 17-acre agricultural land in Bhadal village. Dekhte dekhte hi dub gaya (the land submerged before our eyes), says Jahriyas younger brother Ohariya, talking of how they had been hearing for at least 30 years of how the river would one day consume their fields. While they waited for alternative land to be allocated, the family lived in a village nearby, till they got the land of their choice.He says they were also offered land near Maheshwar in Khargone district. But when we went with police and government officials, the villagers there attacked us. We later found out that some people had encroached on the plot that was meant for us. They started fighting and asked us to return, recalls Jahriya, adding that it was only four years ago that they got this land in Khalbujarg, 90 km from Indore and 140 km from their home.Talking of the SC order, Jahriya says, We thank our stars that we got this land. An acre here costs around Rs 25 lakh. Our family wouldnt have been able to buy 5 acres for Rs 60 lakh. Our next generations will do well in life. He says though they are happy here, the family is yet to get the residential plots they are entitled to as part of the rehabilitation package.They did give us land to build homes, but that is five km from here and we turned it down. We have now asked for plots closer to our fields, he says. The family  the four brothers and their families  now live in a makeshift house near their field. Whatever it is, this is now home. We dont get time to miss our old home. We are busy here, says Devji, adding that they have bought a tractor, which they take turns to use.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

""Mahesh Sir"" is Kadam's Dombivli-based positivity guru and Kadam is a 38-year-old personal trainer displaced from his natural habitat five minutes ago. As the glassy gym of a stockholding firm in Navi Mumbai start filling, Kadam sits in the conference room next door. Turning his swivel chair to one side, the bodybuilder puts both his feet up in the air. ""Eighty,"" he says, lifting the right calf. ""Twenty,"" he says, lifting the left. Given his strict diet and workout regime, those figures should have been ""sixty"" and ""forty"", the average strength distribution ratio of a bodybuilder's lower half. But, under his monosyllabic answers and stilted swagger, this two-time Mr India winner hides a lifetime of polio.Kadam was three when his Satara-based parents had dunked him in buckets of hot water to will sensation back into his left leg. At 19, he first felt those virus-weakened muscles shiver. ""I still remember the date. August 16th, 1997,"" says Kadam, about the day he started working out in a Parel gym, after being goaded by his uncle and his brother, a bodybuilding champion. Two years later, Kadam enrolled in the ""open"" category at a district-level bodybuilding championship and went on to win several medals till 2006 after which he took a break from the expensive sport to focus on his career. Today, ten years later, the fitness trainer is ready to drop his pants and don a serial number on his crotch again. ""I want to be Mr World,"" he says. His first step towards that would be to participate in the Indian Bodybuilding Federation's (IBBF) 17th Junior Masters championship in Indore this weekend.He is one of the four physically challenged participants from Maharashtra in the segment, for which over 40 disabled athletes from all over India will congregate for two days. This event where the prize money has grown from Rs 5,000 in 2009 to the present Rs 50,000, speaks to bloating interest in the spectator sport. Not only has the number of bodybuilders with leg impediments from accidents or medical conditions, doubled in eight years but also more organisers are inserting this category in their shows, spawning avenues and cash prizes. For instance, Belgaum's Satish Sugars Classic recently gifted the physically challenged gold medallist Rs 75,000 while Pune's Swayambhu Shree boasted prize money of Rs 1 lakh. In part, this spurt has to do with the lure of international platforms since last year. ""These athletes inspire others with disabilities to take up the sport,"" says Chetan Pat-hare, general secretary, IBBF.While a medal opens up government jobs for regular athletes, the most a disabled champion can hope for is credibility in the fitness space or a resume frill in a private job application. Still, they persist, to find retribution for their weakness. Sion's Inder Rao, 26 recalls doctors dissuading him from working out. ""They said it will permanently damage the structure of the leg,"" says the polio victim. But for Rao, the gym seemed like the only legitimate escape from bullying. Rao avoided socialising and dropped out of engineering college. In 2010, he joined a gym with his father's permission.Inevitably, their fitness journey starts with pain. After an elaborate trial-and-error that saw Rao writhing for the first few days, he evolved a fitness regime that puts minimal pressure on his right leg. ""I do most of my workout in the sitting position,"" says Rao. Today, 11 medals and four certificate courses later, Rao trains ten physically-challenged clients and is now ready for another national contest. The prize money isn't enough to cover the expenses for these musclemen who spend Rs 600 per day on chicken, eggs and multivitamins. However, rewards come in the form of standing ovation and poignant comments. At times, attention from women online, who Rao doesn't indulge. ""They don't seem to like me when they see the full picture,"" he says.Not only has the number of bodybuilders with leg impediments from accidents or medical conditions, doubled in eight years but more organisers are inserting this category in their shows"

And, surprisingly, the palm-fringed shores keep in store a volley of veg delicacies as well. Konkon cuisine is a potpourri of so many culinary traditions.You will find Tulu preparations along with typical Portuguese dishes from Goa. Our menu is very balanced with equal veg and non-veg options, says executive chef Ashok Eapen.We start with a crunchy raw-mango salad, crisp and refreshing. Paneer cafreal in its spicy-tangy green coating rolls in after that.A variation of the popular chicken dish, the soft paneer pieces just melt in your mouth.Coriander and fresh chillies are the main ingredients in the green paste used for marination, says the chef. The salad bar is elaborate with a solid variety including the desi coconut-and-kappa, egg cocktail and pesto-coated seafood pasta.Next comes the coastal staple, rice, served with three different chutnies and chicken ghee roast. All spices are roasted in ghee for that special flavour and aroma, says the chef. Among the condiments is the truly delectable veppilakkatti, made of tamarind and curry leaves. Dried shrimp powder is roasted with spices and coconut for another while the next one has ground peanut as the main ingredient.Manglorean crab masala is equally spicy and yummy, with a faint flavour of roasted coconut. It goes well with gralic naan, or Kerala paratha or roti for that matter. The masala we use is home ground, its very essential to maintain the spice balance.He adds that another highlight of the menu is Malvani fish curry, prepared using fresh seer fish. Cumin, coriander and black pepper is used for marination and then dry mango is added for the pungency. Its usually served with steamed rice, he says. We wind up the meal with moderately sweet bebinca, the Goan dessert made of flour, ghee, egg yolk and sugar.The menu features some famed preparations like pork vindaloo and bulgogi along with an array of treats of vegetarians.

What's more, it may also be sweeter and better than the current crop.The Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a new onion variety called 'multiplier onion variety,' which would make this possible.It is presently undergoing tests at multiple locations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to evaluate its performance in different weather conditions. Scientists said initial findings of the tests are positive and have achieved the desired results so far.They added that the variety is expected to be released nationwide in 2019.Project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of DOGR told TOI, ""There is no special variety of onion for south Indian dishes that has been released at the national level. So far, farmers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are cultivating varieties developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). But the yield of these varieties is limited. Hence, we decided to develop the special variety, which can be recommended at national-level for other states farmers to grow it.""The variety, named DOGR-1549-Agg, is the first multiplier onion genotype registered with the ICAR-NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources) in New Delhi.Commenting on the variety's strength, Gupta said, ""It matures early and is suitable for both Kharif (July-October) and Rabi (October-March) seasons. It has an average yield potential of 22 tonnes to 24 tonnes per hectare."" Gupta added that the variety has six small bulbs per cluster.Presently, farmers in South India are growing TNAU-developed onion variety called CO(On)5, which can grow only in Rabi season and has a yield capacity of 18.9 tonnes per hectare. Each cluster of this variety produces three to five bulbs, Gupta said.TNAU's horticulture department head T Saraswati told TOI, ""This is a positive development for growers as they can get high harvest. Secondly, if this variety is released nationally, states other than the southern ones can also grow it.""When specifically asked about the taste of the newly-developed variety, Gupta said, ""Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is a crucial factor as it defines sugar percentage in the onion. The TSS of CO(On)5 is around 12%, whereas TSS in our variety is between 16% and 22%. Hence, it will be suitable for South Indian dishes."""

593d4f287be9e00e964d57b0,"Animal cruelty cases don’t compel offenders to even come to court, suggests BSPCA data",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/animal-cruelty-cases-dont-compel-offenders-to-even-come-to-court-suggests-bspca-data-4535353/,2017-02-21,"(AP Photo/Andy Wong) (AP Photo/Andy Wong)Animal cruelty cases, which are both bailable and account for scanty fines, dont compel offenders to even come to court, data suggests. Between 2011 and 2016, the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) has registered over 20,000 cases of animal cruelty at various police stations.However, in 13,089 of these cases, the accused did not appear in court, but still paid the fines. The fines for animal cruelty are too meager for a person to not hesitate to harm a domestic animal again, said Lt. Col (Dr) J C Khanna, BSPCA Secretary. BSPCA, is probably the largest complainant in animal cruelty cases in the city.Watch what else is in the newsThe Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals (PCA) Act 1960 covers all forms of physical torture or abuse against animals. Any such act is punishable for the first time with a fine of Rs 10 which may extend up to Rs 50. The fine for the second offence ranges between Rs 25 and Rs 100.Under the Widlife Act, cruelty to animals like peacocks, which is a non-cognisable and non-compoundable offence, the maximum punishment as per Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, is six years, or a fine of Rs 25,000, or both. In some case the offender is asked by the government to pay Rs 500 but that is the maximum. When we register these cases we try to add as many charges against the offender to increase the fines but the fines are still too little to have any impact, Khanna added.According to data, the number of animal cruelty cases under PCA rose for three years between 2011-13 before showing a decline in the next two years. Khanna attributed this dip to the decision of putting ban on sale or use of a number of animals like bullocks, which were used to transport ice and sugarcane in the city. In 2011, the court cases reported were 3,333, the subsequent years recorded 3,379 and 3,974 cases.In 2014, however, a slump in such cases was noticed and the number stood at 3,083 cases, a further dip to 2,966 was observed in 2015. Interestingly, the number of animal cruelty cases again rose in 2016 with 3,357 cases that went to court.In all of the 20,092 cases registered by BSCPA that went to any Metropolitan magistrate in Mumbai, only 7,003 cases saw convictions.The animal cruelty cases that go to trial only last a maximum of two hearing, depending if the offender doesnt come to court on the first hearing. These cases are very quickly dealt with, where the judge would only ask Gunaah kabool hai? (Do you admit the crime?) and the offender because he has appeared in court says kabool (admit) and pays the fine and the matter is over, Khanna said.The data further indicates that cattle  cows, bullocks, goats, etc  are most cruelly treated. A steady rise in cruelty cases against cattle was observed between 2011-13, with 1,842, 2,189 and 2,957 trials reported respectively.In 2014 and 2015, an average of 2,340 cases went to court. While, the previous year saw 2,862 cases registered for cruelty against cattle. Over Rs 40 lakh has been collected in fines, of which Rs 30 lakh was with BSPCA to pay their employees and treat the injured animals, while the remaining Rs 10 lakh went to the states treasury.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Shivajirao Nagawade Patil, president of the federation, reasoned the country will not face any sugar shortage as the crushing season 2017-18 is expected to start in the first week of October.Till Monday, the country produced 147 lakh tonne (lt) of sugar.Watch what else is in the newsSome mills are still operational in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Considering the present trend, the country will produce 215-16 lt of sugar by the end of season. The carry forward stock of last season is 77 lt so the country will have 293-94 lt of sugar stock at its disposal till the next season starts, he said.Even if one takes the national yearly demand as 250 lt, the next season will start with a carry forward stock of 43-44 lt, said Nagawade Patil. The festive season, which starts from the month of October, will also not see any sugar shortage as the crushing season will be starting early. The fresh stock of sugar will be available by October 15, he said.Import of raw sugar, Nagawade Patil said, will not achieve the price parity that the government is looking at but will impact the present prices of sugar in a negative manner. The landing cost of raw sugar at 10 per cent duty will work out to be Rs 38 per kg. Post processing, the ex factory price of the raw sugar will be around Rs 40 per kg and the retail price will be between Rs 42 and Rs 44 per kg, he said. The demand of sugar traders for import duty reduction, he said, will not help the farmers or the millers.Demands of some millers for lowering of import duty of raw sugar and allowing them to treat it during offseason was also not viable according to him. Once the boilers of the mills are switched off, Nagawade Patil said, it will be difficult for them to turn it on before season.Only mills that have crushed to their full capacity will have bagasse to use as fuel in off season. Rest of the mills would have already exhausted their bagasse in running their co-generation plants or as fuel during the season, he said. Most of the mills in Maharashtra had gone for under capacity crushing so barring a handful of private mills none of them have any extra bagasse. On the other hand mills from Uttar Pradesh had gone for full capacity crushing so they will be able to re-ignite their boilers using stored bagasse and process raw sugar, he said.At present, retail price of sugar in India is Rs 42 per kg, which Nagawade Patil said will not rise. We have asked our members to increase sales so that there is no shortage of sugar, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Dairy farmers at a milk procurement centre with a rapid chiller facility in a Tamil Nadu village.The near-quadrupling of milk procurement by dairy cooperatives in Gujarat over the last 15 years  from an average of 45 lakh litres to about 170 lakh litres per day  has been attributed no less to a single factor: 24-hour power in rural areas, including guaranteed three-phase supply for eight hours, enabling village-level societies to install bulk milk coolers (BMC). These, with capacities ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 litres, chill the milk to around 4 degrees celsius at the primary collection point itself, inhibiting microbial growth that can lead to undesirable quality/taste changes and expedite spoilage.But maintaining the freshness of raw milk sourced from farmers isnt all that the BMCs have done.In the pre-BMC era, the milk collected by the society had to reach the dairy plant by 8:30 am or so, before day temperatures rose. It required procurement to start by 6 am and farmers undertaking milking at least an hour earlier, so as to not miss the tanker. The sheer need to hurry through the process, moreover, limited the number of animals that could be milked. With BMCs, the milk was chilled at source and remained fresh, which gave farmers the flexibility to deliver even at 9 am. They could now afford to expand their herd size and supply more milk. Today, an estimated 80 per cent of milk collected by Gujarats dairy unions comes through BMCs and it is not difficult to see the link between these and higher procurement volumes.Watch What Else Is making NewsNot every state, unfortunately though, is Gujarat  where farmers have assured electricity supply allowing milk to be chilled not very long after it has left the udders of cows or buffaloes. In much of rural India, power supply is irregular, which means even BMCs cannot do without the backup of diesel generators.This is where an innovation by Promethean Power Systems, a Pune-based company founded by two men from Boston has made a difference. In 2011, Sorin Grama and Sam White built the final prototype of a Rapid Milk Chiller (RMC) based on a proprietary Thermal Storage System (TSS) technology. At the heart of it lay a thermal battery, which drew and stored electricity from the grid as and when available. This stored energy it then released to rapidly chill the milk collected from farmers at ambient temperatures  say, 35 degrees  to 4 degrees Celsius.The duo initially sought to establish the feasibility of a solar-powered milk chilling solution. While the trials were successful, their prospective customers, however, wanted a system that was less bulky (solar panels take up too much space), more cost-effective (which was not the case with solar technology in 2010), and easier to operate. Further, solar-based chilling wasnt seen to be necessary in places where there was at least intermittent power supply, even if unreliable. The thermal battery could be charged whenever electricity was available; the trick was to decouple supply of power from chilling. From this emerged the alternative TSS technology, which was more economical and better-suited to general Indian rural conditions.Grama and White launched the TSS-based RMC as a pilot project six years ago near Goa. In 2013, Promethean Systems began commercial operations in India. We have so far sold over 500 units in the country and these have already chilled more than 150 million litres of milk supplied by 25,000-plus farmers, says Jiten Ghelani, CEO of the company.The systems main advantage is the flexibility it gives for chilling milk at village level, even without consistent grid power or diesel generator backup. Typically, BMCs run on gen-sets for 50 per cent of the time, resulting in both high operational costs and 25-30 per cent more carbon emissions, notes Jofi Joseph, Director of Sales & Marketing.Chilling at source is a win-win for both dairy plants and farmers. Milk is a good medium for growth of microorganisms. Chilling within about an hour of milking basically prevents the build-up of bacteria converting the lactose or sugar in the milk into lactic acid, which curdles the proteins and causes souring. Dairies, then, get access to milk with less microbial load and spoilage possibility, while farmers, too, benefit from flexibility with regard to delivery time and increased herd size. Besides, they can expect to fetch a quality premium in terms of price per litre.The buyers of our RMCs arent individual farmers. The processors sourcing milk from them are the ones investing in the equipment, costing Rs 5-6 lakh each, and installing these in their respective village-level collection centres, explains Ghelani, whose company claims to have developed a customer base across Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.Amul dairy currently has a collection centre at Pahad Dhara, a village in Punes outskirts, where it has put up an RMC. Earlier, we had a regular BMC that used to operate most of the time on diesel, entailing a monthly expense of Rs 35,000 a month. With the RMC, which was installed roughly a year ago, we are now spending only Rs 5,000 on electricity, notes Devadnya Dilip Wagh, a coordinator at the chilling centre that procures an average 600 litres per day of milk from 20 farmers in the village.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

His supporters ensured the day is aptly celebrated with the hope that the party will retain power in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. However, February 23 proved to be a day of disaster for the NCP, with the party facing defeat in both the cities, which played major role in Sharad Pawars 50-year political career.Only solace for Pawar supporters is that Rohit Pawar, grandson of Appasaheb Pawar, elder brother of Sharad Pawar, won the zilla parishad election from Baramati tehsil. It is for the first time that somebody from the Pawar family contested a zilla parishad election.Pawars mother Shardabai was member of a local board in the pre-independence era.Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule began their political career by contesting the Assembly or Lok Sabha electiond.Rohit Pawar, who is handling a private sugar mill, preferred to begin his political career by contesting grass root election. The NCP has managed to retain the Pune zilla parishad by begging 44 seats. However, the BJP has won seven seats for the first time, while the Congress and NCP have bagged nine seats each. The zilla parishad election indicates the BJP and Sena have made considerable inroads in Pawars bastion.Setback to Pawar family is continuation of the 2014 Lok Saha elections, when the first serious signal of decline in Pawars hold over Pune city and district was experienced. Two months ago, anti-Pawar forces in Pune district had managed to win municipal council elections in Pune district, reducing NCP to Pawars home town of Baramati. Several NCP workers deserted party in the past two months, indicating Pawar has lost his grip over workers.The NCP was controlling Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations almost for two decades. They are now captured by the BJP. Both cities will have BJP mayors without any help from other parties. The NCP will now be the opposition party in Pune, with the party strength coming down to 38 from 52. Several prominent NCP leaders in Pune had lost elections, forcing Pune unit president Vandana Chavan to resign from the post, hours after the results were announced.Pimpri-Chinchwad has come as a big shocker for the NCP as former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was single-handedly controlling civic affairs. It was part of Sharad Pawars Baramati Lok Sabha constituency before delimitation in 2009. The NCP will be the opposition party in PCMC, with party bagging only 36 seats. In the dissolved house, the NCP had a majority of 82 members. The NCP failed to win voters here despite several development works in industrial township.NCP leaders admit it paid a heavy price for large scale defection in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The BJP managed to get three top NCP leaders in Pimpri-Chinchwad to win. Similar experiment was carried out in Pune in a few areas.Growing feeling among NCP cadre is that the Pawar family has lost its influence over party workers. The outcome has made NCP workers anxious as Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar looked into tje Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections and addressed a number or public rallies.The NCPs decline began in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when Sharad Pawars daughter Supriya Sule got elected with a small margin of 70,000 votes, against the huge difference of four lakh in 2009. Many believe Sule would have lost had Rashtriya Samaj Party president Mahadeo Jankar fought the election on BJP ticket.Ajit Pawars victory margin in Baramati Assembly constituency was reduced by 2,000 votes, while the party lost several sets in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune district.NCP leaders admit it would be tough time for the party because of series of serious setbacks in electoral politics after 2014.Read more: NCP possibly the biggest loser in the local bodies electionsParty over for Sharad Pawar?

The number one position held by the NCP has gone to BJP, which rose from the fourth rank taking its numbers from 165 seats to 400 seats. Even in western Maharashtra, the NCPs bastion, it may have retained its lead in zilla parishad, but its seats declined from 195 to 154 across the sugar belt of Ahmednagar, Sangli, Satara, Pune, Kolhapur and Solapur. The biggest gain in the sugar belt has been recorded by the BJP, which increased its number of seats seven times from 10 to 75.In 2012, the total seats of the BJP in these six zilla parishads was only 10. In Sangli, Satara and Solapur it had not won any in the last elections. The state senior NCP leadership told The Indian Express that it will review the poll results to ascertain where it went wrong and what were the factors that worked against the party.However, several leaders spoken to argued that despite a decline in the overall number of seats, at least in 10 to 12 zilla parishads the NCP along with Congress will be in a position to take reins of the zilla parishad to keep the BJP and Shiv Sena out of power. The NCP has established a clear lead in Parbhani, Beed, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur. But the biggest setback was in Sangli where it gave way to BJP as the leading party.Watch What Else Is Making NewsWhile taking the loss for the party in stride, NCP (MP) and leader Supriya Sule said, We humbly accept the verdict of the people. We will surely introspect and rebuild our base.The critical factors which appear to have worked against the NCP, which is grappling with its image makeover since the 2014 assembly elections, include the partys failure to tackle the in-house unrest and political aspirations of the sugar barons, who are ready to switch sides for assured political future. In the recent elections, powerful local NCP leaders in several districts in western Maharashtra switched from the parent party and formed independent outfits under the banner of Vikas Aghadi (Development Alliance), uniting local groups including the BJP to challenge the Pawars.In Pandharpur, former NCP leader Prashant Paricharak formed the Pandharpur-Mangalvedha Vikas Aghadi, giving the BJP an edge. In Barsi taluka, former NCP (MLA) Rajendra Raut along with the partys district general secretary Arun Kapase crossed over to the BJP to make a dent in the NCPs power. At Madha, former NCP leader Sanjay (Mama) Shinde joined hands with the BJP to forge an alliance  Vikas Aghadi  to fight the NCP. His brother Baban Shinde is the sitting NCP (MLA).At Satara, NCP (MP) Udayan Raje Bhosale had challenged parent party through Satara Vikas Aghadi. Although the dissidents worked in varying measures, it did dent the NCP. In the 2012 elections, the BJP tally across Pune, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur was as low as 10 seats out of 416 in western Maharashtra. The NCP with 195 seats took the lead followed by Congress with 132 seats, Shiv Sena with 24 seats, MNS with nine seats and others at 41 seats.The BJPs hold had always remained weak in western Maharashtra compared to Vidarbha, North Maharashtra and parts of Marathwada.

Supriya Sule, the daughter of Sharad Pawar, barely managed to win from Baramati.According to Pawar, the current decline in the NCPs fortunes is due to the failure of the party to sell itself properly. We believe in working and letting our work speak for itself. Unfortunately, we failed to tell our own story, and thats the main reason behind the electoral debacle, he said.As a party, NCP believed in cadre-based organisation, but it had failed to capitalise on the power of social media, said Pawar. In some cases, we were not able to effectively defend ourselves on those platforms, he said.Like his illustrious great-uncle, Pawar enters into politics was with quite a bang. He managed to garner the second-highest number of votes in Maharashtra in his maiden election.During our election campaign, we walked for over 230 kms and ensured we reached at least 98 per cent of voters homes.

This concoction is poured into a copper barrel, or 'sancha', which is placed in a wooden barrel of ice. The mixture is then churned by an old hand - also coincidentally named Vali - until it solidifies. Taj is one of the last hand-churned ice-cream parlours left in the city.Valiji's original recipe of milk, sugar and fruits - no colours or preservatives - has remained largely unchanged over the years. But the shop now offers 15 flavours including mango, kesar, tender coconut, and roasted almond chocolate chip, all sold at Rs 60 a scoop to about a hundred customers daily. Sitafal, however, remains the favourite and is often carried by NRIs back to Karachi, Kuwait and London. (A loyal customer even inspired the shop name: Tajbhai, a friend of Valiji's son, who would travel to Mumbai from Ahmedabad just to eat the ice-cream.)Despite the lack of advertising and modest outlet - now on Bhendi Bazaar 's Khara Tank Road - many celebrities have sampled the fruity dessert including Farooq Abdullah, Pankaj Udhas Johnny Walker and Madhubala . A 1969 banquet in honour of the Shah of Iran gave bulk orders for Taj ice cream and Delhi Darbar's biryani. ""The Iran consulate made it a condition,"" recalls Hatim Icecreamwala, ""They told the Taj that we will occupy your hotel but during the party these two items will come from outside.""Both father and son are ice-cream fanatics. ""Whenever we travel, the first thing we try is ice-cream,"" says Aamir, who used to churn ice-cream for fun after school and joined the family business last year after quitting a real estate job in Dubai.The shop will be bulldozed under the Bhendi Bazaar redevelopment plan but the Icecreamwalas have been assured alternative accommodation while construction is underway - and a similar street-front location once the project is complete. Aamir says they aren't perturbed by new fads like frozen yogurt and liquid nitrogen ice-cream because their customers crave an ""authentic, organic, milky"" flavour.They recently registered their outlet on Scootsy, Faroma and Zomato, delighting many of their farther-flung customers. ""The idea is also to reach out to many people who don't know about Taj,"" says Aamir. ""We want to continue the legacy."""

The plan, which was started as a pilot in the western suburbs last October, focuses on helping the police cut down on obesity, acidity and insomnia.The state of the Mumbai Polices health came into the spotlight after commentator Shobha De tweeted a picture of Daulatram Jogawat, a police inspector in Madhya Pradesh, and captioned it heavy bandobast, in an attempted barb at the Mumbai Police. Jogawat, who suffers an insulin imbalance, has been offered medical help by doctors in Mumbai.Watch What Else Is making NewsBetween October and January 2017, Diwekar had personnel at eight police station located between Bandra and Andheri West in the polices Zone 9 fill out forms detailing their daily lives  the hours they spent commuting to and from work, the number of hours they work and sleep, and most crucially, the number of cups of tea they consume.The answers, not surprisingly, only underscored the stressful conditions that the police functions in. Policemen and women wrote back saying that their commute averages three hours, their sleep six hours, and work 14 hours.Diwekars team then attended morning parades at police stations to dispense one simple tip every day. The first month, we gave four tips on food, the month after four tips on exercise and last month, four tips on sleeping, said Diwekar, adding that she had to ensure that the tips were doable and impactful.The first month, Diwekar said, was spent dispelling myths and misinformation among the police about food. Bananas make for a great breakfast, but a lot of them believed that they are fattening. In fact, they are the best thing to eat during bandobast duty, she said.The oral tips were followed by a series of posters stuck to the walls in each police station, the first of which advised the police to switch to bananas for breakfast to get rid of headaches and improve stamina, while others advised a short break after lunch. The most important one though, advised the police to cut down on their tea consumption. There are so many better alternatives easily available. Sugarcane juice is very rejuvenating, she said. The police was advised to consume lemonade, kokum sharbat and coconut water instead.Overdoing tea and irregular meals, Diwekar said, was at the heart of police officers being racked with acidity. Diwekars food plan involves small meals spaced through the day, Id like them to eat two rotis in the morning and two for lunch. But with the unpredictable, what happens is that they skip lunch. By that time they are hungry and acidic. Then they eat a heavy dinner which results in the felling acidic and less sleep. By the time they wake up, they do not feel fresh. It was a cycle of eating one junk food after another, fasting and feasting, she said.Apart from advocating rotis, ghee and jaggery, Diwekar also recommended munching on peanuts in the evening to satiate hunger.Diwekars tips on food, exercise and sleep have been collected into a Marathi booklet which will be launched by Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar on March 8. A senior IPS official said that it is imperative that a culture of healthy food habits be introduced in the force.Where other initiatives by previous heads of the police force in the past decade have withered, Diwekar said that this time, it is simply a matter of persisting long enough to bring changes into practice.It is not that they dont want to bring changes in fitness and health, they just dont have the right information, she said.At the end of January, Diwekar had the police in zone 9 fill out exit surveys to gauge what impact the short programme made. Every police officer in zone 9 has started implementing at least one of the twelve tips. They look leaner, acidity levels are low and sleep is better and their energy levels are up, she said.However, a middle-aged police constable posted in Andheri said that it isnt always practically possible to implement Diwekars tips and not suited to changes in the routine work. This plan does not address the real issue, which is a shortage of manpower. The current food plan is well intentioned but cannot be successful unless the strength of the police force is increased and an eight-hour work day is introduced, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Inspector Daulatram Jogawat, who weighed 180-kg, underwent a bariatric surgery at a Mumbai hospital on Thursday for reducing the volume of the stomach to curb the food intake.Two IPS officers, Kushum Punia a 2010 batch officer of Jharkhand cadre, and Kumar Gautam, a 2011 batch officer belonging to West Bengal cadre, were sacked from the service as they failed to clear their mandated physical fitness tests as probationers.They were reinstated only after they cleared the test. Punia had not cleared her swimming test as part of basic course for IPS officers at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, while Gautam didnt clear cross-country race test.Taking a strict view of the matter, the Union home ministry discharged them from service last year. But they sought another chance on compassionate ground following which they appeared for the test and cleared them. We have not reinstated them, a home ministry official said. The message is very clear. The IPS recruits will have to take their physical fitness parameters very seriously, said the official.This is not only case when the home ministry has taken a stern view over adherence to physical fitness parameters of newly inducted IPS officers.

Two young officers who were sacked last year for failing to clear the 'swimming' and 'cross-country race"" tests as part of the IPS foundation course, were reinstated last month after they, on being allowed a second chance, managed to clear the two key physical fitness papers.Similarly, while one 2015 batch IPS probationer having weight issues has been issued show-cause notice for failing to pass the ""cross country race"" test, two probationers from the 2016 batch, one of whom was found overweight and another showed a high blood sugar level, had to make do with a provisional medical fitness certificate. The two were asked to work on reducing their body mass index and blood sugar to permissible levels before being declared ""medically fit"" for confirmation as IPS officers.Kusum Punia, a 2010 batch IPS officer belonging to Jharkhand cadre, was discharged from service last year, even as she was on probation, for failing to clear two of the 14-15 papers that make up the basic course for IPS probationers at the National Police Academy. Sources said Punia was sacked as she did not respond to repeated pleas and multiple opportunities to take the two tests.Another 2011 batch IPS probationer from the West Bengal cadre, Kumar Gautam , was sacked along with Punia last year for not clearing the mandatory cross-country test paper.However, after they filed a plea seeking a second chance, Union home minister Rajnath Singh, taking a compassionate view in the light of their humble family background, allowed them to be reinstated but on the condition that they clear the remaining papers of NPA course. Both Punia and Gautam reappeared for the said papers and having passed them, will now be confirmed as IPS officers.Sources said the initial action against Punia and Gautam has sent a strong message among IPS probationers who tend to take their foundation course at NPA lightly. ""The probationers now realise that they will have to face the implications if they fail to clear all the papers in the course,"" said a senior officer of the home ministry, which is the cadre-controlling authority for IPS officers.A 2015 batch IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre, meanwhile, has been slapped a show-cause notice on why he should not be discharged from service for failing to clear the cross-country test paper, which is mandatory for confirmation as an IPS officer. Sources said though he has appeared for the test more than once, he could not clear it as he has weight issues and collapses while running.At least two IPS probationers from the 2016 batch at NPA had to wait before being declared medically fit ahead of confirmation. While one of them was found to have a body mass index of 32.15, way above the internationally acceptable standard, another was found to have a high sugar content in his blood.Both were given time to cut their BMI and blood sugar level and made to reappear for a second medical test after a few months. It was only after they satisfied the maximum BMI and sugar level criteria that they were declared medically fit, paving the way for their confirmation.""The underlying principle behind insisting on physical fitness of IPS probationers is that they should be ready to meet the high fitness levels demanded by a career in the police services,"" said an officer.

NABARD, as per the latest instructions of the RBI, has submitted the verification report of accounts last week and the banks hope this would be the last inspection they would have to go through. The DCCBs that are stuck with large amount of withdrawn notes hope the RBI would now give them the green signal to exchange these notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSoon after demonetisation, the RBI had passed several orders that had crippled the functioning of the DCCBs. Not only were they not allowed to deposit old currency notes, but the deposits they had received during the first two days were not allowed to be exchanged. The DCCBs had moved the Supreme Court for relief and during the hearing the RBI had expressed doubts over the KYC compliance of the DCCBs. In its order the apex court had asked the remittance of the old currency notes, but had asked for 100 per cent KYC compliance of the accounts that had deposited the specified bank notes (SBNs). The 31 DCCBs in Maharashtra have Rs 4,311 crore in SBNs which they want to exchange.After the December verdict, the RBI had asked NABARD to undertake the inspection but procedural details were lacking. During the first phase, NABARD had physically inspected 25 branches of each DCCBs and submitted their report. Subsequently, the DCCBs were asked to submit KYC details of each and every account in triplicate. However, this exercise proved to be cumbersome and collection of documents for all the 370 DCCBs in the country would have been a tedious job. The RBI had there by instructed NABARD to physically inspect the KYC documents of accounts that had seen deposits over Rs 50,000. The inspections got over last week and now the DCCBs are hoping for an early end to their predicament.In Maharashtra the DCCBs have always been commended for their extensive rural outreach. At many remote places these are the only banks and suspension of banking services had affected the rural populace severely. Acting as bankers for cooperative institutions these banks depose of salaries of sugar mill workers, primary teachers, anganwadi workers, dairies, etc. Till January, the banks had seen outgoing RTGS of more than Rs 7,000 crore while incoming RTGS was just around Rs 4,000 crore.

Such a calamity could paralyse the country's southern states this year unless the governments take steps on a war footing to conserve water, warn experts.Conservation through harvesting and recharging groundwater are the lessons waterstarved states teach their drought-affected counterparts even as experts emphasise on discouraging farmers from carrying out cultivation of waterguzzling crops like sugarcane during such challenging times.The depleting water levels in major reservoirs in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have caused concern over the crisis in these states. While several parts in the four states have already been declared `drought-hit', experts have suggested measures to save the available resources for the coming months.Former Central Water Commission (CWC) chairman A B Pandey said states must begin conservat ion of water.""Drought-hit states must calcu late the avail ability of wa ter and start the process of reducing sup ply so that the existing amount lasts till June at least,"" he said. Noting that Latur woke up to the crisis only at the fag end of it because of which things went out of control, he said, ""It is necessary for the drought-affected states to kickstart conservation plans including in farming.""The desert state of Rajasthan has succeeded in implementing conservation of rainwater to meet the requirements during summer.

""We carried out multiple recharge measures in different parts of the state, which has varied landscape of deserts and plains. Concrete structures were constructed beneath the surface in desert areas to allow the water to percolate deep into the ground,"" he said, adding that 50 blocks had been removed from the red zones of water scarcity after the programme was launched in 2015.Pointing out that the Rajasthan model could be emulated elsewhere, Vedire, who is also the advisor to the Union water resource ministry, said it was the need of the hour in southern states facing drought."

Nirmal Harindran Radhika Shinde at work. Nirmal HarindranTHE first time she peered into the privates of a goat in Injbaon village, surrounded by the goats incredulous owners, all Sangita Tupe, 30, could see was the shock on the faces around her. Over two years later, she no longer needs to tell villagers that she is a trained entrepreneur working on artificial insemination of goats. Those who laughed at me, who said women shouldnt do such jobs now call me to come urgently when their goat is in heat.Sangita is one of seven women entrepreneurs trained by the Mann Deshi Foundation, based in Mhaswad in Maharashtras Satara district, to artificially inseminate goats. Trained in association with non-profit Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) in Phaltan, Satara, the seven women are now locally called goat doctors, though none studied past Class X. Back in 2013, the women learnt of Mann Deshis new training programme either when they opened accounts at the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank or when the Mann Deshi bus, a mobile training institute offering courses in tailoring, sewing, mehndi etc, stopped in their village.Radhika Shinde, 31, of Panwan village, 12 km from Mhaswad, was eight months pregnant when the big luxury bus showed up. I began to attend tailoring classes secretly, when everybody was at work in the fields. Then one day my father-in-law found out, she giggles. One of the seven sisters, Radhika was married off at the age of 14, in the summer holiday after she completed Class VII. Her parents-in-law were labour contractors for a sugar factory, and family members were all signed up to work as harvesters in the cane-cutting season. Her three childrens education stalled every time the family packed up and moved to the cane belt. She saw an opportunity in 2013 when, amid a severe drought, the goat-breeding class emerged as an option to bring some money home.Farm incomes are never enough now. My husband works as a driver. At first the family didnt want me going around filling semen into goats, but now everyone is proud, Radhika says.The seven women receive an average of 30 calls a month. They visit the goat, check if she is really in heat and carefully inject the semen-straws purchased from NARI for Rs 75 each. Every visit is charged at Rs 150, but if a goat doesnt get pregnant at the first attempt, a second visit is discounted by 50 per cent. The women also earn a monthly salary of Rs 4,000 from Mann Deshi. The semen straws are stored in a special canister of liquid nitrogen, also supplied by NARI. At weekly meetings in Mhaswad, the women update detailed records of every goat inseminated, its breed, the breed of the semen, the item number on the semen straw, the post-gestation results, etc.The seven have inseminated over 3,000 goats; 2,265 have delivered while 400 are currently pregnant. Government veterinarians conduct artificial insemination too, but these women have a higher strike rate, at nearly 85 per cent. We only inject the semen if the conditions are right, and we instruct the owners properly on after-care, including ensuring the goat is kept away from any male goat, says Nanda Jadhav, 30, of Goregaon village.Vanita Shinde of the Mann Deshi Foundation says the programme began with a pilot project in two villages, Jambhulni and Pulkoti, where the organisation selected 25 healthy goats for artificial insemination, conducted free sonographies and kept them in a separate enclosure. The results were excellent: Most bore three kids, yielded more milk and the offspring, at three months, were over twice the average weight of goats born without artificial intervention. In terms of productivity, both for milk and for mutton, artificial insemination brings larger profits to breeders, she says. That the majority of home-based livestock businesses are women-run is a happy coincidence, for their work thus eventually brings more financial autonomy to the village women.Apart from insemination, the women also offer poultry vaccination shots, at Rs 3 a shot. Nanda vaccinated 2,000 chicken last month, adding Rs 6000 to her income. The seven women all have stories of personal struggle, and triumph. Nanda, who has a 11-year-old son, was abandoned by her husband years ago. Sangitas husband works as a construction site painter in Mumbai, while she lives in Injbaon with three children. Rajshri Jadhav, 29, was married in 2003 when she was barely 16 years old, her groom selected at a government-run cattle camp where hundreds of families were camping to avail fodder and water amid a drought.Sangita and Radhika used to work as daily wage labourers under MGNREGA  hours of back-breaking toil. Radhika and Nanda worked as the us-tod kamgaar or sugarcane harvesters, a job that required being away from home for two months at a stretch. Sangitas husband would sometimes borrow a two-wheeler to drop her off. Two years ago, they bought their own Activa. Rajshris husband sold his one-year-old bike for a Scooty, so that his sari-clad wife could ride. He says maajhi bayko doctor aahe (my wife is a doctor), and hes learnt to milk a cow and get some work done at home instead of sleeping all day, she laughs.Villagers in neighbouring areas recognise the women in their lab-coats and badges, carrying their canisters. Those who mocked us now say come in, chaha ghya (have tea); they call us doctor madam, says Sangita. Her own three daughters now in school, Sangita says women who have daughters are still pegged lower in the villages complex social ladder. They scorned me, so I was doubly determined, she says. Now those same women marvel at how I managed to put aside Rs 1.5 lakh to build my own house. Sunita Tarlekar of Mann Deshi says they are now expanding the programme, hoping to increase the number of trained women from seven to 20, and then 40. The women are also ready for the next level. Sangita says, Why cant we also learn to do sonographies and other procedures, for goats and also for larger animals? If we can get the right training, theres nothing to stop us.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f501e97be9e018510a1711,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"
58f57a207be9e01a357a1681,City wakes up to goodness of cold-pressed juices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-wakes-up-to-goodness-of-cold-pressed-juices/articleshow/57489812.cms,2017-03-06,"Exercising to keep fit in our modern, fast-paced life is important, but even more crucial is eating right to complement our workout regimen. And like multigrain and brown bread have replaced white bread, organic vegetables have taken the place of regular greens, so too for juices. Sipping fruity drinks out of a can or making them in conventional juicers at home is so yesterday. For the health-conscious crowd, the latest dietary must-have is cold-pressed juices. So why are cold-pressed juices so good for you? Because they are prepared through a process in which no heat is generated  unlike in conventional juicing techniques  the juice itself preserves more of the nutrients and natural goodness of the fruit or vegetable (see box). What's more, apart from the regular orange, apple and guava, cold-pressed juices are available in many exotic varieties  chia seeds, celery, collard, wheatgrass, courgettes, mangosteen, kiwi and more.When we asked nutritionist Hena Nafis about the efficacy of cold-pressed juices, this is what she told us, ""Juicing as a trend is a western concept and has become popular in India over the years. The best part about cold-pressed juices is that they are high on anti-oxidants, but consuming a lot of these juices is not good. Since it may contain so many vegetables and fruits, it is heavy on the stomach. I don't prescribe it to my patients who want to lose weight.""While the demand for cold-pressed juices has been late in coming to Kolkata, we now have two entrepreneurs who are spearheading the movement to make people aware of their products. Their line of juices are supplied to gyms, supermarkets and are also delivered to homes. We met Ashna Chhaochharia , the founder and owner of Pure Haus , which specialises in cold-pressed juices. She said, ""I started my company in May, 2016. Initially, I was a bit sceptical about the concept of cold-pressed juices in Kolkata since the market is yet to open up in comparison with other metros like Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. There, people are more health conscious. Because of a fast lifestyle, people are always on the go, and taking these juices helps to keep the stomach full for a long time. Even my friends, who stay abroad, rave about the goodness of cold-pressed juices. That's when I decided to introduce it to my city. It's not easyintegrating the required amount of vegetables and fruits in your diet if you have a busy schedule. Our products take care of the daily dose of unadulterated nourishment.""Ashna functions with a team of seven members  three of them are part of the production process, one person does the deliveries to gyms and homes, while the other three look after the social media marketing. Pure Haus has different ranges of juices that cater to specific needs. For instance, her cleanse packs can be used for detox, which comes at a price of Rs 1,500, then there are single bottles of juices with various concoctions of orange, beetroot, apple, pineapple, along with imported superfoods like kale, fennel bulb and bee pollen. Each of these bottles is priced between `150-170 for every Rs 250 ml and Rs 250-275 for the 500 ml ones. Apart from that, one can also opt for vegan milk and two types of cashew milks  one with cinnamon, vanilla and honey and the other with Japanese matcha green tea (excellent for weight loss, cancer prevention and lowering bad cholesterol). Abhishek Jhunjhunwala , who runs the other cold-pressed juice brand in town, InSpirit Cleanse , agreed with Ashna that cold-pressed juices have come to Kolkata much later than other cities. Also, since Kolkata is a price conscious market, there are fewer takers for these juices here, since they are not exactly dirt cheap. ""Fitness freaks are aware of the goodness of these juices but then again, their number is not very high. The awareness is a little higher among women aged between 18 and 40. At a time when health ailments are plaguing almost everyone and good habits are gradually getting lost, it is time we take corrective measures to keep ourselves fit. We have held several sampling sessions in supermarkets and people are very keen about the products and awareness is likely to rise in the coming years. But one should also keep in mind that consuming juices or having a healthy diet alone will not help a person to stay fit. Regular workouts are also a must,"" said Abhishek.According to him, sales have gown over the past year. Initially, his brand would sell 15-20 bottles a day, but now the numbers have increased to 200-250 bottles per day. Monthly subscription packages are also on the rise. Since juices are generally consumed after the morning workout, he ensures home deliveries to clients by 7 am. ""I believe we are selling a habit and not a product. Since, we are all addicted to packaged juice and the sugar content in them is very high, it's not good for us. Thus, we brought in the technology for preparing cold-pressed juices, along with nutritionists and dieticians from the USA on board, to create different products that are best suited for Indian markets,"" shared Abhishek.InSpirit Cleanse also has three juice carts  two in the Salt Lake and Sector V area and another one at Park Street  to reach out to new customers and raise awareness levels about the product. The bottles in these carts are priced at Rs 50-80 for every 200 ml. Their range of products covers specific requirements like detox plans for beauty, weight loss, general body fatigue, indigestion and heart diseases, among others."

Sugar prices touched a life time high of Rs 3,950 per quintal on NCDEX twice last week. Prices would remain high given the tight supply situation, experts tracking the sector said.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had lowered its estimates for sugar production during the 2016-17 season (October-September) to 21.3 mt in January due to drought in key cane growing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka. ISMA projected sugar production at 23.4 mt for 2016-17 during its first advance estimates of the crop in September last yearSugar production is estimated to have declined 11% y-o-y to 25.2 mt in the 2015-16 season. An opening stock of around 7.6 mt would result in the overall sugar availability of about 29 mt during the 2016-17 season, which would be able to meet the domestic demand of around 25 mt, analysts said. This would result in carryover stocks remaining in the tight range of 4.6-4.8 mt when the new sugar crushing season commences in November this year, they said.""Due to tight carryover stocks the country may need to import sugar later in the season to meet demand until cane crushing gathers pace by December,"" said Ritesh Kumar Sahu, analyst, agri commodities, Angel Broking.""Thus, we expect the price to touch Rs 4,000 per quintal in futures market during the current season as the crushing season comes to end in Maharashtra and Karnataka early,"" he said.

""Further, with the crushing season drawing to a close in both Maharashtra and Karnataka and both reporting a lower-than-expected output the possibility of the actual output for SY (sugar year) 2017 falling even below the government's estimates cannot be ruled out,"" he stated.Expectations of a decline in output have been driving up sugar prices, which have increased from around Rs 31,500 per tonne in March 2016 to Rs 36,000 per tonne in October 2016. Prices dropped marginally following the demonetisation exercise to around Rs 35,000-35,500 per tonne in November and December. With projections of further fall in domestic production, sugar prices firmed up to to Rs 36,700 per tonne in January."

(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593e11b97be9e00e964d73be,Cultivation Under Contract: West Bengal shows the way in win-win potato farmer-corporate tie-up,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cultivation-under-contract-west-bengal-shows-the-way-in-win-win-potato-farmer-corporate-tie-up-4561007/,2017-03-09,"Representational Image. (PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Gangulys response was sharp. He said, This you do every season.At first, Gangulys comment appeared casual for Parthiv. Then the enormity of what the celebrated Indian captain said hit him. What he meant was I should not be content with what I was doing, needed to do something out of the ordinary to win back my place in the Indian squad, Parthiv said in a conversation with The Hindu here recently.The wicketkeeper-batsman realised he needed to shed weight, improve his glovework and begin dominating the bowling.I then underwent a rigorous morning-to-evening training and practice schedule in the Motera Stadium. I would do stringent fitness routines, practise my keeping and then work on my batting, he said.Parthiv realised that his mistakes as a keeper, most of them in the last session of the day, were not due to any faulty technique.My fitness levels were not quite there and this affected my concentration in the final session where I put down catches, he admitted.The left-handed Parthiv, to whom the cut, pull and sweep come naturally, faced difficulties when bowlers, comprehending his game, pitched the ball up.I worked on my drives through mid-off and mid-on, often practising alone with the bowling machine.The diminutive Parthiv, who shed 10kg coming down to 65 from 75, also dieted, cutting out on fat and sugar.Every three weeks, he would travel to Chennai to get himself assessed by strength and conditioning guru S. Basu.Gradually, Parthiv turned the corner.The results came slowly but when they did, I was a better cricketer.Parthiv returned to the Indian team against England this season  he batted and kept more than usefully  and then led Gujarat to a historic maiden Ranji title. All the effort had paid off.He recalled India coach Anil Kumble knocking on his door on the eve of the Mohali Test and telling him You are going to open tomorrow, I know you can do it.Reassuring wordsParthiv said, Anil Bhais words were so reassuring since I was playing a Test after eight years.The 31-year-old Parthiv responded with innings of 42 and 67 not out at Mohali and then made a strokeful 71 in Chennai  all as an opener.When Parthiv first played for India in 2002 in England, it was in a different era. Sachin Sir, Dravid Sir, Ganguly Sir, Laxman Sir and Anil bhai, they were all there.The first few days I would observe one legend a day from my corner in the dressing room, just see how he went about his work.Old bonds continue and Dravid and Laxman call Parthiv up these days too, offering words of encouragement.Youve got to give credit to Parthiv. He kept the fire burning and slogged it out.There is no success without sweat.I would do stringent fitness routines, practise my keeping and then work on my battingParthiv Patel"
58f564577be9e01a3579fd71,"At Bhadalwadi, canal bunds bring down heronry population by nearly 70%",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/at-bhadalwadi-canal-bunds-bring-down-heronry-population-by-nearly-70/articleshow/57564372.cms,2017-03-10,"PUNE: Water shortage is increasingly reducing the glory of the heronry at Bhadalwadi while causing an alarming decrease in the number of birds, including endangered species, found at the traditional breeding site.Experts said as much as 70% of the bird population, that was seen here earlier, is now gone. They attribute the fleeting birds to various bunds built on canals that restrict the amount of water the site receives.The groves typically have thorny trees, which are partly submerged in water, making it an ideal nesting and breeding environment for various bird species. The groves also protect the birds from predatory animals.In the latest edition of the Ela Journal for Forestry and Wildlife, its chief editor Satish Pande mentions, ""In western Maharashtra, during the months of January to April such heronries resound with the cacophony of breeding birds. While some of these sites depend on the success or failure of southwest monsoon, others in watershed areas are solely dependent on irrigation canal-fed water."" The quarterly journal is jointly published by the state's forest department and Ela Foundation.Owing to dipping groundwater levels and increasing plantation of sugarcane, a cash crop which requires a lot of water, many bunds are being built on the canals that feed the heronries. This is the case with Bhadalwadi, located near Bhigwan town on the Pune-Solapur highway.""The site, which at one time hosted thousands of birds, has seen a decline of nesting bird population by almost 70%, due to the water shortage over the past two years. Now, owing to tree felling and dry land, the birds only occupy a smaller part of the site that still has some water accumulation. We need to plan and move fast before the site is abandoned entirely by the birds,"" Pande told TOI.The biggest cause for concern is that two endangered species, Eurasian Spoonbill and Painted Stork, also breed here. ""The forest department has shared this concern and two years ago, the site was included under the National Program for Wetland Conservation. Funds have been allocated to the site for the same. However, a plan needs to be formulated to best utilise the funds,"" he said.Pande suggested that since the water supply comes through the irrigation department, while the concern for the birds at the site is under the forest department, there needs to be an inter-departmental meeting to urgently form a plan to conserve the sensitive site."

What does it mean? Jayant Patil, NCP Leader of the House in Legislative Assembly. The state government says it is not against loan waiver but will take a decision (on that) at an appropriate time. What does it mean? Jayant Patil, NCP Leader of the House in Legislative Assembly.Maharashtras Former finance minister Jayant Patil is of the opinion that no chief minister or finance minister will ever give consent to a crop loan waiver when the governments coffers are running empty. Patil, who is currently the leader of the NCP in the Legislative Assembly, had held the states finance portfolio for three consecutive terms in the Congress-NCP coalition government since 1999.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDiscussing the politics, economics and arithmetic of crop loan waiver both at the Centre and in Maharashtra, while speaking to The Indian Express, Patil put across the challenges for any government having to deal with financial constraints. The conservative estimate of crop loan waiver would work out to Rs 25,000 cr to Rs 30,000 cr approximately. Now, no wise chief minister or finance minister will give permission for the crop loan waiver. The task has become more challenging for the present government that has miserably failed in fiscal prudence, thus reflecting poor financial management, said Patil.He added: The overall budget spending shows 47 per cent, which means there is an undeclared cut in force. The series of mega-projects being pursued by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in multiple sectors, like infrastructure, also makes us wonder how they would mobilise the funds.Speaking about the socio-politics behind the Oppositions demand for a crop loan waiver during the ongoing budget session, Patil justified it. He said: Our decision is not politically driven. It is our concern to bring immediate relief to the farmers across rural Maharashtra. In the last three to four successive years, farmers suffered due to drought. Last year, we had a good monsoon. There was good crop production. However, farmers earnings were badly affected because of the demonetisation policy imposed from November 8, 2016.Patil added: Farmers were forced to sell their vegetables, fruits and crops at much lower prices. Except for cash crops like sugarcane, all other crops fetched lower prices causing revenue loss to farmers.Taking a strong objection to the governments argument that the loan waiver had helped district cooperative banks and not farmers in the past, he said: I am not asking money for banks. The government can always directly transfer the cash into farmers accounts.The NCP leader said: If Prime Minister Narendra Modi can promise loan waiver to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, what stops the government from taking the decision in Maharashtra? This is our basic question at a time they boast of a robust economy, which is not the case. Therefore, as I said in the beginning, unless any state has surplus money it would be a difficult task to waive the crop loans completely.Reminding of former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars 2008 decision after discussion with then prime minister Manmohan Singh on a crop loan waiver of Rs 71,000 crore for the entire country, Patil said, There were no immediate elections. But the UPA government still went ahead with the decision to bring relief to farmers.He added: Today, the state government says it is not against loan waiver but will take a decision (on that) at an appropriate time. What does it mean?Commenting on the Shiv Sena trying to take credit for the demand for crop loan waiver, Patil said: They are a confused party. On one hand they are enjoying power in the government, and on the other they are trying to show that they are an Opposition party.Taking a dig at the Sena, he said: Now, all Opposition parties had taken a decision to protest at the footsteps of Vidhan Bhawan on the crop loan waiver issue. But just to show that they are different, the Shiv Sena sat a few feet away at the footsteps of Chhatrapati Shivajis statue. A section was protesting against the government and the other half is participating in the government.

5923b6387be9e01fcef054b3,Judicial salt on wounds,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/601252/judicial-salt-wounds.html,2017-03-14,"By V Raghunathan, March 14, 2017 1:14 ISTACCIDENT CLAIMS CONUNDRUMIts a pity the Stella awards closed down after 2007. Had it been around, India would have qualified this week, hands down. If you are wondering what Stella Award is, well, I am not referring to the Australian award for Gospel Music, honouring women, but to the award that honours the memory of Stella Liebeck, who was awarded nearly $2.7 million in punitive damages and $160,000 in compensatory damages by the New Mexico District court, in a law suit against McDonald.The 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was carrying McDonalds coffee, at about 85oC, between her knees, sitting in the passenger seat of her grandsons car, and trying to open the lid off the tumbler for adding sugar and milk, when she spilled the hot coffee over thighs and genitals, causing third degree burns thus needing hospitalisation (1992).The award had its origin in a column by Randy Cassingham, featuring Wacky-but-true news stories. The awards contributed much mirth between 2005 and 2007 before it was closed down as it ran out of steam. But the awards documented some hilarious law suits.One Stella award winner was Jerry Williams of Arkansas, for example, who was awarded $ 14,500 plus medical expenses because he was bitten on the butt by his neighbours Beagle, which was chained, in its owners fenced yard, and Williams had jumped over the fence into the yard and repeatedly shot the dog with his pellet gun. The jury had been good enough to reduced Williamss demand a tad, as it believed the beagle may have been somewhat provoked by Williams with his pellet shooting.Well, now it has happened at our own doorstep, namely in amchi Mumbai, where the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal held last month that a drunk motor-biker, with two on the pillion, who died on the day of Holi in a road accident against a municipal truck in 2008 was only 25% guilty and awarded him claims worth Rs 38 lakh.The heavier truck was supposed to take 75% of the blame (the award suitably adjusted of course)!Now our courts or tribunals are getting rather mathematically precise. Though we arent told if the biker was wearing a helmet, could the answer to the question have possibly swung the percentage of guilt by a couple of points as it were. Nor do we know if the biker had a valid licence and what difference that could have made to the percentage blame. We also do not know what adjustment to the percentage accounted for the fact that there were three riders on the motor cycle. And what adjustments would be made in case the biker was coming on the wrong side of the road?Zig-zag bikersZig-zag bikers on our roads are a common sight. Is there a further correction to the percentage point for zig-zag driving? And if he had a cell-phone between his shoulders and ears, would that make a further difference? And if he had taken off when the signal light was still red?And this particular accident was with a Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) truck, and according to the BMTC, the driver was well in control of the vehicle. What if the accident leading to the unfortunate death of the biker had involved another two wheeler? Or an auto-rickshaw? Or even a pedestrian? One hopes the tribunal would put out a detailed percentage chart of blame.One had mistakenly come to believe that in our land everybody, two-wheelers and four-wheelers alike, have the licence to drive like so many beheaded chicken, without helmets, without seatbelts, talking on the cell phones or even texting, with their vehicles over-crowded or over-loaded, as if they were all out on a suicide mission. After all, dont we routinely encounter near-accidents averted by a tiniest fraction of a second, when a lout overtakes us from the left, or goes around us from the left in order to turn right at a traffic crossing just as we are accelerating to go straight, just as the red light turns green?But this accidents tribunal has raised the bar. Not only is it par for the course to drive drunk with two pillion riders, such drivers shall be protected by law and awarded unprecedented sums in a country where victims of murders and rapes are awarded a pittance. We are now told it is the others who must watch out for such drivers.Well, well, we live and we learn. The tribunal has stuck true to the age-old percentage formula that we strongly believe in: what matters is the relative size of the vehicles in collision. The lions share of the blame must accrue to the bigger vehicle; dont worry with trivia like who was drunk or texting on a phone when driving.Our sympathy is only for those who die, even if they are suicidal idiots and it is their kin who deserve to get rich by Rs 38 lakh for their loved ones driving a motor cycle drunk on Holi, with two riders behind, rushing to meet their maker successfully. Never mind if the truck driver involved and his family have to suffer a life time of collateral consequences. Now you know why we would have qualified for our very own Stella award!Our roads and streets are full of manhole covers that dip or rise a good nine inches above the street level. We have so-called speed breakers that double as bone breakers, without even markers  for day or dark hours. We have encounter enormous craters or dug-up roads aplenty any without any warning, fair or foul.We negotiate assorted animals or even people coming on the wrong direction even on our highways or one-way streets. All of them may cause deaths. Are we to understand that from now on, it shall not only be our lot to learn to live with them all, but also be prepared to pay heavily if a drunken fool compounds the situation by insisting on driving under your wheels.(The writer is an academic and author)"

Source: Shubhangi Khapre Satyawan Baburao Ghadge in Hingni village. Source: Shubhangi KhaprePadmasinha Ganpat Patil (31) gave up his senior salesmans job at Kotak Mahindra in Mumbai to return to his native village Manegaon in Mhada taluka in Western Maharashtra to do dairy farming. Six months later, Patil is on cloud nine. Milk prices have gone up from Rs 18-20 per litre to Rs 25-26 per litre, promising higher profits.In Mumbai, his last annual package was Rs 5.5 lakh.On a sprawling one acre of land in front of his home, five cows wander around. Every two hours they return to their designated spot for fodder which is 35 to 40 kg per cow.Watch What Else Is making NewsA diploma holder from the agriculture college at Akluj taluka, Patil said, The inspiration to return to dairy farming was from my maternal uncle Satyawan Baburao Ghadge (42), who wrote a success story with 25 high-grade jersey cows in a short span of 18 months in Hingni village of Mohol taluka.According to Patil, On an average each cow delivers 20 litres of milk. An average 70 litres of milk at Rs 26 per litre fetches Rs 1,820 daily. Other expenses include cost of transporting milk to collection centres and maintenance and fodder of the cows.The familys adjoining agriculture land spread over five to six acres helps to generate in-house fodder. Revealing that the glamour of Mumbais life does not hold any appeal to him compared to the rural roots, he said, In any job in the city we had to work almost 10 to 12 hours which was very stressful as targets had to be met. Moreover, office and house were located at two ends making travel cumbersome and expensive.Whereas, life in village with half the efforts and proper planning promises higher returns. It easily surpasses the annual package of Rs 5.5 lakh I used to earn. Moreover, unlike in the city, the cost of living is much lower providing both quality life and huge savings.In the last seven years in Mumbai, beginning with a BPO call centre, he hopped jobs as sales manager in Idea Cellular, Future India, General Life Insurance and Kotak Mahindra.I am planning to purchase six more cows. And then intend to put up a small chilling plant, which would be able to hold 2,500 litres of milk. It can be graduated to processing unit in coming years.At village Hingni, Satyawan Baburao Ghadge has a bigger success story. The seventh passed Satyawan (42), tired of crop failure for four successive years, decided to take to dairy development. Three years ago, he started with a couple of cows. Today, with a loan from Bank of India, he has 25 jersey cows in his huge shed pitched on his agriculture land adjoining the sugarcane fields.Satyawan and his younger brother Abhimanyu took Rs 8 lakh each loan from Bank of India to buy the cows. They are mostly brought from Sangola market at Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh depending on age and grade. Satyawan personally tends to each cow, almost with a set timetable of when and how much fodder and water should be provided.According to Satyawan, On an average, we generate 250 to 275 litres of milk. It is transported to Mohol dock where milk cooperative societies purchase it at Rs 26 to Rs 27 per litre. The farmers revealed, In the last six to eight months there have been stringent measures taken by the administration to streamline the corruption and adulteration. As a result, farmers are getting better price.Satyawan said, In the past, middle agents in nexus with milk cooperative owners (including private) exploited the dairy farmers. Citing surplus milk collection they would create a situation where we had to sell the milk at as low as Rs 15 to 17 per litre. In front of our eyes, agents would manipulate and resell the same milk in markets at Rs 40 per litre which would be then sent for distribution to other urban cities and towns. The milk quantity would be often increased by adding water and also chemical, which is detrimental to health.While advocating harsh punishment for those cheating people and farmers, he said, Even a small and marginal farmer with just two cows can survive drought and crop losses if those running the milk cooperatives stop exploiting and manipulating the farmers.According to a NABARD report, The per capita availability of milk is 210 grams for the state as a whole and offers vast scope for increasing milk production to reach the ideal level of 250 grams per person per day. The cooperative dairy infrastructure comprises 29 district milk unions, 77 taluka sanghs and 30714 primary dairy cooperative societies.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Noted physician Dr. Arvind Gupta selected about 50 participants in Jaipur to test the efficacy of a new lifestyle accompanied by the intake of fenugreek.Within eight months, Dr. Gupta, a member of the research committee of the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India, found encouraging results. The participants, who were not on any medication, reported an improved quality of life.Besides Jaipur, the study was carried out in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Puducherry and Thiruvananthapuram. In all these places, volunteers, aged 30 years or above, performed regular yoga and consumed the prescribed quantity of fenugreek seeds twice a day.Dr. Gupta told The Hindu that the study would help reveal the properties of fenugreek seeds that could prevent diabetes mellitus type-2, a long-term metabolic disorder.Fenugreek seeds are high in soluble fibre, which helps reduce blood sugar by slowing down digestion and absorption of carbohydrates.The study will also look into claims that yoga can effectively reverse the mechanism that causes diabetes. Dr. Gupta said regular yoga practice by the participants was keeping their weight as well as blood pressure under check.Undiagnosed, untreatedIn his earlier studies, Dr. Gupta  at present, the director at Jaipur Diabetes Research Centre  found that more than a quarter of patients with diabetes in the urban India remained undiagnosed and the status of control among them was low.As the cities move away from economic and social deprivation, there is [a] greater prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Behavioural risk factors such as smoking, smokeless tobacco use, low fruits and vegetables intake and high visible fat intake indicate that our urban populations are facing a chronic disease transition, he said.Dr. Gupta is a recipient of several prestigious awards and has edited the Journal of Association of Physicians of India in the past. He has received fellowships from the Indian College of Physicians and the Madras Science Foundation."
58fb6206a3d24b44f321efa6,A helping hand to Kolhapur’s underprivileged,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/a-helping-hand-to-kolhapurs-underprivileged/article17459817.ece,2017-03-14,"Anuradha Bhosale is not your regular social worker. She is someone who understands what it is like for little hands to work, or for women to be abandoned by their families, having walked these difficult paths herself.Today, she is the vice-president of Avani, a non-governmental organisation in Kolhapur that helps rescue child labourers and works with underprivileged, abandoned women. I always desired to work for child labour as I underwent a great deal of hardship and pain and could easily relate to their suffering, she says.Her storyThe eleventh of 12 children, Ms. Bhosale had to work as a domestic help in Shrirampur, Ahmedabad, where she was born, as the family faced a financial crunch. Her father was a pre-primary teacher and earned a salary of Rs. 150. Ms. Bhosale earned Rs. 10 as domestic help. However, she nurtured a deep desire to pursue education, which she felt, was the only way to improve ones position in life.I was fortunate that my employers allowed me to go to school, says Ms. Bhosale. On completing Class V, she had to be shifted to a missionary-run girls hostel at Harigaon, Ahmednagar, as the family moved back to their home town at Bhokar, Ahmednagar. However, here again, she had to face humiliation as she couldnt afford to pay the monthly fee of Rs. 25. My mother did various jobs and worked very hard as she wanted me to pursue my dreams. However, despite working late into the night, she could never pay my monthly fees, she recalls. Gradually, it dawned upon her teachers that she was a committed student and her fee was waived. Whatever I could give was accepted by the institution.Ms. Bhosale wanted to do a lot more in life. She completed her graduation from Nirmala Niketan College of Social Work, Mumbai, in 1991. A priest with whom she worked at the age of 16 while doing odd jobs at a church bought her bus tickets. She stayed at the girls hostel and the same priest paid her tuition fee for two months. However, later she received financial support from the college. Some of the teachers too helped me financially for the study tour, recalls Ms. Bhosale. On completing the fifth year of the course, she started working with migrant children who crushed rocks used in paving roads in Kolhapur. She introduced these families to the principles of micro-finance and assisted in setting up self-help groups for women.In 1995, she fell in love and got married, but domestic violence plagued the marriage from the start. Neither her husband nor her in-laws supported her social activities, but she carried on. In 1996, she joined the Verala Development Society (VDS), whose mission was to provide homes to homeless, divorced and widowed women in Sangli and Kolhapur districts. The next year she joined Avani, a VDS project to conduct surveys of migrant children in Kolhapur.This was what I had been craving for, and it was perhaps the most memorable moment of my life, she says. However, while she found solace in work, her marriage was steadily deteriorating, and she had to leave home with a six-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son, with just the clothes they were wearing. I did not have family or close friends to rely on. I now realised the plight of women and their children who were so often kicked out of home. I no longer sympathised with them; I understood the true meaning of empathy.At first, a friend offered her a place to stay. Other friends helped her financially for the next few months. Fortunately, help came from unexpected quarters as well: Arun Chavan, Chairman of Avani, Comrade Govind Pansare, former Communist leader of Kolhapur who fought legal battles for the underprivileged and Dr. Sunil Kumar Lawate, social worker in Kolhapur. Gradually, she began to make progress in her chosen field, attracting followers in the process too.U.S.-based Dr. Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, has been one of the biggest supporters of Avani. He visits Avani every year along with the people from different parts of the world just to acquaint them with our work. He appreciates our work and motivates our volunteers, she says.I was introduced to Avani through Dr. Gandhi, says Scott Kafora, an architect from the U.S., and an Avani volunteer for the past six years. Mr. Scott has travelled to almost 30 countries working for the betterment of children. He is committed to improving the economic, social, emotional, and educational needs of underprivileged children around the world. Certified to teach English as a second language, he shares his knowledge of maths, science, reading, and computers free of charge. I was greatly impressed to see Anuradhas passion and how she tirelessly works to unite child labourers with their families. She works at the grass-root level and this is very impressive, says Mr. Scott, who is now working towards the construction of a childrens home at Kolhapur.What Avani doesThe main aim of Avani is to educate, empower and unite women who are widowed, divorced or abandoned. Since August 2011, as many as 53,216 women received government entitlements in the form of cash and their children no longer needed to work as child labourers.Since 1995, Avani has rescued 9,200 children in Kolhapur district, and they have been enrolled in the schools nearby. Avani also rescues migrant children and provides them with safe housing at Kolhapur. With the help of the government, we implement housing schemes for their families, says Ms. Bhosale. Avani operates 21 schools in the brickyard labour camps, where over 1,100 migrant children get an education.Avani has also rescued children from sugarcane fields, construction sites, domestic work, street begging, retail shops, hotels, lodges and even from exploitation from their own families. In 2005, Avani started a daycare centre for migrant children, providing them with nutrition, clothes and safe housing, besides education. Avani also operates 10 day care centres for the children of waste pickers in Kolhapurs slums.Avani organises local community and grassroots fundraising campaigns throughout the year. They also try to raise funds by selling handmade Diwali greeting cards and lanterns and Raksha Bandhan bracelets. All the proceeds go back into the programme.Ms. Bhosale says, Long-term change can only be accomplished by encouraging people to educate and do things for themselves. Avani works to educate and sensitise government departments on the implementation of the laws and schemes already in place to help those in need.My greatest satisfaction is how Avani has been able to educate the brickyard owners that it is against the law to employ child laborers under the age of 14 and that these children have the legal right to attend government schools. Because of Avanis work in the community, there is now tremendous awareness of the rights of children and the Child Labour Act, which is very heartening,"

""Who has given the right to them (to forecast)? You cannot believe their production numbers. They are misleading public and the industry by releasing wrong numbers. They should not be doing this,"" Paswan told reporters.The frequent revision of sugar output estimate for 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) puts in question the credibility of the industry body, he said. ""It is not fair to frequently revise the figures. We don't know what logic they have behind this. All -- farmers, mills and trade -- get affected because of such numbers.""Paswan said the ISMA has trimmed sugar production forecast to 20.3 million tonnes for 2016-17, down from a previous projection of 21.3 million tonnes made two months ago, and down from a September 2016 forecast of 23.4 million tonnes. Last year too, the industry body had initially project the output to be 28 million tonnes and later revised it downward to 25.1 million tonnes, he added.Urging the industry and public not to get misled with ISMA's incorrect projections, Paswan said, ""There is no shortage of sugar in the country. We have enough stocks and imports are not required.""The availability will be 29 million tonnes this year including the opening stock of 7.7 million tonnes and the likely production of 22.5 million tonnes in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year, he said, adding this is sufficient to meet the the annual consumption of 24-25 million tonnes. ""Even if we take into account the ISMA's production estimate of 20.3 million tonnes, the availability will be 27.3 million tonnes, which is sufficient to meet the domestic demand,"" he added.Asked if import duty on raw sugar will be slashed from 40 per cent, he said, ""There is no question of imports. The status quo will remain."" Defending its data, ISMA President Sarita Reddy said, ""There is nothing wrong with our data. ...We are not hiding any facts. Whatever data we have got from satellite images and different state associations, we have passed it on to the government.""The downward revision of sugar output to 20.3 million tonnes for this year was mainly because of severe drought in some states like Maharashtra, where sugarcane yields were hit badly, she told PTI. The country has sufficient stocks and imports may not be required, she added."

""Every decision in this respect was taken following all due procedures,"" he told TOI on Saturday.""The FIR registered against me with the Kherwadi police is on the basis of wrong information,"" he claimed.Marathwada Mitra Mandal secretary Mohan Deshmukh alleged that Nilangekar, who was removed as the Mandal president a few months ago, had sold off a 3 acre land belonging to the trust, which is worth several thousand crore of rupees, as if it was his own property.The Mandal was formed in 1965 with an aim to run student hostels and education projects among other things in Mumbai for people from Marathwada, he told reporters here.Former chief minister S B Chavan, who hailed from Nanded in Marathwada region , was the founder president and trustee of the Mandal that was allotted 11,000 square meter of land in Bandra East in 1981.""However, later, Nilangekar was elected as the president of the trust. Instead of fulfilling the objectives of the trust, he chose to sell the land in a questionable manner, and without taking the trustees into confidence,"" said Deshmukh.The trust's secretary alleged that Nilangekar had indulged in various financial irregularities involving the trust. ""For instance, he withdrew money from the bank without permission and indulged in financial transactions. He even paid a huge amount of cash to his defunct cooperative sugar factory from the trust's funds,"" he saidDeshmukh said he had made written complaint to the EOW of the Mumbai police on January 29, 2016 against the former CM. However, the police did not take cognizance of that, following which the trust moved the high court seeking directions to the police to register an offence against Nilangekar, he said.The public prosecutor had on February 2 told the bench comprising Jusitices Ranjit More and Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi that a decision on registering an FIR would be taken and would be communicated to the petitioner within two weeks.Accordingly, the police registered an FIR against four people including Nilangekar under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)."
58fb634fa3d24b44f321f0b9,The art of building majorities,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-art-of-building-majorities/article17459215.ece,2017-03-14,"The State elections of 2017 clearly demonstrate that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has replaced the Congress as the principal national party in the country. It won massive victories in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and emerged as a big player in Manipur. In Goa it remained the single largest party in terms of vote share despite a hugely unpopular outgoing Chief Minister. The only disappointment is Punjab where the party was routed with its senior partner Shiromani Akali Dal after ruling the State for 10 years.The spectacular performance of the BJP in U.P. should not detract from its formidable achievements in the recently concluded local elections, where it made huge strides in previously uncharted territory. In Odishas Zilla Parishad elections, the party expanded its footprint from 36 seats in 2012 to 306 in 2017, snatching second place away from the Congress to become a formidable contender to the long incumbent Biju Janata Dal. In Maharashtra, the BJP won eight of 10 municipal corporations with its total number of seats nearly equal to that of all other parties combined.Explaining the riseThe electoral success of the BJP raises an important question. Without being able to meet expectations built up in 2014, in the absence of a surging economy, and with the poor decision on demonetisation, how is the party achieving so much success? There is one obvious reason: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains very popular while the Congress partys leadership no longer resonates with voters. However, leadership is not the only factor. The BJP is acquiring hegemonic status in the Indian polity owing largely to ideological consolidation and its creation of an unparalleled election machine.The BJPs ideology has more takers than before because the party frames the main issues for the elections. Its long-standing ideological association with nationalism renders nationalism an issue on which it has a huge advantage over all other parties. Parties that are able to successfully shape election campaigns around their own issues ultimately succeed in winning elections. By placing a large emphasis on nationalism, the party has cleverly tailored its ideological message to be able to capture the imagination of a larger section of the public. It has opened ideological battlefronts in many different spheres  from universities to movie theatres  and promoted conflicts across the board. It has also placed a large emphasis on other issues that it has traditionally been associated with, such as national security and terrorism, patriotism and more recently, corruption.For a very long time the Jan Sangh and then the BJP relied almost exclusively on the hard-line Hindu nationalists who reside with its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This is no longer the case. Hindu traditionalists, those who are drawn to a conservative Hindu way of life but are largely opposed to the hard-line Hindutva world view and its intolerance towards other religions, have now shifted their support from the Congress to the BJP. This allows the BJP to win elections without nominating a single Muslim, as it did recently in U.P.Forging multi-caste coalitionsThe party has also revamped its electoral strategy, one focussed on widening its appeal by stitching together multi-caste coalitions. As is widely known, the BJPs traditional social base is predominantly upper caste. To increase its support base, it has been building an electoral machine of its own at the local level in the form of caste-based coalitions. Fully aware that the party would not receive much support from the Muslims and perhaps even the Jatavs, the former traditionally associated with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the latter with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), its leaders targeted the smaller groups that dont have adequate representation in any of the larger parties. For instance, the BJP tied up with parties like the Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, giving it the support of a large section of the Kurmi and Rajbhar populations, respectively. It also increased its ticket allocations to non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits. Its campaign was led by a galaxy of local and national leaders, together covering an eclectic set of caste groups  almost a Congress-style coalition  but without the Muslims and some Dalit communities.The BJPs active use of state patronage has also played a big role in strengthening its national footing. In States where the party has come to power, and even at the national level, it has actively worked to break down the existing patronage machinery and replace it with one of its own. For instance, in Maharashtra, a State ruled by the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for more than a decade before the Devendra Fadnavis government assumed office, the BJP has been steadily dismantling the patronage structures put in place by its predecessors. Through ordinances and amendments, the government has managed to severely weaken the hold of NCP and Congress leaders on the powerful cooperative bodies in the State, including the cooperative sugar factories which have been under the tight grip of NCP leader Sharad Pawar for decades. The government not only created a provision whereby it could appoint independent members to the boards of these bodies, but also imposed restrictions on the existing board members, hailing largely from the Congress or NCP, from contesting elections to particular cooperative banks. At the national level, the Modi government removed scores of previous United Progressive Alliance-era political appointees, particularly those notorious for their role in creating the large NPA (non-performing assets) problem facing the public sector banks today, and replaced them with its own people.Risks of rapid expansionOn the electoral front, this has translated into the BJP aggressively co-opting individuals and units of other parties to strengthen its leadership. From Rita Bahuguna Joshi in U.P. to Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, the BJP has taken in many rival leaders into its fold before elections. This resembles the strategy followed by the Congress in the 1970s, at the peak of Indira Gandhis rule. While in the short term, this strategy is giving the party immense electoral success and helping it expand its footprint, just as it had done for the Congress back then, in the medium to long term it poses grave risks. Many politicians and smaller parties have joined the BJP bandwagon as it looks the most lucrative option electorally, and they may desert it at next chance. In addition, as the BJP continues to bring into its fold leaders and parties from outside its ideological umbrella, it risks diluting the content of its ideology over time. If uninhibited, this could also lead to tensions between the BJP and the RSS.The BJP has undoubtedly replaced the Congress as the dominant national party and the cornerstone of Indias political and electoral system. This development has squeezed the space for centre-left forces in Indias polity and has given popular legitimacy to the centre-right narrative on issues of nationalism, secularism and social justice. As Yogendra Yadav has rightly pointed out, the centre-left needs a new vocabulary on the issue of social justice as the BJP has managed to convince a large section of society that the lefts language on the issue reeks of biases based on caste and religion.However, in order for the BJP to remain the dominant national party for a sustained period of time, it too needs to introspect to ensure it isnt compromising long-term success for short-term rewards. Going forward, it should continue to widen its social base while ensuring it doesnt lose its ideological identity. Otherwise, it will only remain dominant as long as a Mr. Modi remains at the helm. As when individuals acquire larger salience over ideology and organisation in parties, it leads to their decline down the road. That is exactly what happened to the Congress.Pradeep Chhibber and Rahul Verma are with the University of California, Berkeley. Harsh Shah is an alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley"

Praveen Khanna The Upper Doab Sugar Mills factory at Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. Praveen KhannaThe same party ruling at the Centre, and now the state, has given a ray of hope to Uttar Pradeshs (UPs) 116 operational sugar mills as well as 25 lakh-odd cane growers, just emerging out of three consecutive bad seasons. With sugar prices improving  ex-factory realisations are currently around Rs 36.50 a kg, compared with the average Rs 31.74 and Rs 25.64 for the 2015-16 and 2014-15 seasons (October-September), respectively, and the lows of Rs 22.54 touched in July 2015  and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in power both in New Delhi and Lucknow, there is renewed optimism over the fortunes of a hitherto troubled industry.Whats more, UP this season will overtake Maharashtra as the countrys leading sugar producer. Its mills have produced 69.12 lakh tonnes (lt) as on March 14, and with crushing to continue beyond mid-April, output could cross 85 lt out of Indias likely 200 lt or so in the 2016-17 season. While 100 out of UPs 116 mills are still running, 148 out of the 150 factories in Maharashtra have already shut for lack of cane and production may dip below 42 lt, from 84.15 lt in 2015-16 and 105.14 lt in 2014-15.Theres no better time to reform UPs sugar sector than now, when things are looking good. The focus should be on cane pricing reform and ending the problem of payment arrears to farmers once and for all. This can happen by linking cane prices to sugar realisations, based on the C Rangarajan Committees report, said Ajit S Shriram, joint managing director of DCM Shriram Ltd, which has three mills in Hardoi and one at Lakhimpur Kheri district.The committee under the chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council in the previous United Progressive Alliance regime had recommended a value-sharing formula, wherein the cane price payable would be 75 per cent of the average ex-factory realisations on sugar. At Rs 3,650 per quintal, the cane price as per the Rangarajan formula works out to roughly Rs 274 per quintal, higher than the Centres fair and remunerative rate of Rs 254.2 per quintal taking UPs average sugar recovery from cane at 10.5 per cent. But it is below the UP governments state advised price (SAP) of Rs 305 for general and Rs 315 for early-maturing cane varieties.Ideally, sugar realisations should be Rs 4,000-plus to enable us pay the SAP. They must be allowed to go to those levels, as this is an industry, unlike fruits or vegetables, where farmers get a fair share of the consumer price. Also, if people can fork out Rs 52 per litre on 30 litres of milk per month, why cannot they pay the same rate for just 5 kg of sugar? Shriram pointed out. However, farmer leader and convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, opposed the Rangarajan formulas adoption. If millers want the sugar price to be a mark-up over cane cost, the same principle should apply to farmers as well. After all, we also incur costs on diesel, labour and other inputs. Shouldnt these be factored into our cane price, too? he asked. The Rangarajan formula can work in Maharashtra, where sugar recovery averaged 11.3-11.4 per cent and cane yields were also higher. Moreover, in Maharashtra, cane harvesting and transportation costs, which come to Rs 50-55 per quintal, are borne by the factories. In UP, the farmer pays for these, Singh added.Both Shriram and Singh were agreed on one thing, though: A BJP government both at the Centre and in UP offers a golden opportunity to resolve the endemic problem of cane arrears. In the ongoing 2016-17 season, UP mills have so far bought cane worth Rs 20,473.51 crore at the SAP. While Rs 18,264.20 crore of this was payable not later than 14 days after delivery, they have only paid Rs 14,345.12 crore. That translates into arrears of Rs 3,919.08 crore, over and above dues of Rs 255.22 crore and Rs 44.75 crore for the previous two seasons. Although some groups  DCM Shriram, Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering, Dhampur Sugar, Dalmia Bharat and Dwarikesh Sugar Industries  have no cane dues, this isnt the case with most others.Significantly, the BJP, in its 2017 UP election manifesto, has promised that its government will ensure farmers get full payment for their cane within 14 days of sale. This provision already exists in the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act of 1953. If the promise signals an intent to implement the law, we welcome it, stated Singh. His organisation won a major victory when the Allahabad High Court, on March 9, set aside the last Samajwadi Party governments decision to waive the interest on delayed cane payments by UP sugar mills for the 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons. While section 17(3) of the 1953 Act does give the state government the power to waive interest, the court, however, ruled that the relevant Cabinet decisions  in May 2015 and October 2016, involving a total amount of over Rs 2,000 crore  were totally lop sided/one way and taken with no application of mind. Interest on delayed payments, it held, was a substantive right and not a bounty to growers. That being so, the power of waiver could be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and not in a routine manner, as the UP government had seemingly done.The state government waived the interest, citing mills inability to pay in view of low sugar prices. But by that logic, shouldnt the interest being paid by farmers on loans from state-owned and cooperative banks also have been waived? In this case, farmers were basically supplying cane to mill at zero interest, even while borrowing at 10-15 per cent or more themselves, noted Singh. The BJP UP manifesto, incidentally, has also talked of waiving crop loans for all small and marginal farmers. According to Singh, the Allahabad High Court order will strengthen the new governments hand to effectively enforce the 1953 Act. If mills dont pay within the stipulated 14-day period, they will have to shell out interest. And that should be deterrent enough, he claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo/File) Sugarcane fields. (Source: Express photo/File)The 2016-17 sugarcane crushing season has clocked four years high in terms of average fair and remunerative price (FRP) paid by sugar millers to growers. While the payment received by farmers might appear to be record high, decrease in yield and lesser crops have not resulted in any windfall gains to the farmers.Starting under the pall of the last years drought Maharashtra had seen only 6,33 lakh hectare of farmland under sugarcane and the expected yield was around 429.55 lakh tonne. Based on payment done till now, the average price paid per tonne of cane by millers works out to be around Rs 2,382. Mills in Western Maharashtra have led in excess payment with many mills paying Rs 400-500 in excess of the FRP to attract growers. Even the cane-parched Marathwada mills have paid excess to attract growers. Till Tuesday, only 2 of the 150 mills, which had taken season, are operational in Maharashtra with the state recording production of 41.62 lakh tonne of sugar.Compared to this years payment, millers had paid Rs 2,100, Rs 1,971 and Rs 1,942 as average FRP per tonne for the seasons of 2015-16, 2014-15 and 2013-14 respectively. The average payments in these years was in tandem with acreage and production figures of those years. Seasons of the 2014-15 and 15-16 has seen mills failing to pay growers and running into arrears. For both the seasons, the sugar commissioners office had to order for auction of sugar stock of errant millers to recover dues. This season as against the total dues of Rs 7,970.68 crore, mills have totalled payment to the tune of Rs 8,323.84 crore- but failure of some of the mills to complete payment has led to arrears of Rs 181.54 crore.Figures might point to bumper payment to growers but farmers say their profitability has been hit this year. Prahlad Ingole, Nanded district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana said growers had to face double trouble to save their crop. Ingole said farmers had to spend excess to arrange for water and in many cases the mills have tampered with the FRP payment system to show lower values before paying excess.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Competing with sugarcane juice stalls, pulling along the hand-cart business is a tough task.Sunita and Ashok Andhale, a farmer couple from Ahmednagar, have come to Navi Mumbai for the first time this year. The two work as labourers in farms to cut sugarcane back home. With not much work between October and May, the couple decided to come to the big city this time, like others from their village have before this. The two first bought a cart built in a workshop in Ahmednagar from money got by selling their cattle. They then hired a tempo and brought the cart to Navi Mumbai. The first few days they observed other carts, before setting out to assemble their own.It took one whole day to build it together from dismantled parts, says Sunita. The three-wheeled cart has two wooden crushers between which the sugarcane sticks are placed. A long handle on top has to be pushed with a lot of strength to crush the sugarcane for its juice.Sunita and Ashok begin their day around 10 am, when the sugarcane is delivered to them from the nearby APMC market. They also buy ice, lemon and plastic glasses for the day before lugging the cart to a street corner, despite their frail frame. We carry many kilograms of sugarcane on the cart, so it becomes very heavy. The work involves so much labour that by the end of the day, we are too tired to walk, says Ashok. They work till 8 pm before returning to their rented space nearby.The couple is hopeful of making more money than their Rs 500 per day as labourers back home. Their three children, including a toddler, are in the care of their parents. We miss them but only manage to speak to them once or twice a week. It is difficult to make ends meet with the meagre amount we earn at home, and that is why we came here, Sunita says. For now, the couple is attempting to get used to the city hustle.They skip lunch every day, too shy to eat in a public place on a road. We do not eat sitting on the road in our village. We are not comfortable doing that here, 25-year old Sunita says.Others, like 22-year old Rajendra Shirsat, also from Ahmednagar, have been coming to Navi Mumbai for a few years now. We first came here over four years ago. We have a small farm for jowar and bajra in Ahmednagar district. We will go home once monsoon begins and the demand for sugarcane juice goes down, Shirsat says.Neelam,too, has been operating a cart for a few years in Navi Mumbai. Earlier, I used to hire a man from the labour market every day to help me with the cart. On days the labourer did not turn up, I would end up losing the entire days earning, since I could not operate the cart by myself, she says.Neelam then took a loan and bought a motor, through which the crushers could turn without any manual push. Estranged from her husband, Neelam single-handedly manages the cart to make enough for her only sons education. I began this work to earn more than I would as a domestic worker in other peoples homes. Summer is a good time, even though I will have to work in the scorching heat through the next two months. If I dont slog in the heat, I will not make my sons life better, she says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

This was stated in an analysis report on recent changing trends in Indian monsoon over Maharashtra. The report was presented as part of the annual monsoon 2016 workshop organised by the India Meteorological Society (Pune branch) in the city on Wednesday. The areas affected include districts in north Madhya Maharashtra  Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon and some parts of Ahmednagar.The average annual rainfall, which is largely a well distributed one, received during the four months over north Maharashtra ranges anywhere between 700 mm and 1,200 mm. However , current rainfall figures are indicating a downward trend in this annual average rainfall.About 3,000 hectare of area is primarily being used to cultivate fruits and vegetables. This area is also major cultivator of grapes and onions in the country. Apart from these, there is sizeable cultivation of tur, gram, jamun, bajra, rice, jowar and sugarcane.The agriculture ministry identifies this region as Western Ghat zone, under which 25 per cent of the total area is covered by forest.This region receives rain primarily from the south-west monsoon, that is during June and September, from the various systems formed in the Arabian Sea. However, off late, it has been found that these rain-bearing systems are phasing out ahead of reaching northern Maharashtra.A a result, these regions are sometimes deprived of even the normal rainfall during monsoon, said Subhangi Bhute, an IMD official from Mumbai.Subsequently, the systems instead benefit Konkan and southern districts like Pune, Satara, Raighad and Ratnagiri in the process. Monsoon onset and its progress is crucial until it passes through Maharashtra, stated Bhute.According to another IMD scientist and agriculture meteorologist R Balasubramanian, June and July are crucial months as that is the period when sowing of Kharif crops has to be undertaken.  Until mid-July, there must be good rains inorder to achieve good crop yield during Kharif Season, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The variety Co 6304, released in 1973, was very popular in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.During the period, it occupied 85 per cent of the area in Tamil Nadu and played a key role in making the State a top sugarcane-cultivating State.The variety Co 86032 was instrumental in making the State achieve maximum sugarcane yield per unit area. Released in 2000, it covered 70 per cent of the area in the State and over 50 per cent in Maharashtra, Karnataka and major area in Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.At present, 99 per cent of the area under sugarcane in the country was occupied by varieties developed by the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, the release added."

Raising the issue soon after the House assembled for the day, Anant Gadgil (Congress) wanted to know how could the government ignore the plight of farmers of Maharashtra.Leader of Opposition Dhananjay Munde drew the Chairs attention to the unseasonal rains and hailstorms that lashed parts of Marathwada on Wednesday, damaging grams, sugarcane, grapes and other crops.Farmers already overburdened by debt burden have now been hit hard by unseasonal rains, Munde said.Accusing the government of being indifferent towards the hardships faced by cultivators, Munde said the BJP-led ruling coalition has done nothing to restructure farm loans after coming to power in October 2014.The government did nothing to restructure farmers loans. At the same time, it allocated Rs 10,000 crore to municipal corporations to offset losses incurred by traders, the senior NCP legislator said.Munde said the government was keen to bail out traders but was ignoring farmers.Sharad Ranpise (Congress) lambasted SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya over her remarks on farm loan waivers.Bhattacharya yesterday expressed reservations over farm loan waiver schemes, saying such sops may disrupt credit discipline among borrowers.What right does the SBI chief has to make such a statement? The government has funds to bail out industrialists but has no money to help farmers, Ranpise said.Replying to the debate, Minister for Cooperation Chandrakant Patil said a loan waiver would cost Rs 30,000 crore to the government and a decision on the issue cant be taken on the spot.Patil said Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis would be making a statement on the issue in the Upper House, but this didnt happen.As the opposition members raised slogans, Chairman Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar adjourned the proceedings for 45 minutes.When the House reassembled, the Chair rushed through the business that included passage of supplementary demands on budget.

The Devendra Fadnavis regime is in a dilemma as precious hours of the budget session are lost in mayhem.However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar stole a march over the Sena by calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi earlier in the day to urge him to offer loan amnesty to Maharashtra farmers without further delay. In his 20minute talks with the Modi, Pawar demanded that the Centre should resuscitate the cash-starved sugar industry in the state, it is learnt.Uddhav's loan waiver demand is a strategy to keep the BJP on a tight leash and to project the Sena as the ""guar dian angel"" of the agriculture community , said party watchers. The Sena held demonstrations in Jalna, in Marathwada , to demand loan amnesty to farmers following crop failure and unseasonal rain.That the Sena legislators should join hands with the opposition to halt the business of the two houses of the state legislature--that too during the crucial budget session--has left the BJP fuming. The state budget is scheduled for Satur day . ""Although an ally in the Fadnavis regime, the Sena joins the opposition members to stall the house proceedings. The Sena ministers should realize that they are bound by oath of office,"" said a senior BJP legislator.While the Fadnavis government is amenable to the loan waiver, Fadnavis does not want to act in haste. ""The CM will make sure that relief reaches straight into the affected farmers' accounts and that the official-neta-contractor nexus doesn't fleece them,"" said a BJP MLA. The CM is said to be examining details of the 2008 loan waiver scheme, sources said."

(PTI Photo/ TV GRAB)Cows are the only animal that inhale as well as exhale oxygen; ghee made of cows milk contains 47 per cent oxygen; and gaumutra (cows urine) in sugarcane field will ensure longer, thicker and sweeter sugarcane and yield more sugar, BJP MPs said in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.The remarks were made during a discussion on a private-member resolution moved, and subsequently withdrawn, by DMKs T Siva, seeking steps for protection of indigenous cattle breed. B K Hariprasad of the Congress, who supported the resolution, said there should not be any discrimination against buffaloes or bulls. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the government could keep in mind the suggestions offered by Siva.In the resolution, Siva sought amendment in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, to exempt bulls from application of provisions that restrict their utility and training for various purposes. Siva also batted for saving diesel by replacing tractors with cattle forploughing and transportation. Nine of 10 MPs who spoke on the issue supported Sivas resolution. Jairam Ramesh opposed it, saying the resolution was aimed at Jallikattu more than protecting the indigenous breed of cattle and promoting organic manure, as was made out by the DMK member.Basavaraj Patil, BJP MP from Karnataka, said, Ghee made of cows milk has up to 47 per cent oxygen. Cow is the only animal which takes oxygen and gives back oxygen. He claimed that if a cow carcass is buried, its chemical action is worth fertilizer amounting to Rs 8,000. La Ganesan of the BJP said he was happy to see a DMK member bringing a resolution that should have been brought by a BJP member, and that he wholeheartedly supported it.Meghraj Jain of BJP claimed that scientists researching on wheat at an institute in Karnal, Haryana, have said that cattle urine mixed with water for irrigation will increase productivity. If cow urine is used in sugarcane farms, the sugarcane will be longer, thicker and sweeter, and will yield more sugar, he said. Jain also claimed that an experiment done at Mumbais Tata Cancer Hospital had found that haemoglobin level of patients using cow urine does not fall even after chemotherapy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Jogawat was kept under observation for 24 hours after he complained of minor fever and a burning sensation in his urinary tract on Tuesday night.It was a minor infection. It subsided after initial treatment. I am doing well now, Jogawat told to Hindustan Times. Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, who had successfully performed a bariatric surgery on Jogawat ,said he is currently stable and will be able to rejoin the workforce soon.Jogawat had been suffering from a urinary infection for a while. However, the condition was unrelated to his bariatric surgery, which took place in Mumbai. He called me after persistent episodes of fever and chills. I requested the local doctor to run primary tests and to not put him on heavy antibiotics as the complication wasnt severe, said Dr Lakdawala.The Neemuch doctor treating Jogawat, Dr Vipul Garg, said he was discharged after a day and will be on oral medication for the next five days. The patient came to the hospital complaining of chills and a severe burning sensation while urinating. We initially thought that this may have resulted from the major surgery he underwent, but later realised it was a urine infection said Dr Garg.Dr Lakdawala said the infection was probably related to his diabetes level. However, as Jogawat is on a strict diet, his sugar levels are expected to come under control. The doctor asked me if we needed to do a CT scan.

590451827be9e0264d1d3e93,Economic Survey Report: Maharashtra clocks 9.4 per cent growth despite demonetisation,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/economic-survey-report-maharashtra-clocks-9-4-per-cent-growth-despite-demonetisation-4574214/,2017-03-18,"Maharashtra, Indias most industrialised state, clocked an accelerated growth in 2016-17 notwithstanding the demonetisation of the high-value banknotes in November and the resultant impact on output as well as consumption. According to the Economic Survey Report (ESR) 2016-17, which was presented to the state legislature on Friday, the real gross state domestic product (GSDP) at constant (2011-12) market prices will be Rs 18,15, 498 crore, up 9.4 per cent over 2015-16. The state had clocked a 8.5 per cent growth rate last fiscal. In the post demonetisation period, the Centre had earlier lowered its own growth estimates for 2016-17 from 7.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 7.1 per cent in 2016-17.But what has sweetened the pot for the BJP-led government is the projection of a double-digit positive growth for the farm sector, which provides livelihood to over 58 per cent of the states population. Maharashtras rural economy, which has been on a downward spiral since 2014-15, rebounded on the back of a good monsoon spell in 2016-17 with a 12.5 per cent positive growth. After a dry spell of the previous two years, the state witnessed satisfactory rains during 2016-17. During the kharif season of 2016, production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cotton increased by 80 per cent, 187 per cent, 142 per cent and 83 per cent respectively. Crop production similarly rose significantly during the subsequent rabi season, states the report.The positive growth story from rural Maharashtra comes at a time when BJPs ally Shiv Sena and the Opposition have been targeting the BJP over the demand of waiver of farm loans. Expectedly, the BJP thumped itsback for the growth projections.While Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was in Delhi leading a Maharashtra government delegation to meet Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over the farm loan waiver issue, state Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, The ESR is a reflection of the performance of the government on commitments it had made at the start of the year. The policies and the implementing programmes we undertook to turn around the farm sector are bearing fruit.Slamming the Opposition for politicising the farm loan waiver issue, the finance minister went on to list how credit financing to the farm sector had improved under the BJP reign. The ESR report, too, included data on the improvement in the distribution of crop loans and agricultural term loans this year.Contending that the states economic growth had seen an upsurge at a time when most other state economies had either dipped or stagnated, Mungantiwar said the government will target a double-digit growth for the economy in 2017-18. The ESR indicated this goal too.Skillful fusion of technology, social structure, infrastructure backed by natural and human resources, along with the original way of production, development, and exchange ensured the leading position for the state in the national economy. The state is envisaging a double digit growth in the coming years and is putting in place necessary policies and implementing programmes to achieve the same, it stated.But the worry line for the BJP-led government in the farm sector was a projection of a steep decline in sugarcane production this year.The prime kharif cash crop in Western Maharashtra and Marathwada will see a 28 per cent drop in production  from 692 lakh in 2015-16 to 50,084 in 2016-17.Cane farmers and sugar millers have been protesting against the policies of the government in the wake of rising input costs for production.Mungantiwar conceded this was a concern.We will have to work for improving the situation, he said. Milk production also increased during the year.The growth driver within the farm sector was the crops sector.Satisfactory rains helped register a 19.3 per cent growth in the sub-sector, the ESR stated. But a stunted growth in the livestock, fishing and forestry sectors, which are all growing at below 2 per cent, limited the overall growth in the farm sector to 12.5 per cent.The government also thumped its back on the investments it had made in the irrigation and water conservation sector for the positive farm growth. Under the states flagship Jalyukt Shivar for drought-proofing villages, the ESR data revealed that 71 per cent of villages  4,374 out of 6,202 villages  selected under the initiative during 15-16 were now water neutral.Additional water storage potential of 11,82,230 thousand cubic metre had been created, the report said, while listing that another 5,281 villages were covered under the scheme in 16-17.While the governments economic report was silent on the impact of demonetisation on output and consumption across sectors, a stunted growth projection for the industry sector gave it away. The sectors overall growth rate slipped from 7.5 in 15-16 to 6.7 in 16-17.The current years projected growth rate is also lower than the growth it clocked in 14-15, when it had growth at 6.9 per cent. The mining and quarrying sub-sector dipped sharply from 4.3 per cent in 15-16 to 0.5 per cent in 16-17. The manufacturing sector decelerated from 9.3 per cent in 15-16 to 8.4.The construction industry too recorded a slump. But the power, gas, and water supply sub-sector upsurged from 3.3 per cent to 10.2 per cent.States fiscal managers said that the services sector too appeared to have felt the pinch following demonetisation with the hospitality, communication and transport services recording a slower growth rate. In the shadow of the demonetisation, financial services grew from 10.5 per cent in 15-16 to 11.7. Overall the services sector was growing at 10.8 per cent.The year-on-year inflation, which was in the negative zone from November, 2014 to March, 2016, increased from 0.8 per cent in April 2016 to 3.4 per cent in December, 2016. The rise in consumer price index was mainly due to rise in prices of pulses and vegetables. The main commodities responsible were tur dal, chana dal, urad dal, and some vegetables, the report said further. The states per capita net state income for 15-16 was Rs 1,47,399 as against the per capita national income of Rs 94,178.Another indicator of the demonetisation impact was that till December 2016, only 63.8 of the states projected revenue of 2.57 lakh crore had been realised. Mungantiwar said on Friday that the government will more or less meet the fiscal targets it had set at the start of the year.The states ESR report was also silent on the impact of the proposed Goods and Services Tax to the states own tax revenues. It is difficult to forecast the loss to the tax revenues at this stage. But the Centre has assured that these would be entirely compensated for, Mungantiwar said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Daiwik Hotel where I stayed, was offering packages to places like Shani Shingnapur, Nashik, Aurangabad (Ajanta & Ellora) etc. I chose to visit Shani Shingnapur as it was recently in the news, having lifted the ban on womens entry, yielding to a high- voltage campaign by activists. The temple trust recently allowed women to enter the sanctum sanctorum, breaking the tradition followed for several decades. Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. I was quite curious to see this village and know more about the place.So, I set out in the cab arranged by the hotel, accompanied by Digambar. During the two hour ride, every now and then I would spot a Rasavanthy on the way. You may wonder what Rasavanthy is. It is the name given to sugarcane juice in these parts! When you see a multitude of colourful balloons hanging from trees, with a few swings by the side decorated with bunches of colourful balloons, bright red plastic chairs neatly placed in a row, then youll find a bull cheerfully going in circles while a wooden contraption neatly extracts fresh sugarcane juice. Well, thats a Rasavanthy stall. Youll find them in rural Maharashtra, amidst onion, corn and sugarcane fields.Tukaram, the cab driver extolled the merits of sugarcane juice thus extracted versus the juice produced by an electric machine. He insisted that it is much tastier and doesnt turn black even after an hour. I stopped at one of the stalls, to take pictures and videos of a cheerful, patient bull that was relentlessly working to get gallons of the sweet juice for human consumption. We sat under the tall trees, surrounded by the festive decorations. I had the most delicious sugarcane juice I ever tasted, with an equally sweet sounding name - Rasavanthy.Drunk on the sweet juice, as I was slipping into a slumber, Tukaram started to narrate the story of Shani Shingnapur. The deity here is Shani, a Swayambhu that had self- emerged from earth many centuries ago, in the form of a black, imposing stone. Legend says that when a shepherd touched the stone with a pointed rod, the stone started bleeding.On that night Lord Shanaishwara appeared in the dream of the pious shepherd and directed him to build a temple without the roof, as he preferred to be under the open sky. He asked the shepherd to do daily pooja and Tailabhisheka every Saturday without fail. In return, he promised to make the village free of dacoits and thieves.As we reached the village I started looking at every house curiously. True, there were no doors anywhere. As we stopped the car to take some pictures, Amol, a cheerful young lad with a sunny smile offered to show us around. His two grandmothers, Sakku Bai and Tulja Bai were sitting on the porch of their house, busy talking and laughing as many kids were playing around Amol said they all live under one roof, more than 25 of them in their family.I could see the happiness in their faces and the joyfulness in the children. Sakku Bai, his maternal grandmother laughed heartily when I said her necklace was looking nice. Then Tulja Bai showed hers and received the same compliments from me and everyone burst out laughing. As we went around, Vittal Borude, the matriarch of a house was sitting in the warm sun, playing with his grandchildren. His wife Vimala said that she came as a bride, to this house with no doors. No one in the village seemed to have ever seen a door in their houses. We passed a tailor shop in a garage with no shutter. The tailor said he covers the threshold with a cloth in the night, after closing the shop. In the busy shopping complex too there were no doors or shutters in the shops. The goods are left as they are in the night, only to resume business in the morning.We went to the temple complex, which is quite huge and impressive. There is a specified place for devotees to place their offerings like rock salt, black til and oil on a wired a mesh. The oil gets drained and collected in a tank below, which is again pumped up, to fall on the top of the stone idol of Shani Bhagawan, through a pipe. I was quite impressed by this modernised abhishekam that eliminates any mess that is created by the oil offerings. Back at the hotel, I had one more gastronomic experience, which is typically Maharashtrian. The huge Marathi Thali consisted of Matki, Pithla, Baigan, Bhendi Masala, Aloo Jeera, Yellow Dal Tadka, Koshambari, Shrikhand, Paratha, Rice, Papad, Pickle and Thecha. I could hardly breathe after eating just one-fourth of the thali. Thats when I gave up, realising that one needs the appetite of a warrior to tackle it!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; blogs at www.vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) Sudhir Mungantiwar and Deepak Kesarkar ahead of Maharashtra Budget. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)The Maharashtra Government on Saturday proposed to raise tax on liquor and lottery while earmarking Rs 8,233 crore for irrigation projects in its budget for 2017-18 with an estimated revenue deficit of Rs 4,511 crore. Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar presented his third straight budget, which he described as agriculture-centric, in the assembly amid vociferous demand by the Opposition for a farm loan waiver.He said the BJP-led government has taken a major decision to merge plan and non-plan expenditure from 2017-18. The focus will now be on capital expenditure. This change will allow each department to use the entire fund allocated to it effectively instead of only the plan component which is 25 per cent of the total budget size, he said.After the merger, the concept of plan outlay will cease to exist, said the finance minister and added: A sum of Rs 77,184 crore has been earmarked for various schemes. He said in FY18, the revenue receipt is estimated at Rs 2,43,737 crore and revenue expenditure at Rs 2,48,242 crore. Consequently, there will be a revenue deficit worth Rs 4,511-crore.Mungantiwar said the government will try to reduce the deficit by cutting down avoidable expenditure and ensuring effective revenue recoveries. He proposed to increase the value-added tax (VAT) from 23.08 per cent to 25.93 per cent on the maximum retail price of the foreign liquor, the IMFL and the country liquor.Mungantiwar also proposed to raise tax on weekly lottery from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The tax proposals are expected to result in additional gain of Rs 396 crore. Describing the budget as agriculture-centric, the minister said a provision of Rs 8,233-crore has been made for various irrigation projects.He earmarked Rs 100 crore for micro-irrigation projects in Yavatmal and Wardha districts which will be completed using Israeli technology. Mungantiwar said the government proposes to double the farm income by 2021. To achieve this, it has decided to focus on irrigation, electricity, farm ponds, food processing, technology, marketing, group farming and agriculture credit.The farm loan waiver issue, which has been dominating the proceedings ever since the budget session began last week, again hogged the limelight. Opposition members, including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil (Congress), former finance ministers Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil (both NCP), were on their feet seeking relief for cultivators in form of a debt waiver. The members displayed banners, played cymbals and made loud noises as the minister read out his speech.Outlining tax concessions, Mungantiwar said in order to provide fair and remunerative price to sugarcane farmers, they will be exempted from purchase tax in 2017-18. Tax concessions on essential commodities like rice, wheat, pulses and their flour, turmeric, chilly, tamarind, jaggery, coconut, coriander seeds, fenugreek, parsley, papad, wet dates, solapuri chadars and towels will continue till the introduction of GST, expected to come into force from July 1.He proposed tax exemption of 6 per cent on geomembrane (plastic lining) used for water harvesting and storage, and lowered tax on aviation turbine fuel from 5 per cent to 1 per cent for a period of 10 years. VAT of 13.5 per cent has been exempted for soil and milk testing kits, card swipe machines, gas and electric incinerators.He said the state was ready for implementation of GST. For compensation post the new tax regime, annual growth rate of 14 per cent on revenue for 2015-16 shall be considered. Compensation amount shall include octroi in Mumbai and the local body tax, Mungantiwar said and announced setting up of three new benches of Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal.Asserting the government is committed to make farmers debt-free, Mungantiwar said at present 31.57 lakh cultivators, out of the total 1.36 crore, are indebted. The debt-ridden farmers face the risk of going out of the ambit of institutional credit. If farmers are to get crop loan, it is necessary for them to repay debts, he said.It is estimated that total institutional indebtedness is Rs 30,500 crore. The government has increased investment in the agriculture sector to help farmers come out of debt trap, Mungantiwar said. If the huge collective indebtedness is written off, it will have an adverse impact on investment in the sector, the finance minister maintained.There is no guarantee farmers will be perennially out of debt if a waiver is announced. On the loan issue, the state has sought assistance from the Centre, he said. We want to make it clear the state will give support and co-operation for any effort by the Centre to reduce farmer debt.A substantial provision of Rs 979 crore has been made in the budget for electrification of agriculture pumps and to clear backlog in eastern Vidarbha. An amount of Rs 125 crore has been allocated under the Punjabrao Deshmukh interest subsidy scheme. The government proposes to take steps to enable farmers to get remunerative prices for their produce and double their income, he said.These steps include providing godowns, strengthening competition through direct marketing of products and establish agro-marketing hubs. Mungantiwar proposed a scheme to provide refrigerated vans to facilitate faster movement of farm products. Adequate funds will be made available for the scheme.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58f5d9d17be9e01a357a862b,McDonald’s told not to sell Coke Zero at outlets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mcdonalds-told-not-to-sell-coke-zero-at-outlets/articleshow/57697873.cms,2017-03-18,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prohibited McDonald's from selling Coca Cola Zero across its 60 outlets in the state for violating norms of the Food Safety and Standard Regulations. The order was issued after the MNC was found selling the beverage that contains artificial sweeteners, suspected to cause health problems, without the mandatory warnings.The FDA action came after a Kolhapur official found that the product was being sold loose to ""unsuspecting clients"", including children and pregnant women.The key problem is the presence of two artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium--suspected to cause obesity, insulin resistance and high BP, among other health impact. Since years of research have failed to establish the components as completely harmless, any product containing them are supposed to carry warnings.The Coke Zero that was being sold at the McDonald's outlets did not specify that the drink was not recommended for children or for phenylketonurics.""For the latter, particularly, such a violation can be critical,"" said FDA commissioner Dr Harshdeep Kamble. ""Phenylketonuria is a rare genetic disorder and those who suffer from it cannot break down phenylalanine, a component of aspartame (one of the sweeteners). Their excess intake can lead to an unusual buildup in the body. Children can suffer from serious neurological deficiencies as a result of consuming the drink unknowingly,"" said Kamble, adding that people should be told about the dangers lurking inside the so-called healthy drinks.Calling the contravention a ""serious one"", Kamble said non-adherence of the order can lead to penalties for the company. ""They can sell the Coke Zero cans like most other fast food outlets but not through dispensers,"" he said. He clarified the order won't apply to other beverages as they don't contain artificial sugar and have necessary permissions.The drug regulatory body found out during investigations that Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt Ltd, which owns and runs McDonald's, was procuring a pre-mix from Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages. However, McDonald's was creating the final product by treating the mix with carbonated water. These sweeteners are also present in Diet Coke, said an FDA official.A spokesperson from McDonald's (west & south) told TOI that the company adheres to all statutory requirements. ""We are compliant with all applicable laws pertaining to usage of loose cups and glasses. For the time being, we have decided to follow the FDA directive."" The Hindustan Coca Cola, in their response to FDA, had said that they had all the requisite permissions to manufacture synthetic syrups containing artificial sweeteners for dispensers. The company, however, could not be reached for comments.Kamble added that both the companies have some sort of an exclusive arrangement as far as the product was concerned as no other food outlet was found selling the drink though a dispenser. He said that Section 34 of the Food Safety and Standards Act empowers the commissioner to issue such a prohibition order. However, the diktat will not be applicable outside Maharashtra.The FDA, in its order, has quoted a study by the Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, which stated that a daily consumption of diet soda increased the risk of non-hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma in men by 42%. Another study quoted in the report spoke of a link between artificial sweeteners and metabolic abnormalities.The USFDA says that no health problems have been consistently linked to aspartame use. ""Research on artificial sweeteners, including aspartame, continues today. For people who want to avoid aspartame, the easiest way to do this is to check the labels before buying or eating foods or drinks."""

But the government was firm. It said such a step would lead to a fiscal collapse and not benefit farmers.Mungantiwar said of the 1.36 crore farmers, 1.07 are indebted, 67 lakh of them hold less than 1 hectare of farmland. To strengthen their financial condition, developing agricultural infrastructure is key, not a waiver. For this, the budget earmarked Rs 8,233 crore for pending irrigation projects; Rs2,812 crore for completion of 26 shortlisted projects nearing completion under PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana. To give a boost to the long-pending Krishna Marathwada project, the state made a separate Rs250 crore allocation, keeping it outside the governor formula. The project will irrigate 33,945 hectares in drought-prone Osmanabad and Beed and provide drinking water to 288 villages. NCP leader and former finance minister Jayant Patil, like many others in Opposition, criticised the states decision. The state talks of allocation over and above the what was done as per guidelines of the Governor, but figures show it couldnt even release funds allocated for irrigation projects.Mungantiwar said the governments focus is on doubling agriculture income over the next four years by increasing production and productivity. The budgets allocations show the states focussing on irrigation, electricity, food processing, technology, and to push for direct marketing of produce. The budget allocated Rs 979.10 crore for electrification of agicultural pumps in east Vidarbha. Tax on buying sugar cane imposed on sugar factories was waived to enable them to pay fair prices to farmers. This will cause a burden on the state exchequer for 2015-16 and 2016-17 of Rs700 crore. To encourage use of milk testing to curb adulteration, the state removed VAT of 13.5% on these kits.On farm loans, CM Devendra Fadnavis said the Centre was positive about institutionalising the credit system and the state will bear its share. The three-tier system will let farmers take fresh loans even if they are defaulters as the institutions providing loans are governed by RBI.Experts are not confident about the provisions. I dont think any of these schemes will directly benefit farmers. Take the farm pond scheme. The staten provides Rs 50,000 to farmers but it costs more than Rs1 lakh. Sugarcane tax waiver will benefit the factories, said SS Magar, former vice chancellor, Konkan agriculture university.Read: Maha budget 2017-18: Heres what Mumbai gotFocus is on making farming sustainable: Maharashtra finance ministerOppn burns Maharashtra budget, Shiv Sena stays calm"

Jogawat was kept under observation for 24 hours after he complained of minor fever and a burning sensation in his urinary tract on Tuesday night.It was a minor infection. It subsided after initial treatment. I am doing well now, Jogawat told to Hindustan Times. Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, who had successfully performed a bariatric surgery on Jogawat ,said he is currently stable and will be able to rejoin the workforce soon.Jogawat had been suffering from a urinary infection for a while. However, the condition was unrelated to his bariatric surgery, which took place in Mumbai. He called me after persistent episodes of fever and chills. I requested the local doctor to run primary tests and to not put him on heavy antibiotics as the complication wasnt severe, said Dr Lakdawala.The Neemuch doctor treating Jogawat, Dr Vipul Garg, said he was discharged after a day and will be on oral medication for the next five days. The patient came to the hospital complaining of chills and a severe burning sensation while urinating. We initially thought that this may have resulted from the major surgery he underwent, but later realised it was a urine infection said Dr Garg.Dr Lakdawala said the infection was probably related to his diabetes level. However, as Jogawat is on a strict diet, his sugar levels are expected to come under control. The doctor asked me if we needed to do a CT scan. I told him that Jogawat was stable and there was no need to for additional tests, he said.ReadCop fat-shamed by Shobhaa De develops post-operation complicationsFat-shamed MP cop Daulatram Jogawat undergoes surgery in MumbaiEman Ahmed vs Daulatram Jogawat: Two obese patients with different treatment"

The survey, released on Friday, estimates the real Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) at Rs. 18,15,498 crore.For the second consecutive fiscal year, agriculture and allied activities have registered a negative growth rate: (-)4.6% for 2015-16 and (-)11.2% in 2014-15. Thanks to a poor monsoon, production of major crops decreased substantially during 2015-16, while that of foodgrain declined by nearly 27% over the previous year.Oilseed production dropped by nearly 9.1%, and sugarcane, fruits and vegetables too registered a decrease in production by 21.1% and 3.4% respectively. Only cotton registered a 10.8% growth. The survey, however, estimates double-digit growth for the sector at 12.5% for 2016-17, as the State benefited from a good monsoon in the current fiscal year.Growth in industry sub-sectors like mining, manufacturing and construction is expected to slow down.The per capita Net State Income (Per Capita NSDP) at current prices is estimated at Rs. 1,47,399 crore for 2015-16; the same was Rs. 1,32,341 during 2014-15. With revenue expenditure expected to be Rs. 2,24,455 crore as per the 2016-17 budget estimate and revenue receipts at Rs. 2,20,810 crore, the States revenue deficit stands at Rs. 3,645 crore, while fiscal deficit is estimated at around Rs. 35,031 crore. The States debt stock is estimated to have gone up to Rs. 3,56,213 crore from the revised estimate of Rs. 3,20,210 crore for 2015-16.In all this, there is some solace, with the survey stating that as per 2016-17 budget estimates, the percentage of fiscal deficit and debt stock to GSDP is well within the fiscal limits stipulated by the 14th Finance Commission under Consolidated Fiscal Reform Path.Of the total revenue expenditure of Rs. 2,24,455 crore, 35.6% is being spent on salary and wages, 10% on pensions, 40.9% on maintenance, purchase of goods and services and 12.6% on interests on loans.When we took charge, the State economys growth rate was 5.4%, which we have taken to 9.4%.

(Clockwise from top): Swaranjali and Pranjali, the daughters of Swati Jamdade who died following a botched-up abortion in Mhaisal village, with their paternal grandmother Padmini Patangrao Jamdade in Manerajuri village; Dr. Babasaheb Khidrapure being produced in court in connection with the abortion racket case; Dr. Srihari Ghodke's sonography centre in Kagwad, Karnataka; and Swatis parents Sunil Jhadhav and Vijaya with her sister Arthi at their home in Khandrajuri village.Arunangsu Roy ChowdhuryOn the morning of May 19, 2016, two medical officers came calling at the Bharti Hospital in Mhaisal, a tiny village on the banks of the Krishna river in Sangli district. Perched on the edge of Maharashtra and bordering Karnataka, rumours of sex-selective abortions at the hospital had brought it under the lens of the authorities. Barely a km away, at the government-run Primary Health Centre (PHC), colourful posters on protecting the girl child aimed at changing mindsets. Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (educate the girl child, protect the girl child), the posters exhorted villagers.Armed with an anonymous complaint received by the Collector, Dr. Vijay Jadhav and Dr. Ashok Mohite, both government medical officers, examined the two-storey bungalow in a narrow lane that also houses a dozen residential premises. They checked the registers and looked around. There were no signs of pregnant women. However, two patients were found admitted  one for diarrhoea and the other with typhoid. Dr. Babasaheb Khidrapure, a Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery (BHMS), the owner of the hospital, was given a clean chit. Nothing suspicious found, their report stated.Ten months later, on March 3, 2017, two State medical officers, Dr. J.K. Momin and Dr. Suresh Kamble, raided the hospital again. Twenty-six-year-old Swati Jamdade had died on March 1, following a botched-up abortion on the hospitals premises. This time, the doctors arrived with a police team in tow. To their horror, they discovered a full-fledged operation theatre in the basement being run by the homeopath, who was not eligible to conduct surgical procedures. The white-tiled basement also had two clean rooms, with beds. Dr. Khidrapure was nowhere to be seen. He had fled before the raid. A computer table in the corner was stacked with registers. While many things appeared displaced and missing to the raiding officers, they seized everything they could lay their hands on, and questioned locals.A routine line of questioning led the investigating team to Ravi Sutar, the local milkman who was also tasked with disposing biomedical waste from the hospital. Sutar pointed to an area barely 150 m away. On March 5, the police unearthed what Dr. Khidrapure had been burying  19 foetuses were exhumed, bundled in blue plastic bags and buried in a mud pit. Some in advanced stages of decomposition, others freshly buried, these were the aborted foetuses over the past two months, concluded the police. The foetuses have been sent for DNA testing.If Dr. Khidrapure had carried out 19 illegal abortions in two months, how many unborn babies had the doctor killed in his practice over the last eight years, the police now wonder.A botched-up abortionSwati, from Manerajuri village, 40 km away from Mhaisal, was a mother of two  four-year-old Swaranjali and one-and-a-half-year-old Pranjali  and was pregnant with her third child. Her husband Pravin, a farmer, wanted a boy and was desperate to know the sex of the unborn child.  Chachni karun ghe (Get the test done), a friend suggested to Pravin and referred him to Dr. Khidrapures hospital. On February 28, Pravin landed at the Bharti Hospital with his wife, then in her fifth month of pregnancy. After a brief meeting with Dr. Khidrapure, the couple was referred to Dr. Srihari Ghodkes clinic in the bordering Kagwad village in Karnataka, six km away from Mhaisal, where a sonography was conducted. With the Maharashtra government keeping an eagle eye on hospitals, sex determination was a strict no-no. But in bordering Karnataka, rules were lax. There was no paperwork involved. Dr. Khidrapure informed Pravin that it was a girl and he promptly offered to abort the foetus.Despite his wifes pleadings, Pravin admitted her to the Bharti Hospital on March 1. He called his father-in-law Sunil Jhadhav, who lives in Puducherry, to inform that he was going ahead with the abortion. I dissuaded him from going ahead with the procedure and asked him to consult a doctor, Jhadhav told The Hindu . But by then, Dr. Khidrapure had already induced labour by placing abortion pills Misoprostol in the patient.In a span of four hours, Misoprostol induces cramps and bleeding through which a woman aborts. Doctors also carry out a vacuum aspiration to remove the contents of the uterus. But before Dr. Khidrapure could carry out the procedure, Swati became breathless and her condition deteriorated. Ill-equipped to handle an emergency, Dr. Khidrapure asked Pravin to rush his wife to the Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital in Miraj, 20 km away from Mhaisal. Swati succumbed on her way to the hospital. Her family subsequently forced Pravin to take the body to the Sangli Civil Hospital. As the patient was brought dead, the doctors informed the Miraj police as per protocol. The police, in turn, quizzed Pravin, who blurted out that his wife had died during an abortion.But when the police stumbled on the foetuses, what emerged was a multi-State racket that Dr. Khidrapure was running. To date, the police have arrested 12 people including Dr. Khidrapure, two doctors from Karnataka who conducted the sex determination tests, and four agents  Saatgonda Patil and Veerangonda Gumte from Belgaum and Yasin Tehsildar and Sandip Jadhav from Kolhapur  who preyed on couples desperate for a male child and eager to abort the female foetuses.While authorities were sleepingDr. Khidrapure grew up in Kanwad village that falls under Kolhapur district. After completing his studies in homeopathy in Belgaum, he opened a small dispensary in Mhaisal where he prescribed medicines for minor ailments like fever, pain and dog bites. It was sometime in 2008 that he bought a piece of land on which he built the Bharti Hospital and began offering hysterectomy and appendectomy surgeries by inviting doctors from Sangli, most of whom were retired practitioners from the Sangli Civil Hospital, to operate on patients. The police are questioning the doctors who worked here.The district health officials were well aware about all the illegalities from the very beginning. But they simply turned a blind eye, alleges Ashok Wadar, an activist from Mhaisal who had written the anonymous letter to the Collector in 2016 following which the medical officers were sent for an inspection. He also claims to have made 30 calls on the governments toll-free number meant for whistle-blowers who want to highlight Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act violations. But no one paid heed to my complaints, he says, adding that Dr. Khidrapure had top connections due to which no one dared to take him on.Incidentally, the PHC that stands within a km from Dr. Khidrapures hospital is administered by a District Health Officer (DHO) who also has the responsibility of keeping tabs on private nursing homes in the area. I never received any complaints about the hospital, says Dr. Ram Hankare, DHO since the past three years. The doctor was probably conducting illegal abortions during night and it is the civil surgeons job to keep a watch, Dr. Hankare told The Hindu . When questioned, the civil surgeon, Dr. Sanjay Salunkhe, tossed it right back at the DHO: It is the DHOs responsibility to keep a watch on the medical establishments in his area.Of the 25 private nursing homes in Mhaisal, only one has the licence to run an In-Patient Department (IPD) and can admit patients. Bharti Hospital does not feature on this list but Dr. Khidrapure still admitted patients.During the March 3 raid on Bharti Hospital, the police found, besides the basement operation theatre and two rooms, surgical equipment such as abdominal retractors, curved artery forceps, Sims speculum, dilator, allis tissue forceps and spiral needles; oxygen cylinders; an X-ray machine; huge quantities of abortion pills; and other medications that were charred. A large pipe connects the basement to the drainage system outside and the police suspect that some of the aborted foetuses would have been discarded through it. The police have learnt that most of the abortions were carried out using Misoprostol; the hospital was buying the drug in bulk from a Sangli-based distributor, Sunil Khedkar. However, the absence of a sonography machine used to determine the sex of the foetus puzzled the police. The search took the police across the border into Karnataka.The multi-State racketDuring the search at Bharti Hospital, the Miraj Rural police stumbled upon names of some doctors in the registers. A raid conducted in Dr. Srihari Ghodkes clinic in Kagwad, Karnataka yielded two sonography machines. The clinic functioned mostly at night. The patients were sent for sonography tests to Kagwad and the abortion would be conducted in Mhaisal, says Dattatray Shinde, Superintendent of Police, Sangli.Run from a two-storey bungalow, the clinic stands barely 100 m from the Kagwad police station and another 200 m from the government-run Community Health Centre. Dr. Ghodke, 68, who has been arrested, is said to have been running the clinic for over two decades. It was a maternity home at first that abruptly shut down. Later on, we could only see some action after 11 p.m. There would be couples going in and out of the bungalow, says a local, adding that everyone in the area knew that something illegal was happening. But the police chose to turn a blind eye. Why should we visit any clinics? We only investigate cases that come to us, says Laxman Ajjanagi, head constable at the Kagwad police station. Kagwad falls under the Belgaum district that has 242 registered PCPNDT centres and over 2,400 medical centres.Meanwhile, the Miraj police have arrested another doctor, Ramesh Devgikar, 64, from Bijapur in Karnataka who has a Diploma in Medical Radio Diagnosis and is suspected to have sent several patients for abortion to Dr. Khidrapures hospital. The police have seized two sonography machines from him as well. The Devgikar X-ray and Sonography Centre is among the dozen-odd small and large hospitals, nursing homes and radiology centres strewn across a 300-metre radius in the busy, narrow lane in Meenakshi Chowk. A retired doctor from the government-run district hospital in Bijapur, Devgikar set up his private centre 15 years ago. His tryst with the law dates back to 2015 when he was first booked under the PCPNDT Act by health officials who also seized his sonography machine. While the machine was later returned, the case is still pending in court. Neighbours say Devgikar had the busiest practice in the area. On average, he conducted more than 50 obstetric sonographies in a day. Police are still investigating into how many of these were for sex determination.Health workers from Bijapur say that sex-selective abortions are extremely common in the area. We come across many women who have one or two daughters and tell us that they dont want another girl. Suddenly during a medical check-up, we learn that these women have had a miscarriage or a stillbirth, says a health worker, adding that the government has made it mandatory for them to maintain tayee or mother cards on which details of pregnant women and their existing children are mentioned. According to her, a health worker keeps track of 20-22 pregnant women annually, of which at least 3-4 undergo abortions.Sources from Bijapur say most clients coming to Devgikar were from Sangli and Miraj. The doctors are closely connected with the agents who operate from border districts of Karnataka such as Belagavi. Some of the agents have their own vehicles which they use to carry the pregnant women to Bijapur from Maharashtra for sonographies, says a source, adding that the gender is disclosed in a very methodical way. All the doctors have their unique code words. The disclosure is done to the agent always. One of the most popular codes is pointing at the ear when its a girl, as girls wear earrings. If they touch the nose, it means a boy.A massive crackdown on sonography centres had begun in 2011 in Maharashtra, and health officials and the police suspect this is what prompted Dr. Khidrapure to explore options across the border. According to Deputy Superintendent of Police (Miraj division) Dheeraj Patil, Dr. Khidrapure charged anywhere between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000 per abortion while the doctors conducting the sex determination tests would charge Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000 per test depending on the profile of the patients and the agents would make Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 per couple.Oh, for a boy!At the core of these abortions is the deep-rooted desire in society to have a boy, an heir to the family. Everyone wants one boy at least. What is there to understand in this? says Namdeo Suryavanshi, a Mhaisal farmer who has two daughters aged four and two and whose wife Meenakshi is expecting a third baby soon. It is not that I am not going to look after my daughters. They are also important. But a son will complete our family, says Suryavanshi, who works in a sugar-cane farm. When asked if he went for any sex determination tests, Suryavanshi promptly says, I have got all my wifes tests done at the Miraj Civil Hospital.Shafiabi Inamdar, 62, from the neighbouring Kanwad village has seven daughters. Today if I had a boy, he would have been there to look after me and take care of this house, she says. The mothers are helpless. There is tremendous pressure on them to have a boy. The in-laws and the husbands are brutal when it comes to having a girl child back-to-back, says Rajashri Zare, an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) from the village. Everyone just wants vanshacha diva (lineage flame).All I ever wanted was for my son-in-law to keep my daughter happy, says Swatis father Sunil Jhadhav. We had shelled out Rs. 3 lakh in cash, 150 grams of gold and an entire sansar set that consists of all household things like television, refrigerator, dining table, sofa set, utensils, bed etc.Clearly, that was not enough.with Firoz Rozindar in BijapurThe district health officials were well aware about all the illegalities from the very beginning.

The Boston-based investor will own a significant minority interest in the Mumbai-headquartered Ideal Cures, a first-generation entrepreneurial enterprise founded 15 years ago.Ideal Cures' products are used to provide aesthetic as well as functional coatings for tablets and capsules. Aesthetic sugar or film coatings allow for swallowability and mask taste, while functional coatings serve a number of purposes ranging from moisture, oxygen and light protection of drugs to controlling drug delivery to a specific part of the gastrointestinal tract.TA Associates believes that the trend is to outsource the production of ready-to-use, fully-formulated coatings, which is being driven most notably by companies seeking innovative solutions that reduce processing time and a company's carbon footprint, such as Ideal Cures provides. ""Ideal Cures has a robust business strategy, and over the last few years has emerged as a provider of high quality products and services in the tablet coating space, with a vast and diversified customer base globally,"" said Dhiraj Poddar, country head (India), TA Associates Advisory.The company, which competes with global giants such as Ashland and Colorscon , has three manufacturing plants located in Vasai, Jammu and Khambat; and two state-of- the-art R&D facilities in Mumbai and Vasai.

The BJP-led government's alliance partner, Shiv Sena , which had joined the protests in the run-up to the budget, back-tracked and cooperated during the budget presentation.The opposition has dismissed the farm allocation as misleading. ""These so-called allocations to the farm sector are nothing but financial jugglery. The budget is hugely disappointing to farmers,"" said NCP's Dhananjay Munde ""A farm loan waiver will require Rs 30,500 crore, and there is no guarantee the farmer will be out of debt for good. Instead we are investing in the farm sector,"" countered CM Devendra Fadnavis. He said the state had also approached the Centre to help in extending institutional credit to farmers who had defaulted on loans.Within the budget's farm sector spend, the main focus is irrigation. The budget allocates Rs 8,233 crore to the water resources department and Rs 1,200 crore for the state's water conservation scheme, the Jalyukta Shivar Yojana. An allocation of Rs 2,812 crore has been made under the PM's Krishi Sinchai Yojana. Another Rs 225 crore has been set aside for its wells and farm ponds scheme and Rs 250 crore for Marathwada's irrigation. A sum of Rs 100 crore has been allocated to micro-irrigation schemes in Vidarbha and Rs 979 crore towards agricultural pumps. In order to boost farm income, the budget has set aside Rs 200 crore to set up Farmer Producer Companies for group farming and marketing.Given that Goods and Service Tax (GST) is expected to be introduced from July 1, the state government has not introduced any new taxes, nor proposed an increase in taxes, except for liquor and tax on lottery.Tax on lotteries which are payable by organisers stands increased by Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Liquor is out of the GST ambit and with an increase in the VAT rate on MRP of country and foreign liquor to 25.93% from the existing 23.08%, the state will stand to gain.For the purpose of compensation to the state, under GST, the annual growth rate of 14% on the revenue for the financial year 2015-16 shall be considered. The compensation amount shall also include octroi in Mumbai (approx Rs 6,500 crore) and local body tax.The budget has exempted sugarcane purchase tax from 2015-2017 to sugar factories. This will generate Rs 700 crore which they could use to pay the cane price to farmers, it says. The budget also exempts the 13.5% VAT on card swipe machines to encourage cashless transactions.In line with the Centre's budget, the state budget has merged plan and non-plan expenditure. The change will bring more flexibility to each department to use their department allocation instead of only the plan component, which is only 25% of the total size of the budget, the state says."

Every year, this farmer would give away some of his high-quality seeds to neighbours. Later, a lucrative breeze would usher pollen from their crops to his farm. This cross-pollination would bring him not only the best crop but also the ''best farmer' award annually. The moral of this story narrated breathlessly by Yadav's Algebra teacher, Amit Thakur, was that happiness multiplies by sharing positivity and so she must greet other students with a smile during the exams instead of avoiding them.Such Facebook-sourced seeds of wisdom are what Thakur-who covers five exam centres in Navi Mumbai on a bike before every paper-shares with his SSC students trusting that nature return the favour during the results. ""I have more faith in motivational than in god,"" says Thakur, whose students seek out his ""pravachans"" to escape the pre-exam drama of rustling books, pacing students, anxious parents and, as Yadav puts it, ""stereotypical teachers who ask us if we are prepared.""Thakur of Airoli's Sushiladevi Deshmukh Vidyalaya may not be stereotypical but his school-sanctioned motivational rounds are typical of a young trend fuelled by the pursuit of board exam success. In the bid to show they care, schools are showering meticulous checklists, mindfulness strategies and such keen personal touches that you'd be forgiven for mistaking the hall ticket for a business class pass.If Santacruz's R N Podar School held a yoga session for students 90 minutes before their first paper, Sangita Kukreti, principal ofVile Parle's Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School, spent five days last week phoning each of her 300 students to wish them luck. As a tradition, her school hands out sugar candy as prasad to each student, reminding you of a Gujarat exam centre that recently handed students welcome drinks and sprinkled flowers on them.Snigdha Roy, principal of Vashi's Father Agnel school, calls them 'feel-good'' gestures. ""They make students feel confident,"" says Roy, whose school distributed a pre-exam 'shopping list' that comprised, among other things, 20 chocolates. ""One to be eaten on each day of the exam period,"" says Roy, like a doctor prescribing a dosage. This list even advises students to ''change the watch battery"", ""carry an extra set of glasses"" and ""visit the dentist"". The last one should come in handy for another reason. ""On the last day, we treat all the students to ice-cream,"" says Roy.In fact, till two years ago, Roy's school used to drop children at their centre in school buses but they stopped as ""centres are too scattered now,"" says Roy. A teacher's presence at the centre has hidden perks. Years ago, history teacher Shobha Ramana, rushed a nervous student, who had ended up at the wrong centre, to the right venue in her car. ""I'd forgotten about this but she still remembers,"" says Ramana, about the ex-student.Younger schools are more eager to please. ""They are nervous,"" says CBSE student Ritika Mukherjee about her three-year-old Thane school, New Horizon, whose vice-principal showed up at the exam centre to hand out chocolate bars before the Hindi paper. ""It defused our tension,"" says Mukherjee, who tucked the bar into her bag and bit into it after the exam.Technology too comes to the rescue. With the help of a system called RFID (radio frequency identification)-the use of radio waves to read information stored on a tag attached to student identity cards-Shobhana Nandakumar, principal of Dombivli's The South Indian Association (SIA) High School, sends a good luck SMS to 200 board exam attendees via their parents' phones. ""Even parents feel reassured that we care,"" she says. Besides, through an app called Fliplearn, where teachers connect with students in real-time, these students receive proverbs like: 'Think high and you will raise high' and 'Do the best you can until you know better'. ""We even upload photos of toppers on our facebook page,"" says Nandakumar.Sometimes, higher forces than social media are invoked. To seduce lady luck, who sits somewhere between prayer and practice. Some high-end schools invite experts on Buddhist chanting and Vipassana meditation to prep minds. In the backdrop, school counsellors ease mental traffic. Recently, SIA's school counsellor Swati Parab formed a support group of ten slacking students who called themselves 'Rising Stars'. ""What if we go blank in the exam hall?"" they asked Parab, who dismissed the fear by comparing the brain to Google. ""If you search calmly, the answers will come sooner or later,"" says Parab, who also choregoraphed their dreams when she asked them to ""visualise yourself writing each paper well, 15 days before the exams"".Part cheerleader, part life-coach, their tactics may seem hippy-dippy-at least one student said a yoga session before the exam wasn't calming-but schools say they help. ""I get grateful SMSes from students,"" says Thakur, who believes attention is the best way to show you care. Sometimes it could come from unlikely sources. SSC student Jayalakshmi Iyer of Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandir Trust, lit up at an unprecedented sight before her exam. ""The security guards smiled and said good morning,"" she says."

The prices are now Rs. 37-Rs. 38 a kg.The Centre should not permit imports of sugar this year (October 2016-September 2017) as output may outstrip demand, said Palani G. Periasamy, president of South Indian Sugar Mills Association.The current season started with an opening stock of 7.7 million tonnes and the production this year is expected to be 20.3 million tonnes. The total sugar consumption will be about 24 million tonnes and the closing stock for the current season is estimated to be four million tonnes.Though production has been hit in south Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu because of drought, it is expected to be high in Uttar Pradesh this year.Mr. Periasamy said the domestic industry was reviving after three years of a sharp drop in prices, the demand has stabilised, and the current demand-supply position is expected to be comfortable.The industry is just recovering and we should not disturb it. Should there be a need for imports, it can be reviewed after a couple of months. But, we estimate there will not be a need for it. If we import, the market sentiment will push down the domestic prices and local mills will not be able to download the stocks, he said.Production in Uttar Pradesh this year was initially estimated to be 8.3 million tonnes. But it might go up to 9.5 million tonnes. This season we expect bumper production in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Periasamy said.Usually, sugar produced in the south is supplied to the northern States too. But, this year, with production affected in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, supply to north India might not be there.But, there will be no shortage, Mr. Periasamy said. Further, sowing is said to be good in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Hence, sugar arrivals will start early next season.The current season began with ex-gate prices hovering around Rs. 27 a kg and the prices now are Rs. 37-Rs. 38 a kg. Any price increase in the future will be moderate and even if it goes up, it will be less than the international prices, he said. The production cost was Rs. 36.50 a kg."

Instead, it tabled a budget on Saturday for 2017-18 which allocates roughly Rs 14,000 crore to the agricultural sector, mainly for irrigation. The state also proposed doubling agricultural income by 2021.Last year, which witnessed one of the worst droughts Maharashtra has seen in recent memory, the state had allocated Rs 25,000 crore to agriculture, including Rs 7,000 crore for irrigation.In financial terms, the budget projects a revenue shortfall of Rs 4,511 crore. However, last year's initial and later figures on revenue deficit vary widely. In 2016-17, the state's initial figure was Rs 3,644 crore, but the revised estimate was Rs 14,377 crore.The state's debt is expected to balloon to over Rs 4 lakh crore. Regardless of the rising debt, the budget allocates Rs 200 crore to build statues: memorials of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Bal Thackeray.The budget also allocates less to capital expenditure used for asset and infrastructure spendingthan the previous year. In 2016-17, the revised capital expenditure was Rs 37,058 crore. In the 2017-18 budget the allocation is Rs 35,504 crore.The budget was presented amid loud protests from the opposition Congress and NCP . The BJP-led government's alliance partner, Shiv Sena, which had joined the protests in the run-up to the budget, back-tracked and cooperated during the budget presentation.The opposition has dismissed the farm allocation as misleading. ""These so-called allocations to the farm sector are nothing but financial jugglery. The budget is hugely disappointing to farmers,"" said NCP's Dhananjay Munde.""A farm loan waiver will require Rs 30,500 crore, and there is no guarantee the farmer will be out of debt for good. Instead we are investing in the farm sector,"" countered CM Devendra Fadnavis. He said the state had also approached the Centre to help in extending institutional credit to farmers who had defaulted on loans.Within the budget's farm sector spend, the main focus is irrigation. The budget allocates Rs 8,233 crore to the water resources department and Rs 1,200 crore for the state's water conservation scheme, the Jalyukta Shivar Yojana. An allocation of Rs 2,812 crore has been made under the PM's Krishi Sinchai Yojana. Another Rs 225 crore has been set aside for its wells and farm ponds scheme and Rs 250 crore for Marathwada 's irrigation. A sum of Rs 100 crore has been allocated to micro-irrigation schemes in Vidarbha and Rs 979 crore towards agricultural pumps.In order to boost farm income, the budget has set aside Rs 200 crore to set up Farmer Producer Companies for group farming and marketing.Given that Goods and Service Tax (GST) is expected to be introduced from July 1, the state government has not introduced any new taxes, nor proposed an increase in taxes, except for liquor and tax on lottery.Tax on lotteries which are payable by organisers stands increased by Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh.

But the government was firm. It said such a step would lead to a fiscal collapse and not benefit farmers.Mungantiwar said of the 1.36 crore farmers, 1.07 are indebted, 67 lakh of them hold less than 1 hectare of farmland. To strengthen their financial condition, developing agricultural infrastructure is key, not a waiver.For this, the budget earmarked Rs 8,233 crore for pending irrigation projects; Rs2,812 crore for completion of 26 shortlisted projects nearing completion under PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana. To give a boost to the long-pending Krishna Marathwada project, the state made a separate Rs250 crore allocation, keeping it outside the governor formula. The project will irrigate 33,945 hectares in drought-prone Osmanabad and Beed and provide drinking water to 288 villages. NCP leader and former finance minister Jayant Patil, like many others in Opposition, criticised the states decision. The state talks of allocation over and above the what was done as per guidelines of the Governor, but figures show it couldnt even release funds allocated for irrigation projects.Mungantiwar said the governments focus is on doubling agriculture income over the next four years by increasing production and productivity. The budgets allocations show the states focussing on irrigation, electricity, food processing, technology, and to push for direct marketing of produce. The budget allocated Rs 979.10 crore for electrification of agicultural pumps in east Vidarbha. Tax on buying sugar cane imposed on sugar factories was waived to enable them to pay fair prices to farmers. This will cause a burden on the state exchequer for 2015-16 and 2016-17 of Rs700 crore. To encourage use of milk testing to curb adulteration, the state removed VAT of 13.5% on these kits.On farm loans, CM Devendra Fadnavis said the Centre was positive about institutionalising the credit system and the state will bear its share. The three-tier system will let farmers take fresh loans even if they are defaulters as the institutions providing loans are governed by RBI.Experts are not confident about the provisions. I dont think any of these schemes will directly benefit farmers. Take the farm pond scheme. The staten provides Rs 50,000 to farmers but it costs more than Rs1 lakh. Sugarcane tax waiver will benefit the factories, said SS Magar, former vice chancellor, Konkan agriculture university.Read: Maha budget 2017-18: Heres what Mumbai gotFocus is on making farming sustainable: Maharashtra finance ministerOppn burns Maharashtra budget, Shiv Sena stays calm"

Celebrated since 3,000 years, the festival occurs on the first day of the first month of the Fasli calender. For Mumbai's minuscule peace loving Zoroastrian community comprising 50,000 odd Parsis and Iranis, Navroze is celebrated with a lot of fervour.The numerous Parsi baugs dotted along the city come alive with the cheerful greetings of 'Navroze Mubarak' after which the faithful make a trip to the neighbourhood agiary or atash behram  most of them in south Mumbai  to pray and offer sandalwood to the holy fire that burns inside. The agiaries have been scrupulously cleaned in the days leading to Navroze and decorated with beautiful divas and fresh flowers. Some Zoroastrians have jasans  thanksgiving prayers performed by priests  at home while some make a trip to the Iranshah at Udwada  the holiest place of worship for Zoroastrians.Houses are spruced up, the most expensive China and fancy linen is brought out, colourful intricate rangoli is made at the entrance and colourful bead and glass torans are hung across thresholds. According to ancient customs, the Iranis lay down a special table, where the Khordeh Avesta (holy book) is placed along with a lamp or candle, sprouted wheat or beans, a bowl with a silver coin, flowers, sweets, rosewater, mirror and bowl of water. Seven food items beginning with 'sh' in Persian  wine, sugar, milk, sweet meat, honey, sweets and syrup  are placed along with fruits, dried fruits and nuts. Signifying prosperity, wealth and happiness among other things, the table is considered an auspicious part of celebrations.The highlight of the day, of course, is the food  no Parsi occasion is complete without a scrumptious meal. The day begins with the tempting aroma of frying vermicelli or sev in ghee with sugar, almonds, raisins and charoli. Some homes make the rava, which is white and has almonds and raisins on top. Breakfast also comprises the Parsi poro, an omelette of tomatoes, green chillies, onions, kothmir or the akuri, which is scrambled. Lunch could be Sali Boti, Dhan Dal Patia or Mutton Dhansak. Dessert is jalebi, sutarfeni, falooda or kulfi.After the indispensable afternoon siesta, it is time to host a get-together at home, meet old friends at the Parsi Gymkhana or spend the evening watching a play or the latest movie, followed by dinner at a fancy restaurant. While the naataks are nowhere as popular as they used to be during the time of the late Adi Marzban , known for his outrageous Gujarati plays, there are still plenty of other choices. Navroze Mubarak to all!"

Though his party is an ally of the BJP and constituent of NDA, it is up in arms against the state government on the issue of giving relief to farmers by way of loan waiver.Political leaders of all hues and farm activists have not taken kindly to Bhattacharya's remarks last week that repeated loan waiver if allowed would lead to farmers getting into habit of defaulting on bank dues expecting the relief. The protesters led by Shetty burned an effigy of SBI chairperson and condemned her for opposing relief at a time when farmers are in deep trouble and driven to suicide because of wrong government policies, bad market conditions and unsuitable weather.Talking to TOI, Shetty said the SBI's chief's remarks were insensitive. ""Till date the farm loans have been waived only twice, one time up to a small extent by the VP Singh government. In 2006, though the Manmohan Singh government claimed to have passed on a Rs71,000 crore of farmers' dues, the actual dues waived accounted for at only Rs52,000 crore,"" said Shetty. He cited the reply by finance minister Arun Jaitley in parliament to a question on the issue.""These sort of remarks coming from country's largest bank are shocking. The SBI happily offered huge loan to Gautam Adani for purchasing mines in Australia. Industry and business have failed to repay Rs6 lakh crores to banks. Yet, she thinks farmers do not need any relief. She should know that big defaulters like Vijay Mallya leave the country to escape repayment, but poor farmer has no other way but to end life when he is not able to repay loan,"" said Shetty.The farm leader was in Vidarbha to express solidarity with farm activists who observed a day's fast in memory of Yavatmal farmer Sahebrao Karpe of Chilgawhan village in Mahagaon thesil who committed suicide along with family on March 19, 1986 triggering a wave of farm suicides that remains unabated till date.""The government only understands language of numbers.

However, the Marathwada region witnessed twists with the Sena etching alliances with the Congress in some areas to stop the BJP staking claim to the presidents post.Strange alliancesCrucial alliances with the Sena were forged in western Maharashtras sugar-belt district of Sangli where the BJP had defeated the NCP in its bastion to secure 25 of the 60 seats and emerge as the largest party.The BJPs Sangramsinh Deshmukh was elected president while the Senas Suhas Babar was elected vice-president to the Sangli ZP. Likewise, in the 67-seat Kolhapur ZP, the BJP-Sena alliance saw Shaumika Mahadik (BJP) being propped to the presidents post.However, the NCPs Sarjerao Patil succeeded in becoming vice-president with the help of Congress.After much delay, the 72-member Ahmednagar ZP saw a Congress-NCP alliance with senior Congress leader (and Leader of Opposition in the State Legislative Assembly) Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patils wife, Shalini, emerging president with the backing of NCP.The NCPs Rajshree Ghule was elected vice-president.Cong-Sena factorMeanwhile in Marathwada, despite the BJP emerging as the single-largest party in the 62-seat Aurangabad ZP, the Congress and Sena joined hands to queer its pitch. The Sena with 18 seats, successfully elected its candidate Devyani Dongaonkar as president, while the Congress, which secured 16 seats elected Keshavrao Tayde-Patil as vice president.As in Aurangabad, the BJP, which emerged as the single largest party securing 22 of the 56-seat Jalna ZP, was upstaged by the Congress joining hands with NCP (which won 13).Anirudha Khotkar of the Sena (which won 14 seats) was elected president while Satish Tope of the NCP became vice-president.The loss of Jalna is seen as a loss of face for top BJP leaders like the State unit president Raosaheb Danve and Babanrao Lonikar, both of whom have their constituencies in this region.However, the BJP managed to turn the tables on the NCP in the fiercely-disputed Beed ZP.Seven supporters of rebel NCP leader Suresh Dhas backed the BJP today.

The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use.IN ORDER to make the sugarcane crop less water intensive and drought-resistant, Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute has developed a new cane variety Co VSI 8005. Shivajiarao Deshmukh, director general of the institute, said the new variety has been planted over 10,000 hectares and would go for crushing for the first time in the season of 2017-18.Cane crop has faced criticism because of its increased usage of water. Although the crop occupies only 10 per cent of the farmland, around 70 per cent of water resources are used by it. The cane crop of Maharashtra has been criticised as a water guzzler by both environmentalist and agricultural scientists. Even the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Pricing (CACP) has criticised the states cane crop for its over usage of water.Deshmukh, talking about the new variety, said it uses less water than the more prevalent Co 86032 one. The standing crop can withstand without water for as much as 45 days and thus, it is suitable for drought-prone area, he said. The new variety also has higher sugar content and its stubble can be re-used for three seasons. This variety will help in increasing the overall recovery of Maharashtra, he said. Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use. Some of the varieties while having excellent sugar recovery had faced pest infestation which had curtailed its cultivation.In some cases, the presence of thorns had made a water efficient variety. The present crushing season saw Uttar Pradesh stealing the march over Maharashtra in sugar production. Uttar Pradeshs success was mainly due to the introduction of a new variety of cane Co 0238, which has increased the over all sugar recovery of the state.On Tuesday, Deshmukh also announced the winners of the the special prizes for both individual farmers as well as sugar mills which VSI confers annually. This year, the Shree Vighnahar cooperative sugar mill in Junnar taluka of Pune district has been judged as the best overall performer. Also, accolades were in store for the Nanded-based Bhaurao Chavan cooperative mill that won four awards. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will be distributing the awards on the occasion of the annual day of the institute on Monday.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A team of six students from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, proposes a solution: adopt an effective channel irrigation method. The team MI6 has considered the water-guzzling crop of sugarcane as a sample to prove the efficiency of their model.The team, which has also proposed that the state government provide certified water-efficiency ratings to all sugar mills, is one of the 220 finalists in the Transform Maharashtra competition.The competition Transform Maharashtra: Platform for Youth to Create a Roadmap of Developed Maharashtra by 2025 makes sure that policymaking and governance for students is not limited to dialogues and proposals that seldom see the light of the day. Winners of the competition will get to see their proposal implemented as a policy or a state-sponsored programme.The winners will be selected based on the popularity of the idea depending on the number of votes the idea receives. Another set of winners will be chosen by a panel of judges. Students from across the state sent proposals under the 11 themes specified under the competition.MI6s model has made it to the top 20 under the Jai Kisan: Drought-free Maharashtra theme. Our model aims at solutions for drought, one of the biggest challenges for Maharashtra, said Udyut Goyal, a fourth-year civil engineering student from IIT-B. By using the effective channel irrigation method, the farmers can optimise the use of available water and eliminate wastage, said Goyal, adding that the model is designed to improve the efficiency of farmers as well as reduce wastage of water in sugar mills.The IIT-B teams idea seemed popular as it was one of the most voted ideas under the theme. Team Parivartan, from the College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, was leading the chart under the theme Moulding the future: Reforming Rural Education.The model proposed by the team will help the government reduce the dropouts rate in schools and bridge the gap between education and employment. We have proposed that eight adults be selected from each village for a centralised training. They will then teach students in schools, said Sarah Husain, one of the team members.These are free vocational courses for students between classes VIII and X. The courses can be helpful for students to get jobs after they pass out. They will also be an incentive for students to attend classes, said Husain, who added that the vocational courses will be specific to the geographical locations of the schools. A compulsory class in puberty is also a part of the model which can be scaled up to be linked with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.A team from Institute of Chemical Technology has proposed a model to improve the transport facilities in the state. Kalyani Chavali, a member of team Aryabhatt, said that the team studied various transportation models in the state and designed a strategy to make the state transport system more reliable and efficient.The online voting, which began on March 21, closes on March 31.

Swaminathan.Tentatively, demonstrations will be held across the country on August 9.But, a decision on the actual date will be taken at the meeting of Inter-State Farmers Organsiations slated to be held at Sangli (Maharashtra) on Thursday, said Kurbur Shanthkumar, president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association, here on Wednesday.Speaking to presspersons, he reminded Mr. Modi of his several yet to be implemented pre-poll promises, particularly on waiving crop loans.After becoming the Prime Minister, Mr. Modi had assured at least for 33 times of implementing Prof. Swaminathans recommendations to improve the condition of farmers and prevent their suicides, he said.Mr. Shanthkumar attributed the fall in sugarcane cultivation to the failure of both the Centre and State governments in ensuring scientific price.The Centre had announced Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,300 per tonne at 9.50% sugar recovery for the crushing year 2015-16 and did not increase it for 2016-17.The Union government was yet to announce FRP for 2017-18, he said.He said in view of the fall in sugarcane cultivation  which would result in fall in sugar production this year the Centre was considering to import sugar."

After training at the academy, the children participate in district-level competitions, followed by state-level events.Sarita Bhise is from Dhuldev, a small tribal village in Mann Taluka in Satara district. Enrolled in a primary school, she could never attend classes throughout the year. Her parents belonged to a shepherds community and she often had to travel to Latur in search of grasslands for the cattle, forcing her school education to take a backseat.When she did attend school, which was five kilometres from her house, Sarita often ran all the way. It was her sports teacher who noticed she was good in athletics, and selected her to undergo training at the Mann Deshi Champions Sports Academy (MDCSA) that provides free-of-cost sports training to rural children. Today, 13-year-old Sarita plays field hockey at the national level and is part of Krida Prabodhini in Balewadi, Pune.MDCSA, an initiative of the Mann Deshi Foundation in Mhaswad in Satara, was established in 2011 to encourage rural children to take up sports as a career, and train them for state and district-level sports competitions. So far, the academy has trained more than 1,000 athletes, of whom 32 were selected to play at the national level. Interestingly, the participation of girls has been increasing at an encouraging rate, informed Chetna Sinha, founder-president, Mann Deshi Foundation.Reshma Kewate, a student of Class XII, used to take buffaloes to graze to a grassy spot four kilometres from her house. She spent hours running after the buffaloes, making her legs stronger. After undergoing the Academys rigorous training schedule and following its nutritional guidelines, she started participating in 5-km, 10-km and half marathon races. She has won several marathons and also been selected for national-level athletics events.The facilities offered by the Academy include a 400-metre running track, ground for volleyball/field hockey/soccer /handball, sports equipments, coaches, sports shoes and kit, nutrition-rich breakfasts, annual medical check-ups, winter camps with specialised trainers from Mumbai/Pune, and leadership development opportunities.The children at the academy hail from schools across 15 villages of the taluka. They are identified and selected for the academy by school teachers when they are in primary classes. Once they receive training at the academy, they participate in district-level competitions, followed by state-level competitions. The selected candidates get admission to Krida Prabodhini, Balewadi, which trains them for national-level competitions, said Sinha.According to Sinha, children from the Academy perform well in sports because of their social background and upbringing, which makes them strong. The children come from such remote areas even primary school students have to walk for one-two kilometres to reach their school. They get physically tough and this makes them potential athletes. They are used to working hard as they are either from the shepherd community or their parents work in sugarcane plantations, said Sinha.In 2012, of the 210 students selected for Krida Prabodhini from Maharashtra, 165 were from Satara district and in 2013, of the 43 students selected for Krida Prabodhini from Maharashtra, 42 were from Satara district.Promising sportspersonSarita Bhise: Played in national-level hockey tournaments.

Apart from the notorious traffic snarls that daily commuters, motorists and pedestrians suffer, an upsurge in pollution levels has made life miserable for urban dwellers.If a shining India set the stage for a new-found prosperity enshrined in the personal swanky wheels acquired by a well-to-do populace, the outcome of this reality is more about pollution and congestion. On the other hand, citizens are caught in the domino effect of rising global crude oil prices and government policies that unfortunately tend to pinch a few always.An aware Centre, in a bid to ease pressure off citizens and with a common good in mind, is looking at various solutions to help the country grow sustainably.Fuelling without fuelThere has always been a need to scout for alternative sources of fuel and energy to power vehicles. India has accounted for a huge imports bill of Rs 6 lakh crore on crude per annum, and exploring and generating indigenous alternatives would cut crude imports by at least Rs 1 lakh crore.On that note, recently, the government recently announced that it would soon come out with policies on second-generation ethanol and methanol.Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has also stated that besides creating an industry worth Rs 1 lakh crore, the move could provide employment to around 25 lakh youth.According to data from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in 2014, the transport sector was the major consumer of diesel, accounting for 70% of the total sales that year.Answering the clarion call of the market, premium bus-makers, armed with global expertise and tomorrows technical know-how, are motoring down environment lane.When it comes to ethanol-based transport solutions, Swedens commercial vehicles giant Scania says it is ready with a whole turnkey offering on its shelf.Scania has 20 years of experience with ethanol technology. We have been making and selling bio fuel buses in Europe, as well as in Brazil, Scania India President Stefan Palskog informs Deccan Herald.It is interesting to note that Brazil, with its huge sugarcane industry, has taken a great leap in the area of blending ethanol into petrol for personal cars, and where Scanias buses run on pure 95% ethanol.But in India, home to many ethanol producers, most of the supply happens to the liquor industry.In order to run a bus engine, ethanol in the denatured form is needed. There are over 600 ethanol producers in India, but very few have the capability to produce and sell denatured ethanol directly to us, Palskog says.An enthusiastic Scania, however, has already unveiled its product in India, with five buses having already been provided to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation on December 3, last year, with 50 additional buses to be delivered by the end of this year.Ethanol, a naturally derived bio fuel, is akin to diesel in performance and reliability, except that it is far more suitable for the environment, with almost zilch CO2 emissions. While the technology is not new, its evolution into a favourable, efficient fuel has been nothing short of cutting-edge. Yet, its adoption in a country like India has been rather subdued; blame it on cost, policy, or plain old perception.Alternate fuel vehicles are very much required to tackle rising pollution levels, and the government is looking at electric, or other solutions. It is initiating good processes for the road ahead, says Price Waterhouse Partner Abdul Majeed, adding that a lot of challenges still persist.He opines, Ethanol is a good concept. As an agricultural country, it all makes sense for India, but regulation is a big problem in the country right now. No major supportive regulations exist for making it commercially viable, which must be sorted out.Says Palskog, The primary perception in India is about cost, rather than value. While people do learn that an ethanol bus is relatively costlier than a regular diesel bus, they are not calculating the value it generates overtime.In India, one must identify the stakeholding chain and it must be in a way that everyone is a winner. Otherwise, if you have one link in that chain winning more that the rest, the chain will break Its all about shifting the tax from one aspect to another. The customer who wants to buy a green bus must be incentivised. The public who will step onto the green bus must be incentivised. The producer must be stimulated to make fuel, and also environmentally-friendly transport. But the present logic is the other way around, he adds.Today, when customers, especially state transport undertakings, buy buses, it is largely on price and not value, and the lowest price wins. While the respective governments contract must include factors such as environment, quality, safety, and then hardware, today, it looks like just hardware.Scania developed its ethanol engine in the mid-1990s. In India, the fuel is being pushed for city buses, for which, the company has identified 12 suppliers of the fuel.In terms of infrastructure, we will set up a tank facility where the bus is serviced. Once the bus returns after its rounds, we will clean, wash, and refuel it. We are providing our customers with fuel for now, as there is no infrastructure available, Palskog says, adding that the company has plans for biogas too.Driving changeRecently, the government extended demand incentives worth Rs 127.77 crore for the purchase of over 1.11 lakh electric and hybrid vehicles under the FAME-India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (hybrid &) Electric vehicles in India) scheme, which also includes buses.Electric mobility is in, and Volvo, another mega Swedish bus pioneer, with decades of pedigree in the said realm, eyes bringing this technology to India.Everything will leapfrog to Euro VI (similar to BS VI) by 2020. Buses will be a part of the strategic direction for Volvo Group, and we look at electric mobility as the next horizon for the bus industry in India, Volvo India Managing Director Kamal Bali says.Volvo Buses began its electric journey with hybrid, and plug-in hybrid is expected to be the next wave, followed by full-electric buses. These buses have already been launched in Sweden and few other countries.Hybrid is part electric, part fuel, which cuts out diesel consumption by over 35%, which means that one uses 50% less carbon footprint, explains Bali, adding that with plug-in hybrid or opportunity charging, one can take 70% power on electricity and remaining on fuel, and the third step being to electrify, with bus stations and depots sporting charging infrastructure.All over the world, Volvo operates all three solutions, between which, it has sold over 7,000 buses. In India, there are two hybrid bus units (city buses in Mumbai) on the road right now, while three more are expected.About electric mobility, Majeed says, Theres no point having coal-fired power generation and then running buses, because those (thermal) plants are more dangerous for the environment, adding that sustainable power generation must be encouraged.Volvo Buses is also part of the narrative with Niti Aayog, looking at alternative fuels, especially for long-haul applications. It is also looking at other alternative fuel solutions such as dimethyl ether (DME).With the sector taking its first step, all eyes are on the government hastening its development agenda, with smart cities also on the anvil.Wishing that misconceptions of cost, reliability and safety be allayed, Majeed says, If you reduce the dependency of crude oil import, the economy will pick up, not only in terms of environment, but also financial health."

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) A 22-year-old resident of east Delhi knows first-hand what it is like to fall into the trap at a young age. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)Cut, samaan or maal  these are words that a 38-year-old real estate broker wants to forget. What started as an experiment with a pinch of heroin 14 years ago has now hijacked his life. Lodged at a south Delhi de-addiction centre for the sixth time in seven years, the father of two is trying to get rid of a habit that has cost him family ties and his business. I started abusing drugs when I was in Class X. The guard in my school gave it to me, saying it was bhole ki booti. I dont remember if it was heroin, charas or ganja, he says.Clad in a T-shirt and jeans, he sits in a room at the de-addiction centre for a counselling session. I am very familiar with this place; the doctors and staff know me. But this is the last time I want to come here, he says.Over the past three years, police sources say, the demand for drugs, especially cocaine and heroin, has been increasing in the city. While the former is out of reach for many due to its high cost, heroin  especially its adulterated version known as smack  is much more accessible.The cost of 1 kg heroin in the international market is about Rs 4 crore. In Delhi, as all over the world, the drug is adulterated  or cut  using sugar, coffee and several compounds. One gram is sold in Delhi for about Rs 200-Rs 300 in various hotspots, which include JJ clusters and parks. Cocaine, on the other hand, is 15 to 20 times more expensive. Brown sugar or smack is very common in Delhi, mostly among youngsters. It is often mixed with various pharmaceutical drugs that are illegally sold over the counter. Addicts inhale, snort or inject the drug.In February this year, the Delhi Police busted a gang in Shahdaras Seemapuri area and recovered 273.45 grams of smack worth Rs 7.5 lakh in the international market. The gang would sell 2,000 packets (each containing 1 gram heroin) of the contraband in a single day. The peddlers got their supply of heroin from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. Police had claimed that the accused were selling heroin packets to almost 4,000-5,000 boys in the area. In the case, police had identified 18 boys who were addicted to heroin. Three of them were minors.A 22-year-old resident of east Delhi knows first-hand what it is like to fall into the trap at a young age. He says he has to inject 10 ml of a mixture of heroin and anti-allergens into his veins every day, else he experiences severe withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, aches and pains in the bones, insomnia, diarrhea, and vomiting.I started smoking cigarettes when I was in Class IX. I quickly moved on to beer, whisky, ganja, charas and eventually cut smack. I can buy a days fix in a small pouch for Rs 200. I mix it with Avil (anti-allergic medicine). Ten ml of the mixture is sufficient for me, he says.He, too, has been in and out of de-addiction centres. This is my fourth time at the centre. After each three-month course, I end up in the same environment  the same friends and the same temptations. I want to get rid of this habit, he says.A transit pointOver the years, owing to accessibility and relative anonymity, Delhi has become a transit point for international drug peddlers. Police sources say that presently there are three big hubs of heroin  southwest Asia, southeast Asia and India.Heroin is an opioid  a drug derived from opium. Cultivation of poppy for opium is allowed in some parts of India, Turkey and Australia. While countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan have banned the cultivation, the plant is still grown extensively in some areas, police say. Opium is used to make morphine  a purified form of which is used to make a strong painkiller. Morphine is also used to make heroin.In India, police say, heroin comes from Rajasthans Kota, Jhalawar, Bara, Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh and Udaipur, Madhya Pradeshs Bhawani, Mandi, Mandsaur, Indore and Neemuch and Uttar Pradeshs Bareilly, Barabanki and Badaun and some parts of Jharkhand. Police sources say heroin is also smuggled in from Afghanistan and Pakistan via Amritsar. Cocaine  extracted from the leaves of Coca plants  comes to Delhi from west African countries via Mumbai and Goa, police say. Police have also noticed the increasing trend of involvement of foreign nationals and women in the drug trade. According to officials at the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), women belonging to middle class families take to trafficking as their relatives are involved in the trade.Director of the Delhi Zonal Unit (NCB), Madho Singh, told The Indian Express that they have identified two routes via which heroin is supplied to Delhi and other parts of India  border route and air route.Due to tension at the border, smuggling via this route has decreased of late. But a new trend is being noticed  drugs are being smuggled by air passengers. The carrier swallows capsules filled with the drugs. Once they land in the country, the drugs are extracted. However, our intelligence network helps us nab such carriers, says Singh, adding that the unit is working towards procuring a full body scanner at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.Sources say the government has asked security agencies to create a database of persons who have been arrested in connection with drug trade. The government has also directed that information about such peddlers or rackets be shared between the agencies.Deputy Commissioner of Police (narcotics and crime) Rajesh Deo told The Indian Express, We are in the process of developing more human intelligence to delve deeper into the peddling racket. We are developing various mechanisms for this purpose. Low income areas are majorly affected by drug peddling and we will soon launch awareness programmes there.Rise of party drugsBesides heroin, police say the most commonly abused drugs in Delhi are ganja (marijuana), charas (cannabis), cocaine, opium, buprenorphine, nitrazepam, phenegran, diazepam, mandrax, amphetamine, morphine, pentazocin, pseudoephedrine and codine. Use of smack and ganja gained impetus as it is cheaper than other drugs. Most of the addicts are street children, people living in shelters and adolescents from the lower classes, says a police officer, who works in the narcotics department of Delhi Police.In the recent past, another trend has emerged  an increase in the use of party drugs such as LSD (acid/blotter), MDMA (ecstasy/eve/lovers speed, peace), GHB (liquid ecstasy/scoop) and mephedrone (meow meow) in the capital.Police sources say these drugs are being used in tandem with alcohol  drugs and alcohol are taken alternatively to give a high which lasts for several hours. The alternative dosage of alcohol and the drug has a spiraling effect, which is further fuelled by high-pitch trance music at rave parties. Though such parties are not common in Delhi, the increase in the type and quantity of party drugs in Delhi is dangerous, says an officer.Another officer says the dog squad unit will soon see the addition of two new sniffer dogs, who will be trained exclusively for the purpose of detecting drugs. The squad has dogs which are trained to detect drugs as well as explosives, but we need to train dogs to sniff out drugs exclusively, he says.Going cleanAccording to doctors, heroin is highly addictive  using the drug a few times is all it takes for people to get addicted. Quitting is tough because of the painful withdrawal symptoms.The real estate dealer testifies to this. I am married and have two young children. Most people dont understand the struggle. I dont want to live in this drug-induced haze. Even my children have repeatedly asked me to quit this habit. It is heartbreaking. I want to lead a good life. I keep joining de-addiction centres but I cannot remain sober for long. The urge to use is too strong, he says.He says that he had reported to police and other agencies about the illegal sale of heroin in his area to no avail. At least 40 per cent of youngsters in my area are addicts. Many times, I have alerted police about the trade but nothing has been done. Also, tablets and medicines (used to cut the drug) are being easily sold over the counter in medical stores, he says.According to a doctor at the centre, the company an addict keeps and the environment he lives in during and after treatment are important. Once a patient completes the treatment, he should avoid coming in contact with the same circle of friends or people with whom he used to take drugs says the doctor. He adds, While some get over the addiction soon after the first treatment, others require multiple treatments.Talking about how the misuse of pharmaceutical products is on the rise in the capital, another doctor says people mix a small quantity of heroin with readily-available medicines from pharmacies.Police, however, say misuse of pharmaceutical products comes under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, and only the government has the power to take action. We can only inform the administration, which we always do when such an activity comes to our notice. We can only seize, arrest and investigate the banned drugs under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act, a police officer says. Under the law, a person booked under the Act may face imprisonment up to 10 years or more. The quantum of punishment is also based on the quantity of banned drugs recovered from his or her possession.From Afghanistan to the capitalMarch 2017Special Cell arrests two, recover heroin worth Rs 8 crore. According to Special Cell sources, the accused were part of an international drug ring with origins in Afghanistan and a trafficking network spanning Pakistan and several parts of India.January 2017Acting on information, NCB intercepts an Afghan national travelling from Herat to New Delhi via Kabul. About 90 capsules of heroin extracted from his stomach.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 27, 2017 1:12 am"

Tiwari who had been raising the issues of farmers' suicide from Yavatmal since two years heads the Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM) working on farmers' welfare. Lately, SBI chief Arundhati Bhattacharya had expressed her views discouraging waiver.Tiwari said out of Rs30,500 crore of the defaulted loans to be waived, nearly Rs22000 crore are from the flourishing pockets. These are in regions like Western Maharashtra , such as the grape belt of Nashik and the sugar cane growing areas, where there is assured irrigation. There are some pockets in east Vidarbha too, he said.Barely one-fourth of the amount will go to the farmers in the distressed districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada , where there is a real crisis. This is because the scale of finance for the crops like cotton and soybean grown in these areas is meagre to take the loan size bigger, he said ""Rather steps should be taken to increase the bank credit coverage and increase the income of farmers in such regions,"" said Tiwari.However, Tiwari agreed that the number of farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada is half of the 4 million in the state who may have benefited if the waiver was approved.The farmers who account for majority of the amount of loan to be waived are engaged in growing, cash crops like grapes, sugar cane, floriculture apart from having, allied activities like dairy farming, he said.The number of defaults has gone up even in the flourishing areas too since the mega farm waiver of Rs70,000 crore during the UPA Government. This means it cannot be ruled out that income from farming needs to be increased, said Tiwari.In areas like Vidarbha where it is largely dryland farming, hardly 30% of the farmers are covered under bank finance. This means the scope of lending needs to be widened. Unless the number of farmers in such areas are covered under bank finance, waivers would end up in only a gimmick.Tiwari said this year there are plans to coordinate with banks to start farm lending from April and finish it by mid May. At the same time, a plan needs to be drafted that farmers in the dryland areas should get credit for at lest five years in a row despite any eventualities. Unless the farmers' income is not increased the repaying capacity cannot be built, he saidThe state government had declined the proposal to waive farm loans on the grounds that the funds can be utilized for other sectors of the society."

As far as his recent presence in the LS is concerned, Gaikwad has a mere 21% attendance during the ongoing budget session of Parliament and 57% attendance during the winter session in 2016. The only scoring point for the leader was his cent per cent attendance during last year's monsoon session of Parliament, a record maintained by PRS Legislative Research.Gaikwad has also been lagging behind in asking questions in Parliament, averaging 173 queries as against the state's average of 371 and national average of 180.The leader, however, has raised queries on a wide range of issues dealing with the lives of both the urban and rural population. Different ministries along with the Prime Minister's Office were made answerable by Gaikwad in what could be termed as quality questions.Some of the key topics on which Gaikwad had posed queries include pending proposals under rural schemes, minimum wages, assistance for irrigation projects in the state, sugarcane dues, closure of textile mills, development of the South Central Railways , promotion of the MSME sector and hoarding of pulses, child/bonded labour, spurious medicines and Naxal activities.Gaikwad, who was a college teacher, also raised pressing questions related to the education sector, including the mid-day meal scheme in private schools, irregularities in medical institutions, vocationalisation of secondary education and private school fees.When it comes to debates in Parliament, Gaikwad's participation is again on the lower side. He participated in an average 25 debates as against the state and national averages of 45.5 and 46.3.Some of the debates in which Gaikwad has participated include the demand for more currency to cooperative banks, terrorist activities in Marathwada, restoration of Veer Savarkar's name plate and quotation in Andaman Jail and reducing the minimum export price for onions.Gaikwad is yet to open his account in terms of tabling a private member's bill. On an average, an MP from Maharashtra tables 2.6 such bills.While Gaikwad could not be reached for his comments, Osmanabad district Sena president Anil Khochre said the MP has a greater connect with the masses in his constituency. ""This speaks for a lot more than compiled statistics. The voters are satisfied with their public representative as he has raised a range of issues affecting their lives. It is strange that nobody pointed a finger at him before the recent Air India episode,"" he said."

Lack of water, drought and other climatic issues have reduced the overall yield of sugarcane, which led to the drop in sugar production.""He said efforts are needed to increase yield per acre. New varieties of sugarcanes that consume less water and produce more sugar should be developed, he suggested.Pawar said, the state had produced around 100 lakh tonne sugar on an average in the last couple of years. This has gone down to nearly 45 lakh tonne this year. ""The state currently has 70 big loss-making mills, which incurred a total loss of nearly Rs 2,400 crore this year. Last year there were 40 loss-making units, accounting for Rs 1,200 crore loss,"" he said. He pointed out that poor demand for by-products has added to the worries.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, the state government will sign contracts with sugar mills in the state to purchase power generated by them and offer them higher rates. The sugar mills should come out with innovative technologies to generate more electricity with less financial burden, he said.Fadnavis said sugar mills need to be better managed and more transparent in management. A meeting will be held to finalise rates for the power generated in around a week's time.""Factors like capital investment, returns and use of new technology will be considered while deciding the rates. Since the electricity generated is green it will be purchased by paying more,"" he said."

The bills of sugar cane are deposited in farmers' accounts in our bank, we deduct the loan instalments from this.

Dr. Hemant Gupta, consultant at Bombay Hospital, says one should have enough sugar, salt and water in the body. Sip juices and eat sweets intermittently. Even diabetic patients should be liberal in eating sweets during summer. If possible, avoid stepping out between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m., and do not over-exercise.Dr. Gupta says in a busy city like Mumbai one can become easily irritable and theres a risk of fainting and getting convulsions.

No one has the time. They just come, order, get their snacks packed and leave to reach office on time. It is a different experience.The outlet opened about two months ago. Sujata Chittiapa, another managing partner says, We studied the station for two months. We observed the crowd that came in. After the connectivity to Mysuru Road, the crowd has increased and it turned out to be better for us.The eatery is open from 9 am to 10.30 pm, until the last train arrives.Goutom claims that the footfall per day is about 1,800 to 2,000. On week days, there are office goers. On weekends, it is usually less as most of them would be families and those who are on joy rides.

Once, the items get over. We inform the cooks and within half an hour, a new batch arrives. They are also priced reasonably. The bakery items are outsourced from our friend who owns a bakery.Sujata adds, I am also a dietician. I have always been connected to the food industry. We do not pre-mix sugar in our tea or coffee as there might be some customers who are diabetics too. We provide them sugar separately. Some complain about it while some prefer it.Particular about the hygiene, Goutom challenges, You can walk in to our kitchen anytime without any prior notice and see the hygiene we maintain.If you are a cheese fan, you should definitely try their tomato and cheese sandwich."

(Pradip Das) Many had queued up outside the RBI office from 7 am on Friday, only to be turned away. (Pradip Das)What was supposed to be the last day for Indian citizens who were abroad during November-December 2016 to deposit their denotified currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500, instead saw a large turnout of people from within the country who missed the December 30 deadline for exchange of demonetised notes due to various reasons.One of them was Mohammed Nabeel Ansari, a construction labourer in Goa, who met with an accident a week after the government announced demonetisation. Ansari underwent a leg surgery and was immobile for almost two months. In January, when Ansari went home to Sitamarhi in Bihar, his wife handed him old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 worth Rs 17,000.I took it to Goa immediately, but the bank asked me to go to RBI in Mumbai. I came here and since then. I have been coming everyday to this place in the hope that they will exchange my old notes. But they havent. I have all my medical records and reports to prove my claim, said Ansari.In another case, Sindhubai Jhadav, a widow from Dhule who came to exchange Rs 35,000 in scrapped notes, was turned down by the RBI Friday. Jhadav, a farmer, said she found Rs 35,000 in old notes in the belongings of her mother-in-law who passed away earlier this month.What do I do, she (mother-in-law) never told us about it. I found the money while emptying her room. Now I have taken a loan of Rs 5,000 to come to Mumbai, but the RBI is not accepting my money, said Jhadav.Apart from Jhadav, a bottled water delivery man, Kanhabhai, travelled 800 km in a bus from a village close to Gondal in Gujarat to reach the RBI office at 7 am, along with his uncle to deposit about Rs 65,000 held by his 80-year-old ailing mother.They (RBI) say only people who were outside the country can deposit money. I dont know what to do. After demonetisation, I kept on asking my mother if she had old notes, and she said no. Last week, I found this money in her trunk. I am ruined, said Kanhabhai.On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai was visited by hundreds of ineligible citizens, hoping to exchange their old notes. (Pradip Das) On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai was visited by hundreds of ineligible citizens, hoping to exchange their old notes. (Pradip Das)On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while announcing the demonetisation move, had said citizens unable to deposit their old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 by December 30, 2016 could do so at specified RBI offices up to March 31, 2017.After the deadline to exchange the scrapped notes expired on December 30, 2016, the government issued an ordinance saying only those who were abroad, Armed Forces personnel posted in remote areas, or others who could give valid reasons for not being able to deposit the cancelled notes could do so till March 31.On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai was visited by hundreds of ineligible citizens such as Ansari and Jhadav, in the hope that the government would give them another chance to submit their scrapped notes.While most of the people who were abroad during November-December 2016 quietly queued outside the central bank waiting for their turn, around 11 oclock in the morning, the crowd of ineligible people that had gathered outside the RBI as early as 7 am became so unmanageable that police were called in to control the crowd.The anger and frustration of the people was palpable as they started shouting slogans against the government and the RBI.We are the ones who vote, not the NRIs (Non-Resident Indians). Then why are they getting special treatment? Narendra Modi says he is a chai wala, but doesnt understand what poor people are going through. Mann ki baat karo ya dil ki baat karo, PM bas ek baar aake iss line main khade raho ek ghante. (Whether or not he holds heart-to-heart talks with us, the PM should just come stand in this queue for an hour), said Laxman Khare, a sugarcane farmer from Bidar in Karnataka, who was turned down by the RBI.According to a finance ministry statement, the note exchange facility would now be available only for citizens of India who are not residents of India, till June 30, 2017. This exchange facility will be subject to Foreign Exchange Management (Export and Import of Currency) Regulations, 2015. These rules restrict bringing back Indian currency into the country to Rs 25,000 per person.khushboo.narayan@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Names of senior political leaders of all parties, including Ajit Pawar, Manikrao Thakre, Pandurang Fundkar and Vijay Wadettiwar, have appeared in the case as they were directors of the bank when financial irregularities took place.State Co-operative Minister Subhash Deshmukh, who made the announcement in the Assembly, said, The report regarding the ongoing investigation is ready and it is over 3,500 pages, but the probe is taking time as 2,000 cases need to be investigated. The issue was discussed during question hour.Ruling party MLAs had raised questions about the investigation into the high profile scam, which is yet to be completed after two years. MLAs were not satisfied by the Ministers reply and demanded that the probe be speeded up.Mr. Deshmukh assured the House that the investigation would be completed within a year, and action would be taken against those responsible. The government will appoint a retired judge of the High Court to investigate the matter independently. We will ask him to complete investigation within six months, he said.Senior BJP member Anil Gote objected to the Ministers reply. The House was assured in December 2015 by Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil that the investigation would be completed by May 22, 2016. But even in 2017, the government is seeking one more year to complete the probe. It creates a picture that the government is supporting the corrupt boards. Mr. Deshmukh, however, rejected the charge, saying no one would be spared if found guilty.Financial irregularities in the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank had rocked State politics in 2011, when the then Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan had ordered that the banks directorial board be scrapped. The Nationalist Congress Party, which was then an ally in Mr. Chavans Congress in the government, had control over bank for decades.The banks condition deteriorated after 1998-99, with loans begin given to sugar mills, weaving mills and others with political intentions. The increase in the number of directors and their expenses had also became a serious issue. Roles NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, BJP leader Pandurang Fundkar, Congress leaders Manikrao Thakre and Vijay Vadettivar, and many others are being investigated."
5922bce57be9e01fd59ab99c,March heat may dampen govt’s hopes of record wheat crop,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/march-heat-may-dampen-govts-hopes-of-record-wheat-crop-4597025/,2017-04-02,"Temperatures in this area touched 38 degrees on March 28 and crossed 40 degrees  nearly six degrees above normal  by the month-end. Temperatures in this area touched 38 degrees on March 28 and crossed 40 degrees  nearly six degrees above normal  by the month-end.THE SUDDEN spike in temperatures since early last week is stoking concerns over the standing wheat crop, even as the Centre has projected a record production of 96.64 million tonnes (mt) and recently levied a 10 per cent import duty on the grain.It was looking good till around March 20. Even on March 25, when the maximum temperature rose to 36 degrees Celsius, I was confident my crop will be similar, if not better, than the one in 2013. The baali (wheat ear heads) had formed beautifully and there were enough ghundi (grain-bearing spikelets) in each of them. But the last week has changed the picture, says Pritam Singh Hanjra, who has planted wheat on 82 of his 90-acre holding at Urlana Khurd village in Madlauda tehsil of Haryanas Panipat.Temperatures in this area touched 38 degrees on March 28 and crossed 40 degrees  nearly six degrees above normal  by the month-end. This is the time when the grain is getting filled. The present heat wave could affect the size and weight, even if not the number, of grains harvested from each baali, says Hanjra.Wheat is mostly a 140 to 150-day crop. The crop thats sown before around November 20 is harvested by April 15. Flowering starts in about 90 days, when the ear heads have fully emerged along with anthers containing pollen. The complete flowering and pollination process  wheat flowers are self-fertilised by the movement of pollen from the male (stamen) to the female (stigma) part of the same flower  happens within five days near February 20.The subsequent 45 days or more is when the resultant grain develops, from the early milk and dough to the final hardening and ripening stages of the kernel. The real grain-filling, or accumulation of semi-solid starch matter in kernels, takes place roughly from mid-March. During this phase, day temperatures should ideally not exceed 35 degrees. When they cross that level, the grain tends to ripen.The question being asked is whether, and to what extent, would the abrupt rise in the mercury this time cause premature ripening. This is important, given the general thumb rule that every extra day on the field during the grain-filling stage gives an extra wheat yield of 45-50 kg per hectare.For the last one week, temperatures are what they should have been closer to April 10. Normally, we dont give any irrigation after March 15, but are now doing so every other day to keep the temperature around the crop down, says Raghbir Singh, a nine-acre farmer from Randhawa Masanda village of Jalandhar in Punjab.I am worried, as my wheat was sown in early December after the harvesting of sugarcane. The crop is still green and grain-filling had started just around the time of this heat wave. Irrigation can help provide moisture and prevent sudden drying, but cannot replace the natural process of the grain ripening with the gradual setting in of summer, says Rattan Singh, who farms 10 acres at Sherpur village in Hoshiarpurs Mukerian tehsil.Sahaj pake, so meetha hoye (When something is cooked slowly, it tastes sweeter). Even if the crop matures a week early, it will translate into a yield loss of 1.5 quintals per acre. Last year, I harvested an average yield of 24 quintals per acre. This time, till March 25, I was hopeful of 26 quintals because the tillering, baali formation and even early grain development were so good. But now, yields could be 22.5 quintals or even less, says Hanjra in Panipat.However, Rajbir Yadav, principal scientist and wheat breeder at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at New Delhi, believes that production losses due to the early onset of summer may not be much. There could be some impact for the crop sown late. But farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka would already have harvested their wheat by the time temperatures had soared. Even in Punjab and Haryana, the crop planted before November 20 would have reached near-physiological maturity before March-end. There is no further grain-filling after that, only a reduction in its moisture content from about 17 per cent to 10-11 per cent, he says.On February 15, the Agriculture Ministry had estimated Indias wheat production for 2016-17 at 96.64 mt, surpassing the previous all-time high of 95.85 mt in 2013-14. The expectation of a bumper harvest also led to the wheat import duty being raised to 10 per cent, from zero, on March 28.Whether the latest unforeseen sunstroke will prompt a review  more so, with public wheat stocks of 9.43 mt as on March 1 at a nine-year-low  remains to be seen.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A total of 371.4 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane was crushed in 147 mills across the state producing 417 lakh quintal of sugar. These figures are even lower than in 2008, when another severe drought had hit Maharashtra Officials say the price of sugar is expected to rise owing to the shortfall in production. Maharashtra is one of the largest producers of sugar in the country.""This has been an exceptionally difficult year with the losses mounting. This is bound to have a cascading effect next year,"" said a senior official from the state sugar mills association. Sugar retail prices are hovering around Rs 38-40 as against the normal prices of Rs 32-34.The worse-hit at the moment are the sugarcane farmers, who have lost income to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore due to low production. The area under sugarcane cultivation shrank to 6.3 lakh hectares in 2015-16 due to the drought from 10.3 lakh hectares the year before. Thus the total sugarcane production in 2016 was 4.5 lakh metric tonnes against a total harvest of 7.3 lakh metric ton in 2015.The dip in sugarcane production is due to the drought in 2015 . Sugarcane is an 18-month crop and the cane sown in 2015 was harvested in the end of 2016.With one tonne sugarcane said to be fetching a minimum of Rs 2,000 for the farmers, even by conservative estimates they have made losses worth Rs 6,000 crore, say industry experts.They add that the total agriculture loss due to the severe drought in 2015 cannot be accounted for, but losses will continue to impact the farmers indirectly. Last year, a total of 178 sugar factories were operational; this year 31 didn't even start operations due to lack of raw material. And 120 of the 147 that were working shut in January.Most of the mills are situated in the sugarcane belt of western Maharashtra and Marathwada. The industry has accrued cumulative losses of Rs 2,500 crore over the past few years and has asked the central government to restructure term loans worth Rs 6,500 crore for 10 years, including a moratorium of three years and seven years for repayment."

The jaggery has been brought to the market on Saturday. With the temperature levels soaring, we fear that the jaggery might melt, he said.The district is already facing drought and the quantity of sugarcane grown is very less, compared to the previous years. Hence, not much jaggery is arriving in the market. Only around 1,000 quintals of jaggery are available for sale, including mould, box and bucket varieties. Moreover, jaggery that was sold at Rs 3,500 per quintal is now being sold at Rs 4,300, he said.Speaking to DH, Mandya APMC Secretary Pushpa said, the truckers stir has affected the business as there are not much takers for jaggery. However, there is not much load in stock at the APMC, she added.Tender coconutThe truckers stir has also affected the sale of tender coconuts at the APMC market in Maddur, in the district. The number of traders purchasing tender coconuts has come down. Only those transporting tender coconuts to Bengaluru are buying them, while the loads being sent to Mumbai, Hyderabad and North Karnataka on trucks are stuck due to the stir.There is great demand for tender coconuts during summer with the wholesale price at Rs 10 to Rs 16 a piece. Each tender coconut is sold above Rs 20 in the retail market."

However, department officials argue that procurement had been done in a completely transparent manner.Quoting information obtained under the RTI Act, 2005, from the department and public documents and agriculture-based websites quoting prices for various commodities in open markets and Agriculture Market Produce Committees, Mr. Gadad said at a press conference here recently that a total 2,10,468 quintals of highly substandard green gram was purchased from National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) for a sum of about Rs. 12.653 crore in February and March this year. He alleged the department paid an average price of Rs. 6,012 per quintal, which was much higher than the average prices that range from Rs. 3,800 to Rs. 4,500 per quintal in open markets.Considering a minimum difference of Rs. 1,000 per quintal between vis--vis average procurement and market prices, the department has paid Rs. 21.04 crore over and above the market prices for green gram, Mr. Gadad alleged.Price of sugarSimilarly, it purchased 88,320 quintals of S-30 grade sugar at Rs. 400 per quintal kg and another stock of 16,900 quintals at Rs. 4,300 per quintal, even though the price of better quality of sugar was only Rs. 38 in markets. The price difference of Rs. 500 per quintal indicates that about Rs. 2.37 crore more was paid for the procurement of sugar.NCDEX e-tendersHowever, N.C. Gangadhar, Senior Deputy Director in the department at Bengaluru, categorically rejected the allegation stating that all procurements were made in a transparent manner through e-tenders from NCDEX, a professionally managed online multi-commodity exchange in Mumbai.Mr. Gangadhar told The Hindu that tenders for green gram and sugar were issued during November-December 2016 and commodities were purchased through e-tenders at e-prices from NCDEX as per the prices that prevailed on the day of purchase on condition of door-delivery. The procurement prices included the cost of door-delivery where sugar was supplied in a 50 kg bag and green gram in 1 kg plastic bags.He said the department was procuring commodities for PDS through the central e-marketing forum NCDEX with due permission from the government."
593ba8827be9e0066b6f5f87,CM takes highway to dry-country push,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170404/jsp/bihar/story_144326.jsp,2017-04-04,"A closed liquor shop in Amritsar on Sunday. (PTI) Patna, April 3: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today picked up the Supreme Court's highway liquor-shop ban to push for what has almost become his pet project, nationwide prohibition. People in many states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are strongly opposing the shifting of liquor shops away from highways into residential areas in accordance with the apex court order delivered in December last year banning liquor shops within 500 metres of national and state highways in an effort to curb drink-driving and road accidents that claim thousands of lives every year. ""Shifting liquor shops 500 metres away from national and state highways due to the Supreme Court directive is no solution to the problem,"" Nitish said when he was asked his opinion on the on the issue on the sidelines of his special Lok Samvad (public dialogue) programme held in the state capital today. ""Complete ban on liquor is the only way out,"" he added. ""Prohibition is the answer as it is attached to public aspiration across the country."" He demanded that the BJP-led government at the Centre should take a lead on this front. ""It's the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha and I would request the central government to show its commitment (to the ideals of the Mahatma) by banning liquor in the country. It could be started with BJP-ruled states,"" Nitish said. He pointed out that neither does any religion support drinking, nor does the Constitution say that the right to drink alcohol a fundamental right, and asked why the Centre was not implementing nationwide prohibition. The chief minister said he has visited several states and noticed that the public sentiment was in favour of prohibition. Bihar, he said, had shown the way and ""people (in other states) were welcoming the step taken by Bihar"". Since clamping total prohibition in Bihar on April 5 last year, Nitish has addressed pro-liquor-ban events in states like Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. ""I have been requesting chief ministers of other states to ban liquor,"" the chief minister said. ""I will do so to Uttar Pradesh CM (Yogi Adityanath). I had suggested this to (former Uttar Pradesh chief minister) Akhilesh Yadav and had requested Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee while attending her oath-taking ceremony."" A few states were avoiding liquor ban on excuses that it will hurt their sugar industry because molasses are used to make alcohol, Nitish said, and declared that no sugar mill had suffered in Bihar as they switched over to produce ethanol, which he called good for the country's economy and environment. The central government has directed that 10 per cent ethanol be mixed in petrol. Nitish also pooh-poohed suggestions that prohibition leads to drop in a state's revenue and declared that Bihar's loss of Rs 5,000 crore excise and value added tax (VAT) in 2015-16 due to the ban on liquor has been almost compensated in 2016-17. ""In the beginning revenue falls,"" he said. but money saved from not spending on liquor leads to growth on expenditure of other items like garments, electrical appliances, milk products, furniture. It expands the economy and leads to revenue growth."""

I loved the avial I ate at the function, he says.Thereafter, he started studying Mappila food, Syrian Christian recipes and the menu of the Nampoothiri Brahmins. The fascinating part about Kerala cuisine is the way it changes across regions, he says.And he lists his favourites. The biriyani that the Mappilas make is awesome, says Ranveer. It is not refined and sophisticated. Instead, it is rustic but tasty. Similarly, the practice of sadhya was started by the Nampoothiris as a way to feed the Brahmins. I also enjoy the Syrian Christian fish curry but this is something I would like to have the next day, because it tastes good only after a day of fermentation.Asked to compare Kerala cuisine with other parts of India, Ranveer says, It cannot be compared, because for 2000 years there have been so many influences: the Romans, Arabs, Dutch, Portuguese, and British. It is a unique cuisine.And thanks to his Global Menu television show, on the Foodz channel, Ranveer is always coming across unique cuisines. The show goes off the beaten track and has focused on places like North and South Korea, Sri Lanka, Romania and Mongolia, he says.The Mongolians have a dish called Khorkhog. Chicken or lamb is cooked with vegetables and stones in a closed container. When you eat it, you can detect a slight earthiness from the stones, which makes it very tasty, says Ranveer.Apart from his TV show, Ranveer runs restaurants in the USA, Canada and India. Last year, he brought out a cookbook called Come into my kitchen. His Mumbai-based premium patisserie, English Vinglish serves fusion desserts, breads and bakes.Ranveer has done a mini-video series on Twitter titled Ranveer On The Road, which featured his culinary sojourn through Australia, apart from being a judge on Season 4 of Masterchef India.And this passion for food began in the unlikeliest of places. When he was a child, growing up in Lucknow, his grandfather Jagir Singh would take him to the gurudwara. A restless Ranveer would run around and end up at the langar. That was when I saw cooking for the first time, he says. Soon, Ranveer began helping around.At age 16, he did the unthinkable for a son of an aeronautical engineer. He ran away from home and worked at a roadside kebab shop run by a man called Munir Ahmed for eight months. However, later, he graduated from the Indian Institute of Hotel Management at Lucknow.Asked the secret to a good dish, Ranveer says, Our five fingers have five rasas: sweet, sour, salty, savoury and spicy. So, when we cook with the hand, the rasas go into the food. And when we eat with our hand, the rasas go inside us. It is important to cook honestly and sincerely because food transfers emotions. So, you are always giving a part of yourself in every dish."
593ba9007be9e0066b6f608a,Rahul farmer salvo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170406/jsp/nation/story_144836.jsp,2017-04-06,"New Delhi, April 5: Rahul Gandhi today asked the BJP ""not to play politics with farmers"" by waiving loans in Uttar Pradesh alone as agrarian distress was a national crisis and the Centre should come up with a ""national"" response. Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.What we have seen is a growing tendency among borrowers who are otherwise capable to repay loan but postpone their decision. The repeated loan waiver is hampering the culture of repayment of dues as honest people do not see any incentive in paying back the money they borrowed from the bank, Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager, Bank of Maharashtra, said.In western Maharashtra, where farmers produce sugarcane, the recovery of loans has gone down from the previous year, officials said.Solapur district, which has highest number of sugar factories, recorded farm loan recovery of up to 65% till March, compared to 77% during the previous year, according to district central cooperative bank officials, who did not wish to come on record since they were not authorised to speak to the media.In Ahmednagar district, farm loan recovery for the outgoing financial year was just 33%, slightly less compared to previous year, an official of Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank, which through its network of agriculture credit societies along with other financial institution distributed agriculture loan, said.When there is a demand for farm loan waiver, people naturally prefer to wait, hoping they get relief. But there are many borrowers who repay their dues, said Charudatta Arkatkar, secretary, State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), a representative body of all lending institutions in the state.The fall in loan recovery has been recorded despite a good monsoon this year with the economic survey predicting a 12.5% growth rate for agriculture in 2016-17 from the minus 4.6% in 2015-16.Congress workers raising slogans with Tamil Nadu farmers during a protest against Centre in Coimbatore on Wednesday, demanding farm loans waiver.

The CAG report on public sector undertakings was tabled in the legislature on Friday.Sahitya Ratna Lokshahir Anna Bhau Sathe Development Corporation Ltd (SRLABSDCL), which was formed for the Matang community's development, gave loans to the tune of Rs 35.34 crore to two companies, Maitari Sugar and Trading Pvt Ltd for business operations and Mahalaxmi Dairy Products Cooperative Ltd for cluster development.

In 14 cases, the same income certificates were used by multiple beneficiaries. The age-criterion norm was violated by the corporation while doling out loans.

Together they eat enough food in a week to feed two families of four for a month.

However, a drug called MC4R Agonist, only available through a pharmaceutical company in the US, could help Eman and the three children. The drug has been tested on three paediatric patients.

They earn about Rs 5,000 a month, which isnt enough to cover even the childrens food expenses  Rs6,000 to Rs7,000 a month.The entire village helps us to feed the children. Some give us rotis while others help out with gravy, said Ramesh. The children consume milk worth Rs 100, more than 30 rotis, and more than a kilo of vegetables every day.

She suspects that they have a genetic disorder known as Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a complex condition affects many parts of the body and causes Type-2 diabetes and obesity.We really dont have the resources to diagnose the children but they used to come to us with other ailments such as pneumonia or fever. They could be treated if there was something wrong with their hormone levels but if its a genetic problem, nothing much can be done, said Dr Mandviya. He added that after local media highlighted the plight of the family, Ahmedabad Civil Hospital offered to treat them.However, Dr K M Maheria, head of paediatrics at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, said even they couldnt diagnose the problem. We dont have an endocrinologist but we did put the children on a diet. We saw a slight weight reduction but we couldnt provide any specific treatment, said Dr Maheria. He added that he has spoken to Dr Lakdawala about the childrens condition.Ramesh said that taking the children to a hospital when there was nothing medically wrong with them didnt make sense. I thought it was better to focus on working and earning enough to feed them. They need a diet of fruit juices and salads but we cant afford it, he said.

Interacting with farmers from different parts of Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, It is an irony that Konkan receives the highest rainfall in Maharashtra, yet its rivers run dry during summers with the overflowing water draining into the Arabian Sea.He dismissed the feasibility of the proposed river linking project on financial grounds. Responding to the water problems raised by farmer Santosh Dinkar, Fadnavis said, We have taken up the five-river revival project.

However, water conservation projects, which are under way in Marathwada or Vidarbha, cannot be applicable in the Konkan belt.To Surendra Bulbules question on river linking, Fadnavis said, The states priority is to complete ongoing irrigation projects requiring Rs 80,000 crore and water conservation projects to immediately tackle drought and double the income of farmers. The two river linking works have been shortlisted by the Centre, which will entirely fund the project.Fadnavis, replying to farmer Yashwant Poples query on micro-irrigation and its impact in agriculture, said adopting Israels fertigation technique to improve the nutrient amount in soil, the crop yield will increase under the micro-irrigation model as well as with the help of water management techniques.He added, With five river basins and big dams, we have as a rule made it mandatory to bring the entire sugarcane cultivation on drip irrigation within three years. To provide uninterrupted power supply to farmers, the state will install a separate solar feeder for agriculture sector.Fadnavis said the financial implications had been worked out. Today, per unit power costs Rs 4.50 to Rs 5. We provide power to farmers at Re 1. Now this amount, which is given in cross subsidy working to Rs 3.5 to Rs 4 per unit, can be used for solar power installation, he said. The solar feeder works much cheaper. The governments solar feeder plan has been accepted by Niti Aayog which believes other states should also replicate the model.Outlining the advantages of solar feeder, Fadnavis said, The electricity cost on agriculture pumps operated on solar feeder will be economically cheaper, thus saving the government money. Other queries raised by the farmers ranged from climate resilient agriculture techniques to higher investments in agriculture infrastructure.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(File Photo) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. (File Photo)Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that micro-irrigation for agriculture will not only save water but also increase the productivity. His government had also stepped up efforts to complete the incomplete irrigation projects, Fadnavis said in the second episode of TV show Mi Mukhyamantri Boltoy (This is CM speaking), aired by Doordarshans Sahyadri channel and other Marathi channels today.Micro-irrigation not only saves water, but experience tells us that it also raises productivity, he said.In the first phase of micro-irrigation, only the required amount of water is given to crops after soil testing. The dose of water is increased in the second phase, he said, answering a question by Madhukar Pawar, a farmer.During the program, the CM answers peoples questions, sent by email, WhatsApp or post. Some of them get the chance to be present on the show and ask the question in person.The Chief Ministers Office had received some 2500 questions from various parts of the state, officials said.Fadnavis said he was confident that in the next three years, most of the sugarcane farming would switch to micro-irrigation.We need Rs 80,000 crore to finish incomplete irrigation projects. We are working hard on it. State- and district-level committees have been set up for the technical evaluation of projectsThe Centre has agreed to provide assistance of Rs 26,000 crore. When these projects are completed, our irrigation capacity would see a quantum jump, he said.To a question by another farmer, Santosh Dinkar, Fadnavis said the government had undertaken a project to revive five rivers in the Konkan region with the help of Dr Rajendra Singh, the famous water conservationist.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

They wait for the hour-long lunch break that day with keen anticipation.All 28 of them rise ten minutes before the clock strikes 1pm, go to their chambers for a quick change and then proceed towards the common dining hall where a delectable three-course meal awaits the lordships.The lip-smacking cuisine from a particular part of the country is not sourced from a restaurant or hotel, but is home-cooked.A sitting SC judge hosts the weekly common lunch. The dishes are part of the host judges home state, prepared at his residence.A minimum of five food items have to be served in the main course and paan  as per each judges choice  is a must to end the lunch. Sources said judges sometimes call cooks from their native place to prepare dishes with the right local flavour.On other working days judges eat lunch in their own chambers.This Wednesday the judges tucked into home-made traditional food from Madhya Pradesh that was cooked at Justice Arun Misras residence. Pumpkin soup, bharvan bhindi and baingan, malai-kofta and paneer lababdar were on the menu. More than the main course, the dessert was much appreciated. The roasted kheer, pineapple kesar halwa and maalpua were just to die for, a judge told HT.Last week Justice RK Agrawal from Uttar Pradesh was the host. Dry green peas, kadhai paneer and dum aloo flavoured with local spices were laid out at lunch time.THE JUSTICES ARE SERVED In a charming tradition, Supreme Court judges meet for lunch every week, with each of them taking turns to bring ghar ka khana from his or her home state 1 Jagdish Singh Khehar 2 Adarsh Kumar Goel 3 Deepak Gupta 4 N.V.

Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the delicacy that afternoon.And before that the judges had Rajasthani delicacies from Justice AK Sikris kitchen - bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi.Vegetables from Justice Kurien Josephs own kitchen garden were used to cook traditional dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, followed by neatly chopped pineapples. The unusually long ripe bananas from the state were served after the meal.Justice J Chelameswar, who stirred a controversy with his decision to skip collegium meetings, too was a good host when it was his turn. His lunch treat of spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi left the judges licking their fingers.An unwritten rule is strictly followed at these lunches  only vegetarian cuisine is served to respect the sentiments of those who do not eat non-vegetarian food. The host is selected according to the judges seniority.Justice AK Patnaik, who retired in June 2014, fondly remembers how the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had added a new rule not to convert the lunch into a competition between judges. He introduced a penalty for those who exceeded the number of dishes fixed by him, Justice Patnaik recalls.Behind every successful meal is a judges wife, a senior judge told HT. But not for Justice R Banumathi  the lone woman judge  who would have to supervise the lunch herself when her turn comes.The Wednesday lunch not only gives judges an opportunity to taste a variety of Indian cuisines, but also shows their bonhomie. Work is never discussed and judges leave their differences at the door. Food is the only topic of discussion with some of the judges boasting about their local cuisines.A senior judge is appointed as the marshall and he penalises any judge who breaks the rules. At present Justice Bobde is the marshall. An argument with the marshall can aggravate the penalty.A marshall is like a class monitor to whom a complaint is made if a judge is seen breaching the rules. He is also the one who announces the end of the dinner that follows a standing ovation for the host judge, a sitting judge told HT on condition of anonymity.Retired judge Justice Kuldeep Singh who suggested the idea of the weekly lunches in the early Nineties gets nostalgic when asked about what triggered the idea. Justice Ranganath Misra was the Chief Justice then and he agreed for the weekly lunch so that we could all get together. It gave a personal touch and became an exciting event which everyone looked forward to, Justice Singh said.It was an opportunity to unwind and relax over food. Therefore, the rule that work should never be discussed. When we left our gowns in the chambers, we also left our work behind. I always looked forward to meals from south, Justice Singh recollects.Justice GS Singvhi who retired three years ago also has fond memories to share. Those were the only moments when we never discussed work. The lunch ensured that we brushed up our knowledge related to food cooked in our houses he told HT.Nor can he forget the south Indian dishes he had at these lunches. Home-made paisam (dessert), rasam and brown rice of Kerala were my favourites. I never eat sweets due to my sugar problem, but I could not resist the home-made paisam served by a brother judge from the south, he says.Yes, it was difficult for judges to avoid home-cooked preparations, despite health issues. When it was my turn I got two types of dessert ready, which included a sugar-free dessert. To my surprise nobody touched the sugar-free sweet and I always thought that judges were too old, muses Justice Patnaik who enjoyed the variety of chutneys his brother judge from the South got for lunch.A judge recollects how Justice Aftab Alam in his farewell speech on April 18, 2013 described the Wednesday lunch as a congregation of mini India. He said the one thing he would miss post retirement would be the weekly lunch, the judge recalls.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha holds a similar view. The Supreme Court is a mini India. You have judges from all over the country. The lunch used to a gastronomical delight of regional cuisine, he told HT.Justice Lodha had served dal-bati when it was his turn to host the lunch. It was soaked in ghee and I remember that after the lunch session all the judges felt so sleepy. Justice Singhvi, who also got dal-bati, says his preparation was different from Justice Lodhas family recipe. Dal-bati is cooked differently in the Jodhpur region and in the Jaipur region of Rajasthan. That is the beauty of Indian food, he explains.The lunch is laid out on a large rectangular table presided by the CJI. The host sits on his right and gives a brief introduction about the dishes. The rest sit wherever they like.However, the seating arrangement keeps changing. During former CJI HL Dattus tenure, the judges used to sit around circular tables and places were decided as per the lucky draw. A judge recollects how the present CJI JS Khehar ended up sitting next to Justice Dattu thrice. And when the former CJI asked him what conspiracy he was up to, CJI Khehar said it was the lucky draws fault!"
593adecf7be9e00e1ecd32b6,Import impact small on sugar prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170417/jsp/business/story_146711.jsp,2017-04-17,"Calcutta, April 16: Sugar prices are expected to remain firm at around Rs 37-40 per kg in sugar season 2017-18. Despite the government's decision to allow duty free import of raw sugar up to 0.5 million tonnes, lower inventory because of a fall in production is expected to keep prices range bound, according to mills and market analysts. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) has lowered its production estimate to 203 lakh tonnes from 213 lakh tonnes as sugarcane yield in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in January and February was lower than expected. ""Sugar prices are expected to remain firm in sugar season 2017 because closing inventory is seen to be at an eight-year low following a fall in production in Maharashtra and Karnataka. That's despite the government's recent move to allow duty-free import of raw sugar of 0.45 million tonnes till June 12, 2017, and a fall in consumption because of demonetisation,"" research firm Crisil said in a report. Crisil, however, added that the government's policy on imports would remain ""a key monitorable"" in the coming months. With high cash accruals (because of stable prices) and no proposed greenfield expansion, Crisil also expects the debt burden of the mills to ease. ""According to Isma and Icra estimates, mills are likely to produce 203 lakh tonnes in sugar season 2016-17, 19 per cent lower than last year's 251 lakh tonnes. Moreover, mills have stopped crushing early this year because of insufficient availability of sugarcane in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We expect the prices to remain firm in the coming months because of a deficient production forecast and diminishing stocks in the domestic market,"" said Ritesh Kumar Sahu, analyst (agri commodities) at Angel Broking. ""Domestic prices are likely to reign at Rs 37-40 per kg. If the import duty is scrapped, this will fall to Rs 29-30 per kg,"" said India Ratings and Research. There is a 40 per cent duty on sugar imports in India. The research firm also expects northern millers to perform better with profitability 15-20 per cent higher than units in the south and west. According to Isma data, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 9 lakh tonnes more than what it was last year. Isma, however, expects sugarcane availability to improve next year in Maharashtra and mills in the west and south are likely to start crushing cane in the first half of October 2017. ""With Diwali now being earlier on October 19, 2017, the mills in north India will also start crushing by the latter part of October. Hence, sugar from the new season will be available in the market by the end of October,"" said Isma."

He, however, found solace in one thing. He knew if his son ever developed convulsions in his absence, his neighbours at Tambawala Trust building  a chawl at Dongri  would rush to his sons aid, arrange for help and would even wait at any hospital.Martis situation symbolises Mumbais chawl culture  where one floor of a multi-storied building comprises houses in a single row with a common verandah and toilets. Think of a joint family, but one in which its members are not related by blood.

(Source: Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Farmers with 20-ft tall sugarcane stalks of Co 0238 variety at a field in Bijnor, UP. (Source: Express Photo by Oinam Anand)The story of sugar in the 2016-17 season (October-September) has been about two underestimations. The first has had to do with Maharashtra  not adequately factoring in the impact of the 2015 drought on cane availability for the new season. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), on September 28, projected the states sugar output for 2016-17 at 62.7 lakh tonnes (lt). Actual production turned out to be just 41.87 lt, a steep drop over the 84.15 lt and 105.14 lt for the preceding two seasons, and the lowest since the 22.33 lt of 2004-05.The second underestimation has been with regard to Uttar Pradesh (UP), although here it has worked in the reverse. ISMAs September 28 advance estimates had pegged sugar production this season at 76.60 lt, up from 68.55 lt in 2015-16. But as on April 18, mills in UP had already produced 85.27 lt. With 52 out of the 116 factories still running, the final output could touch 88 lt  an all-time-high, surpassing the previous 2006-07 record of 84.75 lt.Significantly, the above production achievement hasnt come due to any increase in sugarcane area. UPs total area under cane in 2016-17 has, in fact, fallen by almost a quarter compared to 2006-07. Nor has crushing gone up. Mills had till April 18 crushed 805.33 lt of cane and may end up doing about 830 lt. But that would be well below the 894.94 lt crushed in 2006-07.The higher output by mills is only because of average sugar-to-cane recovery going up, from 9.47 per cent in 2006-07 to a likely 10.6 per cent in the current season. That, in turn, owes itself to Co 0238, a cane variety which gives both higher yields to farmers and also more sugar from every tonne crushed by mills.From practically zero till 2012-13, Co 0238 is estimated to have covered 7.29 lakh hectares (lh) or 35.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. Given the higher yields from this variety, its share in overall production and cane crushed by mills will probably exceed 50 per cent, reckons Vipin Kumar Dwivedi, sugarcane development and sugar industry commissioner of UP.My yields were earlier 45 quintals or so per bigha (66 tonnes/hectare). With Co 0238, it is now 55 quintals (80 tonnes/hectare), says Jitender Hooda, who grows cane in six out of his eight-acre holding at Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district/tehsil. Co 0238 is also the main reason for UPs average cane yields rising from hardly 60 tonnes per hectare till only four years ago to 66.5 tonnes in 2015-16. Since Co 0238s share in total area was only 19.6 per cent last season, I expect the average to cross 70 tonnes per hectare in 2016-17, notes Bakshi Ram, director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute at Coimbatore and breeder of the blockbuster variety.For mills, the biggest draw of Co 0238 is its early-maturity character, defined in terms of sucrose accumulation. This happens faster and reaches optimal levels in Co 0238 at least a month earlier than for normal general cane varieties. Mills are, then, able to get high sugar recoveries right from the start of crushing and all through the season. That alone explains the sharp jump in average sugar recovery in UP, from 9.25-9.5 per cent to 10.6 per cent over the last two years.A one percentage point recovery jump translates into 8.3 lt of extra sugar on the 830 lt of cane that UP mills would be crushing this season. At an average realisation of Rs 36 per kg, it works out to nearly Rs 3,000 crore of additional revenue. In the current season, as many as 27 out of the states 116 mills have recorded average recovery of over 11 per cent. That includes the Bundki (12.31 per cent) and Bahadarpur (12.07 per cent) factories of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, followed by Balrampur Chini Mills Kumbhi (11.94 per cent), Uttam Sugar Mills Barkatpur (11.91 per cent) and UP Cooperative Sugar Factories Federations Sneh Road (11.87 per cent) units. Four out of these top five are in Bijnor district and one (Kumbhi) in Lakhimpur Kheri.The benefits to farmers via higher cane yields  an average increase of 10 tonnes means extra income of Rs 31,500 per hectare at the state advised price (SAP) of Rs 315 per quintal for early-maturing varieties  have, however, been partly offset by delayed payments from mills. During this sugar season, mills have until now bought Rs 24,717.74 crore worth of cane at the SAP. Out of this, Rs 23,521.10 crore should have been paid not later than 14 days after cane delivery, as per the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953. But mills have actually paid only Rs 19,258.47 crore, corresponding to Rs 4,262.63 crore of arrears.The ruling BJP, in its UP election manifesto, had promised to ensure farmers received full payment for their cane within 14 days of sale, as provided in the 1953 Act. However, cane arrears, which were around Rs 4,175 crore when the Yogi Adityanath government took over on March 19, have shown no decrease. Much of the current arrears are courtesy a few groups  mainly Bajaj Hindusthan (Rs 2,355.49 crore), U.K. Modi (Rs 412.23 crore), Simbhaoli Sugars (Rs 390.92 crore), Mawana Sugars (Rs 303.25 crore) and Uttam Sugar (Rs 110.44 crore).We have given a deadline of April 23 for all mills to clear their pending dues to growers. Once that ends, a review meeting will be held and we will take appropriate action against the defaulters, UPs sugarcane development and sugar industry minister Suresh Rana told The Indian Express.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Thombre, president of industry body the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA), forecasting the climb in output to 7 million tonnes.""India will produce enough sugar next season to fulfil local consumption.""Back-to-back droughts look set to curb Maharashtra's production to 4.2 million tonnes in 2016/17 from 8.41 million tonnes the year before, with Indian output expected to plunge 19 percent to 20.3 million tonnes. That would put the nation's production below consumption levels of around 25 million tonnes for the first time in seven years.""This year production fell due to poor yields. Next year we are expecting improvement in yields,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, a body for co-operative mills.India is forecast to receive average rainfall in 2017.Farmers have also been switching back to growing sugarcane after a drop in prices for oilseeds and pulses dented the appeal of sowing those crops, said Nitin Kalantri, a pulse miller in Maharashtra, in west India.That means that imports could decline, hitting major suppliers such as Brazil and Thailand, which have this year been benefiting from New Delhi's decision to allow duty-free imports of 500,000 tonnes of raw sugar.""We will have ample domestic supply next season. We may not need imports,"" said Balasaheb Patil, chairman of the Sahyadri co-operative sugar factory in Maharashtra."

I have instructed officers to look into the matter and given my mobile number for consumers to personally report it if their grievances are not resolved, he said.The complaints ranged from how electricity meter readings were not accurate to the prolonged wait for a permanent connection. Among the poignant complaints was one from Jaibhai, who bitterly pointed out that he was charged Rs 150 for a copy of the consumer profile ledger, and one from a farmer who demanded compensation after his sugarcane crop was destroyed due to a short circuit from a power line that ran through his farm.Responding to these complaints, Bawankule announced that such steep charges would no longer be levied, and directed that the farmer be compensated immediately.On complaints about inaccurate electricity bills, the minister directed that on the 30th of each month, the consumer could take his own meter reading by downloading the MSEDCLs mobile app. Its that simple. Now the next complaint, he said as the queue moved ahead.The exercise also had some lighter moments, when two women involved in a family dispute took on each other at the darbar. The minister had to calm them down and tell them to keep their fight confined to their homes, and present only their complaint at the darbar. I am here to resolve that, he said.One of the consumers, Waghmare from Hadapsar, raised the issue of irregularities in the Infrastructure  phase 2 project. He complained that as per the rules, the meter connection has to be installed within a month of the application being filed. When Waghmare claimed that there were more than 100 applications pending at Talegaon and Wadgaon, the minister snapped at the officer concerned, who sheepishly responded that the MSEDCL had not received sufficient meters. How then do we supply them, asked the officer.The complaint by a retired MSEDCL official, Suryakant Kulkarni, was cut short when the minister bluntly told him to just place his demand for pension rather than beat around the bush.Chandrakant Kale from Solapur bazaar was also told to keep his family dispute aside and not ask for disruption of power supply to other members of his family. Remember, I have come here to ensure power for all, the minister said, as his whirlwind Pune tour, which began with laying the foundation stone for a 22/11 KV sub station at Bopodi and Kothrud, and inaugurating a 22/22 KV switching station at Balewadi, concluded with a darbar to hear the grievances of consumers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Related to ginger, turmeric is a kitchen spice in use for food and medicine for ages.The banal life in urban pockets doesnt allow many of us to see the amazing stages in which a farm crop originates and evolves before reaching the kitchen space. Farm workers in Iluru village under Thotlavalluru mandal in Krishna district on Wednesday were seen processing turmeric rhizomes with deep orange flesh which are dried and then ground to make the familiar vibrant yellow powder.A.P. is the major producerAndhra Pradesh is the leading state in producing turmeric followed by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Kerala and Bihar.The humble journey of this fine yellow power begins in the fields where well developed or split mother rhizomes are used for planting and treated before storing. The crop needs to be mulched immediately with green leaves or sugarcane trash. Depending on the variety, the crop is ready for harvest in seven to nine months. The land is ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted with a spade, says Barma Venkata Subbarao, an agriculture worker engrossed in the task at Iluru.Harvested rhizomes are cleaned of mud and cured before marketing, chips in Zareena Sultana, another farm worker, assisting Mr. Subba Rao.Curing involves boiling of fresh rhizomes in water and drying them in the sun. In the traditional method, the cleaned rhizomes are boiled in copper or galvanised iron or earthen vessels, with water just enough to soak them, he says, pointing to the froth coming out of the white fumes giving out a typical odour. Boiling should be stopped at this point, he explains.Removing four big containers filled with semi-boiled turmeric rhizomes from the fire, Mr. Subba Rao calls out on others for help. Half-a-dozen workers lend him a helping hand in carrying the containers to one side, unloading the rhizomes in heaps and spreading them evenly for drying.The next 10-15 days, the rhizomes are allowed to dry before their appearance is improved by polishing the outer surface.Earlier it was done manually but now it is through mechanical rubbing, he says.

The strict implementation of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act also resulted in more cases being registered in the cases.With more than 30% liquor shops shutting down, the state was also facing a rise in bootlegging and illicit brewing.The excise department that registered 900 cases in 2014, filed about 3600 cases since June 2016 under the NDPS Act. As many as 3,900 persons were also arrested during the same period.Since June 2016, the excise department registered 23,600 abkari cases, conducted 1.27 lakh raids and arrested 22,000 persons. State excise commissioner Rishi Raj Singh said that the bulk of synthetic drugs reaching the state were from Goa and Mumbai, while ganja was mostly brought in from Telangana and Tamil Nadu ""We have taken up a proposal to study the connection between the lack of availability of liquor and the rise in drug abuse by a team comprising of a psychologist, a sociologist, an education expert and a food safety expert. The study is slated to commence as soon as the proposal gets the planning commission's approval,"" Singh said.""The youths are following a frightening trend. The national crime records bureau has ranked Kochi second in terms of drug abuse cases in the country ,'' he said.The commissioner told a news conference that the narcotic rackets operating in the state primarily targets young sters and migrant labourers, a population of more than 70 lakh, making the state a target of peddlers, he said.The amount of synthetic drugs seized over the past 10 months include 135 grams of brown sugar, 2,573 nitrazepam tablets, 813 kg of ganja and 2,892 ganja plants.There was also a rise in abkari cases with the curbs on liquor. The excise department has also seized around 10,400 litre of illicit liquor and 2,780 litre of spirit.Around 34,600 litres of Indian made foreign liquor, 1.48 lakh litres of wash, 10,200 litres of toddy and 22,200 litres of arishtam (Viplavarishtam) were also seized.The excise department also seized 1,420 vehicles used by bootleggers and collected a fine of around Rs 2 crore. The volume of banned tobacco products seized during the period was around 300 tonnes."

Hanumantharayappa has said he had set a deadline of three years for the scientists and officials of the board to take necessary steps for India to become self-sufficient in raw silk production.India is presently producing 28,000 to 30,000 tonnes of raw silk every year as against its requirement of 34,000 tonnes. A shortfall of 4,000 to 6,000 tonnes is being made good by imports from China.Though Karnataka accounted for as much as 60% of the countrys raw silk output, there was no State in the country that was not producing silk, said Mr. Hanumantharayappa while inaugurating a day-long workshop on Entrepreneurial opportunities in Sericulture organised by the University of Mysores Department of Studies in Sericulture Sciences here on Thursday.Mr. Hanumantharayappa said his officials had estimated a time of eight to ten years for India to become self-sufficient. But, I have told them to work towards achieving the target in the next two to three years, he said.Thanks to the on-going R&D activities in the field of sericulture in the country, Mr. Hanumantharayappa said sericulture farmers can now produce not only more amount of raw silk from every 100 disease-free layings, but also reap more mulberry leaves, which serve as food for the silkworms, from an acre of mulberry plantation. Technologically advanced reeling equipment were also made available to the reelers and others associated with the sericulture industry, he said.Observing that a number of students of sericulture were coming from rural areas, Mr. Hanumantharayappa called upon them to pursue sericulture as an occupation instead of pursuing jobs.If you land a job, it is fine. Or else, dont be disillusioned. Sericulture is a very lucrative occupation, he said. While a sugarcane farmer may earn around Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000 for an acre, a sericulture farmer can make more than Rs. 4 lakh now, he said, citing the example of how sericulture farmers from even far-off Maharashtra were satisfied with the price their cocoons command in Ramanagaram cocoon markets.Less waterMr. Hanumantharayappa said the scientists engaged in sericulture research had come out with new varieties of mulberry crop that can be cultivated with a small quantity of water.While an acre of mulberry cultivation was earlier requiring about 3 lakh litres of water for a crop, the new varieties can be grown with just 30,000 litres of water, he claimed.Also, at a time when farmers committing suicide across the country has become a sad recurrence, Mr. Hanumantharayappa claimed that there was no record of any sericulture farmer ending his life.Raw silk productionin the country2012-13  23,679 tonnes2013-14  26,480 tonnes2014-15  28,708 tonnes"

However, the final sanction to the detailed estimate of the project was given on Thursday by minister of railways Suresh Prabhu.The official press statement form public relation office of Central Railway said, ""The section falls in Pune division of Central Railway and passes through Pune, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra. Electrification of this section will provide shorter and seamless movement on electric traction between Western (Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Jaipur, Pune etc.) and Southern (Bengaluru, Chennai) part of the country via Pune-Miraj-Londa-Hospet-Guntakal and Pune-Miraj-Londa-Hubballi-Chikjajur-Bengaluru as these sections are electrified or under electrification.""City-based railway activists and experts termed the development as a big step for Kolhapur.Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) Dhananjay Mahadik said, ""The ministry of railways has fulfilled one of the many demands regarding better rail connectivity for Kolhapur with rest of country. In the rail budget for 2016-17, the rail minister had announced doubling of Miraj-Kolhapur track with electrification. The railway administration has given permission for electrification works. This is first stage of development.""Member of Central Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee Samir Sheth called it major development for passenger and cargo transportation in Kolhapur. ""Lack of electrified rail track from Pune to Kolhapur has slowed down the frequency of trains to Kolhapur. Many trains stop in Pune for changing the engine and it eventually delays the journey. Diesel engines are not as much powerful as electric engines. After electrification speed of all trains will automatically increase.""He added, ""We have already been demanding additional trains for Kolhapur and have already registered our demand for additional trains on Kolhapur-Ahmedabad, Kolhapur-Delhi, Kolhapur-Shirdi and Kolhapur- Mumbai routes.""But the major challenge before railway administration is project deadline. Railway is known for non-compliance of deadlines. Therefore, Railways should instruct PGCIL to comply with the deadline of projects.President of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries Lalit Gandhi said, ""Electrification of Pune-Kolhapur rail track is basic infrastructure work for cargo transportation. It will give boost to sugar and bauxite transportation. At present, sugar from Kolhapur fails to stand in major market due to road transportation and electrification would speed up its transportation."""

That might well have been the order of emergency services in Bombay in the 1880s, going by Kiran Joshi's favourite family story. ""Our shop got the fourth telephone number in the city. The first three were emergency numbers,"" says 55-year-old Kiran.Joshi Budhakaka Mahim Halvawala , located on Mahim's Kapad Bazar road, is not a shop so much as an institution for it invented, around 200 years ago, those wafer-thin sheets of confection that Mumbai calls the Mahim Halva.Veiled in butter paper, these sweets are made from a pulp of wheat, sugar, ghee, and a touch of saffron. The paste is then spread on wooden planks, stretched out and sliced to the size of coasters, then sprinkled with dry fruits before being sold for Rs 400 to Rs 600 per kg.Kiran is the eighth generation descendant of Jetha Joshi, a businessman who had travelled from Pushkar to Gujarat and later to Mahim. For years, Jetha went door-to-door selling halwa, sev bundi, ladoos and mo hanthal made by the women in his family , and became known in the neighbourhood as Joshi buddha kaka (old man).The old man's penchant for experimentation led to the famous halva, says Ki ran. The halva's popularity led the third-generation to open a shop in Mahim in 1829.The shop was registered as `Joshi Budhakaka Mahim Halvawala' by Dhanji Girdhar, the fifth-generation descendant, and was informally known as `Joshi Budhakaka no chokro Dhanji Girdhar Mahim Halvawala, serving eminent British and Indian clients including Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.Kiran holds a letter signed by Nehru which reads: ""We have always been pleased with sweets from Dhanji Girdhar"". He also has a 1950s magazine clipping that quotes Kiran's father, Purushottam Dungarshi Joshi, complaining about heavy taxes and other rules that treat ""sweetmeats"" as ""a luxury meant for the well-to-do"".Now, as then, says Kiran, ""our sweets are consumed by one and all."" The shop's two branches, a 150-year-old one in Tardeo and a 90-year-old one at Dadar Circle, serves mainly Parsis, Maharashtrians and Muslims. ""We even have free deliveries for our privileged Parsi customers in Dadar,"" says Kiran, adding that Parsis are also partial to `sutar feni', `jalebis' and `Mawa Ni Boi'-a sweet shaped like a fish.""You'd be hard-pressed to find something like this now,"" says Kiran, showing off the ornate wooden, fish shaped mould. The shop also prepares a special barfi for the Mahim fair every year.Called 'Urus ki Barfi', the malai confection is fortified with ghee, malai---and faith.""It tastes special because it is sacred,"" says Kiran solemnly.Today the entire Joshi family lives in one building in Mahim. They meet on the shop floor during festivals and also gather for weekly meetings. These gatherings have resulted in innovations like sugar-free anjeer barfis for diabetics, sandwich halva (a jelly-like layer in between two crisp wafers) and triple-flavoured halva.According to Kiran, some truly radical proposals are slated for the upcoming family meeting: introducing chocolate halva and creating a website."
593ae2f57be9e00e1ecd394c,Thermocol shield sinks,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170423/jsp/nation/story_147866.jsp,2017-04-23,"Theni (Tamil Nadu), April 22: Strong and gusty winds have stymied a state government experiment to try and cut water losses through evaporation in the Vagai dam river by placing thermocol sheets on the water surface. Tamil Nadu minister for cooperatives Sellur Raju who inaugurated the unusual method to conserve water in the drought-hit state himself saw the attempt go awry as gusty winds blew the sheets in different directions in the river. The minister later held discussions with officials and staff of the state's public works department who had placed the thermocol sheets on the surface of the water on possible ways to overcome the problem posed by the winds, officials said. Water from the Vaigai dam flows through six water starved districts of south Tamil Nadu including Madurai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Theni and Dindigul districts. Two civil engineers in Maharashtra had two years ago proposed through a study that thermocol can save 32 per cent water on small farm ponds at a cost of about Rs 48 per square metre for material costs. Narhari Chaudhari, associate professor of civil engineering at the Karmveer Kakasaheb Wagh Institute of Engineering, Nashik, had analysed the efficiency of thermocol sheets to prevent evaporation on farm ponds in the region. ""A few farmers near Nashik are already using this technique to conserve water for their sugarcane and pomegranate crop,"" Chaudhari told The Telegraph over the phone today. A thunderstorm on March 15, 2015, had broken some of the thermocol sheets on the farm ponds, slightly reducing the efficacy of the technique, Chaudhari had reported at a conference on hydrology in Roorkee later that year. The Tamil Nadu effort was aimed at a river, in contrast to small farm ponds in Nashik. The thermocol material deployed wasn't enough to cover the water's surface. The minister, Raju, said such methods are used abroad to reduce evaporation. He said the state government has allocated Rs 10 lakh to try out different technologies to prevent water evaporation. Madurai collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said different methods would be adopted or experimented to save water which is in 10 to 12 hectares of waterspread area in the Vaigai dam. He said 1.2 million cubic feet of water is lost because of evaporation every day. On the use of thermocol, he said this was done as the material was non-polluting. But Rathnam, a scientist, differed, saying thermocol is non-biodegradable and can harm fish when they break into pieces."

This year, the sugar cane crushing was particularly low due the drought last year and the sugar factories shut down much earlier than usual.On April 5, the Union government took the decision to import five lakh tonne raw sugar to keep a check on the prices in domestic market. The decision changed the sentiments in the domestic market and traders stopped purchasing sugar from Kolhapur. In the meantime, the bummer production in Uttar Pradesh has led to a decline in demand from northern states.Sugar expert P G Medhe told TOI the government's decision to import sugar has changed the sentiments in market. Moreover, the transportation cost to send sugar to Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh has gone up.""The sugar from UP is available at lower rate for these states than us. Therefore, the overall demand has decreased. The sugar mills have taken loans to recover operational expenses,"" he said.Medhe, who is also the honorary adviser at Chhatrapati Rajaram cooperative sugar factory, said ""The factories have already suffered this year owing to low yield of sugar cane. If the prices of sugar go below the Rs 3,400 per quintal, then it would become difficult to repay the loan.

It is a distributary of the Mathabhanga river which, in turn, is a distributary of the Padma.Read: Drains, polluted rivers raise concerns over groundwater quality in NoidaRepresentatives of Nadia Zila 18th August Parichalan Samiti (NDAPS), a social organisation in Nadia district, have sent a container with samples of water from the Churni river to the Prime Ministers office on Thursday with a plea to start negotiations with the Sheikh Hasina government in Dhaka for controlling the effluents dumped in this river by Bangladesh industry which is carried into India through this river.The Churni river flows through densely populated parts of Nadia district before merging in the Hooghly river. Locals allege tonnes of fish die regularly due to the pollutants flowing from Bangladesh. (Wikipedia)In September 2016, the eastern zonal bench of National Green Tribunal instructed the ministry of external affairs to negotiate with Bangladesh on setting low-cost effluent treatment plant at the industrial unit concerned with expenses to be borne by the Government of India. Nothing, however, has progressed.Read: How pollution killed the HindonLocals greatly depend on the Churni and the Mathabhanga river for various reasons  from fishing to agriculture. But the ever-increasing rate of pollution has jeopardised everything. Finally, we decided to send samples of water from the rivers to the office of the prime minister and the chief minister, said Anjan Sukul of NDAPS.Significantly, the noise is increasing when there is a perceptible difference between the Centre and the West Bengal government over sharing of Teesta waters which flows from India to Bangladesh. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen on signing the Teesta water sharing agreement with Bangladesh, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has taken a stand against sharing north Bengals principle rivers water with the neighbouring country.About six lakh residents are affected by the pollution in the Churni and about 5,000 fishermen have lost their livelihood, allege locals. (HT Photo)In the case of Churni, an 80-year old industrial unit Carew & Co Ltd has a sugar mill, a distillery and a pharmaceutical unit at the border town of Darsana in Chuadanga district of Bangladesh. While the problem of pollutants flowing down the river is an old one, the quantity of effluent released into the waters has drastically increased over the past few years, locals alleged. They collected samples of the polluted water on April 24 and sent it to the PMO the next day.Read: Citizens march to draw attention to Mumbais polluted riversThe effluents are not only polluting the entire river and its ecosystem but are also killing tonnes of fish every year. The livelihood of local fishermen is badly affected and many of them are compelled to switch to other professions, said Gokul Bala, a resident of Shibnibas area in Krishnaganj.The extent of pollution in the river is so high that the water is unfit even for irrigation and bathing, alleged the locals who filed the petition in the NGT.Locals who filed the petition also claimed that the river flows through densely populated areas of the Nadia district and affects the lives of six lakh inhabitants and about 5,000 fishermen, who have lost their livelihood.Read: Pollutants in Ganga destroying river purifying algae colonies: StudyNational Green Tribunal directs the Ministry of External Affairs to continue negotiations with Government of Bangladesh for setting up an effluent treatment plant with funding by Government of India for the industries contributing to the pollution of river Mathabhanga, which subsequently flow into river Churni in West Bengal, reads the September 21 order.The green tribunal also ordered the government of West Bengal to prepare a detailed project report through its Municipal Engineering Directorate.Members of the organisation indicated to HT that they have approached the highest executive office of the land hoping the government would try to prevail on Dhaka to find a quick solution to the festering problem. However, if there is no result, they may think of launching agitations.It is recorded in the NGT order that on July 14, 2014, the Indian high commission in Dhaka conveyed the problem of dumping effluents into the Churni to the foreign ministry of Bangladesh, but there has been no improvement in the situation.After branching off from the Mathabhanga river, Churni flows for more than 56 kms before merging into the Hooghly river. Therefore, the pollutants are eventually carried into the Hooghly river too."

To be fair, PFT has shown a glimpse of railways readiness to take necessary steps in the right direction, but not sufficiently, he added.As per plan, firms and manufacturers that transport bulk of their produce through the railway network would be allowed to set up their own private terminals from where their own trains would ply to delivery centres. The trains will run on Indian Railways tracks and the operation of the trains will remain with the railways. This is per the provisions of the Special Freight Train Operations Scheme of the Ministry of Railways.However, the problems being faced by Indian Railways such as creaky signalling infrastructure and tracks needing maintenance will largely remain the same. The problem is compounded on congested routes such as between Delhi and Mumbai, which already face pressure from both passenger and freight trains, analysts said.This is a good initiative and can help players with bulk movements such as coal, sugar, cement and fertilizers for faster movement of their cargo, said Ganesh Rewanwar, director & CEO, Saanvad Ventures Pvt. Ltd. which runs freightbazaar, an e-transportation marketplace catering to the trucking industry. It will also help in multi modal infrastructure development and speed up investment in infrastructure, he added.He said the impact may not be immediate since it would require more time to build up infrastructure. The major challenge will be land acquisition and terminal utilisation. It is not expected to affect long-haul road transport in a major way. However, it will be a boost for the first-mile and last-mile logistics sector, he said.The Railways, under Minister Suresh Prabhu, may be undergoing transformation, but scepticism persists.The move is seen [as] positive for large corporates with heavy volume of cargo as freight movement by railway is suitable for long distance over 500 kms, said Kamal Podar, managing director, Choice Group which is into financial services and management consulting in the infrastructure space.However, so far we have seen limited success in private container train operations since it was introduced in 2006, due to lack of conducive policies, he added. The railway traffic is caught between subsidised passenger traffic and premium tariff for cargo which is benefiting other modes of traffic like road and shipping, he added.Besides, the precedence given to passenger trains is expected to cause uncertainties in running freight trains in a scheduled manner. This may defeat the very purpose behind the partial opening up of the freight transport arm of the railways. Apart from the convenience of transporting cargo through own trains, the economic viability of any such operation would remain a major question for private operators.Going by past experience, most Container Terminal Operators have either burnt their fingers or not started operations in a meaningful manner. In fact, there have been instances of licence-holders operating only a few rakes merely to prevent their licences from being revoked.Charges, changesAnalysts said the main cause of unprofitable operations may be attributed to the charges by Railways and ad-hoc changes in tariffs for some of the profitable cargo (heavy cargo and long distance haulage). Also lack of guarantee of timely delivery of the consignment has repulsed the EXIM cargo, they added. For example, the railways command less than one third of total container volumes at JNPT, the largest container port in India located in Mumbai. JNPT attracts most of the cargo from long distances from the North and West of India. This situation is unheard of in any other country with advanced logistics systems, industry watchers said. Long distances must mean competitive advantages to railways over road.Analysts believe that the problems such as heavy detention charges, fixed haulage charges, whether the rake is full or empty, coupled with the lack of certainty on timely movement of rakes would affect the private rail operators in the same way as they affected the Container Terminal Operators.Another concern that bogs potential private operators is the lack of clarity on whether they would be allowed to run their rakes on the proposed Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) being set up in the country.In addition, there is lack of clarity on the approval process for rakes and the design specifications. As per existing rules, the approval from the Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO) of the Railways is required for running any non-standard rake. It is feared that the approval process could take a long time and bureaucratic hassles would jeopardise the genuine intent, said industry sources.The absence of a credible dispute resolution mechanism has also been red flagged by analysts. The Railways, being both the operator and regulator, meant that the dispute resolution system in place may not be adequately effective, they said. However, it is expected that the proposed Rail Development Authority may address the issues of effective and efficient regulation as well as dispute resolution.Finally, although the intent to allow private operators to run their own rakes is laudable, ambitious and bold, it has to be backed by proper implementation mechanism, according to consultants.If implemented properly, it can begin the virtuous circle by freeing up the resources of Indian Railways and providing focus on basic infrastructure such as modern signalling equipments and robust rail network, Mr. Chaturvedi said. The result will be more capacity augmentation from existing infrastructure and more cargo movement... [and] thus more resources for the railways, he added."

Karnataka is followed by Tamil Nadu (67%) and Andhra Pradesh (63%).Without exception, all the sample households mentioned non-institutional loan as one cause of farmers suicide. The overall indication was that the pressure exerted by non-institutional lenders was more than that by institutional ones, says the study, conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru.The study was commissioned by the Agriculture Ministry, which shared the report with the Supreme Court in connection with a public interest litigation on farmer suicides that the court was hearing.The survey team interviewed members of 528 victim households  farming families where one member committed suicide  spread across 388 villages in 13 states, including Karnataka. Besides indebtedness, it identified several farming and social causes too behind the rising trend of suicide among farmers.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 12,602 people involved in farming sector (farmers and agriculture labourers combined) committed suicide in 2015, accounting for 9.4% of total suicide victims (1,33,623). The numbers are on the rise for the last three years.State-wise, the maximum number of suicides was reported in Maharashtra (4,291) followed by Karnataka (1,569); Telangana (1,400), Madhya Pradesh (1,290), Chhattisgarh (954), Andhra Pradesh (916) and Tamil Nadu (606) in 2015, accounting for 87% of all farmers suicide in India.Inability to get farm credit and crop failure are also among the drivers pushing a hapless farmer towards suicide.Expectation of loan waiver as one of the causes for suicide was the maximum in Kerala (89%) followed by Karnataka (66%) and Tamil Nadu (57%). Failure of rainfall was a cause for suicide in all states except Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.There are also social causes like drug abuse, alcoholism, extra-marital affair and fear of declining social status.However, the numbers in these categories are far less than farming and indebtedness causes.With the apex court hearing the PIL, the agriculture ministry last month reviewed the measures that the centre and state governments have taken to prevent farmers suicide.In the review meeting, Karnataka officials pointed out that farmers suicide was on a high for the fourth consecutive year because of drought and failure of sugarcane crop."

The delicate skin has fewer oil glands compared to other areas and is constantly exposed to the suns harsh rays and other chemical concoctions like harsh soaps and detergents. Plus, our hyaluronic acid decreases with age, leading to pigmentation, prominent veins and thin skin. This process starts in your mid-20s but becomes evident in the early 40s.Care for your hands as you do your faceExposure to water, cleansers, hand sanitisers, dry weather, long hours in air conditioned environments affect your hands. But with a little care, you can remedy the situation. Firstly, moisturise as much as possible. Whether you are sitting in your car or in your office, always keep lotion handy. As for the men, while strong hands might be appealing, callused ones certainly arent. So use a hand cream too but just dont borrow one from your partner. Sonia Sharma, Spa Manager at Taj Salon, Vivanta by Taj - President, Mumbai, advises purchasing formulas meant for men as their skin tends to be thicker. While doing the dishes, use gloves to avoid contact with harsh detergents. Swap harsh soaps for gentle hand washes with pH levels between 5.5 to 5.7.Dr. Neena Chopra, director, Beauty and Technical, Just Herbs (an e-store for organic and ayurvedic luxury skincare) has simple advice. She urges you to use the same anti-ageing products meant for your face, on the backs of your hands. Massage it in to improve circulation and then slip on thin gloves before bed. Also, a hand mask once a week delivers an intensive dose of hydration to your skin. Dr. Renita Rajan, a consultant cosmetic dermatologist, offers a quick home-care facial for the hands. Lather up a gentle cleanser and add some brown sugar to the mix. Use the concoction to gently scrub the skin until the sugar dissolves. It will exfoliate your skin without being unduly harsh.Of course, never forget sunscreen, even for your hands. Dr. Neeraj Tulara, specialist internal medicine at Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai says, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older. To protect them, Tulara says to regularly apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher reapply often. And if theyve gotten sunburnt, a paste of fresh tomato juice will reverse the damage.Pay attention to your potionsDr. Jamuna Pai, celebrity cosmetologist at Blush Clinic, Mumbai, advises being smart about your hand products. Whilst selecting your moisturiser, check the labels for key ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and dimethicone, besides urea, glycerine and shea butter as these will replenish the moisture that the environment takes out from your skin by pulling the water from the inner layers of your skin to the surface. Aloe vera, vitamin E oil, mango butters, also work well to soften and heal your hands. Dr.Chiranjiv Chhabra, director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive, recommends using a product with retinol at night since it has great anti-ageing benefits and stimulates collagen production.If you want to go beyond homecare, Dr. Apratim Goel, cosmetic dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis Skin Studio, Mumbai, suggests trying out the new Helios-II fractional laser, which works wonders on shrivelled hands and removes age spots and tanning. Filler injections containing hyaluronic acid like Juvederm, Restylane and Meso Infusion can also be given to moisturise the skin from within, she says.Give your hands, a handThe age-old offenders like smoking and drinking will sap your skin of any moisture. Load up on good ol H20 because dehydration can affect your hands badly. A good well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, zinc and fatty acids will contribute to soft skin. Dr. Maithili Kamat consultant dermatologist at Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, tells her patients to keep a stress ball handy as squeezing it not only helps release tension but also helps build the muscles of your wrists and hands."

The recovery followed a quarter of muted sales due to the currency swap in November that had curtailed the purchasing power of rural households using cash to buy shampoos, soaps, or packaged cookies.The overall market grew 12.2% by value in the fourth quarter with 7.5% volume growth, according to executives citing Nielsen data.""Consumption is clearly recovering and is expected to continue to strengthen across the balance of the year,"" Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, said on an investor call last Friday, adding that India's urban consumption is back to normal but the wholesale channel has not completely bounced back in rural areas due to a lag effect.Unilever, the parent of consumer products company Hindustan Unilever , said about two weeks ago that growth in India had recovered from the uncertainty experienced due to the currency swap.So far, two listed companies -- Dabur and Marico -- have posted quarterly earnings with positive commentary on demand revival. Dabur said sales improved as the quarter progressed, led by a significant improvement in rural demand that accounted for more than half its sales. Volume swelled 2.4%.""Liquidity has come back and rural demand is looking positive. It should further accelerate over the next two quarters on the back of a good monsoon as is the expectation. We are moving more stocks in the wholesale channel,"" said Dabur chief executive Sunil Duggal.Marico, which posted 10% volume growth, also said normalcy has returned.Growth, however, wasn't entirely driven by volumes or actual products in shopping carts. Last quarter also saw companies including Britannia, Hindustan Unilever, Amul, Dabur and Parle either raising prices or cutting pack weights after prices of ingredients such as sugar, milk powder and palm oil jumped 20-80% over the past year on account of fluctuating global commodity prices and lower production cycles.Also, while listed companies have been posting lower value growth numbers, Nielsen said the market's expansion has been fueled by smaller companies.""Small and regional players have seen much faster growth than top manufacturers in recent quarters. As an example in one of the mass categories, it was found that three-fourths of category volume growth in 2016 was contributed by only one manufacturer -- and it is unlisted,"" said a Nielsen spokeswoman, adding the top 30 FMCG manufacturers contributed around 55% to total FMCG last year. Nielsen didn't name the company as per its policy.Finance minister Arun Jaitley had announced several incentives on farm infrastructure and credit for rural and low-income consumers in the February budget, measures that could revive consumption.""There are clear signs of rural recovery, which had got derailed last year because of demonetisation,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities.""Measures to improve farm incomes and expectations of a normal monsoon are indications pointing towards better rural demand over the next few quarters. This is in contrast to last three years when there was a lull.""Companies such as HUL and Dabur are also stepping up direct reach with demonetisation turning out to be a silver lining as companies streamline cashless credit transactions and widen product portfolios, experts said."

Officials and traders attributed the significant jump in sales to the good monsoon crop and high rates offered for cane by sugar mills.Large tracts of land in Kolhapur are under sugar cane cultivation, earning it the tag of being the sugar bowl of Maharashtra. Sugar cane cultivation and prices are a driving force in this region and define the overall economic situation.Regional transport officer D T Pawar told TOI , ""Akshay Tritya proved better for the automobile industry in the district this year. Sale of vehicle was very poor on Akshay Tritya in 2016 due to poor showers. Owing to good monsoon and better prices to cash crops, sale of vehicle almost doubled this year on Akshay Tritiya.""He added that the office registered sale of 3,630 geared and non-geared two wheelers and 135 passenger cars.City-based agricultural expert Ashok Pisal said sugar cane has the ability to offer more than your regular needs. Fix payments assure handsome incomes for farmers and they can buy luxurious things. ""Farmer prefer to buy vehicles after meeting his regular needs. Unlike other crops, sugar cane does not require constant attention,"" he said.Traders in the district were still not happy with the overall sales despite the increase. President of Kolhapur automobile dealers' association Vijay Patil said, ""Vehicles market has slowed down in last three years. Despite the increase recorded this year, vehicle sale did not live up our expectation. Many people grabbed the massive offers on vehicle purchase last month. Better agricultural activities brought out little cheer in market."""

""There can be no compromise. What has to go, has to go,"" said Justice Kanade.Senior advocate Ram Apte, appearing for the sugar factory, admitted the chimney's height is above the permissible level, but attributed it to disputed calculation. He said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in Mumbai had given its no-objection certificate and the factory has now approached the AAI Delhi seeking relaxation.To this, Justice Kanade said, ""Only in India this can happen. I have travelled all over the world and realized that only in our country authorities throw caution to the winds without any care for passenger safety norms. You want accidents to happen?""The bench said it is 'well-settled' that height restriction in respect of buildings in the approach of the runway and funnel areas cannot be reduced. ""These restrictions have been imposed taking into consideration the safety of passengers in aircraft and people residing in areas near airports,"" said the bench, adding that the court has earlier given directions with regards to Mumbai that the height of structures has to be calculated from mean sea level with special equipment.Declining relief, the judges said the petitioner could apply to the AAI Delhi to stay the collector's order.

Out of its total geographic area of 7,620 sq km, around 139.11 sq km, which account for 19.35% of the total, are under forest cover. But human intervention in these forest areas has resulted in the man-animal conflicts in the district.V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests and director of the Sahyadri tiger project, told TOI that Kolhapur is located in the eco-sensitive and biological hotspot of the Western Ghats.""Land development activities in Radhanagari, Aajra and Chandgad talukas have disturbed the migration corridor of the gaurs and elephants. Elephant is a vegetarian animal needs at least 18 hours for feeding. Kolhapur is full of grass crop, sugarcane and water bodies. An elephant gets enough food in single farm, but consumes just 1/3 of the field and destroys the remaining. The individual farmer has to pay a high price,"" he said.The officer explained that the National Forest Policy, 1988 changed the view towards elephants. With it, elephants camps were stopped and people freed the animals in the forest. Since then, they started migration towards northern Karnataka and finally in the Maharashtra via Goa.After 2002, seven elephants made Chandgad, Aajra and Radhanagari talukas as their habitat and they are reluctant to go back on Karnataka due to abundance of food in form of the sugarcane here, the officer said.""We have suggested an alternative crop pattern to keep elephants out of farms. We have proposed cultivation of chilli crop to prevent damage from elephants. We have suggested farmers to change crop patterns to deal with the situation,"" he said. The government has given out Rs 2 crore as compensation to farmers in Kolhapur for crop loss in animal attacks last year.Vivek Patil, a farmer in Here village of Chandgad taluka, said that he lost his entire banana crop due to an elephant attack last year. ""They normally arrive normally between May and September. I only received Rs 12,000 compensation from the government against the actual losses of Rs 80,000. We have demanded solar fencing, digging of ditches around villages to prevent the entry of elephants. But hardly anything has been done,"" he said.Ben said that another native animal of the region, gaur or Indian bison, has been the cause of massive crop damage in Shahuwadi, Chandgad, Panhala, Aajara talukas in the district. ""Gaur is native of Kolhapur district. The grassland where the gaurs inhabited have come under sugarcane cultivation in these talukas. Therefore, the gaurs enter the fields in search of their food,"" he said.Wildlife researcher Amol Jadhav said that increasing human intervention in migration corridors has resulted in to man-animal conflicts. ""Karnataka, Goa, Aajra, Chandgad area is a known elephant migration corridor. They come here in search of food. Farmers have brought jungle land tracts along these corridors and started sugarcane cultivation. Sugarcane has become major source of food for elephants. We don't have permanent solution on migration,"" he said.Officials said that the human deaths were reported in cases of attacks by gaurs or Indian bisons. The animal becomes very aggressive between the period of May to October to protect their young ones. ""The animal would attack any person posing a threat to the newborns. Cattle herding in forest areas has encroached upon the natural grasslands of gaurs. Therefore, the incidents of crop damages have increased in past many years. Animal herding in forest areas has become major concern in case of gaur attacks, officials said."

The decision also means the state government will have to make financial provisions of more than Rs 15,000 crore for the local bodies.Following the draft GST bill, Shiv Sena gave its approval to the Goods and Services Tax, after the state government promised to credit the compensation amount in the BMC account before fifth of every month. This has paved the way for smooth passage of the GST bill in the state legislature at the three-day special session from May 20 to 22. The state cabinet on Tuesday adopted the draft legislation by incorporating the compensation clause to replace the financial loss that would be incurred by the BMC and local bodies due to abolition of octroi and local body tax respectively. Late Monday night, the state government had provided a copy of the draft GST bill to Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. The Sena president gave the nod after discussing the amendments with party leaders.Highly placed sources in the government said, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reassured Thackeray that every financial loss on account of octroi would be adequately compensated. As Mumbai was a very important economic capital, the government was equally concerned about the civic issues and responsibilities.It is mandatory for every state to ratify the GST after Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha gave their approval in the Budget session. The GST will be implemented from July 1. Following abolition of octroi in BMC and local body tax in municipal councils across Maharashtra, the state government made amendments in the draft GST to make allocation of funds as compensation to the BMC and other local bodies mandatory. The GST draft states, The state government will every month before fifth credit the amount in the accounts of BMC and local bodies.The total amount which the state will have to incur for local bodies is estimated at Rs 14,500 crore of which BMC will be provided Rs 7,200 crore as compensation for abolition of octroi. Every year, the amount will be increased by eight percent. The state government acknowledged that every local body and BMC would require consolidated funds for civic work in their respective cities. The implementation of GST mandating a unified tax regime makes their individual tax collections from purchase of sugarcane to entry tax on vehicles and octroi redundant.Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, For the last one year, we have urged the centre and the state to make provisions to compensate for the abolition of LBT and octroi.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Based on recommendations the Centre issued over two years ago, the state has told schools not to sell food `High in Fat, Salt and Sugar' (HFSS) and has suggested healthy alternatives. The decision has been taken looking atand related diseases.""HFSS food has very little vitamins and minerals... (Their consumption raises the chance of obesity) and other related diseases among children. The ef fects can be seen on a child's academic performance,"" said the government resolution issued by the school education department. School principals have been asked to ensure that the instructions are followed.The suggested alternatives include chapatis, rice, vegetables and pulses, rajma, wheat upma, khichdi, payasam, idli and vada sambar, coconut water, lemonade and jaljeera. Though not many state-affiliated schools have canteens, the education department's government resolution (GR) banning junk food in schools can be interpreted to include vendors who sell prepackaged or pre-cooked food on campus during breaks.Concerned by food children eat, the Union ministry of women and child development (MWCD) formed a committee under the director of the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad. The panel noted that HFSS (High in Fat, Salt and Sugar) food increased chances of obesity, diabetes, and dental and heart problems.Schools have also been asked toabout healthy eating. ""(They) must take help of professionals in the locality and (seek) information on the internet,"" said the GR.Experts have welcomed the state's move. ""The human body is not designed to metabolise large amounts of artificial sugar and this is easily converted to fat. It is also linked to insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes,"" said Carlyne Remedios, a nutritionist with Saifee Hospital. She said that while it isn't easy to strike the right balance with healthy food, it is not impossible and.""The best way is to make gradual changes so that they are accepted well.""Experts also wished the move had come much earlier.""There was always the science to show that HFSS food had negative health effects on children, and so we should have realized the need for a policy decision two or three years ago,"" said Dr Jagmeet Madan, VP , Indian Dietetic Association.""Nevertheless, it is a welcome step and the least we can do is to minimize the availability of such food to children. ""The Centre's recommendations were issued in December 2014. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) was the first to implement the MWCD's report. It issued directives to affiliated schools in January 2016. CBSE also suggested that a school canteen management committee (SCMC) should take charge of menu preparation. CBSE wanted 7-10 panel members, including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators, to implement the guidelines."

After successful trials in 60 villages of Aurangabad district, the technology is set to be operationalised in various health posts of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, (BMC) in the slums of Govandi and Kurla, in suburban Mumbai.Called Care Mother, the mobile application helps detect pregnant women, categorised as high-risk cases, through health workers and link them with doctors for regular check-ups and ante-natal care. The health worker can create an account for each pregnant woman on the mobile application. Their basic information is then fed in, including blood pressure, diabetes status, weight, age, foetal heart rate, protein and sugar levels. The application identifies high-risk women by calculating a combination of parameters, said co-founder of the application, Shantanu Pathak.Pathak is attached with the bio-medical department of IIT Bombay where he developed the programme with IIT Madras alumni Aditya Kulkarni. Last year, the two conducted trials of the mobile app in the fringes of Mumbai, along with NGOs.In rural areas, owing to poor awareness, pregnant women do not attend regular check-ups at health camps. The health worker or ante-natal care (ANC) workers can use the portable kit to measure blood pressure, haemoglobin, urine and basic parameters on home-to-home visits and feed all information on the application. Local doctors will get an alert on high-risk women identified in the region through the same application loaded on their phones. The only glitch for health workers and doctors is that they should have a smartphone that can install the application.It empowers NGOs, hospitals and doctors to keep high-risk women, such as anaemic or hypertensive, on radar, Pathak said. In Maharashtra, pregnancy induced hypertension can lead to eclampsia, which is the most common cause of maternal deaths.While the mobile app does not replace sonography tests, it aids in tackling common causes of maternal deaths.Till now, 5,000 women have been registered. The software uses World Health Organisation guidelines to classify normal and high-risk women by using test results of foetal heart rate, previous clinical diagnosis and gestational period. If the weight gain is more than 2.27 kg a month, the mother may be at high risk because of change in amniotic fluid levels. The app can decipher such finer details, Pathak said. The app also plots a graph to show foetal heart rate by using a device attached to the mother. In its pilot programme, the appl was used on women in Palghar region. The BMC now plans to implement it in 15 health posts before scaling it up. The IITians claim at least 90 per cent of common pregnancy woes can be prevented. They are now working on adding more features.  In slums, where women do not come for regular screening, the application will be helpful as basic services will be delivered at the door step, said Dr Mangala Gomare, deputy executive health officer, BMC. The app has been bought by Nagaland government and NGOs from Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

From there, he moved to Delhi, and then eventually to Mumbai settling in Sion, in what came to be popularly known as Mini Punjab owing to the community re-settled there.Starting a businessIn 1955, his son Karnail, along with his brother, Surjit, started a small thela selling fish Koliwada. The popularity of the dish encouraged them to open a small eatery in 1970 that only offered 10-15 items.The familys third generation, the 30-year-old Harmeet, remembers running to the shop after school with his elder brother Parvinder (32) and cousins Jagjit and Gurcharan. My grandfather fed us jhinga pao, and my mouth waters thinking of the dish, recalls Harmeet, adding that by then, his father had started a catering business that led to the launch of their first Mini Punjab restaurant in Bandra in 1991. Till date, the Bandra outlet is a converging point for party-goers in the suburbs for its rolls and kebabs. Today Mini Punjab has outlets in Powai, Thane, Sion and Bhiwandi.The familys third generation that is Harmeet, along with his brother and cousin, have now launched Turban Tales, a small plates bar concept to keep up with the times.A new menuFor a family steeped in food, the only tough part about setting up Turban Tales was creating a cocktail menu as none of them drink. On our visit, we try out two cocktails. Since its a Punjabi eatery, we must have a sugarcane drink, so we order Amarsar to Thailand (Rs. 350), a white rum concoction with sugarcane juice, galangal, kaffir and mint leaves. Its not too sour, and the sugarcane compliments the stiffness of white rum and sourness from the lime. We also try thekke da bag (Rs. 400), a whisky, apricot liqueur, pineapple juice, hibiscus syrup and sour mix. It comes topped with a jasmine-vanilla foam. While the syrupy sweetness jars our palate, we love the apricot liqueur.Harmeet, who has worked on the menu, says hes included his favourite dish, the aforementioned jhinga pao. I am doing a mini pao, but I have kept the taste authentic with a besan coating with lots of ajwain, he says.A caterers children will always join him, as there is always shortage of hands. I remember helping my dad after college, where he would make me oversee operations. Koi kaam chota nahi hota, he would tell me. Till date, we step in as chefs, servers and waiters when there is a need, smiles Harmeet, It is our duty to ensure our customers are served fresh food, he says, offering us a portion of tikka supreme.While we chat, we dig into a DIY makke tartlets and sarson da saag (Rs. 239). Their take on the classic saag dish is delicious but wed prefer the roti any day over a floury tartlet.The tikka supreme (Rs. 235) is a charcoal crusted tandoori chicken, moist inside, its hollow oozing with mozzarella cheese. A simple dish, we stop only once the last tikka has been devoured. Vegetarians can enjoy the reshmi soy champ, a smoked chunky bite and tikka momos that come stuffed with cottage cheese and onions. We crave for some spice in the mixture, which is provided by the hand-ground chutney on the side, an old family recipe.All in the familyParvinder, who also runs a vegetarian health caf in Vile Parle East, Garde Manger, apart from running catering and manning the Bandra outlet of Mini Punjab, joins us. My grandfather spoke Pastho, which we didnt understand. So we learnt by watching him. In those days, my father used to sell one kilo of fish for four rupees, with a profit margin of at least one rupee. I burnt my hand in boiling water when I had accompanied my father to a catering event. I was in the sixth standard. My mother was furious, and kept me home for a few years then, he laughs, adding, My friends used to go out and chill, but I would be with dad helping him out. Harmeet adds, We hardly have many photographs of outings with dad. Now, it is our duty to take him out.The brothers Karnail Singh and Surjit Singh remember how difficult and challenging the food business was back then because of the increase in the catering business and dealing with a new restaurant launch at the same time. But they are happy today, It feels great to see how the younger generation has taken charge of things and are offering newer things to our patrons, says Karnail.Turban Tales, Powai; 25708633, 9321158688; 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m. daily."

Foods banned: those high in fats, salt and sugar (HFSS): soft drinks, sweets, pastries, pizzas, and burgers. Approved foods include rajma, vegetables, daals, wheat rotis, vegetable pulav, and idlis.Many schools have banned junk food, but kids still bring unhealthy snacks in their tiffin boxes, says Rebecca Shinde, principal of CBM High School, Mumbai. I am strict, but parents fight with me, asking why children should not be allowed to eat food from home, she says. We are not an affluent enough school to have a canteen, so there is a limit to how much we can control what children bring.Meera Isaacs, principal at Cathedral and John Connon School, says, As students get to higher classes, they do not want to eat healthy food. Fruits and milk have no takers; channa, kaathi rolls, pizza, chips and sandwiches have better appeal. We will have to change these eating patterns. I wonder how much luck we will have.Our canteen is good, said Ujwala Zare, principal of Gopalji Hemraj High School. It has no problem in terms of cleanliness, but it still depends on how much children will show interest in government-approved food.Destroy vitaminsBina Chheda, clinical dietician at Cumbala Hill Hospital, says, Colas bind together B-complex vitamins; ingredients added for colour or to make a dish cook faster also destroy B-complex vitamins. She says that ideal meals for children involve carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and protein.Foods like biscuits are high on glucose and generate short-term energy spikes but do not give any sustenance says Krushmi Chheda, sports nutritionist. During puberty, bones and muscular growth are hampered. Lower attention spans and lethargy become common. She says a good example of a balanced meal is rajma chawal: proteins, carbohydrates, essential fats, and fibre.Limiting access to junk food is good, admits Pranav Vaidyanathan, a student at Dhirubai Ambani High School. Because given the choice of junk food and a healthy lunch, I dont know how many of us would be able to control ourselves."

""Now, she is less enthusiastic about resuming school,"" says her mother Tina.Preetha Sharma, a 12-year-old student, echoes Alisha's sentiments. ""I usually buy vada pav, chips and chocolates almost thrice a week from the canteen . I will miss eating all these items if they ban it. Though I carry lunch from home, I love eating fast food during the short break. All my friends do it, too. My parents tell me about the ill-effects of eating junk food , and it's only at school that I have it. Once I reach home, I anyway drink milk and then eat fruits in the evening, followed by dinner. So why can't I have my favourite foods once in a while at school?"" she asks.Alisha and Preetha are among the many kids in the city who are upset about the ban, which came into effect after the Maharashtra government issued a Government Resolution (GR) on Monday, asking schools not to sell items that are 'High in Fat, Salt and Sugar' (HFSS).Now that items like potato chips, noodles, aerated drinks, pizzas, burgers, cakes, biscuits, buns and pastries might no longer feature on canteen menus, parents are happy that this will keep childhood obesity and other related disorders in check. Arundhati Chavan, president of Parents Teacher Association (PTA), shares, ""We've been fighting for this for the last five years. While some schools anyway don't encourage sale of junk food and have their own midday meal programmes, others instruct parents on what they need to pack for tiffins. Some parents do give their kids snacks like noodles and wafers in their dabbas, but that's only when the children throw a tantrum. We don't recommend junk food because kids tend to feel hungry soon after consuming it and lose concentration as well.""There are some parents who believe that despite the ban, kids will eat junk food outside the premises. Radhika Kochhar, mother of a 13-year-old boy, shares, ""Kids may be forced to eat healthier items in school from now on, but when they step out of the premises, they will buy junk food from vendors. So, how do we control that?""Anushka Desai, teacher at a suburban school, adds that it's not just school authorities who are responsible for what kids eat. Parents, too, need to be strict when it comes to their diet. After all, the GR does not stop children from carrying junk food in their lunch boxes. She says, ""Parents should resist giving in to the demands of kids and try to limit intake of unhealthy food items even at home. They can control consumption of junk food by ensuring that the kids have a balanced, nutritious diet throughout the week  be it at home or in school. Kids can be allowed to indulge in their favourite food items once a week. They need to be taught why junk food is called 'junk' and emphasise on the unhealthy aspects of it. If they start at an early age, it is easier for kids to make correct food choices.""Dietician and sports nutritionist Sakina Patrawala believes banning all junk items from the canteen is not the solution.

593ae8d97be9e00e1ecd4341,Competitive hunger strike in AAP,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170514/jsp/nation/story_151540.jsp,2017-05-14,"New Delhi, May 13: An Aam Aadmi Party lawmaker began a hunger strike this morning after offering prayers at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial, making him the second party MLA to go on a fast in less than a week. Sanjeev Jha's fast, however, is a hunger strike against a hunger strike. The competitive abstention from food unfolded as Jha, an AAP MLA from north Delhi, demanded that sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra provide details of his corruption allegation against party boss and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Mishra - who too is on hunger strike - had claimed that he saw Kejriwal accept Rs 2 crore in cash from a cabinet colleague who is being probed for alleged graft. The suspended MLA, dropped as water minister earlier this month after he spoke out against Kejriwal's criticism of EVMs, has been on hunger strike at his Civil Lines residence for four days now, demanding expenditure details of foreign trips by five senior leaders. Mishra, who the government says was dropped because of complaints of water problems, has even approached the CBI and the Anti-Corruption Branch, alleging corruption by party leaders. Jha today tweeted a letter to Mishra asking him to specify when he visited Kejriwal's house to witness the alleged handover of cash, or say sorry. He also retweeted a letter from an unnamed AAP worker's mother to Mishra's mother Annapurna Mishra, a former BJP mayor of East Delhi, asking her how she could hand over her son to Kejriwal whom her party considered corrupt and anti-national. Jha was detained by police when he tried to sit in hunger strike opposite Mishra's bungalow and taken along with more than 50 party workers and two other MLAs to Sarai Rohilla police station in north Delhi. That prompted a tweet from party spokesperson Preeti Menon: ""@Sanjeev_aap arrested by @DelhiPolice for sitting on a dharna! Need any more evidence that Kapil Mishra's dharna is Centre sponsored."" Jha, who has said he would continue his hunger strike at Jantar Mantar, was later released. He also got some advice from Mishra. ""You are mesmerized by Arvind Kejriwal, like I was.... Drink a lot of water. Take care,"" the former minister said in a letter tweeted to Jha. Mishra also tweeted that police were trying to detain him, saying state government doctors had deliberately reported that his sugar levels were too low and intended to forcefully end his hunger strike. Earlier in the day, Mishra had tweeted an image of Lord Krishna attempting to hurl a chariot-wheel at Bhishma Pitamah in the Mahabharat. He wrote: ""Sir Arvind Kejriwal, I front of our chakravyuh of deceit and lies, I only submit this image."" In the Mahabharat, Krishna breaks his vow of not taking up arms to protect his devotee Arjun from Bhishma. He is stopped by Arjun, whose son Abhimanyu is killed in the chakravyuh formation of rival Kaurava forces. A source close to Mishra said he saw himself as Abhimanyu, being sacrificed in the war against corruption. Letter threat Ashish Khetan, one of the leaders whose travel details Mishra has asked for, has claimed that he received a threat letter allegedly sent by the Sanatan Sanstha - a Goa- and Maharashtra-based outfit being investigated for the murder of rationalists M.M. Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar.# Khetan had received a similar letter last year. Yesterday's letter says: ""Because of journalists like you saints like Sadhvi Pragya Singh (recently acquitted in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case) rotted for years in jail... Bad Hindus like you deserve to be executed, and god willing this will be fulfilled soon."" Khetan was a journalist before he joined the AAP. Khetan today wrote to Union home minister Rajnath Singh, saying: ""The letter sent to me is a chilling reminder of the growing confidence of anti-national and fascist forces who want to exterminate all dissenting voices with violence. The language used in the letter is seemingly similar to many threats that Dabholkar had received immediately before he was brutally killed."" He added: ""I would like to urge you not to treat this as an individual matter. I am writing this on behalf of scores of journalists, activists, artists, writers and ordinary citizens across the country who have been threatened or attacked by the right wing forces. In the ardent hope that the present government will carry out its constitutional duty of protecting liberty and democracy, I am writing you this letter."""
593560c17be9e061b1737537,Grape growers urged to focus on quality,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/grape-growers-urged-to-focus-on-quality/articleshow/58667585.cms,2017-05-14,"NASHIK: Maharashtra Rajya Drkasha Bagayatdar Sangh (MRDBS), an association of grape growers in the state, on Friday urged farmers to focus more on quality grapes than on quantity.It has also requested grape farmers to grow new varieties to tap markets across the globe. Nashik district exported 1.21 lakh tonne of grapes during the 2016-17 grape season (Dec-April), as against 1.08 lakh tonne during the previous grape season in 2015-16.But grape prices declined in European and domestic markets due to rise in supply of grapes as compared to the demand. Ashok Gaikwad , past president of MRDBS, said the new generation of farmers are focusing on producing large quantity and size that creates pressure on plants and affect the quality of grapes.""The sugar developing process is affected in fruit due to greater focus on have large quantity and size. However, the climate was also not good and the plant growth process was delayed by 15 days more due to cold that affected the quality of fruit,"" he added.The quality of grapes was the major reason that led to crash in grape prices. Farmers sold grapes at Rs 10 per kg in domestic market due to inferior quality, while others sold it at Rs 50 per kg at the same time due to good quality.There is need to do proper packaging while exporting it to other countries, stressed Gaikwad. He added ""The quality of the fruit suffers if farmers undertake packaging of 20 kg of grapes. Actually, they should focus on packaging in five-eight kg of grapes.""Vilas Shinde, director of Sahyadri farmer producer group, said, ""This year, there had been excessive supply of grapes in European countries that led to crash in grape prices. Around 90% of grapes produced in the country are of Thomson seedless variety. Hence, farmers need to focus on new colourful grape varieties to capture the grape export market. There is also need to focus on quality grapes.""In 2009-10 grape season, European countries had rejected consignments of grapes from India on the ground of presence of pesticides. They had detected chlormequat chloride component, a plant growth regulator in excess of the prescribed maximum residue level for table grapes. Around 85 grape-growers in the state had incurred losses worth Rs 150 crore as their consignments of grapes were rejected."
593551b37be9e061b1736595,"Maharashtra fails to tailor its farm practices to needs of crops, pays for it with yield far below potential",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-fails-to-tailor-its-farm-practices-to-needs-of-crops-pays-for-it-with-yield-far-below-potential/articleshow/58724663.cms,2017-05-17,"MUMBAI: Agriculture ministry statistics have revealed a poor picture of crop productivity in the state. The reason is that the conditions a crop is grown in are, for the most part, far from optimum for it.Comparative data shows that the average per-hectare yield for major crops is substantially lower than their genetic potential , or the productivity that a crop is programmed for by nature when the conditions are just right for it.Data shows that the difference in productivity between parts of the state that have the highest yield for a particular crop and the ones with the lowest yield is very high, indicating a need to have a re-look at the cropping pattern in the state.Take rice, the genetic potential of which is 4,000 kg per hectare while the state average is 1,867 kg. The highest yield of 3,572 kg is recorded in traditional rice belts like the Konkan but the lowest stands at 641 kg, a yawning gap.Such a high difference in the productivity of a major crop shows that its cultivation in many parts of the state is done in conditions that are not favourable for it.Experts say that the key reasons for the gap between the productivity on the ground and the full potential of a crop are a lack of research-based inputs for farmers, old and redundant practices, absence of innovation, unavailability of assured irrigation facilities, small land holdings and non-adoption of a cropping pattern that is best suited to the geographical parameters of a particular area.The average yield of tur in the state is 695 kg per hectare when the genetic potential is 5,000 kg. Yet, the state remains one of the largest tur producers, enough to cause a glut this year and send prices crashing.The tur phenomenon is an illustration of low-productivity practices employed on a large scale to increase production  a waste of resources  instead of raising yield to achieve the same.Even the water-guzzling sugarcane , which caused a lot of debate during the 2015 drought, suffers from low productivity  though it remains popular as a cash crop with near-assured returns.The state has an average of 7.5 lakh hectares under sugarcane at an average productivity of 830 quintals per hectare against the genetic potential of 3,500 quintals.Experts say low yield is one of the key reasons why most farms are loss-making in the state.""It is unfortunate that research in the agricultural sector in the state has been completely neglected for years now,"" a retired vice-chancellor of an agricultural university said. ""None of the four agriculture universities in the state have a research director. More than 40% seats in these universities are vacant. There is a need to look at the cropping pattern of the state. There are many regions which are wasting time and money in growing crops that will not have much yield there due to geographical and weather-related parameters, but none of the universities give any such research-based inputs to the farmers.""Officials from the agriculture department said they had chalked out a detailed working plan to increase production.""The idea is to reduce the farm input costs by providing subsidies for everything that a farmer needs,"" an official said."

In an attempt to improve the quality of healthcare, the upcoming Maharashtra Paramedical Council Act makes it mandatory for the paramedics to be qualified.15,000 laboratoriesThere are over 15,000 laboratories across the state. Some of them are run by doctors, while many are even run by quacks. Due to this, erroneous medical reports have become very common. Often, doctors have to re-send blood or urine samples for tests. Eventually, the pressure comes on patients, said Dr. Pravin Shingare, head of Directorate of Medical Education and Research.According to Dr. Shingare, the Act is in the final stage and a gazette notification will be issued within next month.Once in place, the Act will require an eight-member council to be formed. Every laboratory will be registered under the council. Also, all technicians will have to be registered under the council after they fulfil the qualification criteria as well.Existing techniciansHowever, a question mark remains over the large number of existing technicians, many of whom are not even graduates. We are devising ways to accommodate all the existing technicians. They will get experience-based licence. For example, an under-qualified lab technician, who is only a Standard X or XI pass may be asked only to assist in testing blood sugar or an X-ray technician will be allowed only to carry out X-rays of certain body and they will be granted licence. We will also offer short-term courses so that some technicians can acquire additional skills, said Dr. Shingare, adding that the new ones will, however, require the three-year bachelors degree to get the licence.The State aims that in the first two years of the council, at least 10,000 paramedics will be registered. Later on, the council will be formed through election. Also, those who do not register their laboratories and paramedics who do not get registered will stand to face three years imprisonment and fine. We will issue timely advertisements about the same, he said.Welcome moveBut many pathologists feel that the government is simply trying to pave the way for technicians to start their own laboratories under the garb of the paramedical Bill. It is a welcome move by the government to regularise paramedical staff. But we feel that the government is simply trying to make way for the technicians to start their own outlets, said Dr. Prasad Kulkarni, executive member of Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists. There are already existing illegal laboratories run by such technicians. How would the government deal with these bogus laboratories? Dr. Shingare, however, allayed the concerns. The paramedical staff are always to assist. They cant ever take the place of a doctor. I dont know what is the fear all about.Who are they?A paramedic is a person trained in providing services ancillary to, or required as assistance in the teaching or practice of modern scientific medicine, ayurvedic system, unani system, and homoeopathic system of medicine.There are 21 paramedic professions identified under the Act including laboratory technicians, radiographic technicians, radiotherapy, cardiology, neurology, blood transfusion, optometry, plaster, anaesthesia, perfusionist, and operation theatre technicians."

BMC may lose Rs 6,000 to 7,000 crore because of octroi getting off the new system, however, the government has decided to compensate the local bodies and protect their independent sources of revenue.During a special session in August 2016, the Maharashtra legislature had ratified the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill. On 6 April, the Parliament passed four GST bills which now have to be cleared by all states.In the 288-member Maharashtra legislative assembly, the BJP has 122 members while Shiv Sena 63. As far as the main opposition parties are concerned, Congress has 42 and NCP 41. The support of the Shiv Sena is essential for the passage of the bills.After the Maharashtra State GST comes into force, the sugarcane purchase tax, Central Sales tax, entry tax on vehicles, entry tax on goods, lottery tax, forest produce tax, betting tax, octroi and local bodies tax will be scrapped."

593df4717be9e00dabcc6d46,Murugappa aims at 20-25% growth,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/murugappa-aims-at-20-25-growth/article18512317.ece,2017-05-20,"The Murugappa Group aims to achieve an overall sales growth of 20-25% during 2017-18 and attain a market capitalisation of $10 billion in a year or two, A. Vellayan, executive chairman at the Chennai-based conglomerate said on Friday.Mr. Vellayan said the groups growth projection was based on a reasonable monsoon, strong rupee and the fact that investors confidence is bouncing back and to Government policies, which is also more Swadeshi.We could see the Governments swadeshi policies implementation have started benefiting various sectors including steel, fertilizer and others. The group has interests in sugar, fertilizers, cycles, engineering, financial services, general insurance, rubber and others.For fiscal 2016-17, the groups turnover rose 2.1% to Rs. 30,023 crore against Rs. 29,395 crore posted a year earlier. Net profit grew from Rs. 1,883 crore to Rs. 2,186 crore. Market capitalisation of the listed/unlisted companies surged by 43% to $8 billion from $5.6 billion in the corresponding period last year.Growth triggersMr. Vellayan said the growth was mainly triggered by Tube Investments, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance and Coromandel International. An appreciating rupee also contributed to the growth.Normally, when we cross 90% of capacity utilisation level, we will start build up for the future, he said. Last year, some of the divisions achieved capacity utilisation of 75% and this year with reasonable monsoon, we might be doing 85-90%. Our investment plan gets triggered when our capacity utilisation goes above 80%. We will come out with investment plan during the second half of 2017-18, he said.On capital expenditure, Mr. Vellayan said: Last year we made an investment of Rs. 396 crore and this year it would be driven mostly by individual companies.Regarding silicon carbide unit in Russia, Mr. Vellayan said they were looking at expanding the capacity. Venezuela and other nations have stopped production due to environmental issues. The weakness of ruble is a quite a positive for us to expand, he said.During 2016-17, Murugappa group reported an export turnover of Rs. 3,400 crore against Rs. 2,700 crore the year earlier. On the retail front, the group will be entering Maharashtra, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The number of retail shops will be increased from 800 to 1,000.N. Srinivasan, director finance, Murugappa Group, said in terms of gross sales Cholamandalam MS General Insurance clocked 28% growth in 2016-17, followed by EID Parry (15%), Chola (11%) and Carborundum Universal (9%), while Coromandel Internationals sales declined by 12%."

Four tax slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% have been fixed for services including telecom, insurance, hotels and restaurants.Expressing disappointment, the hospitality sector said the rates are too complex, high and uncompetitive, and said they will be approaching Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely and Union Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma for a review of the rates. The GST Council announced that non-AC restaurants will charge 12% GST on food, AC restaurants and those with liquor licence 18% per cent, and five star hotels will charge a GST of 28%.Dilip Datwani, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association, Western India (HRAWI) told The Hindu , The government should realise that taxes in neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia range between 5% and 10%. We cannot afford to have this complex and high-rate GST. This is simply not viable. Tourists will simply skip India.Not done, say hoteliersA major hurdle for the hospitality and tourism sector in India is its uncompetitive tax structure, says former HRAWI president Bharat Malkani. A country as small as Singapore gets 10.9 million tourists, while India gets 6.31 million. Nations like Malaysia and Thailand attracted 24.7 million and 19.09 million tourists in 2014 and earned foreign exchange worth $18.3 billion and $26.26 billion respectively. In contrast, India managed only $94 million.Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, senior vice-president, HRAWI said hospitality is not only a high foreign exchange grosser, it is also among the largest tax generators. By the Prime Ministers own declarations, the growth of the nation will parallel the growth of tourism. Its perplexing that the industry is being taxed to death. If GST is not reconsidered, foreign exchange inflow will dry up sooner than later.Hotels and lodges charging per-day tariff of Rs. 1,000 will be exempt from GST, while those charging up to Rs. 2,000 per day will pay 12%. Hotels charging Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 5,000 will pay 18%, and those with per-day tariffs above Rs. 5,000 will be levied GST of 28%.Academicians for GSTGST is the biggest reform this year, says Prof. Neeraj Hatekar, who teaches Economics at the University of Mumbai. He predicts that GST will create a common market for goods and services, reduce the aggregate tax burden as tax on taxes is being done away with. We should not worry about the inflationary impact; its not going to be much. It will increase economic activity in the economy leading to more jobs, more activity and faster growth. Hence, in the long run it will positively affect the common man. All industries should be happy with this reform.Foodgrains and milk are exempt and essential items of mass consumption like edible oil, sugar, tea, life-saving drugs and electricity bills should cost less. However, its too early to predict GSTs overall effect on the common man; at least he will be spared the assault of multiple taxation. says Prof. Geeta Menezes, who teaches Economics at Mithibai College."

The arrests were made on May 19. A magistrate court in Nashiks Satana has remanded them to police custody till May 26. Further investigations are being carried out in the matter, said a senior Excise department official.According to Sunil Chavan, Director, Enforcement and Vigilance, Excise department, an enforcement team had intercepted a Gujarat-bound tanker (MH 26 H 5967) containing 8,000 bulk litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Satana in the early hours of May 19. Chavan said the spirit, which was being smuggled in 32 barrels, had been declared as hydroxide by the transporter, who has also been booked in the matter. The tankers driver, one Sanjay Koli, who is now under arrest, told investigators that the consignment, which was being taken to Surat, had originated from the distillery owned by the Manganga cooperative factory.Acting on this information, a raid was conducted at the distillery on May 19. Chavan said that this revealed the presence of about 20,000 litres of unaccounted for spirit. The entire 28,000 litres spirit found in the matter has been confiscated. Alcohol worth Rs 1.41 crore could be brewed using the confiscated spirit, said department sources. The distillerys in-charge, one Udaysinh Deshmukh, was also arrested.A subsequent raid at the sugar mill found 768 metric tonnes of unaccounted for molasses. The departments FIR has used this as evidence to contend that the mills intention was to divert this stock for the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Despite several attempts to contact Deshmukh, he remained unavailable for comment.Maharashtras Excise Commissioner Ashwini Joshi, when contacted, said, This is a serious matter. Further investigation is being carried out in the matter. We will take strict action against those responsible.The sugar mills vice chairman Bhagwanrao More has denied that the firm was involved in the alleged racket. We have done nothing wrong. The molasses found in the mill had been gained in surplus during the previous years cane production. Since the crushing season got done two months ago, the distillery is shut for operations at the moment.In a similar case last October, the Excise department had revoked the professional licence of a Marathwada-based distillery, owned by sugar baron Ratnakar Gutte, also considered close to the BJP, though this licence was later reinstated in February this year. The Marathwada-based distillery was similarly accused of being involved in an illegal liquor ring. The matter is still pending in the court.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Lamenting that his business has seen a setback in the past 15 years, Raghunanadans son Vijay Kumar said that the same khowa shop used to be crowded when his father was running it.However, the shop will stand firm, he said. Initially, most of the khowa was supplied to these shops from surrounding areas in Hyderabad, he said. In the last 15 years, with a lot of commercial development, milk production at a large scale has come down.Now, most of the khowa supply is from Solapur in Maharashtra and Bengaluru. There are a few new shops here which manage with substandard khowa also. They mostly get supplies from Chittoor district, which is khowa made out of skimmed milk, said Vijay Kumar. Sales have come down by 50 per cent and the sweet khowa that comes from Gujarat, which is white in colour and has sugar mixed in it has become very popular. People are unaware that pure khowa is pale, not white.Lifestyle diseases to blame?Seconding Kumar, some workers from the 40-year-old Babu Bhai klhowa shop said that now the average profit they can earn on the sale of each kg of khowa is eight per cent.Another khowa shop owner said, Manufacturing khowa is not an easy task. In the narrow margin of profit and losses, we can benefit by maximum Rs 16 on the sale of one kg khowa, priced between Rs 200 and Rs 220.Another reason why there has been a sharp decline in the business is because of the rise in lifestyle diseases. A lot of health-conscious people are avoiding high-sugar based sweets, a merchant said.Wont switch businessesThese shops were left to us by our forefathers and they will be preserved at any cost.We sell paneer to make up for the losses we suffer on certain days, a shopkeeper said."
593559967be9e061b1736dd5,"Now, get a health check-up for just ₹1!",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-get-a-health-check-up-for-just-1/articleshow/58750942.cms,2017-05-20,"We've often read how railway accident victims or commuters with medical emergencies succumbed to their injuries on the platform because they didn't receive timely attention due to lack of medical facilities at stations. But that's all about to change now. Railway stations across the city have come up with clinics, which are equipped to deal with all kinds of medical emergencies  be it accidents on the tracks, heart attacks or even heat strokes. What's more, these clinics are charging patients only 1 as consultation charges, giving affordable medical care a whole new meaning!These diagnostic centres, called 1 Clinics, were inaugurated last week at Dadar, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Wadala Road and Mulund stations and are already buzzing with patients. While these are open to emergency cases 24x7, they also have OPDs that are functional for 12 hours a day. In the next few months, 14 more clinics will open at other stations on the Central line.A few years ago, activist Samir Zaveri filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court, claiming there was a lack of prompt medical help for railway accident victims. The court ordered railway authorities to set up Emergency Medical Rooms (EMRs) at all stations in Mumbai . That's when brothers Dr Rahul and Dr Amol Ghule came on board and shared their idea of setting up subsidised clinics with the authorities.But not many know that it was a personal tragedy which became the driving force behind this mission. Dr Rahul shares, ""In 2015, my parents met with an accident on the road and my mother suffered from a severe head injury. Unfortunately, she didn't get immediate medical aid. Today, she is paralysed and bedridden because of the delay in her treatment. Despite being doctors , we couldn't help her. So, we decided to do something to make medical facilities more easily available for Mumbaikars.""Another reason that prompted them to deliver services at minimum costs is the lack of awareness among people when it comes to getting regular health check-ups. ""Most people visit a doctor only if they fall ill or have medical complications. We are trying to change that and these subsidised rates will definitely benefit them,"" says Dr Amol.Irrespective of their social and economic background, anyone can come visit these 1 Clinics. They boast of essential equipment including ECG machines, oxygen cylinders, ambu bags, pulse oximeters, emergency drugs and intubation. Dr Rahul says, ""Railway accidents are one of the major causes of deaths and disabilities in Mumbai. The aim is to provide treatment to accident victims within the golden hour. Once emergency medical aid is given, the patient can be taken to a nearby hospital for further treatment."" The clinics also give up to 25 per cent discount on pathology tests and medicines available in their pharmacies.According to on-duty pharmacist Parthiv Bhatia, it's the OPD section that has been getting a staggering response from the public. ""Though it has been just a week, we already have more than 150 patients a day in one centre alone. While getting your blood pressure checked is absolutely free, other basic tests like blood sugar can be availed at just 25,"" he says.Businessman Rahul Ambavane, who visited the Ghatkopar clinic for a routine health examination, shares, ""I did an ECG test and also checked my blood sugar levels. The minimum cost of an ECG at any hospital in Mumbai is 200 -300 rupees. But I just paid 76 here. Even my family physician charges 200 for consultation alone! I will recommend it to people who want to get a general check-up.""Apart from 14 new clinics on the Central line stations, there are plans of expanding these EMRs to Western Railways in the next two months. Dr Savita Uppud, a gynaecologist at one of the centres, says, ""Currently, we have a staff strength of four doctors, a nurse and a paramedic per dispensary. But seeing the response, we are getting more doctors on board from not only reputed hospitals in Mumbai, but also from cities like Pune. We are also roping in specialists in various fields, who will be available for consultation for a few hours every day.""A paramedic at one of the clinics shares, ""People with diabetes and hypertension have to get regular check-ups, which can be expensive. So, for them, we've started a membership plan. They will also get priority treatment at the centre.""Until May 14 this year, already 1,044 people  112 women and 932 men  have died in accidents on Mumbai locals. According to statistics, 3,202 passengers died and 3,363 were injured on the suburban railway network last year. The Central line recorded the highest number of deaths."
59284e697be9e0137c77cb3a,GST: Impact on key sectors,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612889/gst-impact-key-sectors.html,2017-05-21,"Mahesh Kulkarni May 22 2017, 0:11 ISTFixing rates for six sensitive items will be top priority for the GST Council, which is slated to meet in New Delhi on June 3, just 27 just days beforThe two-day brainstorming session of the GST Council completed its task more or less on May 18 and 19 at Srinagar, with the announcement of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on 1,200 goods and 500 services. The Council has arrived at 18% tax rate as a standard rate on majority of the goods and services. However, there are still some politically sensitive items like bidis, gold, textiles, footwear and agriculture implements, among others, for which the rates will be finalised in the next meet of the GST Council in June. Fixing of rates on lottery service is also yet to be finalised.This leaves the government with a little over 40 days to officially implement the GST effective from July 1, 2017. We are in a state of readiness for July 1 rollout, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting.But before getting into the nuances of the implications for various sectors, there are four broad things that one must understand about the intent of the GST.The core intent of the GST rates was to ensure that the GST implementation is not inflationary, as has been the experience with some other countries. As a result, the GST Council has made an attempt to keep the GST on sensitive food items in the range of 0-5% and transport at 5%.According to Vaibhav Agrawal, Head of Research and ARQ, Angel Broking, GST cannot be purely looked as a tax rate, but one should look at the simplicity that it brings in business and trade. GST makes the entire country as a single homogenous market. Take the case of multiplexes, even though the impost under GST may be higher, the fact that a plethora of state and local levies are getting subsumed, which makes it much simpler.There is an issue of credit on tax paid on inputs, which was not available in many cases in the past. However, under GST, the input credit in such cases will be automatic and seamless. That will reduce the effective rate of GST in most cases, he said.What the GST rates mean for key sectors in India:With the government focus on keeping tax on items of mass consumption low, this sector could be the clear winner. While milk, grain and cereals are exempt from GST; other products like sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will attract just 5% GST. This will benefit companies like Nestle. While personal care items will be taxed at the peak rate of 28%, items of mass consumption like hair oils, soaps and toothpaste will be taxed at 18%. This will be beneficial for companies like Marico, Dabur and Colgate. Overall, the food side of the FMCG business is likely to benefit from the GST.Auto could slightly be a mixed bag as the impost will vary across categories. With the standardisation of GST for automobiles at 28%, two-wheelers and small and medium cars may face a higher impost. While this may be slightly negative for players like Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti, etc, we believe that this will be passed on to consumers, Angel Broking said. Among the commercial vehicles space, Ashok Leyland may see higher GST.The GST Council has put items like refrigerators and ACs in the maximum 28% category. This will lead to a higher impost on these companies, and could impact companies like Voltas and Havells. However, with robust summer demand, they should be able to pass on these costs to the consumer. These companies will also benefit fundamentally as GST will bring more companies under the organised ambit and reduce unfair competition from unorganised players.For cement manufacturers, the peak rate of tax may go up slightly under the GST regime. However, there is an additional benefit for them as the GST on coal and metal ore has been cut to 5%. For cement companies, this will largely offset the higher GST impact. At the same time, steel and power companies that depend heavily on coal will also benefit from the lower GST on coal. JSW and Tata Steel may be the key beneficiaries.These companies may be slightly unhappy that they have been bracketed in the highest category along with gambling and betting activities. That almost looks akin to imposing a Sin Tax on movies. However, multiplexes will benefit from subsuming of a plethora of state and local taxes into one single tax and also from input credits. PVR and Cinemax may find the GST rates neutral at best.Grandfathering of current exemptions for services (including healthcare & education) leaves limited anomaly on the taxability services and the Council has clarified that no additions shall be made to the exemption list, Amit Sarkar, Partner & Head, Indirect Tax, BDO India, said.Unlike the current regime where service tax is imposed at a flat rate of 15% across all services, the GST will have four slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% exactly like the GST on goods. For example, the GST on telecom will be 18%, higher by 3% from current levels. However, the availability of input credit will partially neutralise this impact. However, making transport service GST at 5% will be anti-inflationary. The GST will be just 5% on economy flying, which will help airlines like Spice Jet and IndiGo give a bigger push to the Udaan programme.A rate of 18% for telecom and financial services may appear higher against the current service tax rate of 15%; however, these sectors are likely to derive substantial benefits on the input credit front, given the eligibility of credit on the goods which was not the case under the current regime.Overall positive impact for restaurants having less than Rs 50 lakh turnover, and non-AC restaurants, given that they shall be taxed at 5% and 12%, respectively, with full input tax credit as against the current tax incidence of approximately 19-20% [VAT + ST] for AC restaurants. It is noteworthy that restaurants having less than Rs 50 lakh of turnover may also opt for the composition scheme, subject to the conditions prescribed.With respect to works contract service, though the 12% rate with full input tax credit could be an overall boom for a civil contractor as against the current taxes at 6% (central) and 1-5% (state), it may still lead to potential disputes regarding movability and the applicable rates thereon [works contract vs composite supplies].The impact of GST has been a mixed bag for the Capital Goods and the consumer sector. While the Capital Goods sector would benefit from a lower tax rate on contracts, there would be higher tax incidence on cables and transformers, Motilal Oswal Securities said in its report.A few segments in the consumer sector would see higher effective taxes and need to take price hikes to offset cost pressures from increased taxes. Key changes/surprises vs expectations were for a) Fans, which were expected to come in the 18% bracket, but have been bought at 28% (currently at 24%) and need price hikes, b)Air-conditioners, which have been put in the 28% bracket and would need 2-3% hikes, c) Transformers put in the 28% GST rate vs the current 18% implies price hikes need to be taken, d) Cables, which were earlier in the 18% bracket taken to 28%, and e) Work contract, which is in the 15-20% range (depending on the VAT rate) taken to 12% is a positive for the construction sector (L&T, BHEL).Under the new tax regime, industry stabilisation will take a couple of quarters. However, the benefits of GST on business practices and company strategies will be seen only in the medium term (1-3 years). The extent of business efficiency is estimated to be higher in goods as compared with services. At present, supply chains across major manufacturing industries are strategised, based on tax arbitrage aspect, CRISIL Research said.Seamless tax treatment under GST will eliminate the need of multiple warehouses across states.Broadly, the GST rates are likely to be neutral to positive for the Indian markets overall. Of course, the fine print will give much greater clarity on this subject.Effects:All tax payersWith need for registration and filing of returns in multiple states, compliance costs are likely to go up. Overall tax compliance, too, is expected to go up. This will also impact some of the smaller entities in SME-dominated sectors. Over the longer term, this is likely to lead in consolidation and gain in market share for the organised sectorImpact on manufacturing statesThe destination-based taxation structure of GST implies that states with manufacturing bases will potentially lose revenue which will be compensated by the central government  about Rs. 500 b in the first year. The key states that will require compensation are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana. Proceeds from the additional cess on sin goods/ luxury items will constitute the pool from which the states would be compensated for any revenue loss.Existing companies which have signed MoUs with statesSeveral states have, in the past, offered tax incentives to companies for setting up manufacturing units. Dilution of the power of states to levy independent taxes/offer exemptions under GST regime, will impact existing projects too. State governments and impacted companies will need to find out solutions. However, at present there is lack of clarity on this issue.Revenue authoritiesTax monitoring will become easier on account of the robust GST network platform where all returns can be accessed instantly and in a user-friendly manner. This will help revenue officials monitor the sequence of supply of goods and services as well as flow of input tax credit.Financial institutesGST will increase working capital requirements across major manufacturing sectors on account of tax liability on inter-state stock transfer. Accordingly, businesses will not be able to claim their tax credits until the shipped goods are sold. To reiterate, stock-transfers in the current regime does not attract any tax even during an interstate transfer."

There are many visitors today, Mohammed Sajid Khan, a 56-year-old mahout at Mumbais Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan popularly known as the Byculla zoo, told HT. The veterinary officer in the zoo calls Khan the father and mother to elephants Laxmi and Anarkali, who are the oldest in the zoo.Mohammed Sajid Khan with elephants Laxmi and Anarkali inside Byculla zoo in Mumbai on Friday. (Pratik Chorge/HT)Khan gets worried like a parent if he is not around the two for a long time. He has been working in the zoo for the last three decades taking after his father Mohammad Shakir Khan who in-turn took the job from his father Mohammad Yusuf Khan. At the fag end of his career with just two more years before he retires, senior civic officials say that it is most likely that Sajid Khans 16-year-old son, Saif would take up the job after him.Zoo elephants listen to their mahouts only and doctors say they get so attached to them that they like to be bathed, fed and taken care of only by the mahout.Of the two, Laxmi, 56, is also infamous for her temperament as she keeps most of the staff, except Khan, at bay. Dr Devanand Shirshat, veterinary officer at the zoo, said, Even when I go near her to treat her, Sajid needs to be with me owing to her temperament. With Sajids family staying in the zoo and being familiar with the surroundings, it is only natural that his son will take up the job.Bath time for the elephants at Byculla zoo is fun, thanks to Sajid. (Pratik Chorge/HT Photo)Like Khan, 50% of the employees working in the zoo have been there since generations. Zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi has also put up a proposal in the corporation to consider the family members as the first option when a staff-member retires. Tripathi said, Today, be it the hyena, the birds, the deer or the elephants, they are being taken care of people who have always been around them.Remembering his fathers work at the zoo, Khan said, When I was working as a labourer at the zoo, my father used to be ruthless with me if I didnt do my work properly. I still remember when he got Laxmi from Bihar in 1990. I never went near the elephant enclosure, but had to take up the job after he retired.Khans day starts with visiting the elephants. He touches at the base of their ears every day to check for fever. He also senses their mood, before bathing or feeding them. They are like us. They can be happy, sad or angry on any day, Khan said.The elephants affection for their mahout is clear. (Pratik Chorge/HT Photo)Their breakfast after a nice bath includes 20 kilos of soaked grains with flour for each of them. In the afternoon, they feast on half a kilo of sugarcane as visitors throng to click pictures. The popularity of the newly-opened Humboldt penguin enclosure has also increased the number of visitors to the British-era zoo.Officials say that Khan does not frequently take leaves, fearing for the elephants well being. I dont want their routine to get disturbed. They are everything to me, says Khan while adding, My family will always be grateful to these animals as they are the means to our survival. If the corporation gives the job to my son, I will be more than happy."

Mr. Khot had shared the dais with Mr. Shetti in Kolhapur district when the latter announced the launch of his mega-rally in the first week of the month.While Mr. Shettis party is a minor BJP constituent in the State, there has not been much love lost lately between the two, especially after the recently concluded civic polls. Mr. Shetti, known as a famers leader commenced on his much-touted nine-day Atmaklesh Yatra (introspection rally) and is planning to walk from Pune to Mumbai on foot to express his solidarity with the debt-ridden farmers of Maharashtra. The march will end at Mumbai on May 30, following which Mr. Shetti will meet the Governor and present his demand seeking complete waiver of farmers loans.Mr. Khot, second only to Mr. Shetti in the Swabhimani Paksha, is his partys only representative in the Devendra Fadnavis-led cabinet.Relations between Mr. Shetti and Mr. Khot had become severely strained following the recent Kolhapur Zilla Parishad elections. Mr. Khot was said to be disgruntled after Mr. Shetti, who heads the party, objected to giving his son, Sagar Khot, a nomination to contest the polls. Mentored by the late stalwart agrarian activist Sharad Joshi, Mr. Shetti broke off from the Shetkari Sanghatna to found the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, whose political wing, the Swabhimani Paksha, was formed in 2004. His traditional antipathy to the sugar barons of the Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) made Mr. Shetti join forces with the BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. However, relations between big brother BJP and Mr. Shetti has progressively deteriorated since then."

ICICI organised the event in Mumbai on May 18 by inviting innovators and startups to submit their ideas for next generation mobile applications for the financial sector with the help of custom sets of Application Programme Interface (API) provided by ICICI.Senior officers in the banking sector and financial experts wetted more than 1,000 proposals from different parts of the country and selected 10 proposals to develop their project ideas into working prototypes and demonstrate it at the finale in Mumbai on May 18. Mr. Das said that Lyfas is an easy health diagnosis platform and the mobile portable ECG device, also developed by the trio, indigenously allows automatic scanning and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, like myocardial infarction, partial epilepsy, arterial flutter, arterial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and other complications.

593adbd87be9e07a5a19f5fd,"Activists: Don’t join SUN, a nutrition drive",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/activists-dont-join-sun-a-nutrition-drive/articleshow/58816008.cms,2017-05-24,"Civil society groups have cautioned the central government about fresh efforts to persuade India to join the international movement called Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN), whose stated mission is to help countries fight malnutrition.Several paediatricians, nutritionists and public health activists wrote to the Niti Aayog stating that SUN, ""while claiming to support governments in taking the lead in policy setting, in reality, facilitated the entry of businesses into the policy space"". Even as SUN's efforts to persuade India to join it have not been very successful, Maharashtra joined the movement in 2014 and Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand in 2016. SUN coordinator Gera Verburg of Netherlands is expected to meet Niti Aayog officials this week.Many countries that did not join the SUN network have raised the issue of conflict of interest in the SUN Business Network (SBN), which includes multinational food corporations like Pepsi, Cargill , Nutriset, Britannia , Unilever, Edesia, General Mills, Glaxo SKB, Mars, Indofood, Nutrifood, DSM and Valid Nutrition. In a document detailing the reasons for not joining networks like SUN, officials from a Brazilian government agency said that international initiatives on fighting malnutrition ought to forbid ""the participation of the business sector in the decision-making process and the management and implementation of both international and national strategies and policies"".They pointed out that ""such participation creates conflicts of interests and favours market-guided measures that ultimately result in the increase of food insecurity,"" and added that it goes against the concept of food sovereignty. Of the 58 countries in the SUN network, over 40 are from Africa . Though SUN -- started in 2010 -- claims to be a global movement, it has only aided recipient countries. The letter to Niti Aayog stated: ""We cannot see how the Government of India - or any other government claiming to uphold democratic principles - can allow themselves to be accountable to transnational corporations or philanthropic foundations rather than their citizens. Nor can we see how effective nutrition and public health policies can be adopted if consensus must first be reached with transnational food corporations.""The SUN approach, the letter argued, results in members sidelining sustainable strategies for prevention of malnutrition that NGOs focus on and instead promotes ready to use foods as a solution. Activists warned the agenda was to get India to sign up as it would add to SUN's profile to get India into its network, but this would bring little for India while facilitating business for multinational food corporations selling processed foods, especially those with high sugar, salt and fat content. Research in India has shown that commercially produced fortified, energy-dense food is not effective in treating children suffering from severe acute malnutrition."

(HT)Open wells in villages near forests are a hazard to wildlife. Around 1,500 animals, including leopards, jackals, civets, jungle cats, wolves and hyenas, have reportedly died after accidentally falling into open wells across the state over the last decade.Forest officers said that the well was located on a private property bordering a sugarcane field. We dispatched a team of officers to assess the situation. It is clear that the leopard was hiding in the sugarcane field and was looking for food. She was pregnant, said Sachin Ragatwan, range forest officer of the forest division.The trap cage used to rescue the animal. (Wildlife SOS)A three member rescue team led by Wildlife SOS senior veterinarian Dr Ajay Deshmukh from the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre and forest department officials rushed to the location soon after the distress call. The team tried to rescue the animal using a motor pump pipe and a trap cage.The motor pump pipe was lowered into the well to help the leopard stay afloat and while a trap cage was lowered so that she could safely climb into it, said Deshmukh adding, We managed to rescue her from the situation. However, we did not expect what happened next.A veterinary examination conducted by the team revealed that the leopard was pregnant but was under severe trauma due to the incident. The leopard had injured herself while trying to stay afloat, which led to extensive internal bleeding. Despite our best efforts, she passed away, said Deshmukh.Why so many cases?Buffer areas around forests, which mark the transition between forest areas and human habitation, are dotted with uncovered wells. Animals competing over the decreasing prey base, territory and water sources, are forced to venture out into human settlements, which puts them at risk of falling into uncovered wells.Several instances of leopards falling into wells have been reported over the last few years in Maharashtra and several others in states like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam. Such cases have been increasing in the recent years and the main reason behind this appears to be the lack of proper covers and fencing around these wells, said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder, Wildlife SOS.Some cases of leopards falling into wellsAugust 4, 2016  A seven-year-old leopard was rescued from 60-foot deep well at Pimpalgaon Siddhanath village located in Junnar division. Locals heard loud, panicking noises from the well and informed forest officers that rescued the big cat.March 10, 2016  Forest officers and local NGOs rescued five-year old female leopard from a 30-foot-deep well at Savidhane village, Junnar. The leopard fell when she saw her reflection in the water. In a five hour long rescue operation, forest officials used a trap cage to pull the leopard out.October 28, 2015 - A two-and-a-half-year-old female leopard was rescued in a three-and-a-half hour operation from within a 50-feet deep well in Parner Taluka, Ahmednagar district. The leopard had fallen into two separate wells while being rescued by forest officers."

Hotels, and homestays in Kasol, Malana, Rasol, Tosh, Manikaran, and many other villages of the valley are almost fully occupied. Foreigners from Israel , France, UK, US, and other countries are camping here. Domestic tourists from all states of the country  especially from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and Mumbai  have thronged the valley. While a few tourists come here for sight-seeing and trekking, others come to enjoy parties and drugs.Kullu police have laid several nakas in the valley and are frequently checking vehicles and pedestrians. Recently this week, three foreigners from Switzerland, Turkey, and Sri Lanka, were arrested by the police on charges of possession of contraband LSD and methedrine . Sources said some people were organizing late night parties. Drug peddlers have also become active in the region.Sources said the peddlers sell small quantity of local charas to tourists at high prices. Also, non-native drugs like LSD, heroin, cocaine, and brown sugar are available here. As late night parties in open spaces where drugs and alcohol are served with loud music are completely banned here, some people are taking a risk to organize parties in forest areas for the sake of good profit. One such illegal party was busted by the police a few days ago, and its organizers  a Swiss national and a tourist from Delhi  were arrested by the police.According to Kullu superintendent of police Padam Chand, additional police force has been deployed in all tourist destinations of the district. ""Nakas are being laid. Traffic patrolling has increased. We have arrested three foreigners under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act in two days. We are handling the drug carriers strictly,"" he said."

At the second edition of World on a Plate, the weekend carnival of food, drinks and conversations organised by Goldrush Entertainment (with The Hindu , MetroPlus Food as media partner), theres plenty for the sweet tooth. After all, the participating ptissiers have proved their mettle with edible installations (like a coral bed made with 1,300 kg of sugar and chocolate for the Singapore Art Museum) and croquembouche towers. This year, CEO Kiran Soans is taking the show to Bengaluru and Mumbai, where its five guests of honour  chefs Gary Mehigan and Ranveer Brar, ptissiers Adriano Zumbo and Janice Wong, and 2016 MasterChef Australia winner Elena Duggan  have a big fan following. There will be master classes, chef interactions, and top restaurants showcasing their food, says Soans, adding that they will also be introducing the Ptissier of the Year award. While last years dbut was successful (over 10,000 footfalls), he says this outing will see better crowd control and a seamless coupon system. We get the chefs to tell us what to expect.June 4 at the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Center Hotel, Powai. Rs. 599 to Rs. 15,000 on in.bookmyshow.com. Details: worldonaplate.in."
593e00d07be9e00dabcc778a,A toast to the local and ordinary,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-toast-to-the-local-and-ordinary/article18663572.ece,2017-05-31,"The words, East Village Style sit directly below the Toast and Tonic logo. Drawing on New York Citys grungy, DIY localeMumbais first Toast and Tonic takes design inspiration and serves up food that is inspired by the Manhattan area that stretches from Houston to 14th Street, and counts, Alphabet City and Tompkins Square Park among its markers. The inspiration makes sense, after all Manu Chandra started his career living and working in New York at restaurants like Le Bernardin and Gramercy Tavern.In it philosophy and food, Toast and Tonic successfully marries its specific inspiration with Indian produce and local twists, as frequent visitors to Bengaluru already know. There, the restaurant has been pleasing palettes, with its local, everything made in-house philosophy.For its extensive alcohol menu, that means that the restaurant is making its shrubs (a fruit-flavoured vinegar that is sometimes sweetened with sugar) and tonics. Where the restaurant excels is in its selection of gin and tonics each subtle and refreshing especially in the summer heat. The shrubs take the edge of the quinines metallic tang, and bring new depth to a classic cocktail. Also on offer are twists to various cocktails (like the Bacon Old Fashioned and Royal Bengal Mojito) and new concoctions (for example the Betty Rose, which is made with vodka, fennel, pomegranate, rose petal and lime juice).Toast and Tonic works as a showcase of Chandras chops, marrying his technique and skill for a menu that successfully straddles American small plates with the current push to celebrating indigenous foods and local producers, with a menu that lists everything from gondhraj (as an ingredient in the dressing in the kodo, foxtail, pearl and sorghum in a guava gondhraj dressing), to ricotta (made in-house), and fresh Andouille sausage (made by the kitchen team in their spacious Bengaluru digs). The cheese plate lists variants from three different Indian states while the food does a great job of taking local millets and overlooked grains and updating them for todays eaters. Its all aimed at consumers who seek out global small plates in an often-minimalist setting.The interiors, for those who have travelled or lived in New York, bring together some of the citys beloved design shorthand in a space that is inviting yet raw. Taking inspiration from the tin ceiling tiles that create ornate, repetitive patterns on the ceilings of bars and restaurants across much of Manhattan below 14th street, Toast and Tonics white tiles do that same. The walls covered in pressed wood, give the eatery an unfinished feel, reminiscent of the many layers that one finds on peeling walls and graffiti-ed bathrooms in the Big Apples dives and bars.It must be said that the menu, which takes its inspiration from the melting pot of cuisines that has made New York into a city that serves up all kinds of foods, manages to be neither disjointed nor overwhelming. The food at Toast and Tonic sees soft shell crab in a Singapore style sauce sitting alongside spaghetti caccio e pepe and Naga chilli chicken wings.This melting pot approach though, could do with some editing, as the breadth of the menu sometimes overwhelms. The pressed wood interiors too, are unfortunately a design-led approximation of the layered, often uncared for interiors, in some ofNew Yorks East Village, or really, any dive.Ultimately, the restaurant is a great distillation that a chef can take his inspiration and successfully translate into a vision that satisfies customers, manages to encourage local artisanal and speciality food producers and serves up some mean cocktailsall without compromise.

(CNNL) for performing homa at the Talacauvery, the birth place of river Cauvery, seeking good monsoon after a three-year drought.While officials insist that it is a common practice to offer puja at reservoirs and the place of origin of rivers, the criticism has now forced the States Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil, on Friday, to state that he would go ahead with the puja with his own money and not take funds from CNNL.Responding to the controversy, Mr. Patil said he was hurt by criticism over the allocation of funds for the puja. He said such rituals were not unusual as all governments have offered puja when the dams were full. He clarified that the cost of the ritual may not cross Rs. 1 lakh.On Friday, Mr. Patil visited Mahabaleshwara, the hilly region in the neighbouring Maharashtra where river Krishna takes its origin, to offer puja along with his wife and senior officials of the Water Resources Department.Interestingly, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, known for his rational outlook, tried to wriggle out of the row by stating that he was unaware of any plans to conduct homa and that the government had no role in such rituals.But Mr. Siddarmaiah is the chairperson of the CNNL and hence funds could not have been earmarked without his approval.Earlier, the decision to earmark funds in the CNNLs budget for performing a homa at Talacauvery was opposed by some of the farmers leaders from the Cauvery region itself.Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association president Kuruburu Shanthakumar argued that it was strange on part of the government or the CNNL to conduct a homa now as they had allegedly prevented farmers from offering puja to Kabini, a prominent tributary of Cauvery, in 2015."

It is as much about eating as it is about fasting. Sehri (a pre-dawn meal) and iftar (an evening meal to break the fast) are the two meals every day during this holy month when Muslim families across India relish delicacies, some of which are especially made during Ramzan.The idea of the sehri meal is to eat food that is high in protein, is easily digestible and does not leave you thirsty for the rest of the day. Khajla (a kind of pancake) and pheni (a vermicelli dish) are integral to this meal in North India. Bakeries in Muslim localities make special breads during Ramzan, to be eaten with milk for sehri. Big bowls containing salan (non-veg curry) with pieces of chapatti mixed in it are part of the pre-dawn meal of Muslim families in Delhi and Lucknow.The iftar meal is the one to which believers look forward; preparing which women in the families spend their afternoons. Except dates which find a mention in Islamic history (it is believed that prophet Mohammad used to break his fast with dates) and are common in iftar meals across the world, rest of the delicacies eaten for sehri and iftar are influenced by a given region or states history, culture and cuisine (read the accompanying stories).Fruits and smoothies such as Baebri Boel (a popular drink in Kashmir) are consumed primarily for their nutritional value while snacks such asunnakaya (Kerala), haleem (Hyderabad) and bhajiya (Kolkata) reflect the Indian fondness for all things spicy.HYDERABAD: HALEEMHaleem is much in demand in Hyderabad in the month of Ramzan. (HT Photo.)The one festival that Hyderabadis across faiths wait for is Ramzan. This is the only time when they get an opportunity to relish their favourite local food item  Haleem.Haleem, made of meat, wheat, dry fruits and spices, is now incredibly popular because Hyderabad haleem, was given the Geographical Indication certification in August 2010.After fasting throughout the day, Muslim families look forward to having haleem for dinner.Hyderabadi haleem is made of meat  preferably that of goat or sheep and pounded wheat (not exactly atta) The two are then cooked together in pure ghee.The meat and wheat mixture along with spices are cooked in a bhatti (a cauldron made of iron and inserted in a kiln made of brick and mud) on a low flame, with cooks stirring the mixture continuously using wooden paddles or sticks for 10-12 hours.It is garnished with fried onion, coriander and slices of lemon. Occasionally, boiled eggs are also served with haleem.It is believed that haleem originated in Iran, but became popular in Hyderabad during the reign of the Asaf Jahis or Nizams in the 18th century. Since then, it has gained prominence in the Deccan.According to Ifteqar, a steward at a popular Irani restaurant at Mehdipatnam, haleem is not only tasty, but also highly nutritious. It has carbohydrates in the form of wheat, proteins in the form of meat besides spices, which are good sources of minerals and vitamins. At the same time, it is very soft on the stomach because of prolonged cooking, he said. For vegetarians, there is vegetarian Haleem. The ingredients and recipe remain the same minus meat.

(HT Photo.)Visit any corner of Kerala during the holy month of Ramzan and you will be struck by the mouth-watering aroma of spices, ghee and coconut oil that wafts through the air. Unnakaya  a sweet dish made of banana and grated coconut  is a part of Keralas iftar platter. Some prefer having the rich sweet as a dessert after the main course, which usually comprises biryani, a dish of rice and slow-cooked meat.Banana, the main ingredient in this delicacy, is a good source of vitamin C and potassium. It helps the body fight infectious agents; controls heart rate and blood pressure; and coconut is high in dietary fibre and improves digestion. Unnakaya is more popular in northern Kerala than other parts of the state.Depending on the availability of time and ingredients, some people prepare fresh Unnakaya minutes before sunset, the time at which Muslims break their fast. Those who cannot, especially office-goers, are often buy it from eateries.Recipe:Steam the banana in a pressure cooker with the peel. Remove the peel after steaming.Heat a pan. Add a little sugar to water and boil it. Add grated coconut and stir. Add cardamom, raisin and stir. Set aside.Grate the steamed banana. Once it becomes a paste, shape the paste into small balls. Smear your palm with coconut oil and stuff the coconut-sugar mix into the balls, wrapping banana paste around the filling. Keep wrapping and shapinfg until you are left with the shape of a spindle.Put oil in a pan and heat it. Fry the spindle-shaped banana fillings. Once it turns golden brown, its ready to be served.

(Mujeeb Faruqui/HT Photo)Nukti Khaare, a Ramzan dish that is common across Bhopal, is, in fact, a combination of three snacks: Nukti, a yellow sweet made of gram flour; anardaana, made of slit black gram; and khaarey, which is essentially, sev, crunchy noodles made from chickpea flour paste.While the yellow nukti, also known as nukti daana is found in northern India, the addition of anardaana is unique to Bhopal.The Nukti is typically eaten with Khaare or sev, which is salty.Nukti and khaare are sold separately. They are mixed together before eating. The result, a sweet and salty snack, is a staple iftar dish in many families. (By Punya Priya Mitra)"
5a05d5159855b76bf13c12c7,When a peasant revolts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/when-a-peasant-revolts/article18716297.ece,2017-06-04,"It didnt last long enough to turn public attention away from more weighty matters like cattle trade and peacock tears, but nevertheless, the two-day strike by farmers in Maharashtra ought to have politicians and policymakers worried everywhere. That is because when the Indian farmer decides to take collective action, there is really no way to counter it.Chaudhary Charan Singh demonstrated this way back in 1978. His kisan rally remains the largest gathering witnessed in Delhis Boat Club lawns to date. It was an awesome display of political power which propelled him  howsoever briefly  into the Prime Ministers office.Mahendra Singh Tikait demonstrated it again a decade later at the same venue. Half a million farmers squatting on the lawns off Rajpath soon brought the Rajiv Gandhi government to its knees, which accepted Tikaits long charter of demands, ranging from higher price for sugar cane to waiving of electricity dues.More recently, the Jats of Haryana once again demonstrated the might of farmer power, seeking Backward Class status  and associated reservations in jobs and education  for themselves by coming out into the streets.So, it is hardly surprising that the Devendra Fadnavis government had to cave in, in a span of just two days. With fruit and vegetable prices soaring 50% and faced with an imminent milk shortage, the Fadnavis administration bought peace by agreeing to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers  nearly 80% of the States 13.7 million-strong farmer population  as well as waiving interest and penalty on pending power bills.The government also agreed to hike the procurement price of milk  though perhaps not to the Rs. 50 per litre farmers demanded  and promised to bring in legislation to make procurement of agricultural produce at prices below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) a criminal offence. It also agreed to set up a State-level commission on agricultural costs and prices.Of course, the ruling party has accused middlemen of machinations to jack up prices (quite true) as well as the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party of political shenanigans (also quite true), but that shouldnt distract us from the real takeaways from this episode.The first one is this: when the Indian farmer is roused enough to march on the streets, it is almost impossible for any government to counter it. That is what 65% of the population means. Faced with large-scale farmer protests, Rajiv Gandhis Congress caved; the Janata Party caved; the UPA caved and, now, the BJP has caved in  in Haryana and Maharashtra.The second is this: unless the powers that be stop merely paying lip service to agrarian distress and actually double down efforts to find meaningful solutions, we are looking at potentially much larger, much more impactful uprisings in times to come.A distorted subsidy regimeIt is paradoxical that agrarian distress has risen even as agricultural output has grown. There are many reasons for this. At the core is a distorted subsidy regime which has pushed cereals in favour of oilseeds and pulses, and water or input-intensive cash crops like sugar cane or cotton in areas which are agro-climatically not suited for them. On the other hand, with rising incomes, education levels and prosperity, the nature of food demand has also changed. Indias per capita cereal demand, as Credit Suisses Neelkanth Mishra pointed out in a recent article, has been declining by 1% a year for the last 30 years. This means that domestic demand for cereals isnt growing any more  while output, even in bad monsoon years, has risen.Farmers continue to grow cereals, tempted by rising MSPs. Procurement, faced with growing grain mountains and tightening of subsidies, has reduced, except in traditionally strong agri-markets like Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.This forces distress sales at below MSPs, as was also seen in the case of toor dal this year. Last years record price surge forced the government to announce higher MSPs and incentives. However, an immediate and overwhelming response from the farmers found it unable to actually procure at the promised support price, leading to distress sales, and a continuing cycle of rising agricultural debt and unpaid bills.In Maharashtra, for instance, one of the subsidiary demands was to stop harassment by microfinance companies, which leads me think that another Andhra Pradesh-type crisis may well be brewing there.This in turn triggers demands for loan waivers and other write-offs. Yogi Adityanath set the ball rolling with a loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh  now the demand is spreading. Tamil Nadu farmers, despite a high-profile demonstration in Delhi and a half-hearted strike, have not managed to get one yet, but that is only because they havent yet found a forum  or a leader  they can rally behind. If Tamil Nadu finds a Tikait, the tale would unfold quite differently.The point is, given the manifest shortcomings in execution capability, and the limits on capacity, state intervention  of the type which Fadnavis and the Yogi have preferred  can never really solve the problem. There isnt enough capacity and there isnt enough money.What needs to be done instead is to find holistic solutions  actual, rather than theoretical access to credit, lifting of market access controls, better rural infrastructure, affordable and reliable power supply and a crackdown on middlemen. Otherwise, it may not be milk that flows down the streets the next time around."

People from as far as Muscat, Mumbai and Hyderabad have offered to give monetary assistance to Rampal to enable him to pursue his studies.An investment banker, Rajiv Pachat who is based in Muscat, Oman, contacted TOI after reading the report. ""I want to know how I can help Rampal with his studies in any way,"" said he.Similarly, Rachna Sethi , a homemaker in Mumbai, said, ""I want to take care of his school fees or books. I want him to study hard and do well in class XI and XII. Once he performs well in the intermediate exams, he will get admission in a good college.""She added, ""When Rampal takes admission in some school for class XI, I will contact his school officials for financial assistance. As I have relatives in Lucknow, I may visit Bareilly in future to meet him.""Moved by Rampal's story, a reader from Hyderabad, Nanda Kumar, wrote to TOI, ""It is our duty to encourage such bright students and I am ready to help him in his further studies.""When TOI informed Rampal that many people have shown willingness to give financial aid to support his education, the happy teenager said, ""I only want people to help me in paying my school fee and for purchasing textbooks. As I want to become a doctor, it will be best for me if someone supports my coaching for MBBS entrance exam. I am planning to take coaching after getting promoted to class XII.""Son of a poor farmer, Rampal's father Bhagwan Das earns about Rs 2,000 a month, toiling in the fields of Pilibhit. But this never deterred his father, a school dropout, from aspiring for proper education for his three children, who he sent to Bareilly and enrolled them in good private schools.In an earlier interview, Rampal had credited his father for his success and said, ""My father borrows money at 5% interest to pay for our schooling and pays back the loan after harvesting the sugarcane crop. However, this time, we are yet to pay the fees of Class X. As I am good in studies, the school officials allowed me to write the exams.""My father somehow managed to get an electricity connection in the room. However, I had to study in candlelight during the long power cuts in the area. As I could not afford to use more than one candle a day, after it got over, I would go to a neighbour's house to study,"" said Rampal. Unable to buy books, Rampal borrowed NCERT books from his seniors but could not arrange for expensive books and test papers that his peers had."

The founder of EnviGreen Biotech India Ltd , Bengaluru, who nurtures the dream of a plastic-free India, is set to launch biodegradable EnviGreen (EG) bags this month. TOI caught up with Hegde to learn more about his anti-plastic mission. Excepts:In 2012, the Mangaluru City Corporation banned the use of plastic. While it was an excellent move, people were not prepared for it. We started a campaign - I Love Mangaluru -and a lot of companies joined us. But fishermen and kirana store owners told us how difficult it was to sell cloth bags at Rs 15 each.After speak ing to a few biotechnol ogy scien tists, I real ized it was possible to invent 100% biodegradable products but research and development (R&D) would be costly. After a four-year struggle, we came up with EnviGreen Biotech India Ltd.We started collecting raw materials available in India, like natural starch from tapioca, potato, banana peels and sugarcane. We have three products -EG Centum are biodegradable garbage bags, EG bags are meant for shopping and EG packaging bags for wrapping food products. These are all compostable plastics. We are setting up a factory with a 1000-metric tonne capacity and creating employment opportunities for over 200 people. We hope to expand operations to Mumbai.A team of agents helps us pro cure starch from India and southeast Asian countries.I always wanted to be a lawyer and not an entrepreneur. But unfortunately in 2010, I met with an accident and was told to rest for six months -I suffered a head injury and had a rod in my left arm. That was a turning point in my life. I realized I had to do something big.I dropped out of college, wrote exams through distance learning and founded Areka Artefacts to export cutlery made of betel leaves. At present, I am pursuing international marketing studies at Cambridge Marketing College, UK. It's an online course and in a couple of months, I'll be going to Dubai on an internship.Increasing our global presence is not easy. When the UN in vited us to Shanghai, it was a three-month process. They sent our samples to China, confirmed they were 100% biodegradable and organic and only then approved our visit. The Changemakers' summit was an amazing platform and the theme was zerowaste. I spoke about a plasticfree world, incorporating my EnviGreen experience and cutlery-manufacturing business. I got an overwhelming response from Chinese industrialists who are willing to invest in the business.During our initial research, we came across compostable plastics, which were being promoted by some companies. However, on probing further, I realized making 100% corn starch-based bags would not be feasible. To reduce the cost, companies were adding substances like tar, calcium carbonate and other hazardous materials, and selling them as environment-friendly bags.Our products can burn like paper, dissolve in water and degrade when they come in contact with soil. That's because they contain no additives and are 100% biodegradable. Initially, due to the cost factor, it was difficult to sell our product in India.In Qatar, we launched a campaign with the environment ministry -Go Green Qatar. It saw the participation of 13 ambassadors from countries like Italy, Palestine, India, Saudi Arabia and UAE among others. The initiative was a success and we met former environment minister Prakash Javadekar, who inspired me to come back to India and set up a brand in consonance with the Swachh Bharat and Make In India initiatives. It was with his motivation that we launched the company in August 2016."

While the scheme graded 23 industries in the state as the most polluting ones (one or two stars), it awarded the least polluting status (four and five stars) to 47 industries.Those industries that breached the prescribed limit for PM emissions from the smoke stacks, which is 150 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/Nm3), were given one, two and three-star rating. Those that did not fell under the four and five star categories.The rating scheme launched on Monday awarded three stars to just 9 industries. At present, the programme includes 79 industries across eight sectors  chemical, pharmaceutical, power, cement, sugar and distilleries, metal work, textile and paper  with at least four recent stack samples.The five-star rating programme is an initiative by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board with researchers from the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Yale University and Evidence for Policy Design at Harvard University.Maharashtra has more than 75,000 industries, with 12,500 emitting high pollution levels. The programme has the potential to reduce pollution by leveraging information already being collected by regulators and providing it to both industry and the public, said Anant Sudarshan, director, EPIC-India.The Maharashtra Star Rating Programme provides access to data from approximately 20,000 industrial stack samples.

A nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had milked thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects, revealed sources. NCP leaders who had controlled the department came under the scanner.Sources said the ED was looking into irrigation contracts that had been given to a Pune-based firm, Raj Group, during Pawars tenure as water resources minister. This is the only case in which Pawar can be accused of having directly benefited through his connection to the firm, which bagged irrigation contracts worth Rs803 to Rs1,000 crore.HT had broken the story of Pawars links to this firm through personal and business connections in July 2015.Here are five reasons why former deputy chief minister and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars nephew could land in trouble if ED pursues this case :1. Jagdish Kadam and Ram Nimbalkar are directors of the Pune-based Raj group. Kadam is Ajits cousin, while Nimbalkar is one of his close associates. The firm bagged irrigation contracts for at least 11 projects, collectively worth Rs1,000 crore. Two of these projects are in Vidarbha, one in Marathwada and ten in western Maharashtra. These contracts were allotted when Pawar was water resources minister.2. Kadam and Nimbalkar were also directors in a few of the 60 companies associated with Pawar that had interests in infrastructure, realty, wind and hydro power, sugar factories, distilleries and automobiles.The two were the joint directors of 15 such companies. Pawar was the director of five such companies until 2009. His wife, Sunetra, was the director of 20 of these companies until 2014. She and Kadam were joint directors in seven such firms. Nimbalkar and she were joint directors in one firm.3. Raj group bagged projects by floating different entities, including Raj Infrastructure Development Corporation, Raj Promoters and Civil Engineers Private Limited, Raj Construction. The firm violated the norm that a single company cannot win more than three contracts in any region. In the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC), the group got five projects under different names, including one joint venture.4. The costs of a majority of projects bagged by the group rose by 4.83% to 41%. All the cost escalations were cleared by Pawar as the then minister. These controversial projects include Kuntephal, Dhom Balkawadi canals, Umraodi and Karanjao project5. The Kuntephal lift irrigation project worth Rs209 crore, part of the larger Krishna-Marathwada project was seriously flawed. A special investigation team that probed the project had sought action against the officials who cleared it. Documents show that the work order for the project was given without getting an administrative order, violating the governors directives. Project officials did not seek the mandated green nod from the Union environment ministry either."

Investigations are now expected to spread across state as agencies expect similar leakages in other districts.According to officials there is an entry tax of 0.25% on sugar that comes from the states like UP, Maharashtra, Gujarat and MP. However, in the investigation, it was observed that some of the dealers did not register while some others, though registered, were not paying tax.Sugar being an essential commodity is exempted from VAT. However, traders dealing in this commodity are required to pay 0.25% of entry tax when purchased from outside Rajasthan Sources claim that sugar of about Rs 1,263 crore was purchased by the dealers in Surajpole Mandi at Jaipur over the period of five years. However, nearly 150 dealers were found to be evading entry tax which is estimated to be Rs 4-5 crore. Added with penalty and interest, the realization is expected to be around Rs 9-10 crore.Similarly in Alwar district, one the major market of sugar in the state, 13 such dealers were found to be evading the entry tax. As per records, in past three years, sugar of Rs 90.74 crore was purchased by the dealers.Commercial taxes department ( CTD ) will now assess tax penalty and interest and will soon send notices to evaders. ""Dealers will get the opportunity to present their stand and if they failed to put any rational reasons, they will be asked to pay penalties,"" said an official of CTDAgencies meanwhile have broadened their scope of investigation and are at present carrying it out in Ajmer and Bharatpur. It is likely that similar exercise will carry out in almost all the districts of the state.""Sugar is something whose consumption is universal. Quantity may differ as per population size but dealers in mandis of the state purchase and sale it"" claimed one of the officials."

A truck full of milk packets destroyed in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh even as the Congress party backs the protestsMUMBAI/BHOPAL:The call for a shutdown across Maharashtra, except Mumbai, as part of the ongoing farmers protests, evoked good response on Monday from various sections of the society, though it disrupted normal life in different parts of the State. In some places, the protests turned violent.With Puntamba, the epicentre of the protests, remaining completely shut, Nashik, Kolhapur and Sangli were some of the other major centres where life was thrown out of gear due to the bandh.Farmers and Jai Jawan Jai Kisan activists pour milk on the road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh in Nagpur on Monday;The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) remained open in some places such as Pune, Solapur, Dhule and Navi Mumbai.All major APMCs from Nashik district, including Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Niphad, remained closed. Life in cities across the district too was affected. Major markets in Sangli and Kolhapur were completely shut down.Farmers in Chandwad resorted to road roko on the Manmad-Chandwad road. There was also a onion-throwing protest in Yeola of Nashik district. Farmers on bullock carts blocked the Nashik-Niphad-Chandwad road to extend support to the bandh.Farmers in Puntamba also stopped trains carrying agricultural goods from Gujarat to Pune. In Sangamner, farmers burnt an effigy of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and condemned the policies of the government.Minor clashes over closing of shops were reported from Kolhapur, where workers of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana were aggressive. Milk tankers from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara going to Mumbai via the Mumbai-Pune expressway were given Z-category security to avoid untoward incidents.In Madhya Pradesh, the 10-day farmers stir took a political turn on Monday, with the opposition Congress announcing support to the agitation. State Congress chief Arun Yadav said the Congress is aggressively supporting the agitation by the farmers and party workers have been instructed to join the crusade of the agitating farmers.Reports of farmers enforcing a shutdown in Mandsaur and looting and destroying a truck full of milk packets in Jhabua district surfaced on Monday.MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan launched a veiled attack on the opposition party, alleging that certain vested interests were behind the violent protests. The farmers are not at all involved in violence, its anti-social elements and certain vested interests who are behind the violence, said Chouhan. He also stressed on the need for the government to purchase agricultural produce at more cost whenever the market prices go down. The CM announced that a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs 1,000 crore is being set up for this.While maintaining that a bumper onion crop had triggered price crash, Chouhan said the government has decided to purchase onions from farmers at Rs 8 per kg. The process has already begun in Indore, Ujjain and Mandsaur districts. Also, it has been decided to purchase moong and toor pulses at Rs 5,500 and Rs 5,050 per quintal.While the RSS-affiliated Bhartiya Kisan Sangh had called off the stir following a meeting with the CM on Sunday, other bodies like Bhartiya Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh are yet to call of the 10-day long protest.Why are the two states facing trouble?Farmers from the drought-hit states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have taken to the streets in the last few days.

Khot, who is a minister for state in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, has become the target of ire of many for his alleged role in trying to break the ongoing farmers strike.Shettis Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) has a strong presence in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra. The farmers body had allied with the BJP both for the union and state elections of 2014. While the party itself could not better its previous performance, its alliance with the BJP had helped the party make inroads in the rural parts of western Maharashtra. Party leaders Ravikant Tupkar and Khot were accommodated in the state cabinet. Khot was made the minister of state for agriculture and marketing while Tupkar was made the chairman of the state textile corporation.Differences between Khot and Shetti started cropping up since the recently concluded zilla parishad elections. Khots son, Sagar Khot, had stood for elections which had not gone down well with the rank and file of the farmers body. Shetti had openly expressed his displeasure about the matter and when Sagar lost the polls, his father was quick to blame the MP for it. The rank and file of SSS were also not comfortable about the apparent closeness of Khot with the BJP. Murmurs of protest were heard from various factions of the Sanghatana, but Shetti had not taken a public stance about it. The complex caste equations in the sugar belt and Khot being the Maratha face of the party was one of the reasons for Shettis vacillation.As the demand for loan waiver gained ground, Shetti had launched a padyatra from Pune to Mumbai to do the same. The padyatra was called a Walk of Repentance, with Shetti expressing regret over his decision to go with the BJP in the polls. Khot was conspicuous by his absence from the walk and cited health issues when asked. The padyatara had received unprecedented support from farmers.After the padyatra, Shetti had announced that a large section of farmers wants him to severe his ties with the NDA and the ongoing farmers strike has upped the decibel level of the same. My supporters want me to severe tie with the BJP and I will put the matter before the executive council of the party, he said. Asked about Khot, Shetti said as the former was a disciplined party worker, he will abide by the partys decision. Tupkar told The Indian Express he would resign from his position if asked by the party. My alliance is with the movement not with the government, he said.While Khot remained unreachable for his quote, party workers said the farmers strike and his supposed role in trying to scuttle the same has maligned his image. Khot was the governments face for negotiation and it is alleged that he had planted his supporters in the now disbanded core committee to break the protest. In the sugar belt of Sangli, rumours are rife that Khot and his son will both join the BJP. As the farmers strike continues, Shetti has been nominated into the core committee, along with other leaders. Shettis direct involvement with the strike and Khots stance of trying to broker peace has presented the clearest picture of an imminent divorce between the two.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The CM has told a few of his close party colleagues that he is in no mood to give a long rope to Matoshree any more.Senior state BJP functionaries will discuss the issue with Amit Shah, the party's national president, when he visits Mumbai on June 17, sources said on Tuesday. Shah is expected to meet Maharashtra BJP functionaries during his three-day stay in the city.""We have two options before us. Either create a split in the Congress-NCP or the Sena to prop up our minority regime or go for mid-term elections. A sizeable section in the party is in favour of the second option,"" said a key state BJP functionary. With 123 MLAs under its belt, the Fadnavis ministry has to, much against its wish, rely on the 63 Sena MLAs' support for its survival on the floor of the assembly.However, favourable findings of a recent opinion poll has triggered confidence in the BJP rank and file about freshelections in Maharashtra. The poll says that should the state assembly elections be held sometime in November or December this year, the BJP is slated to win more than 140 seats in a house of 288 MLAs. Sceptics, however, say the farmers' strike could bring down the BJP's tally considerably.""The BJP's TRP is intact across the nation, thanks to Narendra-ji's (Modi) unabated popularity and the Opposition's inability to throw up a charismatic leader to take on the PM,"" said a party MLA. Factors such as Fadnavis' 'Mr Clean' image, and his emphasis on infrastructure and good governance will stand the party in good stead at the hustings, he added.Yet, the farmers' strike, which entered the sixth day on Tuesday, has brought to the fore the internal contradictions in the state BJP, said political experts. Barring a lukewarm statement here and there by a minister or two, there has been no concerted strategy by either the Maharashtra BJP or the state cabinet to lend unflinching support to Fadnavis in his hour of crisis, they pointed out. Said a senior bureaucrat, ""The chief minister is seen as a lonely figure battling on all fronts.""Moreover, Fadnavis' move to broker peace with the coordination committee of the striking farmers by announcing a partial loan waiver has backfired miserably. As a result, the rival sections promptly geared up to launch a fresh offensive on the already beleaguered Fadnavis regime. The Congress-NCP's strategy is to use the strike to make inroads into the regions which do not grow cash crops such as sugar-cane, said a senior state Congress functionary.The 40-something splinter groups of farmers, which are spearheading the strike across the state, have turned down Fadnavis' offer of partial loan waiver which, if implemented, will entail an additional burden of Rs 30,000 crore on the state exchequer. Experts say the partial loan waiver may not help the state's 31 lakh debt-ridden farmers tide over their escalating financial losses.Fadnavis is said to be deeply upset with the Sena for its open support to the striking farmers. In Jalgaon, Dhule and Nashik districts, Sena functionaries joined the Kisan Kranti Morcha stir and pelted stones at vehicles ferrying goods and foodgrains to local markets.A delegation of agitating farmers met Raj Thackeray at his Shivaji Park residence on Tuesday. The MNS president said the state government should create infrastructure--such as warehouses, godowns, cold storages and a smooth transport network--to help agriculturists get decent returns for their farm produce.Meanwhile, Saamna on Tuesday warned the Fadnavis government that empty assurances would not help resolve the farmers' agitation. Urging the state government to accept the farmers' demand for complete loan waiver and minimum support price for agricultural produce, the Sena mouthpiece said the ""hundred per cent"" Maharashtra Bandh on Monday reflects the anger brewing among farmers.""Outburst of farmers collective ire will lead to a grave crisis,"" warned Saamna and reiterated support to the farmers' on-going agitation."

(PTI Photo) Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra. (PTI Photo)India received a normal rainfall in 2016  three per cent less than the 100-year average  after reeling under severe drought for two successive years. In addition, the country registered record food grain production in the same year, as per the official figures of the Ministry of Agriculture and farmers welfare. This was 6.37 per cent higher than last five years average production and 8.6 per cent more as compared to 2015-16. The government also boasted of having allocated more budget to agriculture than the previous UPA regime with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself promising to double the income of farmers by 2022. However, all these seemed to have had a little impact on farmers in terms of easing their problems.Now, farmers in two of the largest states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, which are presently ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, have resorted to agitation over a wide-range of issues concerning their livelihood. So, what has happened since then that the farmers have been forced to protest despite brief spell of relief?Ongoing stir and farmers demands in Madhya PradeshAccording to latest reports, protests turned violent as three farmers were killed by police in Mandsaur, the epicentre of the agitation which lies 325 kms from the Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal. Subsequently, curfew was imposed in the area and prohibitory orders were issued in other parts of the district. They have been protesting since June 1 demanding minimum support price for their farm produce, among other things. On Monday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tried to assuage frayed nerves, insisting that his government was taking all the necessary steps to address the issues of the agitating farmers. He said a price stabilisation fund of Rs 1,000 crore would be established to procure the farm produce at the minimum support price (MSP).Bhopal : Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during their nation-wide strike and agitation over various demands, in Bhopal on Sunday. (PTI Photo) Bhopal : Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during their nation-wide strike and agitation over various demands, in Bhopal on Sunday. (PTI Photo)The Centres decision to demonetise high-value currency notes in November last year came as a severe jolt to farmers as cash is the primary mode of transaction in agriculture sector. Moreover, pandemonium prevailed in different parts of the state as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, an organistaion affiliated to the RSS, suspended the agitation while others refused to budge. Calling off the agitation, the BKS said that the government had accepted most of its demands like buying onions at Rs 8 a kg and paying farmers half their dues at mandis in cash and the remaining via electronic transfer to their bank accounts. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that is believed to be behind the stir, said the agitation will go on.Maharashtra farmers stira result of UP farm loan waiver and plunging crop pricesIn early April, the newly-elected BJP government under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath took a bold step by waiving off farm loan worth Rs 36,359 crore. The move was appreciated by many cutting across various political spectrum. Similar demands were raised by farmers in Maharashtra, which witnessed the highest number of farmer suicides between 2014 and 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, the state saw an 18 per cent jump  from 2,568 to 3,030. Marathwada region of the state also faced drought in both years. The reliance of farmers in Marathwada on water-guzzling cash crops such as sugarcane has been cited as one of the reasons for the distress. The dwindling crop prices is also being viewed as the other reason behind the uprising.Farmers spilling out milk on a road during their state-wide protest over various demands at Pingli Village in Parbhani, Maharashtra.

As mark of protest, they even dumped produce and milk on the street, and blocked highways while preventing delivery trucks from reaching city markets. Amid mounting pressure, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis promised a loan waiver to small and marginal farmers who were out of the institutional credit system. However, the agitation showed no signs of abating as it continued for the sixth day today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Dairy farmer Nitin Dhanvate with his cross-bred cows and six-month-old daughter. (Source: Partha Sarathi Biswas)After one-and-a-half years of incurring heavy losses, Nitin Dhanvates dairy business has just about turned around in the last four months. The 32-year-old is now receiving Rs 28 per litre for the cow milk, containing 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent SNF (solids-not-fat), he is supplying to Prabhat Dairy Ltd. The same dairy  and also the Godavari Khore cooperative and two private milk contractors operating in the village  was till December paying Rs 18 per litre.Dhanvate sells on an average 40 litres from his six Holstein-Friesian crossbreds, not all of which yield milk at the same time. My total monthly outgo on feed concentrates and other inputs comes to roughly Rs 24,000. Only since February have I been making a profit of nearly Rs 10,000 per month, as against losses of Rs 2,400 when the milk price was Rs 18 per litre, notes this full-time dairy farmer, who grows kadba (lucerne or alfalfa fodder) on his entire four-acre land. Had I been buying fodder, my losses would have been even more. But despite that, I have had to reduce my herd size from the 15 cows giving 100-odd litres daily two years back, he adds.Dhanvate epitomises the average angry young Maratha farmer of Puntamba, the village on the banks of the Godavari in Ahmednagar districts Rahata taluka that has spawned the ongoing agitation by ryots across western Maharashtra. He, like all other farmers here, has since June 1 stopped supplying milk to the four dairies/contractors procuring 5,000 litres or so daily from the village. Puntambas Gram Sabha, on April 3, passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to the Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included implementation of the MS Swaminathan committees recommendation of ensuring crop realisation levels at least 50 per cent above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100 per cent subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and  of immediate relevance to Dhanvate  a minimum milk purchase price of Rs 50 per litre.We not only wanted this price, but also a mechanism forcing dairies to pay it. Last June, the state government raised its official procurement price for cow milk from Rs 19 to Rs 22 a litre, but the dairies, both private and cooperative, were still paying us Rs 18. They started paying more from February, only because of milk shortages arising from farmers cutting back on production and herd sizes. And even the current prices will not be paid, once milk production recovers with the onset of the monsoon and increased fodder availability, says Dhanvate, who has seen better times when he selling his 100-plus litres that fetched a rate of Rs 25 or more.A billboard at the Puntamba village square asking farmers to participate in a Maharashtra bandh on June 1. Partha Sarathi Biswas A billboard at the Puntamba village square asking farmers to participate in a Maharashtra bandh on June 1. Partha Sarathi BiswasBut Puntambas crisis isnt about milk alone. Farmers in the 16,000-strong village with over 4,500 acres of largely-irrigated farmland and seven primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS)  which makes it relatively prosperous compared to the drought-prone rural landscapes of Marathwada or Vidarbha  also talk of their losses over the last 2-3 years from growing other crops, including onion, soybean and sugarcane.Sunil Pare, 49, claims to have spent Rs 70,000 on seed, fertiliser, labour, pesticide and other inputs for cultivation of rabi onions on his two-acre holding. Despite harvesting 130 quintals of the bulb in March, he is yet to sell a single kg so far. Prices at the Rahata market yard were Rs 500 per quintal in March and have only fallen further since to Rs 400-450. At these rates, I cannot even recover my investment. What alternative do I have other than holding on to my crop? he complains. The same story is repeated in soyabean, where Pare could realise just Rs 2,700 per quintal for the nine quintals that he sold in November  just after the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes. The previous years rate that Pare got was Rs 3,500 per quintal.Dhanajay Dhanvate, a 24-acre landowner and homeopathic doctor, who is also manager of the Asha Kiran Paraplegic Rehabilitation Centre at Puntamba, puts the total farm loan defaults in the village at Rs 1.80 crore. 80 per cent of our farmers are staring at economic insolvency. And these are not people who you could call poor by traditional standards, he says. But according to him, loan defaults  hence the demand for waiver  are only symptom; the real underlying disease is low prices. The unpaid loans owed by Puntambas farmers are primarily to Bank of Maharashtra, Axis Bank and four PACS, which, in turn, have borrowed from the Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank.The Puntamba farmers decision to go ahead with their Shetkari Sampa found favour with their counterparts in neighbouring villages and beyond. As the movement spread to the entire western belt  from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune down to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur  a five-member core committee was formed to negotiate with the state government. The committee included Dhananjay Jadhav, who belonged to Puntamba, and Dhananjay Dhorde from Dongaon, a nearby village in Vaijapur taluka.The stir began as scheduled on June 1, but was called off after two days, following a meeting of the core committee with the Chief Minister Fadnavis, who announced a Rs 30,000 crore loan waiver package targeting small and marginal farmers in the state. That decision, however, did not go well with most of Puntambas farmers. This was a complete betrayal. How could they have taken the decision to withdraw? They should at least have consulted the Gram Sabha, remarks Dhananjay Dhanvate. One indicator of the mood at Puntamba is that Jadhav has not returned to the village since the June 3 meeting in Mumbai that went on late into the night.The Puntamba farmers basic demand is a robust mechanism to ensure remunerative prices, which is the ultimate antidote to their chronic debt problems. What stops the government from forcing dairies to pay its declared procurement price? The Rs 22 per litre price is not much, but can at least keep us afloat. We can, then, try and cut costs through increased fodder yields and optimal feeding practices, observes Nitin Dhanvate.There are some others  such as Yogesh Rayate of Khadak Malegaon village of Nashiks Niphad taluka  who suggest that the government could also disseminate regular production and sowing area updates for crops such as onions: The government already knows the minimum area required to avoid production shortage. With satellite imagery, it is possible to also know the progressive area coverage on a daily basis. If the farmer is provided both the former and latter data during the sowing season, he will know how much exactly to plant and avoid overproduction.That suggestion is, perhaps, well worth considering in these troubled times.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But as soon as the sun sets, and the food is served, everyone is smiling and chatty. Eyes suddenly light up with gratitude and glee. You can hear some banter on one table and a child screaming with joy on the other.However, even if you arent fasting, rest assured that the lip-smacking food found in the hidden pockets of this area, abuzz with restaurants dishing out their signature preparations, will make your mouth water. Heres a glimpse of what to expect on your Iftar trail.Shami Kebab and Chicken HakimiNoor Mohammadi, Bhendi BazaarBhendi Bazaar is a busy nightspot through the year. Its especially busy during Ramzan. And the largest crowd is usually gathered at Noor Mohammadi, waiting to break their fast with falooda, fruits and some lip-smacking Shami Kebab (Rs 20). Made with minced chicken, chana dal and spices, the kebab is hand-pound to a texture so soft that it is hard to lift them without having them fall apart. Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies.

In a note that the police say he left behind, Jadhav said he should not be cremated ""till Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis comes here"".Jadhav had just 2.5 acres of cultivable land and a debt of over 60,000 rupees from banks and money lenders that he felt he couldn't repay. He leaves behind two young children and wife.Solapur Collector Rajendra Bhosale confirmed to news agency Press Trust of India about Jadhav's instructions and said he was rushing to the village. So are police reinforcements. Vijay Deshmukh, the state minister in-charge of Solapur district, has visited the state earlier in the day.As word about the suicide got around, farmer organisations blocked the main road and called for a bandh in the Karmala tehsil, triggering worries within the state administration that the farmer protests could spread.The suicide could further fuel the farmer protests in the state that have continued despite Mr Fadnavis announcement to waive loans held by defaulting farmers with small tracts of land and low incomes.Mr Fadnavis tried to buy peace last week with a loan waiver for marginal or poor farmers who defaulted on repayments. But it hasn't convinced the farmers yet; the farmers say they will continue the strike until the waiver was extended to debt of all farmers and not just marginal, or poorer, farmers who defaulted.They also want the government to take firm steps to boost farm incomes and cut supplies of vegetables and milk to Mumbai and Pune to get their point across.Maharashtra, the country's second-biggest producer of sugar, cotton and soybean, has the maximum number of farmer suicides in the country. In 2015, the last year for which national data is available, 4,291 farmers killed themselves as compared to 4,004 in 2014. Most of these suicides were linked to bankruptcy."

It has roped in commercial and nationalised banks in 16 districts where the co-operative banks are less likely to give loans.In a review meeting held by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday, the government identified five commercial, private and nationalised banks for disbursing crop loans. Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra and IDBI are three of the five banks the state has roped in.Crop loans needs to be extended to farmers in 16 districts, including Nandurbar, Nashik, Yavatmal, Wardha, Beed and Jalna. It is about Rs 540 crore. Since cooperative banks in these districts are financially weak, we decided to take help of commercial banks. Funds provided by them will bridge the gap between the requirement and the capacity of the district cooperative banks, said an officer from the cooperative department.Fadnavis has also directed officials from agriculture and cooperative departments to organise farmers meet to facilitate crop loans for the upcoming kharif season. He also reviewed schemes for cold storage and marketing chains for the effective marketing of farm products.He also took stock of the policy under consideration to acquire sugar factories that have been liquidated instead of selling them in the open market. The state is considering acquisition of such sugar factories and then allotting them to cooperative societies on lease."

(File photo) What should worry Fadnavis is that the Rs 30,000 crore farm loan waiver will add to the states deep indebtedness. (File photo)As a young legislator in 2013, Devendra Fadnavis went for the erstwhile Prithviraj Chavan-led NCP Governments jugular on the issue of farmer suicides, the irrigation scam and the governments position on the farm sector.Three years later, it is the farm sector which is threatening to weigh him down. Fadnavis critics are accusing him of being urban-centric and having a limited connect with farmers, even though he hasnt been as singed as fellow BJP chief minister, Shivraj Chouhan of Madhya Pradesh.But as the farmers agitation spread, Fadnavis was forced to compromise on another plank  writing off loans. The Maharashtra chief minister has always believed that loan write-off is not a durable solution, but in this case, politics came in the way. Apparently, Delhi prodded him into announcing a Rs 30,000 crore waiver.Fadnavis may have kicked the can down the road. Thats because the detailed scheme for the write-off will be finalised only by the end of October. It could be that the government is hoping that a good monsoon will allay a large amount of troubles on the farm. Significantly, Fadnavis completes three years in October; the farm loan write off at that time could be used to counter opponents who believe the Chief Minister and his party lack the sensitivity in handling issues relating to the farm sector.Whats been noticeable about this issue is that Fadnavis has had to handle it personally  many political heavyweights have been benched and many newcomers are too inexperienced. Maharashtra has a well diversified farm sector  sugarcane is dominant in western Maharashtra, cotton, soyabean and pulses (such as tur dal) are grown in the dryland farming belt of Vidarbha, while horticultural produce such as oranges, pomegranates and mangoes are grown in the Konkan belt.Incredibly, a record production of pulses  over 20 lakh tonnes  has eaten into farmer incomes. With India being a traditional importer of pulses, last years Minimum Support Price was pegged at over Rs 5000 per tonne, which means that famers who grew pulses made good money. But in March, the government put out an advance estimate of 11.7 lakh tonnes, which it had to later embarrassingly revise to 20.35 lakh tonnes.Compounding the states woes is the continuing ban on export as well as a bilateral agreement signed with Mozambique last year to import tur dal for five years. Additionally, the squeeze post-demonetisation didnt help.What should worry Fadnavis is that the Rs 30,000 crore farm loan waiver will add to the states deep indebtedness. Over the last two years, the state has added Rs 100,000 crore to the debt bill  its total debt is set to top Rs 4 lakh crore next fiscal. Annual interest payments alone will account for Rs.30,000 crore.The elbow room for extra borrowings is fast narrowing at a time when several big ticket projects are underway. Fadnavis is betting big on the Nagpur- Mumbai expressway and the expansion of the Mumbai metro. For a state which is the top contributor to the countrys GDP, the fiscal indicators look a little more worrying now.The latest farmland agitation is a sign that any thoughts of a mid-term poll, fuelled by the partys strong showing in the zilla parishad polls a few months ago, may have to be jettisoned for now.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Sadananda Gowda (Middle in the left) having lunch with locals at Chinnapuram village.Union Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Thursday said that a national-level cattle survey would be carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) from September.The Central government plans to survey the cattle population and different breeds with focus on high-yielding cattle across the country in the wake of ban on the sale and purchase of cattle for slaughter.The ban came into force recently with the notification under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act.When asked about the proposed national-level cattle survey at a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Sadananda said that the cattle survey would likely to begin in September.Parameters to be covered under the survey were being worked out, the Union Minister added.Previously, the NSSO had attempted to carry out a national-level cattle survey but it had to be withdrawn due to various reasons, according to Mr. Sadananda. Apart from collecting exclusive data about the cattle, difficulties of the farmers who own the cattle will be heard to find out solution to their woes. Of late, we are working on the methods to be adopted for the survey and tools of technology, said Mr. Sadananda.Special training is required for those to be deployed for the cattle survey. The cattle survey is expected to be completed within one year from the date of commencement, said Mr. Sadananda.Labour surveyWith regard to household survey, Mr. Sadananda said that labour survey that focuses on unemployment and survey on household expenditure on education and health began recently.Mr. Sadananda also said that the Ministry of Statistics launched a pilot project in the State of Maharashtra, integrating remote sensing technology with crop cutting experiments to get accurate crop yield estimates. The pilot project will cover different major crops like paddy, sugarcane and wheat in Andhra Pradesh and other States, said Mr. Sadananda."

File/PTI Photo Farmers and NCP activists throw away milk on the road outside Collectors office during a protest over farmers issues in Thane, Mumbai on Saturday. File/PTI PhotoClearing the decks for an end to the ongoing agitation by farmers in the state, the Maharashtra government Sunday announced a blanket loan waiver, the largest ever, to provide immediate relief to 31 lakh farmers. This is a clear departure from its earlier position that loans of only small and marginal farmers will be considered. The government also agreed to raise the price of milk.There are 1.36 crore farmers in the state and their loans add up to Rs 1.14 lakh crore but the government estimates that the loan waiver will not exceed Rs 35,000 crore when parameters are introduced to weed out non-farming categories to ensure that genuine farmers reap maximum benefits.These parameters will ensure that big business houses, professionals or politicians who own large parcels of agriculture land do not avail loan waiver benefits in the name of farmers.Announcing that a consensus had been reached and farmers had called off their strike, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who described the decision as historic, told The Indian Express: The loan waiver is for all farmers and not confined to just small and marginal categories. There will be defined parameters to ensure genuine and needy farmers are not left out of the institutional credit bracket.Indicating that financial implications are yet to be worked out, Fadnavis said the volume of loan waiver will be largest the state has ever offered. He hinted that the farm loan model would be almost on the lines of Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.When it was pointed out to him that the blanket waiver would mean writing off Rs 1.14 lakh crore for 1.36 crore farmers, Fadnavis said: There was an overwhelming response from farmer leaders that loan waiver should be for needy farmers, and not become a medium availed by rich and prosperous individuals or groups at the cost of poor and needy farmers.Earlier, in a series of tweets, the Chief Minister said: Government agrees for loan waiver for farmers. Conditions and detailing will be finalised by a Joint Committee.Govt also accepts the demand of farmers to increase the milk prices. At the same time, the milk societies will have to agree with 70:30 formula of profit sharing on the lines of sugar industry. Farmers and their betterment was, is and will always be this Governments top priority. Group of Ministers will also hold discussions with various political parties for a broader consensus and inclusion, he said.The development of farmers and their welfare has remained integral to all policy decisions with capital investments of Rs 26,000 crore. The loan waiver is another step to reaffirm our commitment to the farmers, he said.The waiver decision came after a meeting of the core committee led by state Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil and farmer representatives from Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli and Pune.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetty said, We are pleased with the decision. Our concern was for genuine farmers. We are not seeking a blanket loan waiver. Why should rich and prosperous politicians or industrialists get loan benefits?Patil said, This is a revolutionary decision. A loan waiver of such magnitude has never been considered in the state.Taking another step to provide relief to farmers supplying milk to cooperative dairy societies and private players, the government decided to increase milk rates from June 20.We want to stop exploitation of farmers who are often underpaid. The formula for fixing the milk rate for farmers will be derived, as is done in the case of sugarcane. The ration of 70:30 profit share between sugar mills and cane farmers will be enforced for the milk sector, Patil said.The farmers have demanded Rs 50 per litre but it is likely that they will get between Rs 28-30 per litre.Shiv Sena Minister Diwakar Raote said,  We are happy with the loan waiver. Any decision that helps farmers is welcome. NCP president Sharad Pawar said, I welcome the loan waiver decision. But now we have to see how soon it is enforced.The Shiv Sena along with NCP and other farmers organisations had backed the strike over the last ten days. Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, We had always urged the government to enforce the loan waiver and now they have accepted our demand.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The leaders have said they will block all the national highways in the region on June 16.Various farmers' organisations, such as the Bhartiya Kisan Andolan, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Asli) and Ajgar Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, have pledged their support to the call for blocking national highways.""We have prepared a detailed plan and have people supporting us in each village of western UP. They are coming together under the new banner of the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. There will be lakhs of farmers out on the highways and we will not allow any vehicular movement for three hours in the afternoon of June 16,"" said Harpal Singh, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Asli), a breakaway faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union founded by legendary farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait.""We are not demanding anything outrageous. Before the 2014 elections, PM Narendra Modi himself had promised the implementation of MS Swaminathan commission recommendations. It has been three years. Farmers are committing suicide across the country and the government is not bothered,"" he added.The main demands of the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh are waiver of all farmer loans, and assurance of income of more than 50% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan panel in 2006. ""Our demands are the same as those of our brothers in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The government has dealt mercilessly with them. The time has come to show them the power of the farmers. Farmers across the country will be out on the streets on June 16,"" said Kuldeep Tyagi, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Andolan.Farmers across the sugarcane belt are preparing for the blockade. ""We will be there in full numbers. This is a matter of life and death for us and we will make our voices heard,"" said Ravinder Choudhary, a farmer in Daurala on the outskirts of Meerut.

5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) (Express Photo by Partha Paul) The state government has also decided to prevent exploitation of dairy farmers by dairy cooperatives. (Representational Image) (Express Photo by Partha Paul)Farmers supplying milk to dairy cooperative societies are set to get higher remuneration from June 20 in a move to prevent their exploitation by dairy cooperatives. The proposal will be mooted at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. A source in the government said: Apart from the blanket loan waiver, the state government has taken the decision to prevent exploitation of dairy farmers.The proposal states that profit-sharing in the dairy co-operatives should be similar to the sugar co-operatives sector, in the ratio of 70:30. With the Congress-NCP having the maximum hold on dairy cooperatives and unions across Maharashtra, the decision is likely to have far reaching implications. The move comes in the wake of mounting pressure from farmers unions about exploitation and underpayment for milk supply.A source in the dairy development said: After the cabinet ratification of the 70:30 formula, the profit margin of the farmers would increase. In the present context, the supply of milk per litre would be at Rs 30 to 32. A study across the state shows that the average rate that the farmers now get from dairy cooperatives is Rs 18 to 26 per litre. Another reason for the state governments intervention is being seen as the huge losses the sector has been suffering for the last 15 years.During the ongoing farmers strike, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, while expressing concern about dairy farmers, had said: The government believes they deserve higher remuneration. There are 11.6 lakh members in co-operative dairy societies, and 1.43 lakh in cooperative dairy unions, according to officials in the Commissioner for Cooperative and Registrar Cooperative Societies.The average daily collection of milk by the government and co-operative dairies together was 44.45 lakh litres in 2016-17. Whereas, it had recorded 51.13 lakh litres in 2015-16. In the government and co-operative sectors, there are 98 milk processing plants and 156 chilling centres with a capacity of 90.17 lakh litres and 26,55 lakh litres per day respectively. There are 14,921 co-operative dairy societies and 85 co-operative dairy unions across the state.About 37.6 per cent of the co-operative dairy societies and 29.4 per cent of dairy unions are running into losses. A NABARD report states that the estimated credit potential projection for 2017-18 for livestock (animal husbandry) is Rs 5447.17 crore, of which Rs 3,656.49 crore has been set aside for dairy development and Rs 1,103.69 crore for sheep, goat and pig farms.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Chandigarh had largest number of participants in the study as compared to other states.A study released last week had found that overall prevalence of diabetes is 14% in Chandigarh, highest in 15 states, which were included. The citys 27% poor were also found having diabetes. The results were of an ongoing study, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes study, and published last week in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.Chandigarh has highest per capita income, which means people are more likely to stay indoors and less involved in physical activity, said Dr Mandeep Singla, endocrinologist, GMCH-32. Physical inactivity, excessive intake of junk food that is rich in carbohydrates are the other two reasons. Until people dont improve their lifestyle, they will continue to get metabolic diseases. he added.Dr Sanjay Bhadada, endocrinologist, PGIMER, said another reason could be in city a large number of people are from Punjab and they have highest waist circumference, blood pressure and BMI (body mass index).Dr Bhadada said the exact cause is not clear but there is theory called Barkers hypothesis, which can explain the scenario. According to the theory, baby does not get good nourishment in utero and during infancy are more prone to develop metabolic disorders like diabetes in life. Reason being that their organs like pancreas do not grow properly, Dr Bhadada explained.FOOD ABUNDANCE FOR POOR COULD BE ANOTHER REASONThe study has found that in the urban areas of UT, the prevalence of diabetes among individuals in the low Socio Economic Status (SES) is 27%, which is more than double the incidence among individuals in high SES, which is 13%.Now, large numbers of migratory people live in the city. They do not get good nourishment in their states but when they shift to Chandigarh, they get food in abundance. Their body does not adjust to the change in the environment of abundance food, leading to diabetes. This could be one of the reason, but this is just one hypothetical theory, Dr Bhadada added.The experts said the shift in diabetes towards urban poor is a cause of concern, as the treatment is lifelong and costly. The cost varies from Rs 50 to Rs 200 per day. Also, it can lead to lots of complications, including heart attack and kidney failure.According to a government report of 2016, Chandigarh had per capita income of Rs 2.42 lakh during 2015-16. The study found that the prevalence of diabetes seems to be higher in states with greater per capita income.FINDINGS OF THE STUDYThis study is largest ever to investigate diabetes in India. The prevalence of diabetes in all 15 states of India was 7%. The prevalence of diabetes varied from 4% in Bihar to 14% in UT.The diabetes epidemic in India is in a transition mode and it is a cause of worry for health experts.Reason: The disease of the rich is now spreading to urban poor living in affluent states, who can hardly afford the medication. The study showed that prevalence of diabetes was higher among poor people (low SES) living in urban areas of affluent states like Chandigarh, Punjab, Maharashtra and others.Nearly half of the people (47%) tested with diabetes during the study were never tested earlier for the disease.DIABETES: ITS SYMPTOMS, EFFECTS, PREVENTIVE STEPSDiabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys , and nerves. The most common is type-2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesnt make enough insulinSYMPTOMSExcessive excretion of urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly.CONSEQUENCESOver time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves Adults with diabetes have a 2-3-fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy (nerve damage) in feet increases chance of foot ulcers, infection and eventual need for limb amputation Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness, and occurs as a result of long-term accumulated damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. 2.6% of global blindness can be attributed to diabetes Diabetes is among the leading causes of kidney failurePREVENTIONSimple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. People should: Achieve and maintain healthy body weight Be physically active  at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most days. More activity is required for weight control Eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats intake; and Avoid tobacco use  smoking increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases Diagnosis and treatment Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood sugar. Treatment of diabetes involves diet and physical activity along with lowering blood glucose and the levels of other known risk factors that damage blood vessels. Tobacco use cessation is also important to avoid complications (Source: WHO)"

The state will hold a meeting of stakeholders on Tuesday to decide upon the final price.To reassure agitating farmers, the government had said it would pay them more for cow and buffalo milk, to ensure than farming remains a sustainable practice. On Sunday, dairy development and animal husbandry minister Mahadev Jankar said farmers are likely to be paid Rs2 more a litre.Currently, the government pays farmers Rs24 a litre for cow milk, while buffalo milk fetches them Rs33 a litre at the government procurement centres.Govt also accepts the demand of farmers to increase the milk prices .  CMO Maharashtra (@CMOMaharashtra) June 11, 2017The rise will be applicable to societies and unions collecting milk for government brands. But, with the government paying more for milk, even private brands will be forced to do the same, leading to a spike in prices. We have decided upon a 70:30 formula, under which the farmers get 70%, while the milk -collecting societies and unions get 30% of the cost. If this is implemented, the difference between the procurement rate and retail price will reduce and there will be no need to increase the retail price, said an official from the dairy development department.At the same time, the milk societies will have to agree with 70:30 formula of profit sharing on the lines of sugar industry .  CMO Maharashtra (@CMOMaharashtra) June 11, 2017Private brands always pay more than the government. For instance, Gokul pays farmers Rs28 a litre for cow milk. Owing to the stiff competition, private brands will start paying farmers more when the government does. They will have no option but to ask customers to pay more then, said Vinayak Patil, president, Rajarambapu Patil Sahakari Dudh Sangh, Sangli.Experts from the dairy development sector have demanded a government subsidy to keep retail prices in check. The government should give us subsidies, just as the Karnataka and Haryana governments do. This will ensure that there is no hike in retail prices, said Vaishali Nagawade, former chairman of Mahananada."

Haryana farmers, who are sitting on dharna in many parts of the state, have decided to block national highways and state highways for three hours on June 16. On the other hand, keeping in view the increasing protests by farmers, the Haryana government has initiated the process of collecting details about the outstanding farm loans particularly given by its cooperative banks and societies to the farmers.A government official told The Indian Express on Monday that there is a defaulting loan of Rs 6,575 crore, which the farmers could not deposit with the cooperative banks and societies on time. Keeping in view the past practice of waiving such farm loans, the government may consider to waive off this much amount, said the officer, adding that no decision has been taken on the issue yet. As of now, only details are being collected, added the officer.However, the amount of total farm loan disbursed by both cooperative and commercial banks is much higher. As on March 31, 2015, the total outstanding crop loan in Haryana was pegged at Rs 28,558 crore with more than 22 lakh Kisan Credit Cards (KCC).Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Haryana unit president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, From the media reports, we have heard about farm loans of Rs 56,000 crore pending against the Haryana farmers.Chaduni said the issue of farm loans is related to the farmers of all states, not only Maharashtra. In the absence of good prices of crops, farmers lives have become miserable. The problems of farmers can be addressed only by two ways. First, waive off their existing farm loans and second, offer them profitable rates of their crops to increase their income, added Chaduni, who have led many agitations of farmers in the state.To help farmers ensure their survival, the government should implement recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission to ensure 50 per cent profit in the peasants input cost to their crops, said Chaduni.On BKUs call, the dharnas are being staged at eight district headquarters currently. Similar, dharnas will begin in Sonepat from Tuesday. The farmers also protested in Panchkula on Monday. Haryana BJP spokesperson Jawahar Yadav said their government was serious about tackling farmers issues.We have already reduced the rates of urea fertiliser apart from implementing a crop insurance scheme for farmers. As many as 15.73 lakh soil health cards have so far been prepared to prevent unnecessary use of fertilisers. We have already initiated the process to implement many of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, said Yadav.State Agriculture Secretary Abhilaksh Likhi said the state government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and accelerated its targets for different sectors to double farmers incomes by 2022, which requires an annual growth of 10.41 per cent in the income of farmers. Likhi said the government was aiming to ensure increase in agricultural and allied sector productivity through crop diversity and peri-urban farming.Among the high value crops (HVC), annual growth of 14.1 per cent in cotton, two per cent in sugarcane, 4.2 per cent in fruits, 5.7 per cent in vegetables, 3.5 per cent in animal husbandry and 12 per cent in fisheries has been envisaged by 2022. A target has been set to increase the productivity of fibre crop cotton from 0.274 metric tonnes per hectare to 0.693 metric tonnes per hectare and of sugarcane from 75.18 metric tonnes per hectare to 86.30 metric tonnes per hectare, he added.Hooda to hold MLAs meet todayGroupism in the Congress was visible on the issue of farmers agitation, too. Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda will hold a meeting with present and past MLAs of the party in New Delhi on Tuesday to launch an agitation on the farmers issue.However, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Tanwar said Monday he would not attend Hoodas Delhi meeting as he had no information about the same.

This was lower than the recovery in three successive drought years between 2013 and 2015, the average of which was 54 per cent. According to senior government officials, Rs 51,235 crore was disbursed among 52 lakh farmers. Three successive droughts had led to a steep rise in loss of crops and revenue in 15,000 villages in 2013; 23,000 villages in 2014; and 28,000 villages in 2015. Maharashtra has 40,913 villages. Yet, in these drought years, crop loan recovery was 52 per cent, 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively, according to official data.The state governments core committee and farmers representatives are now working out stringent guidelines to define farmers eligible for loan waiver. Government sources said rich farmers, and those with alternative income, would not qualify for the promised waiver. The Rs 1 lakh ceiling that is likely to be imposed is expected to cover the small, marginal and needy farmers, whose number is pegged at 30 lakh.Former agriculture minister and Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, Anticipation of a loan waiver is the main reason for the low recovery. Another reason could be shortfall in sugarcane cultivation, he said. Holding the government responsible, Vikhe-Patil said, Last year, monsoon led to higher foodgrain production. But the government failed to provide the MSP to farmers. This too may have led to their refusal to repay the crop loans.A BJP cabinet minister, however, said, While anticipation of a loan waiver can be a reason, the cooperative network which is under the oppositions control may also have fuelled the campaign against payment of dues. Of the Rs 51,235 crore disbursed, the share of state-owned banks was Rs 26,470 crore, private banks Rs 4,126 crore, rural banks Rs 3,044 crore, district central cooperative banks Rs 17,548 crore and others Rs 44 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The industry players here described the event as a historic initiative for development of Kolhapur and adjoining areas in western Maharashtra and Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts of Konkan.Kolhapur is an important centre of agriculture and foundry business. But lack of adequate railway network force people to rely on road transport which is comparatively more expensive. Due to this transport costs, produce from the region becomes incompetent in market. Hence, people had been demanding electrification of the Pune-Miraj-Kolhapur track for fast movement of goods and passengers. With the ports in the western coast are being developed, connectivity with Sindhudurg and Rantnagiri districts would provide a boost to export. The new lines and electrification would lead long-term development of the region.Prabhu said at Karad on Sunday, ""These railway projects lead development of tomorrow's Maharashtra. Western Maharashtra is a developed region. With the connectivity with Kokan through the Kolhapur-Vaibhavwadi line, the region would develop further. This rail network would further connect to Marathwada and Vidarbha and boost passenger and cargo transportation.""Lalit Gandhi, president of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, ""Electrification of Pune-Kolhapur track is the basic infrastructure work for cargo transportation. It will boost sugar and bauxite transportation. At present, sugar from Kolhapur fails to compete in major markets due to transportation cost. Electrification would also speed up transportation.""He added, ""Rail connectivity with Konkan is a historic opportunity for the industrial sector. At present, we rely on Jawaharal Neharu Port Trust (JNPT) for export. The Jaigarh port in Ratnagriri is being developed. Once it is done, our dependence on JNPT would reduce. Konkan is still an untapped market and rail connectivity will provide an opportunity to explore it. It will also help expand the manufacturing base in Kolhapur and nearby districts.""Member of central zone railway users committee Samir Sheth said, ""Electrification of Pune-Kolhapur track will save time and bring down cargo and passenger transportation expenses by half. It will also lead to increase in the frequency of trains. Railways can also run fast trains on this route.""He added, ""The Konkan is full of natural beauty.

The Opposition decided to press for a comprehensive loan waiver for farmers and implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions five-part report.The Opposition parties have decided to organise a Bharat Bandh on the issue of farmer distress. The decision came in the meeting of the Opposition sub-group on Wednesday to discuss a strategy for the Presidential election. Sources said that the farmers unrest on a range of issues  falling prices, Minimum Support Price and debt  was discussed at the meeting where many Opposition leaders felt this was the appropriate time to seek answers from the government.The Opposition decided to press for a comprehensive loan waiver for farmers and implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions five-part report. That 2006 report had suggested detailed, sweeping reforms to address agrarian distress: from ensuring better credit and insurance to marketing to better access to technology; steps to promote land reforms and productivity to food security and employment.The date for the Bharat Bandh, a source said, would be decided after parties discuss with their respective leaderships. On Wednesday, Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, an NDA ally from Maharashtra, met senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav at his residence here where the two discussed agrarian distress. Shettis party has set a deadline for the farm loan waiver in Maharashtra where protests have put the BJP government in a tight spot. A day before Rahul Gandhi visited Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh on June 7, Sharad Yadav and Gandhi had a long discussion at the JD(U) leaders residence, too.Yadav, incidentally, accompanied the Congress vice president to Mandsaur to protest against what he called was the MP governments apathy towards protesting farmers. Later, a delegation of the All India Kisan Sabha, led by CPI(M) leader Hannan Mollah, also visited Mandsaur this week.After Mandsaur, some Opposition leaders have planned a joint visit to Mandola in Uttar Pradesh to express solidarity with farmers who have been protesting there demanding revised compensation for land acquired under Avas Vikas Housing Scheme.An Opposition leader said that agrarian crisis cuts across caste and community lines and could, therefore, be a potent political issue to corner the government with. More so, he said, because both MP and Maharashtra, where the protests reached a flashpoint, are BJP-ruled states.Sporadic farmer agitations were going on at a number of places. Our effort is to unite all such forces, said a leader associated with the plans. A section is sceptical as well given the Oppositions diffused agenda and failure to build a narrative around the protests so far. They cite the fact that in the run-up to UP polls, a rally was organized in Delhi on sugarcane prices and other farmers issues bringing parties like JD(S), NCP, Congress, JD(U), RLD and SP on the same stage. A rally was also organized in Muzaffarnagar to bridge the Hindu-Muslim divide under the overarching umbrella of farmer identity. However, this campaign failed to make any impact during the elections which the BJP won hands down.However, on the land acquisition issue, after Opposition parties had joined hands in 2015 to call the government anti-farmer in and outside Parliament, the government was forced to retract its plan to bring key changes to the UPAs 2013 land law.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In western Maharashtra, the total number is 6,090. (Representational Image) In the region of Marathwada, the total number of banks is 1,889 and in Vidarbha it is 2,626. In western Maharashtra, the total number is 6,090. (Representational Image)The crop pattern in western and north Maharashtra gives an advantage to the farmers to avail of higher loan component compared to their counterparts in the backward districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra, officials in the agriculture ministry said.A source in the government said: The agriculture loan for cultivating pomegranate per hectare sanctioned is Rs 90,000, grapes is Rs 80,000, sugar cane is Rs 80,000 and for banana it is Rs 80,000.These are the main crops grown in the 10 districts of western and north Maharashtra.Whereas loan allocated per hectare for soya bean is Rs 40,000, tur (pulses) is Rs 30,000, cotton is Rs 40,000 and jowari is Rs 25,000. These crops are grown in the 19 drought-prone districts of Vidarbha (with 11 district) and Marathwada (8 districts) in the state. These two regions include 14 distressed districts that have recorded higher farmer suicides in the state in the past 15 years. The crop pattern of the farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada fetches lower loans, a government official said.While average loan allocation to farmers in western and north Maharashtra comes to a minimum of Rs 2.80 lakh, for their counterparts in Vidarbha and Marathwada it is Rs 25,000.To enable the backward districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada to avail of a higher loan component at par with the economically prosperous districts of western and north Maharashtra, the state government is likely to urge the Centre to consider other parameters, including agriculture land price and labour cost, in the investment category.A source said: The state government is going to take up the issue with the Union Agriculture Minister, Radhabmohan Singh. A proposal is being worked out to facilitate higher allocation of crop loans for the backward districts of state.Several experts in the agriculture sector have pointed out that crop loan allocations cannot be determined on investment cost and crop pattern alone. The cost of investments should also include labour and land prices.A preliminary study of an agriculture experts committee has said: The six-decade-old parameters to allocate crop loans will have to be revised and re-evaluated to provide higher incentives to small and marginal farmers in the backward districts of the cotton belt of Vidarbha and Marathwada. The investments in cotton per hectares may be lower compared to sugarcane or pomegranate. But the labour cost is much higher, which is not considered.Another argument is that when an individual seeks loan for buying a home, evaluation is on the price of the property and income. Similarly, agriculture land holding and its price can be considered while sanctioning crop loan. According to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), in 2017-18, the total crop loan credit for Maharashtra will be Rs 58,862 crore. Of which, Vidarbha will get Rs 14,327 crore and Marathwada Rs 13,735 crore. It is lower than the total allocations for western Maharashtra at Rs 20,762 crore.Of the total 1.36 crore farmers in the state, 65 per cent are in Vidarbha and Marathwada. In terms of small and marginal farmers, the percentage is much higher in these backward districts compared to the economically prosperous western and north Maharashra.Another area of concern that is being reworked is related to the expansion and strengthening of the financial network in the region of Vidarbha and Marathwada to bring it at par with western Maharashtra. The state government and NABARD are working to address the problems of providing better banking infrastructure.A NABARD report states: The credit flow is always higher in economically developed regions. The higher loan allocations is linked to a higher banking network.In the region of Marathwada, the total number of banks is 1,889 and in Vidarbha it is 2,626. In western Maharashtra, the total number is 6,090.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Every evening during the holy month, the streets around Minara Masjid are heaving with iftar food stalls and with people  those who are breaking their fast and those looking to just relish the meaty delicacies and sugary specials. There are some essential pit stops such as Noor Mohammadi Hotel (shami kebab and Sanju baba chicken), Bismilla (offal dishes), Janta Fast Food (quail tandoori), Noorani Milk Centre (malpua) and Suleman Usman Mithaiwala (phirni), not to mention the myriad kebab stalls and the famous khichda vendor at the end of the road.When I came to Mumbai for the first time in 2007, I went to Mohammad Ali Road (for iftar). When I joined [Sofitel] in 2015, I thought why not bring the experience of that street food here during Ramzan, says chef Shadab Ahmed Qureshi of Jyran  Tandoor Dining and Lounge at Sofitel Mumbai. The restaurant has launched a Mohammad Ali Road food promotion, which will continue until Eid later this month. This is the restaurants third edition featuring iftar food. On the menu are several Mohammad Ali Road favourites, albeit with a five-star twist.Tried and testedWe began with sherbets, essentially fruit juices spiked with masala. While the watermelon sherbet was refreshing, the pineapple one was cloyingly sweet. Theres a long list of appetisers, including cutlets, kebabs, and rolls of all kinds. The chicken achari tikka was a standout for its spicy pickle marinade and the succulent chicken perfectly cooked in a clay oven. The roti pe bhuni roti sounded great on the menu  lamb cooked on griddle, flavoured with red chillies and served on Indian bread. Though the lamb, served taco-style on a tiny roti, was well-cooked, it struck a single flavour note paling in comparison to the other dishes. The macchi tawa fry made with tilapia was competent enough. We tried both the vegetable and chicken cutlets, and the former one far outshone its meaty counterpart; indeed it was our favourite amongst all the appetisers. Not only was the patty juicy and flavourful, the semolina-encrusted top gave a crunchy texture to the cutlet, something that was sorely lacking in the chicken version.The gloriously meaty main course features bara handi, khichda, kheema pao, and a couple of offal dishes. We picked the gurda kaleji pao  a finger-licking delicious mix of lamb kidney and liver cooked till the organs turn pleasingly soft but not mushy. The fluffy mini paos on the side were warm and glistening with a dab of butter  perfect companions to mop up the spicy kidney-liver preparation. The menus pice de rsistance Khichda, the slow-cooked dish of lamb and mixed lentils with its mildly spicy flavours, is bound to be a crowd-pleaser. Khichda is more popular than Haleem in Mumbai, and if youre looking to try just one dish, I would recommend this, says Qureshi. There are biryanis and pulao on offer as well, but we left them for another day.Desserts galoreVegetarians have limited options, though the vegetable cutlet is far superior to most we have had in the city. After fasting the entire day, the body needs energy and protein, so meat is the best option, says Qureshi, explaining the paucity of vegetarian dishes in an iftar spread. Apart from the food, the restaurant has also gone to lengths to create the right ambience, with servers dressed in salwar-kurtas and skullcaps, and qawwali songs serenading us while we eat. The dessert menu has all the iftar specialities, from sheer korma and phirni to kulfi falooda and malpua-rabdi. The last item really stole the show: a scrumptious mini malpua topped with creamy rabdi; we may have groaned with pleasure.The Mohammad Ali Road Food promotion at Jyran, Sofitel Mumbai BKC is ongoing till June 26 and is only available at dinnertime from 7 p.m. onwards"

The participants, working in two groups had added butter, sugar, egg yolks and four to a KitchenAid mixer to get the dough to the right consistency.For Daniel Fernandes, whose family runs a catering business, the opportunity to hone his skills in patisserie, which his father has outsourced so far, is something he didnt want to miss. Much like the others who participated at this workshop held at Andheris Callebaut Academy, Fernandes had paid Rs. 15,000 for a class with Geuffroy a teacher at Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athne, Paris. Geuffroy one of Frances top dessert chefs began teaching at the prestigious culinary institute, Alain Ducasse Education (where hes the Pastry Director), six years ago.As part of a tie-up between the Taj and the Ducasse Education, Geuffroy is one of two chefs travelling the country taking classes with baking enthusiasts. This will be followed by a trip to the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM) Aurangabad where chefs from across the country will get a chance to learn new techniques, plating ideas and keep up with international patisserie trends. The workshop at IHM is an alliance between the Maulana Azad Education Trust and the Taj Group. To wrap-up, Geuffroy has a workshop in Delhi for Taj chefs from across north India.At the class, Geuffroy gamely fielded questions on vegetarian substitutes for gelatin and its proportion in recipes. The chef talked about different brands that hes encountered on his travelsoften leading to subtle changes in flavour and cooking time. There is a challenge with moving from place to place, he said. In the Philippines, I had to make a croissant, and I found it hard to find the right ingredients. But I have to oblige, to whatever circumstance and situation comes [and] constantly adjust. Its this ability to keep tweaking recipes, while teaching them, is one of the reasons that Geuffroy enjoys his job, and interacting with students. He elaborated, You need to have [the] understanding, if you dont have the right ingredient, there will be a difference.The participants, who varied from expatriate wives to Indians with a penchant for baking, were eager to learn, working to replicate the techniques shown. They took videos on their phones to make a note of the consistency that the pate  choux should achieve before being piped onto a baking tray and topped with chopped peanuts, walnuts and almonds. Working collaboratively, the members of each group took turns working with ingredients, manning the mixers, whisking ingredients, zesting lemons, filling piping bags and then piping out dough. When asked why she enrolled, Klara (who declined to give her last name), a Hungarian whos been living in Mumbai for three years says, the opportunity to improve my technique, In the same breath, she added, and to meet a big chef.As the class took a break for lunch, I chatted with Geuffroy as he talked about working with seasonal ingredients like the king of fruits.

However, breaking of the fast, which is known as iftar, post sunset every day, and the fellowship they share then, is as important as prayers and other rituals for them. The large variety of iftar food items is something that appeals to foodies across all religious faiths. During this time, many pop-up stalls serving Ramzan delicacies mushroom on streets across the city. So, it won't be hard to find eateries where you can tuck into food that is made specially for iftar. Though Chennai isn't as big on Ramzan food scene as other cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai or even Bengaluru are, it is definitely getting better year after year. Check out the number of food stalls and the variety of food available in areas like Periamet, Royapettah and Egmore, and you'd know what we are talking about.Farooq Ali Syed of Pista House, who has set up a stall with his brother in Chennai, says, ""Food scene in Chennai during Ramzan is definitely improving every year. That's why we're back in Chennai for the third time. We are from Hyderabad. Every year we see an increase in the number of our customers. And it has not only been the Muslims, people from other communities, too, come here to have a bite of our iftar special,"" says FarooqAbid Zahid Sait of Abid's can't agree more. ""We were the pioneers in getting haleem to Chennai, in 2007. It was all about educating people at that time and getting them to taste haleem, which is an acquired taste for many. Now, the market has opened up, and how! Though there are several places, both big and small, serving iftar specials, there aren't that many takers, yet. It is still small compared to other big cities. We have a long way to go, but there is definitely an increase,"" says Abid. From specials like mutton haleem, Hyderabad biryani, mutton and chicken starters, gravies like dum ka murgh, roast mutton, aloo gosht korma and not to miss, the special nombu kanji  there is no dearth for options in this city. The spurt in demand has only opened up an increase in variety, too. ""Haleem is a sell-out every single day. Owing to the growing demand, this year, we have also started making chicken haleem. The festival of fasting is become all about feasting,"" smiles Nazeef Ahmed TM of Fisherman's Fare.And when it comes to the desserts, there's a bigger variety. Starting from the khubani ka meetha, shahi phirni, ande ka meetha to caramel custard, there's loads to choose from. Bharat Bhandari of Indiska Magic has specially come out with a variety of date sweets, baklavas and kunafa. ""We have chef L Syed chef from Egypt, who makes it in an authentic manner. This is the time people look for variety as well as something that's light on their tummy. They usually consume date after their meal as it releases sugar slowly. And this is why we wanted to provide variety,"" says Bharat."

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

This has helped villagers get rid of water tankers. More than 1,190 villages have become tanker-free.Fadnavis was interacting with more than 18,000 participants in the fifth episode of Mi Mukhyamantri Boltoy programme in Mumbai on Sunday. Many had joined the interaction from across the state via video conferencing.The Jalyukta Shivar projects are enhancing the irrigation potential of 25,000 villages across Maharashtra and will make them drought-free, Fadnavis said, adding that they will also help provide clean drinking water. The policies entail detailed planning with special focus on water recharge projects to elevate the underground water table. Our planning aims to make villages not only water-neutral but also get access to clean drinking water, he said.Fadnavis was asked by Sandeep Choudhiry from Thane about what steps the government has taken to complete irrigation projects. Fadnavis answered that the government has given priority to projects which have been languishing despite 75 per cent of the work being completed.In the last 15 years, resources were spread thinly in the irrigation sector and large number of projects were started, but none of these could benefit people, he said. Our government taken every project which would enhance irrigation potential on priority. We have completed 100 projects which will bring at least one lakh hectare of land under irrigation. Another 140 projects would be completed in next two years, he said.There are 23 mega projects which I personally monitor periodically through my war room to assess the progress address problems. Their completion would bring 32 to 40 lakh hectare of land under irrigation, he added. Chitali Asolkar (Shegaon) from district Buldhana asked when villages would get water supply like cities. Fadnavis said, The government has already launched a special project Mukhyamantri Jal Yojana for which Rs 2,500 crore has been allocated. The work is underway and Rs 900 crore has been released.While discussing the water policies, he said, A lot of impetus is given on identifying and strengthening underground water sources across all districts. The projects to strengthen water sources will ensure sustained water supply in villages.

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Thats what a team of researchers led by the Indian Institute of Technology  Bombay (IITB) found when they used a process to extract pectin a gel-forming substance used as a universal additive in jams, jellies, ice creams and cosmetics  from the peels of Indian and Australian mangoes. The study is a part of the ongoing research on fruit waste, based at IIT-Bs bio-refinery.The research assumes significance as India produces 40% to 48% of the worlds mangoes.Currently, pectin produced from citrus peels and apple pomace is imported for Rs700 to Rs900 a kg from Germany, Mexico and China, owing to a lack of manufacturing capacity in India.Waste from fruits a global issue Globally, fruit processing industries contribute more than 0.5 billion tonnes of waste.There is no such data available for India.But, primary data on waste from mango processing factories in Maharashtra that was part of the study found that medium scale industries produce up to 50-100 tonnes of waste per day.In contrast, the five-member team extracted pectin using lemon juice, which is a natural acidifying agent. Despite being such a vast country, India doesnt produce pectin, which is used in food, confectionery, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, professor Amit Arora, principal investigator, Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas, IIT-B.India produces millions of tonnes of mangoes, but all we now do is compost the peels and generate biogas. We, thus looked at an alternative green approach, in which the mango pulp is extracted and the peels processed right next to the industry without any hazardous chemicals, he added.Mango peels consist of approximately 20% to 40% of the total mango processing waste (by weight) generated in industries.The team conducted experiments on Indian mangoes, which showed that the amount of pectin in mango peels varies from 20% to 30% of total peel weight, as compared to commercial sources of pectin from citrus peel (15% to 20%), apple pomace (10% to 15%), sunflower (15% to 25%) and sugar beet (10% to 20%). To make the process of extracting pectin eco-friendly, the IIT-B and Monash University-led team replaced hazardous mineral acids with lemon juice as the former generates effluents, which need to be treated before they are released into the environment.Conventionally, industries use mineral acids nitric, sulphuric and hydrochloric to extract pectin that gels in presence of highly concentrated sugar.We used lemon juice to ensure that when we use waste, such as mango peels, it shouldnt result in us producing even more waste, said Jhumur Banerjee, a doctoral student at IITB Monash Research Academy. The effluent from the current process is comparatively safer as there is no mineral acid waste as a by-product.In addition to preventing acidic effluents, pectin, when extracted using lemon juice, was low on sugar in jams and jelly since it can gel in presence of calcium, which researchers said is a new concept in food additives for products such as low-calorie food and beverages."

Call it the collateral damage of demonetization or sehri feasts becoming less indulgent and the rich turning more altruistic, but this year, whatever extra cash there is is finding its way to charity.Till last year, sehri parties were a rage with a section of the city's rich Muslims. Those who held these parties previously--most of them builders say demonetization, combined with inflation, has forced them to cut down on indulging friends with offers of sumptuous food post-midnight. ""This year, we are not holding any sehri party, but will certainly hold Eid milan in July (Ramzan ends on June 26),"" says Bandrabased builder Khalid Qureishi, whose sehri dos at Rizvi Colle ge Complex in Bandra would attract the who's who in town, including actor Sanjay Dutt.Qureishi laughs it off when asked if demonetization has had an ""effect,"" but a source says most builders who earlier held such parties are feeling the pinch post-notebandi. Some say the ""realiza tion"" of Ramzan's real value has dawned on them now.""The holy month is granted by Allah to purify body and soul with prayers, reflection and contemplation. We don't want to throw away our money on holding sehri parties. Instead, we try to help the poor eat nutritious meals in the night and celebrate Eid comfortably,"" says Parvez Lakdawala, another builder in Bandra who too held sehri parties in the past.The tradition of dishing out food packets for Ramzan and Eid has picked up. Haji Arafat Shaikh, president of the Maharashtra Shiv Vahtuk Sena, the transport arm of the Shiv Sena, stopped holding parties during Ramzan a couple of years ago and now directs the money to buy ration for the poor. ""Why spend money on feeding the well-fed? We are distributing food packets among the poor in not just some of the impoverished localities in the city but also in distant suburbs like Mumbra and Nalasopara,"" informs the Vahtuk Sena's vice-president Sajid Kassam Supariwala, who supervises the distribution as Shaikh is currently away on Umrah (the mini-Haj) in Mecca. Former MLA Yusuf Abrahni began a campaign in the beginning of Ramzan this year, pleading with people not to ""waste"" their money on sehri or iftar parties but instead help the impoverished imams and muezzins in Mumbai. ""So far we have distributed around 80 pack ets among imams and muezzins in the city . The packets include all the essential things like sugar, ghee, tea, flour, spices, dates,"" explains Abrahni.Even some medical practitioners have taken to approaching the rich. Eminent cardiac surgeon Dr Zainul Hamdulay hopes to raise around Rs 3.37 crore this Ramzan to fund 100 bypass surgeries, as many angioplasties and 500 angiographies for the poor and the underprivileged. ""Most of our donors are Muslims who contribute with their zakat money (2.5% of the annual savings),"" says Nagpada-based Dr Hamdulay .However, some, like the managing trustee of Mahim Dargah Sohail Khandwani, claim the sehri parties have not ended, only the format has changed. ""Every night, 800 to 1,000 poor people are fed iftar and sehri by Mahim Dargah Trust with the help of some wealthy individuals.Parties in Ramzan are still there but increasingly not to indulge the affluent,"" says Khandwani."

Incidentally, 84% of the land earmarked for the highway project is agricultural.Already caught in the spiral of high input costs and diminishing returns, the highway project is another reason for disquiet among local farmers. The recent farmers protests in north Maharashtra were triggered by the governments land acquisition policies among others.Not just this expressway, but all big-ticket projects cheat farmers, said Ulka Mahajan, an anti-land acquisition activist who had led the protests against the Mahamumbai Special Economic Zone in Raigad. Many farmers agree that road projects such as the Mumbai-Nasik highway will essentially leave them by the wayside.Their list of grievances against the government is long. Top among them is the administrations alleged lack of transparency in land acquisition. Farmers say no social impact assessment was done and the issue of compensation to landless labourers was ignored.They are also not impressed with the price  four times the current market rate  that the government is offering selectively. Our land is irrigated and we can grow crops the whole year round. I dont think you can put a price on that in Maharashtra, said Dhanaji Waghchowre, Shantarams brother.Farming has mostly ceased to be profitable, pushing more and more farmers into a deadly debt trap. According to estimates, 1,129 farmers committed suicide between January and May this year. Majority of these suicides are from Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmers practice dryland farming. And many of those who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods dont want to give up their lands because theres no viable alternative. The three Waghchowre brothers are among them.As far as Shantaram remembers, the last time he made a killing was in September 2013. Then, he had got Rs 5,000 for a quintal of onions. Belonging to the vegetable belt of Nasik, Shantaram made a cool Rs 2.5 lakh by selling his 50 quintals onions to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).Prices have gone downhill since, and so has his financial well-being. 2013 was the best thing to have happenedThis year the price is down to Rs 350 a quintal. I wont even recover my input costs, he said.Farmers spill milk on the road during a demonstration protest over various demands in Nasik. (PTI FILE PHOTO)With onions bringing him tears, he has scaled down his ambitions. A farmer lives on hope. I wont plant onions across my five acres but half an acre is my gamble. Something might pay off, he said. Nearly 40 quintals of unsold onions lie covered under a tarpaulin outside his mud and thatched house adjacent to his field.Onions, however, are just one of Shantarams many problems. Novembers demonetisation hit the family hard and curtailed their access to cash. Then ready-to-harvest tomatoes were lost in a hailstorm in May, resulting in a loss of Rs 40,000. The family thereafter also lost one of its bullocks and the tilling of land in the new sowing season suffered a setback.The Waghchowres are the typical small Maharashtra farmer with three brothers and their families living off the five-acre field. But what separates them from the rest is their irrigated land, courtesy a well and a pipeline that brings water from the Kadwa river nearby. Not every Maharashtria farmer is as lucky, with only 18% of land tilled in the state being irrigated.Report card This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguish Soil quality No soil health card yet from the government Water source: Irrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyNote: This year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on time This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguishIrrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyThis year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on timeShantaram and his two brothers feel that though life isnt exactly good, it could have been much worse without the land. Besides onions, they grow tomatoes, brinjals and sugarcane. Their field is normally lush green even at the height of summer. But that does not necessarily translate into a windfall as there are too many imponderables plaguing the farm sector, including unseasonal rains, pest attacks and price fluctuations.Shrinking profits and heightened unpredictability have put the family in a quandary. The money the brothers make is just enough to feed the family of 10, but inadequate to service their debts. A far bigger challenge at the moment for them is to get Dhanajis daughter Suvarna into a college.The girl has just passed Class 12, the first to do so in the family, but is facing an uncertain future.Where will a farmer get Rs 70,000 by the end of the year for college expenses? asked her mother Sunita. Despite bountiful production, hope is in short supply among farmers of Maharashtra.This is the second part of HTs series, #BeingaFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh."

However, the core committee of ministers, headed by revenue minister Chandrakant Patil, fixed some eligibility criteria for the loan advance. And some of the norms were not acceptable to the farmer groups holding talks with the state government.Most of these norms were revised on Tuesday and a fresh notification will be issued incorporating them. One of the norms fixed by the committee was that farmers with four-wheelers would not be eligible for the advance. Now, that norm has been revised and farmers who own a vehicle of up to Rs 10 lakh will be eligible for this advance.Similarly, the government had decided that families of government servants or members of the panchayat samiti or sugar mills administrative body will not get the benefit. Even this norm has been revised: Now, a government servant who draws a salary less than Rs 20,000 and is also a farmer can avail of this scheme. Members of the panchayat samiti too would be included in the scheme. Similarly, members of the administrative bodies of sugar mills too would be eligible.On Tuesday, most district cooperative banks in the state were unable to provide the Rs 10,000 instalment citing cash crunch or low liquidity. Government sources said they have asked all the banks to make the necessary funds available.In a related development, the government has said it will no longer hold talks with the coordination committee of the farmers after the latter staged a protest on Monday against the decision to cap the loan waiver at Rs 1 lakh and set the cut-off date as June 30, 2016. ""We will now hold talks with small groups in their individual capacity. The committee that calls itself representatives of the farmers is fuelling the issue to gain political mileage out of it. So, the government will not hold any discussions with them from now,"" said a senior BJP minister, who is on the committee."

I think we are quite sorted after that meeting, Fadnavis told HT.Fadnavis indication was that the new understanding with the Sena goes beyond presidential polls, and would last until the end of his governments term.Sources in the BJP told HT that Shah had told Sena that after BJPs compromise in handing out the mayors post to the party after Mumbai civic polls , more support was expected from the ally. And, a decision to not back the BJP in presidential polls just for the sake of opposition, would be seen as the last straw for the alliance.Read: Why is BJP tolerating Shiv Sena?What has settled the diatribe for now is that both alliance partners are not keen on mid term or early polls.As such, in the meeting, it was decided not to stretch things to a point of no return.Meanwhile, in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers protests and the BJPs perceived bias against the co-operative sector, Fadnavis said that his party would continue to root out corruption in the sector, but was supportive of the co-operative movement and network as a whole.In the last two years we have only tried to clean up the co-operative sector. We believe the sector is there to stay and is very important to Maharashtra. However, we will focus on stringent laws to keep check on the scams in the co-operative sector. Our laws have withstood legal scrutiny, said Fadnavis.The BJP-led governments approach towards the co-operative sector, whether it is sugar mills or banks, is being questioned by political opponents. Congress and NCP dominate the co-operative network of sugar mills and banks in the state.However, the state government managed a turnaround on Wednesday by getting the Reserve Bank of India to accept scrapped notes deposited in these banks worth Rs 2,772 crore.This is a significant decision.Unfortunately, due to corruption, our co-operative banks started losing their relevance. There are scams in 16 co-operative banks, all under the tenure of the former government. The problem is that penetration of co-operative banks is high in Maharashtra, and it will take nationalised banks at least three to four years to set up their network. So, if co-op banks are not there, in certain areas we will have no institutional banking facilities, said Fadnavis.They destroyed the banks, we are trying to rejuvenate them. I feel that these institutions have always helped farmers and by destroying them (the former government) has done great injustice to farmer."

5a0616009855b76bf13c3983,Dispirited wine industry struggles to stay afloat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dispirited-wine-industry-struggles-to-stay-afloat/article19143605.ece,2017-06-25,"Excitement about reds and ross ran high when the wine industry took roots in India three decades ago. But the industry wears a pallor now, with many among the 100-odd wineries across the country  mostly in Maharashtra and Karnataka  either struggling to stay afloat or shutting shop.In Maharashtra, of about 75 wineries, a majority of which were started after the government offered subsidies to encourage wine production, only a few remain robust. About 12 to 15 small-size wineries are surviving on local wine tourism, and boutiques or bulk sale of wine. The rest, mostly saddled with loans, are closed or on the verge of closure, multiple sources in the industry confirmed.On paper, around 50 wineries could be working. In fact, those that are not in the market are also keeping their licence active by paying the licence fee, which is meagre, a winery owner said.In Karnataka, where 17 wineries are registered, the pressure has started showing. Unable to weather the cut-throat market conditions, a winery on Bengalurus outskirts recently merged with a top winery that has a nationwide presence. According to industry sources, at least three more wineries in the State are up for sale and more may follow suit. One winery has stopped production. Some have reduced the quantity of grapes crushed. In fact, the Karnataka Wine Board, the first of its kind in the country set up to promote wine, has not received any application to start a winery in the last three years.It is difficult for small players to sustain in the industry. Wine production has become an expensive affair, with labour becoming scarce. At the retail end, it becomes very difficult for the small wineries to sell their wines, said Bengaluru-based Heritage Wines producer P.L. Venkatarama Reddy, who is merging his business with the countrys largest wine brand, Sula. Only companies with deep pockets can survive in the wine business, he added.The managing director of Bagalkot-based Elite Wineries D.V. Guraddi also acknowledged the precarious condition of the wineries. It is a very tough industry working on meagre margins. Most wineries are making losses.A small pieA large part of the problem is the small size of the wine market in a country where consumption is restricted to a few large metros.Though the volume of wine sold has more than trebled in the last 15 years, industry estimates peg the current per capita consumption of wine to be a meagre 10 ml to 15 ml per annum, when compared with the global per capita consumption of around four litres per annum.The wine market, which is currently estimated to be around Rs. 500 crore (including domestic and imported wine), forms a tiny fraction of the liquor business in the country, but remains crowded. While the total volume of sales in the Indian liquor industry is pegged at around 560 million cases annually, the combined sales of wine in the country is pegged at just around 1.5 million to 1.6 million cases. The four biggest wine makers  Sula, Grovers, Fratelli and Big Banyan  together have nearly 80% of the market share. Market leader Sula alone has more than 60% of the market share, industry veterans say.Though figures show a nearly 25% growth annually, it is mainly the cheaper wine segment, and not the premium wines segment, which is growing at 2-3%, said Parag Kamat, the chief operating officer of the Nashik-based Charosa Wineries, which is backed by Hindustan Construction Company. According to him, the selling and marketing cost of wine is very high. The cost is also high in the production of good wine, he said. To add to this, the industry has not seen an exponential growth. The industry, which was hit badly by recession in 2008-2009, has been seeing only an incremental increase. Unless the business has sound financial backing, wineries cannot sustain in market in the long run.Different rulesDifferential excise rules across the country have also put wine makers in a quandary, especially prohibiting smaller players from accessing these markets. Currently, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa and Delhi continue to be big markets for wine consumption.There are different rules applicable in 36 States and Union Territories, and high fees limit the spread of wines in these States. The volumes from each winery under each brand is low compared to the liquor business, which is limiting the growth of the wine industry. It is not sustainable, said Neeraj Agarwal, executive vice-president (Operations) Sula Vineyards.In fact, in some States, it is easy to register an imported label without even selling a single bottle in any other State, he added. However, local wineries need to show that they have sold a minimum number of cases in other States. This is a ridiculous rule for domestic wineries, he argued.Wineries have also been affected by policies in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the market potential is huge. In a bid to protect their own wineries, both Maharashtra and Karnataka have imposed high fees on wines brought from outside their States. While this has limited the access to small wineries, the bigger wineries have bought or tied up with local wineries to sell their brand, wine and logistics consultant Robin Somaiah said.Unreasonable discounts sought by the retailers to push wine has been another bane. Sometimes, the discount sought is so much that it does not even cover the production cost  it can go up to 50%. How can wineries be expected to hold margins and reinvest to improve quality of wines? Mr. Somaiah asked.Farmers affectedThe problems plaguing the wineries have had a cascading effect on the farmers in the last few years. Vineyards developed on contract farming have shrunk, with many shifting to cultivation of table grapes or sugarcane.In and around Bengaluru, where wine varietal cultivation started in the late 1980s and where brands like Grover and SDU have their wineries, the real estate boom has also triggered the uprooting of vineyards by farmers who saw a better return in real estate.While the Karnataka Wine Board claims the State is having nearly 2,000 acres under wine grapes cultivation, industry estimates say the figure could be around 500 acres. Many farmers under contract farming have shifted to other crops. I also shifted from wine varietals in a portion of my land, said viticulturist V.G. Patil, who has been a consultant to many wineries in Karnataka. Wineries which were unable to sell their stock stopped buying grapes from farmers with whom they had a contract. Wine varietals of grapes  unlike the table variety  cannot be sold to consumers. So farmers had to shift, said Mr. Guraddi. He estimates that about 40-45% of vineyards may have been uprooted in the wine regions of north Karnataka.On a more optimistic note, Mr. Agarwal said that though the area under wine varieties reduced after the global recession in 2008-2009, re-plantation had started in the last couple of years. Approximately 600-800 acres of plantation is happening annually in the last three years, more than 50% of which has been added by Sula alone, he added.Enquiries with other wineries also suggested that more area is being brought under cultivation only by companies as farmers are wary of their income being dependent on the fortunes of wineries.Only companies with deep pockets can survive in this businessP.L.

Dilip Kagda Gadkari arrives at the conclave on Tuesday. Dilip KagdaSwitching to biofuels such as ethanol and methanol, besides biogas, will make India pollution-free and generate employment, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said here on Tuesday.Alternative fuel sources such as ethanol, biogas and compressed natural gas which are cost-effective and pollution-free are the way forward for the country and the state, said the minister. He was speaking at the valedictory function of Badalta Maharashtra, a two-day conclave organised by Marathi daily Loksatta of The Indian Express group.He said that switching to ethanol, methanol and CNG will also empower farmers. Ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel produced by fermentation of sugarcane found in abundance in Western Maharashtra.We should promote large scale production of ethanol to meet the demand in the country. We would not need to import any fuel from any country, said Gadkari.If the transition is achieved, the country can cut down its dependence on petroleum. This will help reduce the countrys imports and make the country self-sufficient in fuel. If we increase usage of ethanol, companies such as Bharat Petroleum will become redundant and shut down, said Gadkari.Gadkari announced that the government is planning to convert one lane of the national highway between Mumbai and New Delhi into an electrified lane for electric buses and vehicles. We are planning to convert the last lane of the highways from Mumbai to Baroda, Baroda to Ahmedabad and Ahmedabad to Delhi to electric lanes, said Gadkari. Currently 55 buses in Nagpur run on ethanol, he said.Among other plans, the minister expressed the possibility of a bus service between Mumbai and Pune that will run entirely on ethanol. He urged officials and policy-makers in Mumbai to consider launching methane-run public transport in the city.Individual cars and vehicles must be discouraged and people should be encouraged to use public transport only, said Gadkari.Electricity tariff will be halved by 2030Electricity tariff will be halved in the state by 2030 as envisaged by the governments masterplan for development of energy resources, said Maharashtra Energy Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. He said the plan has been prepared bearing in mind the estimated rise in residential consumption of power.Currently, the demand for residential consumption is pegged at 23,000 MW but will increase by 1.5 times in a few years. The plan has been prepared keeping that increase in mind, said Bawankule at the Badalta Maharashtra conclave.The minister pointed out that by breathing life into several erstwhile defunct power plants such as Koradi, Chandrapur and Parli, the government has been able to generate 3,200 MW power and plug the shortage of power. He also claimed that the cost of production has dropped by 30 paise.Bawankule said that to meet the increasing power demand in Mumbai, the generation capacity will be increased from 3,800 MW to 5,500 MW.The minister announced that soon he will bring the tariff of distributors Tata Power, Reliance Energy and Maharashtra State Energy Distribution Company Ltd at par for usage of energy till 300 MW.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Projects like Gorakhpur Metro, to come up at an estimated cost of R12,000 crores , are among the dream projects of the CM and officials from the departments concerned have been instructed to ensure they materialise in time .Rapid transit: Gorakhpur Metro on the anvil The Gorakhpur Metro, connecting major routes in the city, seems to be the best plan to tackle traffic snarls, making commutation faster, easier and comfortable for office goers, students and locals.Officials from Rail Technical and Economical services (RITES), the government agency which entered an agreement with the Gorakhpur Development Authority (GDA)to prepare detailed project reports, have been visiting different localities to assess traffic load and conducting surveys.RITES has been entrusted with the task of preparing a detailed project report on Gorakhpur Metro within eight months. Within two months of agreement with GDA, they have to complete 25% of DPR work  said ON Singh , vice chairman, GDA, adding that the total estimated project cost of Gorakhpur Metro was around Rs12,000 crores.Introduction of Gorakhpur Metro would not only ease huge burden of traffic on roads and bring down pollution level but also help provide employment to jobless youth.No one had ever imagined that one day Metro would run in a city like Gorakhpur. Indeed this has become possible because of the personal interest of the CM who wants that Gorakhpur should not remain a backward area, BTech third year student Yashpal Singh said.AIIMSSetting up of the 700-bed AIIMS on 112 acres land of Ganna Shodh Sanstha in Gorakhpur is another ambitious project of the central and state governments which would boost growth in the city and help government deal effectively with ailments like encephalitis , the most fatal disease of east up which claims hundreds of lives every year.On July 1, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of AIIMS and fertilizer factory and assured people that he would not let a single child die of encephalitis .Giving pace to the project, DM Rajeev Rautela leased the land in the name of AIIMS for 90 years last week.Work on construction of three and half km long boundary wall of the site was initiated by service providing firm in March.AIIMS will be like a new ray of hope for encephalitis patients .It will also reduce burden of encephalitis patients at BRD Medical College ,where patients from 36 districts and even Nepal report for treatment , said DR RN Singh, paediatrician.Fertilizer factoryThe fertilizer factory which was once the pride of the city before closing down in the late 90s, is set to be revived to manufacture neem-coated urea for farming. The project is expected to be completed in three years, at a cost of R6,000 crore. Over 3,850 metric tonnes of urea will be produced here every day, helping in the green revolution.Youths, including those passing out in chemical engineering from MMMUT, would have a chance of employment at the factory, said Mohd Azhar, an engineering student.Two closed sugar mills in Padrauna and Munderwa will also be revived to usher in growth.Under the new industrial policy to be announced by the state government, east UP, particularly Gorakhpur, was to be developed as an industrial state , CM Yogi Adityanath had announced during his recent visit to Gorakhpur .Tax exemption and land at cheaper rates is what the government plans to attract investors here . Such policies s will further fuel growth and create more job opportunities .It will also help check migration of youths who move to Mumbai, Delhi and other big cities for livelihood, BJP leader Satyendra Sinha said.Better connectivityThe citys road and air connectivity will also be improved. After new Spicejet flights for Delhi and Kolkata under Udan scheme last year , flights for Mumbai and Kathmandu were also on the cards, MoS Civil Aviation Jayant Singh had announced during a programme at Gorakhpur airport on June 14.Power sectorThe government will spend Rs 214 crore to improve power distribution system under IPDS scheme and Rs 90 crore for underground power cables, said AK Singh, chief executive engineer, Gorakhpur zone . Of the 16.29 houses, only 11.53 lakh have power connections in Gorakhpur, depriving 4.76 lakh consumers of electricity. Under the IDPS, all such houses will be covered. Capacity of 18 substations will be enhanced while four new substations will be set up, Singh said.Tourism sectorGorakhpur and its surroundings have immense unexplored potential in tourism. The government has allocated funds for about half a dozen projects, including sound and light shows at Gorakhnath temple, revival of Chauri Chaura memorial and Budhdhist circuit in Kushinagar , said Tourist officer Arvind Rai.International flights from Kushinagar are also on cards to attract foreign tourists."

Chavan Centre near the State Secretariaton on Monday to demand more benefits for farmers who regularly repay their crop loans..The farmers, hailing from the village which was the epicentre of the recent agrarian protests in the State, said Mr. Pawar assured them that he would look into their demands. The farmers are planning to meet Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday. The BJP-led government on Saturday had unveiled a Rs. 34,022-crore farm loan waiver scheme to write off debts up to Rs. 1.5 lakh and give relief to about 89 lakh farmers.However, a steering committee of farmers leaders rejected the mega loan waiver scheme on Sunday saying there should be no upper limit for the waiver. Under the scheme, farmers who regularly repay loans get 25% relief on the amount paid, which is capped at Rs. 25,000.Abhay Chavan, a farmers leader from Puntambe, said, We regularly repay our crop loans. The governments loan waiver scheme helps us up to Rs. 25,000 only. Those who have outstanding loans up to Rs. 1.50 lakh are going to benefit more. We think this is unfair to us.Mr. Chavan added, Most of us grow grapes, sugarcane and soyabean. Our crop loan limit is quite high compared with farmers growing foodgrains. When our loan turns bad, the amount is more than that of farmers growing cereals and pulses. We are not going to benefit much from such loan waiver schemes.Dattatray Dhanwate, another member of the delegation, said, We met Mr. Pawar because he understands our issues thoroughly. Our demand is that we should get benefit up to Rs. 50,000 because many farmers would not benefit from the existing scheme. If a farmer gets Rs. 25,000 in return under the scheme, it is quite less. Mr. Dhanwate added, Some senior farmers from Puntambe village are going to meet Mr. Fadnavis on Tuesday. The loan waiver scheme announced by the State government is not satisfactory,Amol Teke, another farmer, said, The State government should withdraw all cases against the farmers without any condition. Early this month, several parts of Maharashtra witnessed large-scale protests by farmers demanding a loan waiver and remunerative prices for their produce. The protests started from Puntambe and spread to other regions in the State."

On Wednesday, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley gave no immediate assurance to state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who called on him on this issue in New Delhi.Mungantiwar sought Jaitleys intervention to direct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow nationalised banks to lend the state government Rs34,000 crore with a staggered repayment schedule over four years so that it can repay farmers loans. He also requested Jaitley to increase the cap on the states open market borrowing by Rs15,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of Rs35,000 crore, putting the state government in a position to raise funds for the waiver.According to information, Jaitley asked Mungantiwar to deal with the RBI for the loans and staggered repayment.The state government will have to deal with the RBI for the loans at a lower rate and their deferred schedule of the repayment. With permission to borrow and additional Rs15,000 crore, we can manage to raise Rs34,000 crore, Mungantiwar told HT.The state plans to shift the old loans that have been borrowed at a high rate of interest of about 10.5% to 7.5% to save about Rs40,000 crore on its outstanding loan of Rs75,000 crore from open market borrowings. The state has also requested the Centre for the waiver of the pre-clousure charges on the payment of the outstanding loans.Mungantiwar also requested Jaitley to extend the permission to export onions by three months to ensure rates in the domestic market do not fall on the backdrop of the bumper crop. Maharashtra farmers have produced 2.05 lakh metric tonnes of onion and the production is 25% more than the average. Similar rise in the production in other parts of the country has resulted in the fall in procurement rate of onion. The extension to the export permission by three months will prove beneficial to farmers in getting good procurement rate. Jaitley has assured us to positively consider the demand, Muntantiwar said.Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday began the procedure to waive off loans by issuing government resolution (GR) notifying the eligibility of the loan waiver. The notification stated farmers who have restructured their loans between April 1, 2012 and 2015-16 and have become defaulters till June 30, 2016 will be eligible for the waiver of up to Rs1.50 lakh per farmer. It has also clarified farmers seeking the benefit of a one-time settlement of their outstanding more than the waiver limit of Rs1.50 lakh, will have to first pay of the remaining amount to seek the benefit.It has reiterated that except Class-IV employees, the families of the government servants, legislators, ex legislators, corporators and the members of cooperative sugar factories, district cooperative banks, cooperative milk unions will not be eligible for the loan waiver. The government has defined the family of farmers as husband, wife and children below 18 years. This means the nuclear families of the farmers will be separately entitled for the waiver.Read more:Farm loan waiver: Maharashtra to seek Centres help to raise 34,022 crore from banksMaharashtra readies game plan for farm loan waiver"

Cultivation of water intensive crops like paddy, banana, sugarcane in major areas disturbed the demand and supply system, he said.Talking about the role of politicians, he said, If governments had directed the farmers to stick to the cropping pattern, then there would not have been a tussle. But politicians kept the issue alive for political gains. He added, Our politicians never felt it was necessary to inform farmers to link their crop pattern with rain pattern. When there is no coordination between crop and rain patterns, there is more demand for water. They assured to get more water from Karnataka. How can they get more water when there is no water? he asked.Singh said he had five rounds of meetings last May with farmers, industrialists and other stakeholders to find a solution. Farmers are unhappy as crops failed and were ready to find a solution. He hoped that experts and judges coming together to constitute the commission would resolve the issue amicably.Mahadayi issueIt is a geo-hydro morphological issue. Earlier Mahadayi was flowing towards east but now has changed its direction to west, like rivers Sharavathi and Kali. The natural flow diverted because of development and soil erosion, he said. There is no problem between Karnataka and Maharashtra but Goa has raised the issue. The Karnataka CM is eager to resolve the problem in the interest of north Karnataka people, he said.Diversion of Sharavathidemand for water is increasing with increase in density of population. Diversion of the Sharavathi river results in tussle between urban and rural people. So it is not a viable decision to divert the river water, he said.How to revive water bodies in Karnatakakarnataka is a teacher in water harvesting. Earlier, linking of lakes and tank system prevailed in the state and it was disturbed with the centralised irrigation system. Now again efforts are being made to re-establish linking of lakes and tanks with rivers. Definitely this would support in strengthening the water bodies, he said. Regretting the fact of more water bodies in the state being encroached, he said there were three challenges in the states water management system. It is encroachment, pollution and exploitation. The government has to come forward to identify and notify the encroachments."

The rupee has risen more than 5 percent against the dollar this year.That comes after the government in April allowed the duty-free import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar by the end of June to keep a lid on prices after local production fell by a fifth from a year ago.Nearly 60,000 tonnes of that 500,000 tonnes is yet to land in the country and the government is likely to extend the duty-free imports' period by up to two months, a government official, who declined to be named, said.""Right now refiners are processing duty-free imports. From the next month they could start importing (duty-paid) sugar for local consumption,"" said a sugar miller based at Kolhapur in Maharashtra. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media.Traders said predicting the scale of potential imports was tricky.""It is difficult to estimate how much Indian refiners will import ... (while) paying tax,"" said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.""The market has not anticipated additional imports. Once imports start, local prices could crash and could make larger imports unviable.""Local sugar prices have already fallen to their lowest level in three months in the wake of the duty-free imports and due to a cooler summer than usual, which curbed appetite for cold treats such as ice cream.""There is a need to raise import duty on sugar to 70 percent. Otherwise imports will pull down prices further and make it impossible for mills to pay the government's fixed cane price,"" said Baramati Agro's Pawar.India has increased by nearly 11 percent the price sugar mills must pay cane growers in the next sugar season beginning in October.There is no immediate plan to raise import duty on sugar and wheat, the government official said.""Mills cannot pay higher prices for cane unless they manage to sell sugar at higher prices,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.""There is a need to stop imports as next season we will be self-sufficient in sugar production.""India's 2017/18 sugar output is expected to jump a quarter from the previous year to 25 million tonnes."

Co-operatives could prove to be a new engine for growth, he said.Farmers are not getting as much benefit as they must get. Farmers must get a complete stake in the supply chain and this could happen through co-operatives, Prabhu said.Prabhu, speaking at the D R Gadgil memorial lecture organised by the Maharashtra Economic Development Council at Yashwant Chavan Centre, reminded that Gadgils contribution in setting up sugar co-operatives in the state had brought a change.Today, we are discussing farmers problems all over the country. Sugar co-operatives changed the entire landscape of Maharashtra. There are more than one lakh primary agriculture co-operative societies and they can work at grassroots with farmers to bring about a change. Building more co-operatives could help us solve farmers problems, Prabhu said.Prabhu added that self help groups (SHG) must be involved with co-operatives that could aid in socio-economic change. There must be a partnership between co-operatives and corporates which could bring about socio-economic change. SHGs can also work with co-operatives which will aid the economy, he said.In the new economic order, farmers must benefit. As farmers constitute more than half the population, they must be our focus group in India. Their income will increase, Prabhu added.Speaking on initiatives of the government, he said significant changes happen only after a period of time. Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be a game changer. Make in India will change the GDP profile of the country. Many other programs like Swachh Bharat and Digital India will also initiate changes in the coming few years, he said.The Railway Minister said that a group has been set up to study the impact of GST on railway operations. Inevitably, all sectors will be affected (with the GST rollout) We are studying the impact. In any case it is the law of the land so we will adopt it. We have already set up a group to look into the implications of GST on all our operations, Prabhu said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

You may, at most, get Rs 10 difference (compared with non-sale) on some items because BigBazaar is anyway known for low prices, Prashanth said.Better products at a lower price would have been worth it but the same products at just Rs 10 or so off is not too satisfactory, she added.Prashanth wanted to buy a microwave, a dustpan, a bedsheet and teacups but finally settled for a bed sheet sold at a 60% discount on a retail price of Rs 1,199.Naseer Ahmed, a travel agent, too was not satisfied.I was looking only at clothing. The products are good but the discounts arent too much, he said.The retailer was largely offering a 2-22% discount on food and groceries items, reflective of their new cheaper pricing under GST.Sales keeps on happening but this is a price reduction which is permanent, said Kishore Biyani, chairman and chief executive officer of Future Group, which operates Big Bazaar. Biyani was talking of the sales offers in June.For those who just bought groceries, the sale lived upto its promise.It was a pleasant surprise for me...If this (grocery) comes at a 30% discount then theres nothing like it, said Akanksha Singh, a credit analyst at a bank.In Mumbai, regular big bazaar customer Raghunath Bhattacharya too was happy man.I bought daily consumption items and got some discount which is a relief, said Bhattacharya, 60, who visited the mega store in Mahim.There was also panic buying as many people are rise boom in cost of essentials.The most visible change under GST is the payment receipt which now reflects the tax slabs for the state, Centre and intra-state transactions. (Kavya Kothiyal/LiveMint)At a Star Bazaar store in Mumbais Andheri West, one customer filled four shopping carts with groceries such as biscuits, rice, tea powder, noodles, soaps and detergents, as she felt the prices would go up post GST.The prices will shoot up from tomorrow and for a middle-class customer we would definitely look for such sales. Normally, I wont come for shopping at midnight but if something cheap is available on your plate for a limited number of time, I would try not to lose a chance, said a 45-year-old woman.Under GST, daily consumption items such as milk, fruit and vegetables, food grain, pulses and cereals have been exempted from tax. Sugar, tea, coffee, edible oil and newsprint have been placed in the lowest slab of 5% while ready-made garments will be taxed at 18%.For others still, a sale is a sale and means better prices.I made up my mind to come for shopping at Big Bazaar as soon as I came to know about the mega sale late in the evening, said Poornima Shah, 20, who is confused about the impact of GST on her daily purchases.Consumer fears of rising prices drove sales across retail stores last month. Moreover, retailers also offered steeper discounts as they looked at making most of the old tax regime.I am surprised business has gone unprecedently high. I thought the business would go down but the business from our expectation is 30% up, said Biyani.The most visible change under GST is the payment receipt which now reflects the tax slabs for the state, Centre and intra-state transactions and also shows harmonised system nomenclature (HSN) or the master item code.This is unlike the Value Added Tax (VAT) regime where bills just reflected the MRP of the items and discounts with a summary of the applicable taxes at the end."

Eating out will be costlier. Watching movies at a multiplex will cost more, as will staying in premium hotels.Air conditioners and television sets will be more expensive. Salon and spa services will cost more.The general perception is that even buying a house and then furnishing it will cost more once the goods and services tax (GST) kicks in on 1 July, say consumers.Overall there will be some escalations in costs. Everything will become more expensive. There will be very few basic things that will become cheaper, says Rajesh Kurup, 40, an architect in Mumbai, who expects no relief to consumers from GST, at least in the short term. In the long term, it could be different, he says.Under GST, daily consumption items such as milk, fruit and vegetables, foodgrain, pulses and cereals have been exempted from tax. Sugar, tea, coffee, edible oil and newsprint have been placed in the lowest slab of 5%.When it comes to packaged consumer goods, most items like detergents, hair creams and colours, shampoos, liquid detergents, liquid soaps and instant coffee are under the highest tax slab of 28%. Soaps, toothpastes and hair oils have been spared.The GST rate for these goods is higher than under the current tax regime, where the indirect tax on most packaged consumer goods is in the range of 20-24%, said a 19 May report by Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. Ltd.We will be paying more for everythingfrom eating out at restaurants to buying air conditioners and television sets, says Aparna Shinde, 26.Shinde says goods like televisions, refrigerators and air conditioners are household necessities today. Also consumers like herself are frequenting restaurants more often. To continue to lead the same lifestyle under GST will cost more, she says.Pankaj Sharma, 30, a digital marketing executive, agrees with Shinde. The costs of everything from mobile bills to eating out at restaurants, travelling and staying at hotels will be more expensive. Even branded clothes will become more expensive, he says.With multiple messages on social media on GST and the expected tax rates on various goods, consumers are confused about what the real impact will be.I am not really sure what will happen... There are so many different news reports on social media about the prices of various goodssome will increase, some will decrease. but we will know the reality only on 1 July, says Vishwajit Mane, 33.According to Mane, the general perception is that GST will improve ease of doing business for corporate entities but for consumers, it may only increase expenses."

5a06343e9855b76bf13c4324,The great avocado show,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-great-avocado-show/article19201494.ece,2017-07-03,"You know a superfood has gained serious traction when it makes news, rages across Instagram, and has restaurant menus dedicated to it. The avocado, once happily married to onion, tomato, cilantro and lemon juice, in the humble guacamole, is the latest to get upwardly mobile. It has found its way from the first course in swanky eateries to the last. You can have it smashed, pulped, frozen, charred, tossed in a salad or blended into a shake.Hip millennials have raised its demand to the point where the avocado has become hot rather than humble, and its price point in India is comparable to anywhere in the world.In Mumbai to showcase the versatility of this ingredient is Australian chef Scott Pickett. In two varied techniques, Pickett shows that the avocado can be made to obey any instruction. It can excite your palate and fuel taste buds when simply charred and served with olive oil and salt or sugar. Conversely, it can cool you off at the end of a meal when whipped into a chocolate mousse and served with berries and cherries. Says Pickett, When you use it to make ice cream, you are replacing milk-based fat content with avocado.With great power comes talkThe avocados status as a superfood has made it a talking point over the last year, and not just in Australia alone.As Pickett observes, With the world being so much closer, thanks to social media and the Internet, superfoods that are popular become a simultaneous trend the world over.This is why, there are at least two avocado-themed restaurants worth mention. Amsterdam has locals and tourists mad for The Avocado Show, while Brooklyn, New York, has the Avocaderia. Both restaurants serve up avocado halves in place of burger buns in their burger, while the former even pairs it with hummus and toast, in a nod to the popular smashed avocado on toast. Theres avocado in side dishes as well  trussed up with truffles and oils, served with salmon and caviar, and even married into a burrata.Much as Pickett loves avocado, he isnt keen on forcing it into every bite you take at any of his four Melbourne restaurants.Reining in the fad, he says, I think there is a place for everything. It can definitely be part of a meal, but Im not sure if I would like everything avocado.Experimental muchSpeaking of how chefs and foodies are playing with their food in Australias foodie state of Victoria, where Pickett is from, he says that the lack of an established culinary history (like India has) means that the treatment of ingredients is always under scrutiny.Whos to say what ready means when it comes to avocado? We are actively developing ways to cook and use the fruit at different stages of readiness. If its firm, charring works great, and served as a side with the main meal.A ripple set off in Australia last year made waves all the way to the front pages of western media when Australian columnist Bernard Salt wrote that millennials were unable to afford homes because they were spending $20 on avocado on toast. The furore this generated across oceans simply had more people lining up to see what the fuss was all about. Smashed avocado gained street cred in kitchens everywhere. Now, the time is right, feels Pickett, to take the interest into creating dishes beyond his beloved smashed avocado on toast.Trend mentalityHe wouldnt go as far as the avo-latte though, which is a regular latte served in the skin of an avocado. It was created as a joke in Melbourne before cafs around the world sincerely followed suit. They missed the joke, grins Pickett. Doctors in the UK  where sales of the fruit shot up over the last year  have even coined a new condition called avo hand for the injury sustained from cutting avocados.While the most popular variety of avocado sold is called Hass  named after the American postal worker Rudolph Hass  the latest variety that everyones excited about is the Teeny Tiny Avocado, developed by Trader Joes. Its lime-sized, ripens faster than your regular avocado, and is a perfect single serving. However, it hasnt made its way to your local grocerToo much of anythingAs for that fat content some people worry about, says Pickett, too much of anything is bad. And that is why the avocado too must be only one of the many things you eat. Its health benefits also outweigh the perceived negatives. Meanwhile, people who have had enough of the avocado are calling it the over-cado. Of course, here in India, we havent even got started, not really.Game of numbersOver four billion avocados were consumed in the US in 2016 alone."

The notices identified them as beneficiaries of the alleged benami assets.The notice was issued under Section 24(3) of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 2016.Earlier, Bhujbal had appealed to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court to release him so that he could vote in the presidential election, which the court allowed a couple of days ago.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was hoping to come out of jail for the first time in one and a half years when the IT Department brought new charges against him.The assets attached include Girna Sugar Mills in Nashik valued at over Rs 80.97 crore and a multi-storey residential building Solitaire in Mumbai's Santacruz West suburb valued at more than Rs 11.30 crore.

(File photo)Benami assets worth Rs 300 crore of NCP leader Chagan Bujbal and his family have been attached by the Income Tax Department, which has slapped charges under a newly enacted criminal law against them. The department said the assets were allegedly created by them using a maze of about four dozen shell companies.In fresh trouble for the jailed former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, the I-T department has issued notices for provisional attachment of assets of Bhujbal, his son Pankaj and nephew Sameer Bhujbal, and has identified them as beneficiaries of the alleged benami assets.The attachment notice, accessed by PTI, has been issued under Section 24(3) of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 2016 (where the taxman thinks the person in possession of the property held benami may alienate the property).The immovable assets attached under the order include Girna sugar mills in Nashik valued at over Rs 80.97 crore and multi-storeyed residential building Solitaire in Mumbais Santacruz West area valued at more than Rs 11.30 crore.While the mills are in the name of Armstrong Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, the house is in the name of Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd.The attachment also includes the Habib Manor and Fatima Manor building in Bandra West area of the Maharashtra capital valued at over Rs 43.61 crore (benamidar: Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd) and a plot of land in Panvel in Raigad valued at over Rs 87.54 crore (benamidar: Devisha Infrastructure Pvt Ltd).While the total cost of the attached benami assets has been valued at over Rs 223 crore, the department has said the market value of the assets is more than Rs 300 crore.The department has identified a total of 44 shell companies which invested funds in two of the three firms identified as benami in the order. Violators of the law, enacted in 1988 but implemented from November 1 last year, attract a rigorous imprisonment of up to seven years and fine up to 25 per cent of the fair market value of the property. Benami properties are those in which the real beneficiary is not the one in whose name the property has been purchased.The order, issued after over four months of investigations by a special I-T team, said the probe clearly shows that the properties were acquired out of unexplained funds of the Bhujbal family, which was routed in guise of share at high premium in the group of companies of the Bhujbals, through a web of shell companies based out of Kolkata, Mumbai and other locations.The department has held that the source of funds of these companies of the Bhujbals is fictitious and unexplained cash credit under sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.The order has also relied upon the statements recorded by the ED, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), of dummy operators and Chartered Accountants of the Bhujbal Group to establish the benami assets charges.Chagan Bhujbal, the MLA from the Yeola assembly constituency in Nashik, and Sameer are at present lodged in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai after they were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) last year in a money laundering case.The I-T department will now move for confiscating these assets after getting approval from the Adjudicating Authority of the Act. The Act allows for prosecution of the beneficial owner, the benamidar, the abettor and the inducer to benami transactions.It also says that the assets held benami after final prosecution are liable for confiscation by the government without payment of compensation. The tax department, last month, had charged six family members of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, including wife, son and daughters, under the benami assets law in connection with its probe into land deals worth Rs 1,000 crore.As per official data till May 23, the I-T Department had identified 400 benami transactions in the country and provisional attachment of assets was done in about 240 cases.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The delivery of raw sugar started arriving in India last month.According to sugar experts, prices of sugar came down heavily in the international markets due to excessive production and devaluation of international currencies. The government's decision brought down the wholesale prices by Rs 100 to 150 in the domestic market Vijay Autade, state executive director of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Cooperative Sugar factory, said, ""Sugar prices in international market have heavily come down due to various factors. As of now Central government has levied 40% import duty on sugar, but prices of ready and raw sugar have already gone down. There is potential threat of another major slot of imports. Indian importers easily earn profits with existing import duties.""He added, ""Therefore, our bodies at state and national level have demanded a hike in import duty from 40% to 60% for a level playing field. If we increase import duty, then prices of sugar would remain around Rs 3,500 per quintal at par with domestic producers.""P G Medhe, another sugar expert, said, ""Sugar factories take loan against sugar stock to pay sugarcane bills. Therefore, stable sugar prices are requisite to repay bank loans. If government imports sugar as it is available at a lower cost, it would badly affect the domestic industry. Hence, the government should hike import duty in the interest of domestic sugar industry and farmers.""Another expert, on condition of anonymity, said, ""The government is trying to keep prices of groceries at the lowest level. Hence, it would try to import sugar. But while appeasing the middle class, it should also think about local industry."""

The special team will verify documents submitted to the banks. We will submit a report to high court, detailing the action we have taken, said Bipin Bihari, additional director general of police (law and order).The scam came to light in August 2016, when Maruti Pandurang Rathod, an agriculturist from Gangakhed in Parbhani, needed money to treat his ailing father. After villagers, district central cooperative banks and Marathwada Gramin Bank refused to lend him cash, he approached the UCO Bank branch for an agricultural loan.However, the UCO bank manager told Rathod that he had already availed a loan worth Rs1.84 lakh from Andhra Banks Dharampeth branch in Nagpur, and as such, he was not eligible for another one.As Andhra bank refused to give him more details, Rathod could not find the beneficiaries of the loan. When Rathod went to the Nagpur bank, he found out that the loan had been repaid. The bank refused to give him more information, said advocate PD Bachate.Only after Dhananjay Mundhe, the leader of the Opposition in the legislative council, intervened, Andhra Bank revealed that Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Limited, a sugar factory, had siphoned the money without farmers knowing.The Nagpur-based factory had applied for a loan in Rathods name without submitting an application. The loan account prepared by the bank had been forged, said Bachate.Bachate said farmers in Marathwada rarely take loans as their crops depend on the rainfall. He added that Andhra Bank disbursed Rs39.17 crore; UCO Bank, Rs47.78 crore; UBI, Rs76.32 crore; BOI, Rs77.59 crore; Syndicate Bank, Rs 47.27 crore and Ratnakar Bank, Rs40.20 crore.The factory had given a corporate guarantee to all the farmers. The loan amount was first deposited in a current account that the company opened in the farmers names. It was later transferred to the companys account, added Bachate.Such a big scam could not have been carried out unless the factory had the banks support, said Bachate.The allegations are politically driven and are baseless. The dead farmers were alive when the account were opened. All gave us their consent. No notices have been served to anyone in connection with the case. We will file a reply on July 25th , said Madhav Nagargoje, advocate for the sugar factorys owner, Ratnakar Gutte."

It was further revealed after checking the CIBIL record that crop loan amount has been disbursed through the said sugar factory.It further stated, After conducting further investigation, it was noticed by the petitioners that the loan amount has been disbursed in the name of dead persons through sugar factory by the concerned banks.A total of six banks, including five nationalised banks  Andhra Bank, UCO Bank, United Bank of India, Bank of India, Syndicate Bank  and a private bank, Ratnakar Bank, have disbursed loan amount worth Rs. 328 crore in a similar manner. It was revealed after farmers themselves decide to investigate the matter with the help of local MLA Madhusudan Kendre.It is alleged that in most of the cases, the amount has been borrowed by tendering fictitious, false and fabricated documents to the bank. The concerned agriculturists have not consented nor tendered application forms for disbursement of the loan and that the benefits of crop loan have not been extended to those in whose name the amount is allegedly borrowed and deposited in the account of the factory.

Dhavale and R.M. Borde has asked the Director-General of Police, Maharashtra to conduct an inquiry by the EOW and has also asked other banks to submit all details regarding the loans.When contacted, Mr. Gutte said that the allegations are politically motivated. Look at the nature of allegations, these are frivolous in nature. But I would not comment on it since the matter is sub-judice, he said."

The Deputy commissioner of Income Tax (Benami Prohibition) Unit I, Dependra Kumar in Mumbai had on June 20 issued an order of provisional attachment as well a show cause notice on the properties.A copy of the order seen by TOI stated that investigations by Enforcement Directorate had revealed that the ""Bhujbals and their associates had acquired the immovable properties by investing his ill-gotten money through a web of shell companies based out of Kolkata, Mumbai and other locations.'' ED had earlier filed a complaint against Bhujal, his son, nephew and 30 others including and Parvesh Construction pvt ltd and their associates under Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The IT notice found that Armstrong Infrastructure Ltd as the benamidar which owned the Malegaon sugar factory worth about Rs 80 crore. The Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd has been identified as benamidar of Solitaire Building in Santacruz West, Mumbai worth about Rs 11.30 crore. The same shell company also owned Habib Manor & Fatima Manzil in Bandra West estimated to be worth about Rs 43 crore. The Devisha Infrastructure Pvt Ltd owned land at Rohinjan village in kharghar worth about Rs 87.60 crore.Bhujbal's advocate Sajal Yadav said, ""ED had already attached all the four properties and there is a stay by PMLA tribunal in Delhi on the Solitaire attachment. The IT has re-attached them which is unwarranted as the department must first demonstrate fear of alienation of the properties.''The ED probe was based on statements of chartered accountants of Bhujbal group, market operators who facilitated conversion of cash into purported share subscription at high premium for Parvesh Construction. The IT order said that ""it is clear that M/s Hingora Finvst is a bogus entity and used by the Bhujbals to channelize and integrate tainted funds and these tainted funds appear to be laundered in the guise of equity subscription of Parvesh Construction and Armstrong energy Pvt Ltd at unreasonably high premium with help of operators and CAs.''Bhujbals have been accused of running more than 40 shell companies through which they laundered their unaccounted money worth hundreds of crores."

Balakrishnan and Justices R.V. Raveendran and Dalveer Bhandari decided to hear the petition, filed by advocate Z.K. Faizan, after it was mentioned on Tuesday for early listing.The petition sought a direction to the Election Commission not to permit the MPs and MLAs, numbering about 200, to cast their votes from prison.The petitioner referred to the discussion between Parliamentary Affairs Minister Priyaranjan Dasmunsi and Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami on arrangements for the MPs and MLAs in prison to vote under special circumstances. The petition mentioned, among others, Mohd. Shahabuddin, Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, Umakant Yadav, Mukhtar Ansari, Amarmani Tripathi, Anand Sen Yadav and Akhilesh Kumar Singh.Section 62(5) of the Representation of the People Act says no person shall vote at any election if he/[she] is confined in a prison, whether under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation or otherwise or is in lawful custody of the police.Since the provision was intended to prevent criminalisation of politics in elections, it would be applicable to the Presidential polls too, the petitioner said. The court, however, declined to give an urgent hearing to another advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, who appealed against the Election Commission order declining to go into allegations against the UPA-Left Presidential nominee Pratibha Patil. It would be heard in the normal course on August 17. The Commission declined to go into his representation on the question whether she is an undischarged insolvent or not in view of irregularities allegedly committed by her and her family members in a cooperative bank and a sugar mill in Maharashtra."

A sum of Rs 111 crore has been withdrawn from the fixed deposits for paying salaries to the employees. It reflects a complete collapse of administration at all levels. I urge the governor to dismiss him,'' Munde said.Alarmed by rampant irregularities, particularly in the examination system, Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao had convened a special meeting to take stock of the state of affairs in the Mumbai University . He set July 31 as the deadline to declare the results of all exams. Munde urged chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to probe all the decisions taken by the former chief executive officer of the Slum Redevelopment Authority (SRA), Vishwas Patil. ""A week before his retirement, Patil cleared 450 files. Many files were brought to the SRA office on the day of his retirement on June 30. All decisions taken by Patil and proposals cleared by him should be stayed and a high-level probe should be conducted,'' Munde said.Following a tip-off, acting SRA CEO Milind Mhaiskar, who is also managing director and vice-chairman of Mhada took possession of all the files. Vishwas Patil said that he cleared less than 120 files a week before his retirement and that he was prepared to face probe by any agency. Fadnavis has taken the view that most of the files were routine, however, he has asked the new CEO to scrutinize all the files cleared by Vishwas Patil.Munde has demanded a probe by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate into the transactions of Gangakhed Sugars, a factory controlled by Ratnakar Gutte. ""Loans were obtained by Gangakhed Sugars without the knowledge of farmers. They have received notices for repayment. The total debt stands at Rs 650 crore,"" Munde said."

They found that weed or pot usage among students has increased substantially in recent times. The findings came as a surprise as psychotropic, synthetic and recreational drugs such as heroin, brown sugar or mephedrone (MD) were thought to have replaced weed in campuses since 1990.It has been decades since we came across instances of marijuana abuse among college students, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), ANC, Shivdeep Lande told HT.The plan to crack down on college students, code-named drug free campus, was conceived by Mumbai police commissioner Dattatreya Padsalgikar a week ago, as part of the polices drug-abuse awareness campaign, which was launched in colleges on June 26.During the awareness drive, we received complaints that drugs were being peddled and abused within and outside colleges, sources said. Based on this information, the police commissioner ordered the top-secret crackdown.Undercover ANC sleuths fanned across campuses and peddlers were identified. A college in Kandivli (West) was the first to be raided. On Wednesday, four drug peddlers were rounded up from there and 1.10 kg of weed recovered.This was followed by raids near a college in Ghatkopar and another in Worli, where a kilogram of the banned substance was found and two were arrested. In the final raid, near a college in Bandra (West) on Thursday, two more peddlers were caught. Of the eight peddlers arrested, three are women.ANC sources said peddlers at most colleges had only marijuana, while the Bandra peddlers also had 60g of heroin.ANC veterans attribute the recent increase in weed abuse among college students to several factors.The all-out crackdown against mephedrone  including the ANCs raids on two manufacturing units in January  led many clandestine units in Mumbai to shut in haste, said a senior ANC officer, who did not wish to be identified. The arrest of a few key members in the supply and distribution chain had spread panic among middle-rung conduits and street peddlers. Many of them are suspected to have fled to Bangkok to avoid police detection or possible arrest.Simultaneously, the Narcotics Control Bureau and customs department have cracked down on the smuggling of synthetic drugs, such as LSD, into the city via airports and ports. This has dealt a severe blow to the supply of the imported contraband.This has also led to a surge in the popularity of weed among students, as the drug is easily available and cheap.DCP Lande said the cannabis seized at the college campuses had been sourced from Ganjam district in Odisha, where the contraband is available freely.The peddlers carry small quantities of the drug, about 10g, in small polythene sachets, which are sold for Rs300 each. They deliberately carry small quantities to minimise losses and evade harsher punishment, Lande added.Interestingly, students who tried weed for the first time told police they had mistaken the grass-like drug for herbs. Most of them were introduced to the drug [packed into cigarettes or rolled in papers] by former students, who are the key members in the supply chain , an ANC officer said."

Whether it was his favourite plate of bhajiyas or the frequent cups of chai, he didn't care much about the effect it could have on his health and his waistline. But that's not the case anymore. Harikrishna has now realised the importance of a proper diet and he is not the only one. Cops across the city, from the top rank to the constabulary, have started keeping track of what they eat like never before.This positive change has come about in recent times after Police Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar initiated workshops for the Mumbai Police force that focussed on eating right and staying healthy.Life has changed a good deal ever since, not just for the men in uniform, but also for their families. As constable Nitin Bhosle says, ""There's a huge difference in the way we cook food at our home now. It has very little oil and my mother and wife both understand why it's necessary to eat right.Our families are supporting us to maintain our fitness levels.""The women in the house have taken it upon themselves to help their husbands stay fighting fit. Inspector Sadanand Mane 's wife Sailee, who is into fitness herself, makes sure that her husband eats at regular intervals. ""I pack several tiffins for him. The idea is to make sure that he eats nutritious food through the day. They do a hard job and their timings too can be odd, so it's important that they don't skip their meals."" Her husband agrees. ""Our jobs are hectic and we tend to eat at any time. I know of many cops who used to skip breakfast; they would just have a cup of tea and set out for work. But things are changing for the better now and people are realising that erratic food habits can have an adverse effect, not just on our weight, but also health,"" says Mane. The emphasis is a lot more on veggies andsalads, fruits and juices in many police households.Meanwhile, the canteen at the Police Commissioner's Office in Crawford Market smells different now, what with the cooks being given some serious instructions. ""Earlier, we didn't have fruit salad in the canteen, but now, we do and that's a hot favourite among the cops,"" observes Assistant Police Inspector Feroz Patel, adding, ""The workshops have helped many policemen make simple changes in their eating habits, which are showing positive results. Around 50,000 booklets on healthy eating were also printed and distributed among the policemen.""Dietician Rujuta Diwekar , who conducted the workshops for the policemen, says, ""What has made this project a success is the fact that the commissioner is so hands-on. We first held workshops for the cops, after which he suggested that we conduct them for their families as well. And that really worked. Little changes in one's diet can go a long way. Like I have told them, they could start their day with a banana instead of tea, have a wholesome meal between 4 pm and 6 pm, and instead of having many cups of tea throughout the day, they could opt for sugarcane juice, coconut water or kokum sherbet.""Another big change that has taken place is when the cops go for their bandobust duty. Says Rujuta, ""Earlier, they were served chai and biscuit. Now, it's poha, kokum sherbat and rajgira chikki. There's a change taking place in the system; it is a good beginning and I'm sure it will only get better from here."""

Even Engineer wouldnt have anticipated that in the days to come the search for the next India coach would end up as some grand diabolical roast that lampooned the stalwarts of the game and the system they were part of.In hindsight, had the petulant skipper been indulged early by putting sugary sweet Ravi Shastri in a cone or on a stick  depending on his preference of course  and handing it to him in May itself and not as late as mid-July, the sun would have continued to shine brightly from the rainbow-hued skies of cricketopia. A few tears would have been shed for the outgoing coach but remember, at the end of the day, Anil Kumble was a bowler. The 619 wickets are fine, thanks for the effort, but he wasnt the Fab Four, was he?As for Tendulkar, Ganguly and Laxman, with their halos glowing ever so brightly, they would have continued to wave and smile at fans through their retirement years. The BCCI suits would have strained their hands patting their own backs. The Committee of Administrators, for overseeing the quick coach switch, would have expected to get a very good from the bright red pen of Supreme Court in the margins of their homework book. All they needed to do was give Shastri to Kohli the moment he made a face. It was as simple as giving a candy to a child.They eventually did that  late night on July 11  but long after the ceiling fan at Indian crickets Hall of Fame had thrown the fertiliser around. It was ugly from the start. The initial cast was: Kumble, the conniving autocratic alpha male; Sehwag, the establishment candidate; Shastri, the yes man. Its easy to blame the media for this name-calling and ridicule them for trusting their sources but they were merely being messengers. There were insiders ready to express their angst, or on some occasions, pedal their agenda.After the three protagonists came the perpetual optimists  Tom Moody and Richard Pybus. You wondered what chance these outsiders had in this reunion of men who had spent their entire youth together. How could Paaji, Dada and Lachhubhai pick Moody or Pybus over Viru or Ravibhai? A more representative panel than the one that had three close buddies from the same generation would have been more suited for this job. More so in this season of revamp, when the howling winds of change were carrying words like conflict-of-interest and good governance from the rooms of the Supreme Court to the cricket maidans.Once Kohli remained stubborn and rejected his one-time seniors call to sort out his differences with Kumble, the spotlight was on Ganguly. Thats because Shastri had re-applied. Just a year ago, Ganguly had rejected Shastri, even humiliated him, by not turning up to interview him and asking Kumble to apply. Till a day before the eventual announcement, Ganguly seemed to be hinting it was anybody but Shastri.It all changed overnight. Surprisingly, Ganguly hasnt yet thrown a fit, a tantrum or a resignation letter. Had Shastri improved as a coach in a years time or has Ganguly mellowed? What happened to the man who had kept Steve Waugh waiting? Where was the prince who took on the establishment? By all accounts, Ganguly too loves being in the commentary box and sitting on the Bengal cricket chiefs throne at Eden Gardens. He is also an expert on a news channel. It so happens that the same media group that has Ganguly on its rolls first broke the stories about Kumble quitting and Shastris selection. Someone needs to run a fine comb into Gangulys media contracts to see if he, along with giving expert comments, also needs to break stories.Then theres V.V.S. Laxman who shares the dug-out with Moody during the IPL season  the latter was among the coaching aspirants. Laxman is said to have recused himself during Moodys presentation. Thankfully, no one from the Mumbai Indians dressing room applied or else Tendulkar too would be doing the same. The meeting room would have needed a revolving door.Such situations arise since these are not paid panelists. Unpaid part-timers on ad-hoc committees cant be held accountable. While most sporting bodies globally are embracing professional sports administration, crickets superpower believes in honorary roles. They still want the world to believe that Indias former greats live on air and adulation. Our superheroes cant have salary slips tucked in the pockets of their tights.The BCCI officials too came across as bungling figures. They first failed to smell the dressing room rift, they later brazened it out and eventually got beaten by the media in announcing the name of the new coach. At the end of it all, the SC-appointed administrators were sporting a forced smile, exposing their lack of teeth. They werent informed when the BCCI, in a bid to accommodate Shastri, extended the deadline to apply for the coachs job. It didnt disturb them that the cricketers committee was in a conflict of interest situation.A day after the coach saga ended, they sent out a statement. Defining the role of a coach they said, A coach is a mentor  a friend and an elder buddy. The coach has to provide backroom support. They could have just said the coach has to be Ravi Shastri. They go on to conclude that they wanted to put the immediate past to rest and hoped that the sun shone brightly from the rainbow hued skies of cricketopia.Postscript: Those who bought that dream also bought flying pigs and walking fishes.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Titled Usamadheel Bibtya (sugarcane leopard).In the last four years, Junnar region has seen a significant rise in cases of man-leopard conflicts. According to Junnar Forest Department officials, at least one case of man-leopard conflict is reported every 10 days. To highlight the safety measures to avoid such attacks, the department has made a documentary.Titled Usamadheel Bibtya (sugarcane leopard), the film was released last week and has been shot in Junnar region over the last one year. Through this documentary, we want to raise awareness about the nature of leopards and why they have made sugarcane fields their home. The documentary also aims to apprise the audience about what measures one can take during a man-animal conflict. We have been creating awareness through various mediums, such as brochures, lectures, workshops. But an audio-visual medium has a stronger impact, said Arujun Mhase, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar Forest Department. Mhase added that though the problem of leopard-animal conflict started from 1999, it has increased in the last four years, with growth of sugarcane farming.He added that there are various reasons why leopards have left the forests and come near the human settlements.Sugarcane fields come across as secure and safe shelters for leopards. They prey on local animals, such as goats, dogs, hare, etc. Also, water is readily available near the fields. Female leopards find the dense sugarcane fields a safe place to give birth. Spotting newborn cubs in sugarcane fields is a common sight for the villagers here, said Mhase.The documentary will come in handy in reaching out to people during awareness programmes. We aim to screen it in schools, colleges, among other organisations. Besides, since the documentary has been converted into a DVD, we will share it with forest officials in Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Mumbai, which are facing similar cases, he added.Sharing excerpts from the documentary, the official discussed the shy nature of a leopard and why it runs away after seeing a human being. It attacks only when provoked or threatened, he said.The documentary, Mhase said, also suggests measures villagers can take to avoid a conflict with the big cat. For instance, while stepping out alone at night, one should intentionally make noise to alert the animal  either by whistling, playing a song on the cellphone, singing a song, or merely carrying a torch. Hearing any sound will alert the animal and it will run away. Children should not be allowed to pass through a secluded area unaccompanied.The film further advises people to keep their livestock properly locked during the night. Keep your surroundings clean and ensure that no carcass is lying around. If a leopard is hungry and does not find a prey, it may stray into the nearby area for food. On seeing a leopard, the villagers are advised to inform the forest department or the local police official immediately, said the official.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Girvarsing Devda, who used to work at a sugarcane stall of the victim's daughter, had decamped with jewellery, and currency notes and coins amounting to over Rs 3 lakh.A liquor shop-owner, to whom the accused had handed over part of the booty of Rs 1,100 in coins, as payment for liquor, turned out to be a key witness who helped nail him in court. The coins were recovered from the witness.Chetnaben Vora, daughter of the victim, Nirmala, went to her stall at about 11.30am on November 4, 2012. She said she called her mother in the evening and chatted with her. She further said that at 9.30pm, her mother did not answer her calls. Chetnaben said that when she returned home at 11.30pm, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood, with a deep injury on her neck . She recalled that two cupboards in the hall were open, their drawers were pulled out, and clothes were scattered around. After she screamed for help, neighbours arrived at the scene and called doctors and cops.Cops suspected the accused, after he did not return to work at the stall the day after the incident. He was traced to Udaipur, Rajasthan, where he had absconded. Besides the statement of the liquor shop-owner, the court also relied on the statement of Rajkumar Chaudhary, who had seen the accused near the house on the day of the incident. Chaudhary, who worked with a supplier of sugarcane, said he had gone to the victim's house to deliver sugarcane at 5.30pm.The court pointed out that jewellery and other articles were recovered from the house of the accused. ""All these proved facts are sufficient to fully establish that only the accused had committed the charged crime. All these facts are inconsistent with innocence of the accused,"" the court held."

There are fears that if rains are insufficient, 25-30% of the total area under cultivation may have to be resown, said an official from the agriculture department.Officials say Gondia, Amravati, Bhandara, Buldhana, Akola, Washim, Beed are some of the worst-affected districts, which have received barely 50-75% of the average rainfall.Sowing has been completed on nearly 65% of the 139.64 lakh hectares of cultivable area in the state  which adds up to 82 lakh hectares.""There has been an issue with sowing due to the long, dry spell and crops like soyabean, moong, tur, rice and sugarcane will be hit. Cotton which is grown on a large scale in the state will not see a lot of problems as it sustains on the moisture of the soil, but if the dry spell continues then cotton too will be affected,"" said a senior official.Resowing, if required, will increase the grower's input costs on seeds and labour and have a bearing on financial planning for the season ahead.Principal Secretary, Bijay Kumar said field officials are undertaking surveys to ascertain the damage. Relief measures will be undertaken based on their findings. ""We have ample supply of seeds ready. Whenever there is a requirement for resowing, the cost of the seeds are borne by the government. The same policy will be applicable in this case too,"" said Kumar who will himself undertake a statewide tour starting on Thursday.Officials said the state government has sent out advisories to farmers asking them to start sowing only next week and wait for clarity from the Indian Meterological Department.The agri department is also trying to convince farmers to sign up for the state's crop insurance scheme. ""After a good monsoon last year and with prediction of surplus rainfall this year, the tendency to pay premium for the insurance scheme is not there. And if rains fail this year and if they have not signed up for the insurance then they will not get anything,"" said another official."
5a071bcf9855b76bf13c7b1c,Tracing the history of ‘honeyed urine’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2017/jul/13/tracing-the-history-of-honeyed-urine-1628354.html,2017-07-14,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Did you know that diabetes is one of the oldest diseases known to man? Of course, it was not known as diabetes in ancient India but as madhu meha or honeyed urine. As early as 1,500 BC, physicians noticed that ants were attracted to the urine of certain patients who had complained of frequent urination, fatigue and thirst. They observed that this urine was sweet or honeyed. Interestingly, the ancient Greeks believed that frequent urination, which was one of the symptoms of the disease, was caused by flesh that was melting down and being converted into urine. Further observations by Indian physicians, Charaka and Sushrutha around 400 to 500 BC added to our knowledge of madhu meha. They identified two types of madhu meha, and categorised the first type as being associated with youngsters and the second type as affecting obese older people.The word diabetes itself was coined in 200 BC by a Greek physician, Appollonius of Memphis. It means to siphon or pass through. The name was first recorded in English in a medical text written around 1425. It was in 1675 that Thomas Willis added the word mellitus - meaning honeyed or sweet - to diabetes, and today the disease is known as diabetes mellitus.The first test for diabetes was the urine taste test. In ancient times, people known as water tasters diagnosed diabetes by tasting the urine of people suspected of having the disease. If you ask me, it was a rather unpleasant way of earning a living! It was only in the 1800s that scientists developed chemical tests to detect the presence of sugar in the urine.By the twentieth century, tests for blood glucose- the term used for the sugar present in your blood- were developed. In 1964, a drop of blood was placed on a paper strip and then washed off. Comparing the colour to a standardized colour chart gave the doctor a rough indication of the level of glucose in the blood. Today, there are different tests for diabetes. FBS is a test that has to be performed by drawing a blood sample from a vein, after twelve hours of fasting.It measures the fasting blood sugar levels. After giving a blood sample to determine FBS, the patient consumes a heavy meal. Approximately between 11/2 to 2 hours after eating, a second blood sample is drawn from the vein for testing. This is known as the Post Prandial Blood Sugar test, or PPBS test. A third test is the Glucose Tolerance Teat or GTT which is performed after consuming a concentrated amount of glucose dissolved in water.If you have been confirmed as being diabetic, your doctor will probably ask you to have a test called HbA1c done as well. Why is this test considered an important diagnostic tool for diabetes?To understand this, let us backtrack a little. Haemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. It gives your blood its red colour and carries oxygen to different parts of the body. When the glucose in your blood builds up, it binds to the haemoglobin, to make a glycosylated haemoglobin molecule. This molecule is called haemoglobin A1C or HbA1C. The more glucose there is in the blood, the more haemoglobin A1C or HbA1C will be present.The HbA1c test identifies a three month average of glucose concentration in the blood. The reason a three-month average is taken is that after four months, red blood cells begin the process of decay. For people without diabetes, the normal range for the haemoglobin A1c level is between 4 per cent and 5.6 per cent. Haemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7 per cent and 6.4 per cent mean you have a higher chance of getting diabetes. Levels of 6.5 per cent or higher mean you have diabetes.FBS and PPBS levels give us information about the present, while HbA1c levels give us to give a picture of blood glucose control over a long period of time. In fact, HbA1c is the only proven indicator of a persons risk of developing complications. Both tests are important in order to get immediate, as well as the long-term information that is needed to make decisions about managing the disease. search of honeyed urine!The author has a PhD in Biochemistry from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and retired as Head of the Food Technology and Enzyme Engineering Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research centre, Mumbai."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

A higher crop output is anticipated following increased sowing of rice and pulses when compared with the last season.The latest Union Agriculture department data showed that across the country, kharif crops have been planted on 563.17 lakh hectares till now, as against 521.80 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year.Increase in acreageWith the sowing of crops apace during the past few days across the country, paddy (rice) has been sown in 125.77 lakh hectares in the current season till July 14, which is marginally higher than the 120.32 lakh hectares recorded in the 2016-17 season. The acreage under pulses has been recorded at 74.61 lakh hectares till now, as against the 60.28 lakh hectares of the corresponding period for the last season.The sowing of coarse cereals is up as well, at 113.06 lakh hectares against the 98.79 lakh hectares of last year. But the total oilseeds sown has come down to 103.92 lakh hectares, when compared with 115.75 lakh hectares of last year.Cotton acreage is up this season at 90.88 lakh hectares, against 73.93 lakh hectares last year in the corresponding period. Sugarcane, too, continues to see an increase in acreage and has been planted in 47.94 lakh hectares against the 45.22 lakh hectares last year. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), conditions are favourable for further advancement of the monsoon and overall rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over the next two weeks, from July 13 to July 26.Conditions favourableSowing of kharif crops has gained momentum during the past few days as the monsoon is progressing well. Paddy transplanting, though, has been a bit sluggish in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but it is likely to pick up in the coming days. Sowing of pulses is apace in the key growing states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, which is an encouraging sign, Anand Sharma, regional co-ordinator of the IMDs agricultural meteorology told, The Hindu .Apart from western parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the monsoon rains have covered most parts of the country, he added. The monsoon rain delivers about 70% of Indias annual rainfall and is critical for millions of farmers as nearly half the countrys farmland lacks irrigation and is dependent on rain."

This is only 14% less than the 1,543 cases recorded till June-end last year. The state had announced a limited loan waiver on June 3 and a Rs 34,022-crore loan waiver on June 24.Significantly, farmer suicides have actually risen in both Vidarbha 's Amravati region and the sugar belt of Western Maharashtra compared to last year. Amravati-the epicenter of farmer suicides in the staterecorded 503 cases compared to 483 last year. Western Maharashtra recorded 50 cases compared to 45 last year.The Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, continues to record the highest number of farmer suicides (629). While the Amravati belt saw a rise in cases, the Nagpur division with126 cases saw a 33% decline compared to last year.The arid region of Marathwada recorded 459 cases, a decline from 568 cases last year. North Maharashtra, epicenter of the recent farmer protests, recorded 223 cases, a slight decline from the 257 last year. The Konkan region has recorded only two cases so far this year.Besides the loan waiver, the state has also announced a Rs 10,000 loan advance for the kharif season. However, not much has trickled down to beneficiaries owing to procedural delays and stringent eligibility norms.Farm activists blame state policies for the continuing farmer suicides. ""We would have expected a sharper fall in the number of cases this year since last year saw a water crisis till May. The state needs to provide better prices for crops and also hike import duties to protect the domestic market,"" said Kisan Sabha's Ajit Nawle.The intermittent rains across the state have also led to the prospect of repeat sowing especially in the Vidarbha region. ""This will significantly hike the input costs for farmers,"" said farm activist Vijay Jawandhia.Farm groups are pressing for higher prices for crops, without which farm incomes are unlikely to rise. ""The support price for soyabean is Rs 3,050 per quintal but farmers are selling for Rs 2700 in the market. How will they break even?"" Jawandhia said."

There are fairies in Mumbai and not just the ones that are part of dreams. These are real men and women, who you may brush past on your way to work in the mornings, or if you are lucky enough, you may just spot one while going home in the amber twilight. They may not wave a wand, but they still have some magic to offer  in the shape of a book that's likely to pop up right next to you in a rickshaw, at a bus stop, in a nook by a leafy road or even on your seat in the local train! Mumbai's very own neighbourhood book fairies are leaving paperbacks at public spaces in the city for people to read. Why? To enlighten, educate and make the world a better place to live in.The book fairy movement came to light on International Women's Day, when 'Harry Potter' actress and feminist Emma Watson began leaving books on women empowerment at public spaces  in the subway in New York, on the Tube at London and at iconic locations in Paris. Since then, it has generated an army of 5,000 book fairies across the world  who leave paperbacks, hardcovers, adult colouring books, children's tomes and more on park benches, at bus stops, in libraries and on public transport. Mumbai is not far behind. Luxury professional Mahek Sareen decided to act on her desire to be a book fairy on her return to Mumbai after her studies in France. ""I'm inspired by Emma Watson and when she started the concept, I thought it was fantastic! It's already caught on in Paris and it was so nice to see it happening in Mumbai as we have voracious readers back home,"" she says.Today, the Mumbai book fairies are a steadily growing community, spearheaded by book fairy Kadambari Mehta . She and her little coterie have left books on travel, empowerment, love and romance, self-help, poetry and fiction at places like the David Sassoon Library, Mani Bhavan, little corner coffee shops, behind pillars and more. Much like a public library system, the finder is supposed to pick up the book, read it and share it again with someone else and keep the chain going. Says Kadambari, ""I have even left a book on a seat during a flight and at Mahabaleshwar, too. The whole idea is to encourage reading."" So far the books placed have been in English. ""Mumbai, being a cosmopolitan city, we see a huge potential for books in Marathi, Hindi and Gujarati. We also have had had a demand for books in Bengali,"" she adds.Each book carries a sticker instruction to take a picture with the book, hashtag it #IBelieveInBookFairies and post it on Instagram . Mahek Sareen, resident of Kandivali, left a Stephen Hawkings book in Mount Mary Church, Bandra. ""It was picked up by two girls, who took a photo with it and shared it with the hashtag. It feels good to know how far the book has travelled,"" she smiles."" Malad-based marketing professional Jaita Guha left a book on geishas in a rickshaw near her home. ""I left the book as I alighted from the rickshaw. Later I was elated to see a post with the book. Turned out that the person found the book a day after her birthday, so it made for a nice gift,"" she informs, adding that she also left a book at Aksa Beach on 'Book Fairy Biography Day' recently. ""I left a biography on a yogi at a sugarcane stall at the beach as it was raining."" Did she see who took it? ""No, I never wait to see who's picking the books as I am a fairy and have to stay out of sight,"" she smiles.Bhavika Govil, a book fairy-in-waiting, is planning to place a few books around Bandra so you might get one if you are lucky! ""I'm thinking of leaving the books behind a cushion in a cafe for people to find. I also want to leave a few detective books on a local train,"" she grins. ""The very idea of someone picking up the book, reading and appreciating it, feels great. It feels like a personal recommendation to a stranger,"" she admits.There are no rules to be a book fairy. Adds Kadambari, ""Anyone can take on this role. The books can be from your personal collection, ones you've read and loved. We have got requests from people who want to give away books to us, too. I got 30-40 books from donors around Mumbai in this week alone, so the kindness bug is certainly biting them,"" she says. What's more, men have also signed up as fairies. ""We have male book fairies too, which is so heartening,""she adds."

The government hopes to bring around 3.05 lakh hectare farmland under drip irrigation, for which the it has also announced a loan scheme.Maharashtra has 9.42 lakh hectare farmland under sugarcane, of which only 2.25 lakh hectare has drip irrigation. The decision to make drip irrigation mandatory has been pending for long. According to government estimates, 60-70% of the water available in the State is used for irrigation, in which sugarcane has the highest share, of around 25,000 cubic metre water per hectare. Using drip irrigation is estimated to save 7,500 to 12,500 cubic metre water per hectare.Agriculture Minister Pandurang Fundkar said, We will bring 1.50 lakh hectare farmland under drip the irrigation scheme in 2017-18, and 1.55 lakh hectare in 2018-19. A committee will decide the year-wise target. In the first phase, assistance will be extended to land irrigated by wells, rivers and nullahs.Farmers will get loans up to Rs. 85, 400 per hectare with 2% interest to implement the scheme. NABARD will extend the loan to the State Central Co-operative Bank (SCCB) at an interest of 5.5%, following which district banks will get the same loan from SCCB at 6%, and farmers at 7.25%. On timely repayment of loans, the State will pay 4% interest,1.25% will be paid by sugar mills, and 2% by the farmer.Mr. Fundkar said drip irrigation would also increase sugarcane production.Nod to group farmingThe Cabinet also cleared the proposal to set up group farming in the State. The farmers groups will be registered under the Companies Act and the Co-operation Act. Each group will be eligible for a maximum grant of Rs. 1 crore in two years. Every year, 200 groups will be eligible for the assistance."

(Express Archive) Among the crops that could be hit are sugarcane (both in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) and maize (Haveri, Davangere, Chitradurga and Bellary districts are major producers). (Express Archive)If Maharashtra, particularly Marathwada, was the epicentre of drought in 2014 and 2015, that has now seemingly shifted deep southward to a stretch covering the old Mysore region and coastal Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.In 2016, south interior Karnataka recorded 22 per cent deficit rainfall during the southwest monsoon season (June-September), while it was minus 21 per cent for coastal Karnataka, minus 34 per cent for Kerala and 20 per cent for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The numbers were even worse  at minus 70, minus 63 and minus 62 per cent each, respectively for the four meteorological subdivisions  for the northeast or retreating monsoon (October-December), which brings significant amount of rain, especially in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.A repeat scenario looks to be unfolding this year as well. While India as a whole has received an average area-weighted rainfall of 343.4 mm during the current monsoon season until July 19, one per cent more than the historic normal of 338.4 mm for this period, rain has so far been below-normal in south interior Karnataka (minus 33 per cent), coastal Karnataka (minus 11 per cent), Kerala (minus 24 per cent) and Tamil Nadu (minus 19 per cent).The result can be seen in water levels in the dams. The four major reservoirs of the Cauvery basin in Karnataka  Krishna Raja Sagara or KRS in Mandya district, Hemavathy (Hassan), Kabini (Mysore) and Harangi (Kodagu)  currently have less water than they had at this time in 2016.Last year, the Karnataka government was forced to release water from the KRS and Kabini reservoirs to the Mettur dam across the border in Tamil Nadus Salem district, following a Supreme Court directive. It triggered violent protests in Mysore and Mandya, spilling over to even Bengaluru. Traffic along the Bengaluru-Mysuru expressway came to halt as vehicles with Tamil Nadu registration plates were burnt by pro-Kannada groups who also targeted Tamilian-owned shops and eateries.This year too, theres great worry. Reservoir levels in the Cauvery basin have fallen lower with back-to-back monsoon failure and Karnataka is headed to Assembly elections in barely eight months. Political temperatures have already been raised, with pro-Kannada groups demanding removal of Hindi signage in all Bangalore Metro stations and the Siddaramaiah-headed Congress government constituting a committee to examine whether Karnataka could have a separate flag for the state.If this were not all, the rainfall forecast for the next one week at least is not very optimistic. There is possibility of some scattered rainfall in south interior Karnataka and Kerala over the coming two days, but it will not be enough to compensate for the current deficit in this area, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, head of services at the India Meteorological Department.The reservoir position is equally, if not more, precarious in Tamil Nadus main dams  Mettur, Bhavanisagar (Erode), Vaigai (Theni) or Aliyar and Sholayar in Coimbatore district. The rain hasnt been good in either the Nilgiri (the catchment area for Bhavanisagar) or Anaimalai hills (for Aliyar and Sholayar) of the Western Ghats.While Mettur gets water from the KRS and Kabini, the latters catchment is mainly in Keralas Wayanad district. Similarly, the Mullaperiyar dam in Idukki (Kerala) irrigates Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts of southern Tamil Nadu, with its waters also feeding the Vaigai dam in Theni. The same goes for the Parambikulam dam, which, while located in Keralas Palakkad district, largely caters to the Coimbatore-Erode belt in western Tamil Nadu. The Parambikulam and Mullaperiyar dams are both, in fact, owned, operated and maintained by the Tamil Nadu government  thereby also lending themselves to inter-state disputes with Kerala.What this also means is that the rain failing in one part could impact water levels in dams and reservoirs elsewhere. The effects are cumulative when the monsoon turns out bad in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern as well coastal Karnataka  that too, for a second successive year.I havent seen anything like this. Sadly, it is not receiving adequate attention from the powers-that-be. Even the protests by Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi do not reflect the real intensity of the crisis, said M Manickam, chairman of the Coimbatore-based Sakthi Sugars Limited.Among the crops that could be hit are sugarcane (both in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) and maize (Haveri, Davangere, Chitradurga and Bellary districts are major producers). Milk output could also suffer; the bulk of procurement by cooperatives in Karnataka is from the Mysore-Mandya-Bangalore-Kolar belt. Dairies in Tamil Nadu, too, are reporting near-flat procurement, with farmers struggling to arrange both fodder and water for their animals.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Mr. Shetty said, The decision is an example of the governments authoritarian behaviour. Mr. Shetty, who is also leading farmers protests in Maharashtra and across the country, said that the decision was taken to profit private companies with links to Ministers in the Cabinet.Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has asked the government not to merely make announcements, but also to implement them. NCP leader Jayant Patil said, Ever since this government took charge, it has announced a number of schemes. However, none of them have been implemented properly on the ground. In reality, the people are not benefiting from the schemes.Mr. Patil pointed out that like the farm loan waiver scheme whose details have not been announced yet, the drip irrigation scheme too lacked clarity. He said, The government must announce the amount of money it has reserved for this scheme.Agriculture Minister Pandurang Fundkar said the decision would help increase sugarcane production in the State. Water will be saved and production will increase too. The private sector has also welcomed the move. Drip irrigation is a proven method for increasing sugarcane production.

Reserve Bank of India's chief general manager in Delhi and Wardha Police Station are other respondents in the case.A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Rohit Deo directed all respondents to reply within two weeks. Rajnish Vyas has been appointed as amicus curiae in the case.He contended that UCO Bank fraud was systematic and organized crime committed by its officers along through illegal transactions where they floated a scheme for financing farmers for cultivation of sugar cane through tie-up arrangements with sugar mills.The amicus brought to fore large-scale misappropriation of public money by the bank officers in connivance with the directors of [private companies. He also pointed about adamant attitude of senior bank officers in not cooperating with the investigating agency. The premier agency is further accused of not showing interest in investigating the crime and exercising its powers.Vyas prayed for directives to RBI to call upon all bank and finance institutions to file a suo motu complaint on financial frauds by framing appropriate guidelines and strictly monitor the same. He also demanded CBI to explore the possibility of invocation of Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, in the financial crimes.He insisted on to look into the grievance made by CBI city office regarding non-cooperation of superior officers of UCO Bank and to take stringent action against them.As per the petition, the UCO Bank floated a scheme under which loans could be granted to the farmers/joint liability groups through industry/mill owner. They're required to prepare the list of farmers, who would be cultivating crops (Soyabean) and they would be guarantors for repayment. The loan amount would be disbursed in the account of farmers/joint liability groups. GS Oil Company allegedly acting in connivance with the officers of UCO Bank in Hinganghat and Wardha disbursed loan amount of Rs25 crore, though the list of farmers submitted was fraud and fabricated.After amount was deposited in farmers' account, it was immediately transferred in the accounts of GS Oils, which clearly shows that it was GS Oil who was ultimate beneficiary. The CBI then registered offences under Sections 420, 468, 471, 34 of IPC Section 13 (1) and 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act."

At the age of 15, he was elected president of the Communist Party of India's student wing, All India Students Federation (AISF) in 1939.Through the AISF and the CPI, he took part in several agitations during the struggle for Independence and was imprisoned for 12 years for various subversive activities.After Independence he switched over to the Congress and was elected thrice to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, to the Legislative Council and served one term in the Rajya Sabha (1992-1998).Handling various ministries during the tenures of Chief Ministers Vasantrao Naik, S.B. Chavan and Vasantrao Patil in the 1950s-1970s, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan in 2013 for services to the cooperative movement in Maharashtra.In between, he briefly flirted with the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, but remained a Congressman at heart and committed to the cause of the cooperative sectors.In 1996, on the 10th death anniversary of his actress daughter, he set up the 'Smita Patil Charitable Trust' which runs a public school in Dahiwad village of his native Dhule district imparting quality education to rural children.Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi expressed his condolences on his demise.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also condoled Patil's death, describing him ""a stalwart of the cooperation movement"" in the state.""He made a significant contribution to the Indian freedom struggle. After Independence, he played a major role in politics, social, cooperation movement and education fields. His role in the development of the sugar cooperative sector brought international laurels,"" Fadnavis said in a message.Maharashtra Congress President Ashok Chavan expressed grief over Patil's death and said the masses have lost ""a committed"" leader who contributed immense to the political, social, cooperation and education sectors.Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar described him as a leader who ""represented a generation, which was socially aware.""""He never let go of his commitment to the cooperative movement and democratic ideology,"" Pawar said in his message.Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde also condoled the death of Patil in a message and said the state has lost a leader who developed society through agriculture and cooperation movement.Condolence messages have come from the Congress's party units and Chief Ministers all over India and prominent leaders of different political parties."

(Representational image) In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. (Representational image)Just 18 months ago, Jalna farmer Chandrakant Kshirsagar sold the couple of quintals of tur (pigeon pea) he produces at Rs 8,000 a quintal. This year, after waiting months for prices to rise, he finally sold his produce at Rs 4,000 a quintal, making exactly half last years earnings even as his input costs have grown.Other farmers who sold at Rs 3,200 a quintal had fared so much worse, he reasons, explaining why pulse producers, all habituated to volatility in pulse prices, are still the angriest among Maharashtras farmers this year. Many of them small and marginal farmers especially in Marathwada where Latur and Nanded districts produce tur, urad and moong in large quantities, pulse farmers fully anticipated a bumper crop in 2016-17.An excellent monsoon had followed two consecutive drought years, prices were sky-high last year, and there was a government-induced increase in acreage of pulses. Everybody knew we would have an excellent output. And still, we now have a glut of imports, so much so that the oversupply will not end any time soon, says Rajan Kshirsagar, a farmer and Left leader from Parbhani in Marathwada, a mostly dryland farming region that produces much of Maharashtras approximately 1.5 million tonnes of pulses annually.Current wholesale rates for tur are still approximately Rs 3,700 a quintal. And to add to farmers woes at having to sell way below the MSP of Rs 5,050 a quintal, there are allegations that cartelised traders abused the governments procurement process by selling to government centres at the MSP, at huge profits. Maharashtra is a major pulse-producing state, among the top four.While pulse farming across India is largely unirrigated, the problem is more acute in Maharashtra, where only 8.7 per cent of land under pulses is irrigated, making the 16 per cent share of Maharashtra in Indias pulse production especially vulnerable to monsoon shocks. (In Uttar Pradesh, 35.1 per cent of area under pulses is irrigated).It follows naturally that the plentiful monsoon of 2016-17, and government policy promoting pulse production, saw area under pulses in Maharashtra grow from 20,06,000 hectare in 2015-16 to 25,57,000 hectare  a 28 per cent rise. From 6,11,000 tonnes last year, output ballooned to an estimated 17,51,000 tonnes, a 187 per cent rise.In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. But everybody is unanimous that the reduction in acreage will not help tackle the existing oversupply.Maharashtras farmers are sowing less tur because of crashing prices, but supply will not come down so soon. The rains are going to be good, so it is a reasonable assessment that prices will remain depressed, says Dr Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.Also, price volatility in pulses, a cyclical problem, is neither peculiar to Maharashtra nor unusual. Dr Joshi says the massive volatility in pulse prices has been a constant phenomenon over the last 15 years or so. Every third year there is a price spike and then a crash, and the volatility is directly linked to production. Farmers look at experience of high prices and sow more, so prices fluctuate.Dr Joshi believes a 10 per cent price increase annually is good incentive from farmers perspective, but a mechanism needs to be devised to smoothen prices. Firstly, you have to de-risk agriculture from rains  irrigation is key. Alongside that, better food management can ensure that volatility is kept under control, through buffer stocks and other measures.That import arrivals of pulses continued even as it became apparent that there is a bumper crop locally contributed to the glut. Structural solutions are needed from a long-term perspective, but in the short term, various devices on imports, buffers and so on are needed.Nitin Kalantry, one of Laturs larger pulse traders, says imports from Africa are at about Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,300 a quintal and from Burma at Rs 3,400 a quintal. So prices will definitely not rise dramatically in the near future, he says. In addition, Kalantry says, theres a 1.10 million tonne buffer stock with the government at the all-India level and traders are wondering how and when this will be disposed of. Also, he says farmers continue to hold about 15 per cent of their stocks, hoping prices will rise.Also, while government buyouts themselves will not suffice to tackle the oversupply, many say the procurement process itself should have been better streamlined. Kshirsagar, the Parbhani leader, says there was negligence and poor planning in procurement. First there were only 17 procurement centres, and too few were added later. Then farmers were first told to bring their produce, and they waited there while incurring rent for the vehicles, then they were told to take a token and make deliveries later, he says, adding that thousands of farmers also received delayed payments.MahaFPC, a consortium of Farmer Producer Companies, which demonstrated a procurement intervention in the 2016-17 season in parts of the state with a transparent system for farmers, says there are many policy interventions needed to improve the procurement process. Inadequate warehousing and procurement infrastructure in the producing states, unpreparedness of the state nodal agencies and political interference in procurement operations created mismanagement and failed to stabilise the markets, says Yogesh Thorat, MD of MahaFPC, adding that a huge majority of pulse farmers may have sold below MSP.Thorat adds that while commodity futures markets are in an infancy stage, they may help reduce market risks for pulse farmers despite fears that trading in futures may be highly speculative, without any actual delivery of the commodity. Recently SEBI allowed NCDEX to launch chana futures. Presently these trading platforms are in the hands of middlemen, hence neither farmers nor consumers are benefitted.Farmer Producer Companies are coming forward to participate in these markets for physical delivery of commodities, a good sign, and futures can be a crucial instrument to regulate price trend. All kinds of marketing avenues should be open for better price realisation and price stabilisation in pulses, Thorat says.Tuesday: Sugar, not sweet for farmersFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: AP) It was Bhullars heroic knock of 171 runs in the semi-final against Australia earlier this week which helped India march into the final. (Source: AP)IT WAS a heartbreak for the Indian womens team and the cricket fans in the Tricity as the Indian team lost by nine runs against England in the final of the ICC Womens World Cup at Lords Cricket grounds in London on Sunday. While Indias semi-final record scorer Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar scored a half-century and stitched together a 95-run partnership for third wicket with Poonam Raut, India lost the final for the second time.We will take a lot of positives from the final. Harmanpreets knock of 51 runs was as important as her century against Australia but it was unfortunate that India lost the match. Harmanpreet has been my favourite cricketer since she led Punjab senior team. The Indian team showed that they can perform at the world level. Reaching the final after playing the qualifiers and dominating the matches will mean good for Indian cricket. I hope that BCCI also launched IPL for women cricketers, said Chandigarh cricketer Taniya Bhatia, who plays for Punjab and was also part of Indian women camp in Mumbai before the World Cup.It was Bhullars heroic knock of 171 runs in the semi-final against Australia earlier this week which helped India march into the final. The Indian team had played their first final in World Cup in 2005 and Sundays final in the World Cup was their second final in the last 12 years. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced a cash award of Rs 5 lakh for Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar. Singh spoke to Bhullars father Harmandar Bhullar on Sunday and appreciated Harmanpreets performance in the World Cup.Later, Singh also said that the Punjab government would review its sports policy to induct players like Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar into government service and she would be offered the post of DSP in Punjab Police. At Bhullars hometown Moga, trainees and her coach Kamaldeesh Pal Sodhi watched the match at the Gian Jyoti Academy, Tarapur village.More than 30 trainees at our academy played a match in the morning and later watched the match. Harmanpreet showed that she can play a big knock in the final too. It was disheartening to see her depart just after completing her half-century. This World Cup brought her in the limelight and she will only improve from now on. Trainees at our academy train without any support from state government and to produce a World Cup finalist is a huge achievement for us, said Sodhi.Harmanpreets long-time teammate and Punjab player Parveen Khan, who belongs to Moga and will be attending a coaching camp at IS Bindra Stadium, Mohali, this week, too, watched the match. After her knock in the semi-final, all of my friends want to meet her. We talked on Friday and she was eager to give her best in the final despite suffering injury scare in the semi-finals. She was looking set for a big score today but fell at a crucial moment in the match. We hope there are more centuries to come from her bat, said 26-year-old Khan, whose father works in a sugar mill at Moga.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

During the current southwest monsoon season (June-September), India as a whole, so far, has received rainfall that is 3 per cent above the historical average or normal for this period.

But merely because the countrys overall agricultural production will not take a hit cannot be reason to ignore the crisis thats bound to unfold in the deep south  it may be no less political, more so with assembly elections less than eight months away in Karnataka.Last September saw a major stand-off when the Karnataka government, in deference to a Supreme Court order, was forced to release water from its reservoirs on the Cauvery river basin to the Mettur dam across the border in Tamil Nadu. It triggered violent protests by pro-Kannada groups who contended that there was hardly any water in the Krishna Raja Sagara and other Cauvery reservoirs to meet their own farmers irrigation needs.

Fresh tensions could erupt in about a month from now, when farmers in Tamil Nadus delta districts start transplanting their main Samba paddy crop.

(File photo) Maharashtra produces 36 per cent of the countrys sugar stock. (File photo)Well over two years since the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party lost power in Maharashtra, the states sugar barons are still coming to terms with the loss of political patronage for the sugar sector. Known for their political significance during the previous regime, while the major sugar millers with deep-rooted networks in the cooperatives and farms now find themselves isolated from the power centres, they say the sector  with a Rs 50,000 crore annual turnover in the state  is suffering on account of political neglect.Sugar has been a historically important commodity in Maharashtra, given its socio-political relevance. The state produces 36 per cent of the countrys sugar stock, making it the largest producer of the sweetener in the country. India is the second largest producer of sugar in the world and is the largest consumer as well.The sugar sector in Maharashtra, besides its huge annual turnovers, is also a major employment generator in rural areas. Naturally, the position of sugar in the states economics cannot be overstated  any distortion in production gets planners in a tizzy.On paper, the state has 175 cooperative and 72 private erected mills, but the number of mills that actually participate in a season have been fewer. In fact, sugar production in 2016-17 fell considerably, with back to back droughts leading production to fall to only 42 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar as compared to the 84.1 lakh tonnes in the previous season. For the coming season, the state is projected to produce around 70 lt of sugar, still much lower than the 100 lt mark the state reached a few seasons back.Historically, the sugar sector in Maharashtra has always been close to power. Sugar barons  barring a few  have been inclined towards the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party, with the latter holding sway over the sugar-rich western Maharashtra region through a close relationship with the rural elite, this political patronage bringing growth to the region but also pitfalls.In drought-prone parts of western Maharashtra itself where there is plenty of cane cultivation, such as in Solapur, and in large pockets of Marathwada too, sugar cultivation is at the centre of a controversy for the sheer quantum of water needed for these stretches of farmland.What ails the farm sector part-1: Maharashtra farmers angry despite bumper pulse harvest, prices crash on oversupply | Click here to readThe district of Solapur is a classic case of the growth of sugar sector in an otherwise drought-prone area. Annually, the district receives barely 550-650 mm of rain. Yet, the district has 38 installed mills  the most for any district in the state. In its report on Pricing Policy of Sugarcane: 2013-14, the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Pricing (CACP), Ministry of Agriculture, draws some harsh truth about the states cane group. It says for production of 1 kg of sugar, Maharashtra requires 2,068 litres of water whereas Uttar Pradesh requires about 1,044 litres, making the water stress caused by the crop in drought-prone regions a serious problem.Adding to the imbalance is that while barely 20 per cent of Maharashtras farm lands are irrigated, almost 80 per cent of existing irrigation facilities in the state are concentrated in cane-growing areas. This anomaly, for a crop that occupies just about 10 lakh hectares of land, means that one single crop has cornered the major portion of irrigation facilities. Water experts including Indias waterman Rajendra Singh, as well as multiple reports of the CACP, have discussed the option of mandating drip irrigation for cane.Amid the intensifying debate on the inequitable water distribution in favour of sugar, the state has recently made it compulsory for cane growers to install drip irrigation systems. Despite the efforts, until now, only 30 per cent of Maharashtras cane-growing area has come under drip irrigation, with growers complaining of difficulties in raising finance for the project. Subsidies are hard to come by, say farmers.Environmentalist Vishambhar Choudhari points to the water-intensive nature of cane and says a compulsory drip system is a good move. The cane crop doesnt add much in terms of soil nutrients but the fixed returns lure farmers to it, he says. The only way farmers can be weaned away from cane, he says, is to ensure equal and better returns for other crops such as pulses.Simultaneously, the changes in the political landscape have meant sugar barons are no longer assured of a sympathetic ear in the government. For millers, for example, easy access to finance from government institutions has disappeared. Minister of Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, whose family runs three private mills under the Lokmangal banner, has repeatedly talked about the need for millers to spruce up their act. To cite one example, millers have been asking for the last two years for a restructuring of the soft loan extended to them to pay growers from the 2013-14 season, but the government has not accepted their demand. Millers are at present repaying the Rs 3,000 crore extended to them by the state and central government.Shivajirao Nagawade Patil, president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, says the market for the states sugar has shrunk over the last two years. Earlier we used to send sugar to Kolkata but the transport costs have made that uneconomical, he says. Uttar Pradesh, Nagawade Patil says, has captive markets in Rajasthan, Delhi and other states that continue to elude Maharashtras millers. We have been asking for restructuring of loans but the government is yet to respond, he says.Congress MLA and director of Latur-based Manjara Cooperative Sugar Mill Amit Deshmukh cites the state governments refusal to execute a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the mills as another example of official apathy towards the sector. The state government has consistently refused to accept the Rs 6 per unit rate quoted by the millers to sell excess power generated through cogeneration plants. A special committee has been formed to look into the matter now.For growers, cane is almost akin to a salaried crop  assurance of a fair and remunerative price (FRP) by the mills at the end of season is one of the most important reasons that growers opt for it. However, rising production costs now pose a challenge for growers as well. Prahlad Ingole, a farmer from Ardhapur taluka of Nanded taluka, says that for an acre of cane the costs of inputs come to almost around Rs 50,000 this year. With increasing water stress it is becoming difficult for us to make our ends meet, he says. Overall the situation for the sugar sector, the sweetness appears to be missing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The SSS council will take a final call on Khot next week.The agriculture minister is considered a strongman in the organisation and has clout in the farmer community in the region.Political analyst Prakash Pawar said, ""Khot failed on the expectations of the farmer community. Shetti is disappointed over Khot's inability to address concerns of farmers, for which he was given the ministerial berth. Shetti's image as a leader of the farmers will improve if Khot is removed from the party. But Shetti is in dilemma over whether to support the state government or not.""Shetti and Khot parted ways with Sharad Joshi's Shetkari Sanghatana over 15 years ago. The constant agitations by SSS for higher price for sugarcane resulted in the party creating a political base in south Maharashtra.The BJP has now made inroads where SSS was strong, as could be gauged from results of elections to local governing bodies.Pawar said since farmers from various parts of the country were uniting against the government, Shetti has a great chance of regaining lost ground. ""In the next two years, farmers' agitations will increase, which will boost Shetti's political prospects. If Khot forms an outfit, he will not get much attention as he is being seen as one who has disappointed farmers by not addressing concerns such as loan waiver,"" he said.Khot told TOI, ""I have presented my view to the organisation. I will take a decision only after the committee appointed by the party takes a call. I am consulting those who helped me all these years."""

The board of directors of these banks is considered powerful and only a select few hold on to the position for years. There are 30 DCC banks in the state, most of them controlled by the Congress-NCP.The cumulative deposits with the DCC banks is nearly Rs 66,000 crore. The bid to broadbase voting rights, coming on the back of a massive loan waiver, is the second significant outreach by the regime in the agriculture sector.Currently, elections for the board of directors are held every five years and only a select few nominated members cast their vote.These voters are nominated from village level rural co-operatives like the primary agriculture credit societies (PACS), primary milk collection centres, sugar co-operatives and animal husbandry institutions. These have presence in almost all the villages and act as agents of all the district level co-operatives.For years, Congress-NCP leaders have been running most of these co-operatives, be it the sugar mills in western Maharashtra or the milk co-operatives which procure farm produce. This has created a system of patronage for farmers. ""People managing these village-level institutions are also close to political parties and the people they nominate as voters are also linked to the party in some way or the other and the monopoly never seems to end,"" said an official. ""The idea is to increase the number of voters, as a small set of voters can easily be manipulated and controlled,"" said another official. On an average, one DCC bank covers 1,500-2,000 villages, and the number of voters for one bank is nearly 4,000-5,000, while the number of farmers who take loans from a DCC bank are around 1.5-2 lakh. That's how small the group of voters is, explained an official.Senior officials said that this will also help the farmers in a big way, because it is a known that getting a crop loan on priority also requires good relations with the people managing the bank.The state government had formed a committee under the additional commissioner of co-operation department to study the framework of the new rule. The committee has submitted a positive report and implementation will begin soon, said sources from the department.This will be the BJP 's second attempt to snatch control of key institutions from the opposition, it has already made ammendments in the act to allow farmers to vote in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)."

It starts as a feeling of dread at around 3 p.m. and gives in to some ill-advised snacking by 4 p.m. This is where Neha Pandit Tembe comes in with Snack Right, a subscription box for your daily snacking needs. Each box takes care of 15 days of nibbles with two snacks a day. Wholesome granola bars, trail mixes, whole grain puffs, sweet nutri pops, crackers, multigrain mixtures all made with ingredients nutritionists love to exhort you to take: oats, amaranth, nuts, dates, seeds and so on. Every product is natural, no added sugars (no sucrose, glucose or corn syrup etc) or refined flours and no trans fats or preservatives.Tembe is a nutritionist who has studied nutrition at SNDT, Mumbai and M.S. University, Baroda. She has a masters (M.Sc Dietetics and is a University Gold medallist. She says, In the academic arena, the health benefits of many traditional ingredients is being explored these days. Her study of food apart, she has also years of experience: three years of lecturing at SNDT and two years of consulting at Anjali Mukerjees diet clinics along with research in nutrition and health for several local, national, international projects.The years of interacting with clients of all shapes and sizes made Tembe realise that people wanted to eat healthy but often just did not have the time to make it. She says, There is a lacuna in the fresh food market. I thought I should provide salad and soup. But salads and their freshness are problematic to maintain. This is when she realised that the other time people cheat is when they are reaching for snacks and in-between-meal solutions. Reading off shelves of dietary foods, Tembe says she could see how harmful many so-called diet foods really could be.She says, People will eat anything that says baked or roasted and not realise that they are eating maida or other kinds of fats. Diet khari makes me crazy  look at the composition, its still maida and fat in all the layers. Tembe feels its a challenge to educate people on labels and what they mean. She feels nutrition-seekers must consult professionals on products that have added sugars and trans fats.All ingredients and products source are examined very carefully. I cannot compromise on this. I am always talking to my suppliers about whether they use colours, sweeteners or maida. I check their laboratory certifications As her products have a limited shelf life, Tembe says the business is a challenge. Nuts and seeds, in particular, go off faster than other ingredients. Seasonal fluctuations can also cause ingredients to behave unpredictably and a lot of ingredients get discarded, she says. Things like nuts cannot be ordered in bulk because they dont taste fresh and yet suppliers cater to large orders only. I am now working on better storage for my ingredients.Tembe has a unit in Vile Parle east that she works out of. Her business was launched in May last year. Now she is researching how to upscale her module. She presently has a team of five managing the manufacturing, packaging and logistics. Each snack is between 100 and 140 calories and this works for most people. She adds, If someone has a more specific diet requirement or is diabetic, I tailor according to that.

(Express Archive) Cotton remains the most popular choice for farmers in Vidarbha, Marathwada and parts of middle Maharashtra. (Express Archive)IN April 2010, raw cotton prices had zoomed close to Rs 7,000 per quintal, its highest peak till date. As a result, the cotton area in Maharashtra saw a record jump from 33.91 lakh hectare in 2009-10 to 39.42 lakh hectare in 2010-11. The event bears uncanny similarity to its intercrop arhars story in 2016, when the pulses price skyrocketed to a record over Rs 9,000 per quintal, leading to the area of the crop going up by over three lakh hectare in 2016-17. And it was cotton area that took the hit dropping from 42 to 38 lakh hectare. But with arhar (pigeon pea) prices crashing to less than Rs 4,000 per quintal and cotton prices touching a high of Rs 5,700 per quintal, cotton is set to regain its lost ground in 2017-18. Also, over the past ten years, soybean and cotton crops competed with each other in Maharashtra, with the area being influenced by prices and pests.Despite being seen by some as a problem crop for farmers, cotton, however, remains the most popular choice for farmers in Vidarbha, Marathwada and parts of middle Maharashtra (Khandesh), thanks to the advantages it provides like no other crop does. Its sturdy and withstands harsh weather conditions better than other crops, its non-perishable, farmers can hope to get extra flushes from extended rain spells and, more importantly, prices have generally remained stable if not very remunerative. Moreover, cotton has always had a demanding market in the textile industry and hence was seen as a cash crop by farmers. Clearly, agrarian distress in general and farmers suicides in particular in regions like Vidarbha do not relate to cotton so much as many have reasoned as far as the farmers steadfast choice for the crop goes.Says farmer Dilip Pohane from Hinganghat, the biggest cotton mandi in the state, in Wardha district, I had stopped sowing cotton for past three years due to lopsided cost benefit ratio and had switched over to arhar. But since arhar prices have crashed, I am switching back to cotton this time. And if you take a look at the entire stretch of 50 km from Hinganghat to Wadki, you will find 75 pc of farmers have gone for cotton since it fetched up to Rs 5,700 per quintal last year. Pohane agrees that cotton provides advantages even if its not hugely profitable. In situations like the one created by arhar, cotton is the only viable option, he says. Read: What ails the farm sector part-1: Maharashtra farmers angry despite bumper pulse harvest, prices crash on oversupply. Click hereAccording to government statistics, cotton sowing in the state is complete up to 93 pc of the average area till July 21, which is already 108 pc of last years sown area. Arhar sowing, meanwhile, has fallen 13 pc. The rise in acreage could impact prices, some feel. According to cotton trader Pankaj Kochar from Hinganghat, there has been 40 pc increase in cotton area in the Hinganghat belt. With the kind of rain at this juncture, production will go up by 1.5 times and is likely to suppress the prices this time round, he says.But Keshav Kranthi, former Director of Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) and now with Washingtons International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC), says many countries have seen a drop in area under cotton. And with China also likely to import this time, the prices are expected to remain at the same level as last year, he says.MSP and cotton prices in Maharashtra MSP and cotton prices in MaharashtraSome activists have also blamed the advent of genetically modified Bt cotton as an aggravating event in farm distress. But increase in area, production and productivity in cotton over the years do not bear it out. Even going by the farmers suicide numbers over the past ten years, Bt cotton is difficult to blame for distress. What most have missed is a very substantial drop in suicide numbers from 1449 in 2006 to 805 in 2013 in the six main cotton growing districts of Vidarbha viz Wardha, Amravati, Akola, Buldana, Washim and Yavatmal. These are known as the most suicide-prone districts in not only Vidarbha but also anywhere in the country. Interestingly, Yavatmal, that had registered the maximum 360 suicides in 2006, recorded 231 suicides in 2013. Coincidentally, this was the period when Bt cotton picked up in a big way to cover over 95 pc of the cotton area in the state. The area under cotton also rose from 31.07 lakh hectares in 2006 to 42.07 lakh hectares in 2016, averaging an increase of more than one lakh hectare per year.The productivity levels have also gone up from 253 kg lint per hectare in 2006-07 to maximum of 361 kg lint per hectare in 2013-14. The average market price has also risen from Rs 1,955 in 2006-07 to Rs 4,751 in 2015-16. Read: What ails the farm sector part-2: Politics brings bitter turn for sugar barons, drip irrigation for cane still to catch up. Click hereThe problem for Maharashtras 20 lakh cotton farmers, however, has been low productivity. In states like Gujarat, the yields are more than double that of Maharashtra. The difference between cost of production and average market price has always been very small. In 2006-07, according to statistics provided by Kranthi of the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC), the cost of production in 2006 was Rs 2,052 per quintal against the average market price of Rs 1,955 and the minimum support price (MSP) provided by the government Rs 1,990.Incidentally, the MSP factor was virtually rendered ineffective since 2005 when the state government virtually ended the Monopoly Cotton Procurement Scheme (MCPS), where it would buy the entire cotton produce of state farmers by paying a bonus amount above the MSP. The scheme, launched for thirty years in 1973, ran on extensions for two years till 2005 with no further extension being granted due to over Rs 8,000 crore losses piling up and continued default on payment of bonus. Since then, the open market prices have mostly been above the MSP, barring 2008, when then Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar hiked the MSP by a huge 42 pc from Rs 2030 to Rs 3000. The market didnt respond to the government move and kept their offers low, forcing the state government to buy about 70 pc of the produce. But except for 2008-09, farmers have been selling their cotton in the open market.Low productivity itself is because about 90 pc of the states cotton area is non-irrigated and about one-third of the state area is in Vidarbha (about 15 lakh hectares), where irrigation is a far cry. Of late, in the Khandesh region, the yields have gone up handsomely, attributed to use of drip irrigation.Though productivity has increased after the advent of Bt cotton, it has kind of plateaued over the past ten years. Resurgence of sap sucking insects and emergence of Bt-resistant pink bollworms. Sap sucking insect pests such as jassids, mealy bugs, mirid bugs, thrips and whiteflies, which are not controlled by Bt-cotton, increased over the past ten years and caused serious damage despite heavy use of insecticides, says Kranthi. Pink bollworms, which can feed only on developing cotton seeds and almost nothing else, developed high levels of resistance to Bt-cotton. More than a thousand private Bt-cotton hybrids were released during the five year period after 2006. Majority of these were very susceptible to the sap sucking pests thereby leading to the problem of sucking pests. Non sowing of refuge crop surrounding Bt, as prescribed in the Bt technique coupled with extending the crop by a few months, led to rapid development of pink bollworm resistance to Bt-cotton only in India and nowhere else in the world, he adds. Whiteflies in Punjab and Pink Bollworm in Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh had hit national headlines last year. Whitefly had blown up into an election issue in Punjab.Successive governments have rhetorically pushed cotton to cloth slogan doing virtually nothing on the ground to turn it into a reality. A value chain beginning with cotton and ending in cloth has kept hanging fire with no textile units coming up in and around cotton growing areas.Tomorrow: Resolving Maharashtras Irrigation crisisFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sometimes, I take leave citing health reasons or opt to work from home. But I never share the real reason. I feel it would make me look weak and I dont want my male colleagues to know about my cycle, she says.Medical conditionsThere are several reasons for the pain, and it is not the same for everyone. For instance, women with endometriosis usually take medication for pain relief during their menstrual cycle. Women with endometriosis go through such extreme pain that sometimes they just want to die than go through itthats terrible, says Jayarani Kamaraj, MD, Aakash Fertility Centre. The pain is very minimal for some. They dont even realise they have periods and go on with their daily routine. So, in such cases how will this menstrual leave work?Sruthakeerthi Mohan Ram, founder, Teal Zeal and a yoga practitioner, has been creating awareness on how to tackle Polycysytic Ovarian Disease (PCOD). She says, Periods are a painful time for most women. So, for women with PCOD, who usually have irregular periods and might not menstruate even for three months, when the time comes, it is excruciating. For such people, an off would be appropriate. Women go through a lot of pain during their menstrual cycle  not just physical but, emotional and mental too.Being lactose intolerant is another reason why periods can be painful. Shalini Sinha, a media professional, says her period pain was unbearable and she would also feel depressed. I used to be depressed prior, during and post my menstrual cycle and my cramps used to be unbearable. Thats when I found out that I was lactose intolerant. Thankfully, I had an understanding boss...and I was never shy to ask for leave during those days when I could hardly get out of bed. I think as we start talking and being more open about periods and the other conditions associated with it, everyone will understand. Otherwise it will always remain a myth, she shares.No hierarchy for thisIrrespective of period pain, women have been working through it. But, the paid period leave policy is mindful and supportive of those who need a day to just rest. Each body is different, and the way we choose to respond to pain is also different. But, that said, there are some who feel that this is not a good strategy unless all women in an establishment are offered this same privilege, such as blue collar workers and women who are at a different level in the hierarchy.

Says Dr Manasa Rao, a homeopath, There is primary period pain and secondary period pain and everyone falls into any one of this category. But, in a society where paid maternity leave is being frowned upon for being unreasonably advantageous for women, I doubt that an off-day during menstruation would be taken positively, she opines.Sudha Ramalingam, social activist, says, women need not be embarrassed to ask for leave nor should they be considered weak. Taking leave during periods just means the person needs rest and not that the woman is weak.

It includes bloating, cramps, mood swings, and headaches.Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) is when the ovaries have multiple cysts surrounding it. These cysts are formed when the regular changes of a normal menstrual cycle are disrupted. The symptoms of PCOD vary from irregular periods to obesity. Not all patients will have the same symptoms.If you are lactose intolerant, it means your body cannot digest lactose, a natural sugar found in dairy products. When lactose moves through the large intestine without being digested, the pain can be excruciating in the stomach.Endometriosis is a condition where an inner layer of the uterus grows outside it mainly on the ovaries, fallopian tube and on the tissues outside the uterus.

This will help bring 7.5 lakh hectares of additional land under irrigation.In the last 30 months, the state government has accorded highest priority to the irrigation sector, undertaking policy reforms to plug financial bleeding and thin spreading of resources. The government aims to enhance the irrigation potential from 18 per cent to 27, the maximum given the geographical conditions and terrain in Maharashtra. The national average is 42 per cent.In a clear departure from the past, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has imposed a ban on new irrigation projects. Instead, he has accorded priority to completion of ongoing projects.Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan said, At present, there are 376 irrigation projects in the state, of which 67 are major, 83 medium and 226 minor projects. The amount required to complete them is Rs 84,000 crore. There are 49 projects worth Rs 26,600 crore that are facing problems with land acquisition, forest clearances, etc. The government has decided to keep them on hold and focus on the rest of the 327 projects, which require Rs 57,400 crore.A senior official in the water resources ministry said, The state budget allocation in the next three years will be Rs 24,000 crore. Loans from NABARD (for central projects under PMKSY) is Rs 12,770 crore and central assistance Rs 3,830 crore. Loan from NABARD to the state government (Rs 2,000 crore) and raising bonds from markets (in next three years) of Rs 14,800 crore sums up to the required amount of Rs 57,400 crore.Former chairman of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probnig the irrigation scam and water management expert Madhav Chitale said, A scientific policy along with fiscal discipline is integral to maximising the irrigation potential. Apart from the irrigation projects, emphasis on water conservation through jalyukta shivar would help tackle the water scarcity and raise the water tables, he said.Of the 42 recommendations made by the Chitale committee to plug corruption, the government has implemented 38.Those that remain on paper include evaluation of canals using remote sensors and levying water charges to stop the misuse and diversion of dam water for sugarcane cultivation, leading to drought.The state government has proposed central assistance of Rs 7,187 crore for 107 projects in 14 suicide-prone districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada; and Rs 3,500 crore for seven projects in drought-prone areas.Of the total 99 projects under PMKSY, 26 are in Maharashtra, proposed to be completed by December 2019, creating an additional irrigation potential of 2.56 lakh hectares.Greater Centre-state coordination saw the chief minister succeed in getting environmental clearance for 10 crucial projects, which were on hold for 10-15 years. The projects are spread in Vidarbha (4), Marathwada (3), Western Maharashtra (2) and Konkan (1). For the last 10 years, the environment ministry had kept the Krishna-Marathwada project on hold, resulting in work coming to a grinding halt.In 12 projects, forest land was handed over after the environment ministry gave the nod, paving the way for work to start. The projects in Vidarbha includes Jigaon, Gosikhurd right bank canal, Bhimdi, Khindsi feeder canal in Pencha project and Bhimalkasa Ingalwadi. Whereas in Western Maharashtra, it is Nira Deoghar and Gunjavani, the Dhondalpada diversion scheme, Panzan left canal and Shelgaon barrage.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Aishwarya Maheshwari The crowd atEats and Beats: Authentic Naga Food Buffet tries the Naga cuisine from the Northeast at a school in Mumbai. Aishwarya MaheshwariAROUND 400 people enjoyed the rain-free Saturday night with steaming hot Naga food at a buffet held at a suburban school. Apart from people from the North-eastern states, hundreds of Mumbaikars, too, made a beeline for the event to get a plateful of authentic Naga cuisine.As platters of colourful items were dished out at the Eats and Beats-Authentic Naga Food Buffet, attendees showed interest not just in the food but also the culture of the North-eastern states. The smell of spices and a variety of meats hung in the air at the Indian Airlines Ideal School, Santacruz, the venue.On offer was a plethora of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options including singju, eromba, chicken with bamboo shoot and kidney beans gravy served with steamed rice. To top it all, banana caramel custard, a dessert made out of mashed bananas, sugar, eggs and milk, was served.People from the North-eastern states currently residing in Mumbai found solace in the authentic food that reminded them of their homes in the hills.This event makes me feel closer to home and gives the Naga students who have settled in Mumbai an opportunity to feel less homesick said Manesa Krichena Mao who is from Manipur and is in Mumbai for her studies.She said that the buffet was a platform for Mumbaikars to experience Naga culture and know more about the community.The event, which spanned a period of three hours, was organised by the Mumbai chapter of the non-profit Naga Christian Fellowship (NCF) community which includes students, working people and families predominantly from the North-East, who have settled in Mumbai.The raw material for the buffet was sourced from the North-East and the meal was prepared by the members of NCF Mumbai. To keep the audience entertained, stalls selling NCF goodies and exotic pickles were set up. The first edition of Eats and Beats was an attempt to provide Mumbaikars with a glimpse of the rich Naga cuisine.The beauty of our country is in its diversity, and through this event we tried our best to present a slice of the Naga culinary art, that is rarely displayed in Mumbai. This event also ensured that our fellow Naga brothers, sisters and well wishers had an opportunity to come together under one roof and have a good time in general, said Edward Odyuo, secretary of NCF Mumbai. The funds raised through this event will be utilized for the NCF annual camp of Youth with a Mission (YWAM), Lonavala.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Swaminathan said, The effect of increased temperature on crop yield is real. In the late 1980s we found that when the temperature increases by 1 - 1.5 C the duration of the crop reduces by one month. Since the duration reduces, the yield drops by 300-400 kg.Tamma A. Carleton from the University of California, Berkeley and the author of the paper, tested the link between climate change, crop yields and suicide by comparing the number of suicides across India between 1967 and 2013 with crop yield and climate data. Data on suicides were collected from the National Crime Records Bureau.An additional burdenShe found crop losses due to heat damage cause additional burden on farming households and this at times leads to suicides.Dr. Carleton found suicides reported when a single days temperature increased by 1C only during the crop growing season. Similar increase in temperature during other seasons did not result in a rise in suicides.Crop yield data from 13 States from 1956 to 2000 were compared with climate change data. Dr. Carleton found annual yield falling when the temperature was above 20C during the crop-growing season.An increase in rainfall by 1 cm during the growing season leads to a decrease of about 0.8 deaths per 100,000, thus lowering the suicide rate by 7% on average, she writes.The effect of climate variation reveals that past growing season temperature strongly influences suicide rates in the following years up to about five years.For instance, when there is abundant rainfall during one growing season, the suicide rates dip for the next two or three years. Drought apparently does not seem to have any effect on suicide rates, the researcher found.The study says South India, which is generally hotter, has higher farmer suicide rates.Comparing the yields to growing season temperature for 13 States, the author found that States where the yields are more affected by high temperatures are also the States which report higher suicide rates. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh not only show severe suicide responses to temperature but crop yield is also more negatively affected by higher temperature.The study did not find any adaptive behaviour to prevent suicides in response to climate change.Weak studies in IndiaWe must undertake anticipatory research using genetic checkmating for potential changes in climate such as changes in precipitation, and temperature. I dont think we have done such research as seriously as we should have, says Prof. Swaminathan. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are the most vulnerable regions and we would be the most affected.Indias average temperature is expected to increase by 3C by 2050."

Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF), Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals and Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation are among the scrips that touched their 52-week highs on the stock exchanges on Tuesday.The RCF stock led the pack with a 10.1% jump to end the day at Rs 97 on the BSE and was followed by Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals that surged by nearly 10%. RCF and Nagarjuna were among the top-10 gainers on Tuesday. The Chambal Fertilisers scrip was up by about 5.2% while the Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals and Fertilisers and the Madras Fertilizers stocks posted 4.8% and 3.3% gains respectively during the day.""The demand for fertilisers in H1 (first half) FY2018 (2017-18) should witness good recovery, given the lower base for H1 FY2017 (2016-17) and satisfactory progress shown by monsoons leading to growth in kharif sowing,"" said K Ravichandran, senior vice president and group head, corporate ratings, ICRA.The area under kharif crops increased 3.3% year-on-year to 7.91 crore hectares during the 2017-18 season, data compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture for up to July 28 showed. The area under pulses went up 6.9% y-o-y to around 1.15 crore hectares during the timeframe. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a normal monsoon for 2017-18. Monsoon showers have been well-distributed so far with cumulative rainfall at 102% of the long period average. Interestingly, the sowing for cash crops such as sugarcane, which see extensive use of fertilisers, has shot up during the current kharif season. While the area under sugarcane increased 8.7% y-o-y to 49.15 lakh hectares, cotton sowing jumped 20.8% y-o-y to 1.12 crore hectares, data showed.But some market experts are advising caution given the steep increase in prices of these scrips. ""Valuation comfort is not there as PE (price-to-earnings) multiples are quite high,"" said G Chokkaligam, founder and managing director, Equinomics Research and Advisory.Incidentally, ratings agency Crisil has estimated that tractor sales would hit an all-time high of over 6.5 lakh units during FY2018 on the back off normal monsoon, declining interest rates and farm loan waivers by state governments. Agricultural loan waivers in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh will also put more money in the hands of farmers, the agency said."

At her flat in Santacruz (West), the number of theplas  a spicy Indian flatbread  vastly outnumber the number of people sorting through them on Wednesday evening. There are 3,371 packets, each containing 25 theplas, to be sent to Gujarats flood-hit Banaskantha district. And only 25 people.Still, they make quick work of the task, scrutinising packets they collected from residents of 41 localities across the city between 8am and 5pm that day. Theplas that are stale, undercooked or too oily will be set aside. The rest will be packed in cartons and sent to Ahmedabad via tempo, where the district collector and her team will distribute them, assisted by the National Disaster Response Force and the Border Security Force on Thursday evening.Response was overwhelming Food Army members expected 30,000 theplas to be donated on Wednesday. They got 54,250 more.As many as 41 centres were set up for the drive, including eight in south Mumbai and 22 in the western suburbs.The response was overwhelming. We set aside just one of 3,371 packets as the theplas were burnt, said Rintu Rathod, founder.The group also received 65 gunny bags of clothes, 130kg sugar and 30kg jaggery.Ive been a donor since the beginning. I had sent a packet to the collection centre at Santacruz (West) and was happy to hear that the turnout was good, said Renu Raniwala, who works for a manufacturing firm.The practised ease with which the group works tells you that this is not the first time they have undertaken such a mammoth challenge. In 2014, they got Mumbaiites to donate 35,000 theplas, which were sent to flood-hit Kashmir residents.I read about the floods and decided to do something to help those who were suffering. I realised that whenever there is a calamity, the Indian army is the first to reach the spot. However, army members usually distribute biscuits and other dry items. I wanted Kashmir residents to enjoy a hot meal instead, said Rathod.She texted 10 of her friends, asking them to contribute 25 freshly made theplas each. Why theplas? Its a nod to Rathods Gujarati roots.Her friends, in turn, forwarded the text to everyone in their phones contact lists, and soon the original message  which included a step-by-step recipe  went viral. With the help of her friend, who runs an NGO in Kashmir, Rathod ensured that few locals went hungry that night.The success of this mission encouraged the group to undertake several more. During the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the group sourced a staggering 1 lakh theplas, which they vaccum-packed to ensure a longer shelf life. In December that year, they sent 30,000 theplas to Chennai residents affected by the floods. Both times, they roped in NGOs to help them with distribution.When we started out, we planned to transport the theplas via flight and even offered to pay airline officials for the excess baggage. However, they were touched and told us this was the first time they had heard of such an initiative. They have been transporting our theplas for free since then, said Rathod.Theplas loaded onto the tempo, which started for Ahmedabad on Wednesday night. (HT Photo)Now, the group has 1,000 members across the city. New ones sign up daily, many of whom were among Wednesdays donors. There were several familiar faces at the collection centre in Ghatkopar. We collected around 3,200 theplas, 10 bags of clothes, one bag of toys and one of shoes, said electrical engineer Yogesh Zaveri, who has been a member of the group since its inception.Homemaker Neetu Singh, in charge of the collection centre at Bandra (West), said the turnout there was lower, which she attributes to a lack of awareness. We usually send out mass text messages, listing the collection centres and their addresses, two to three days before the drive. However, this time, we sent the texts a day before. Still, I estimate that I collected around 600 theplas and two boxes of clothes, she said.By the time you read this, the cartons will be well on their way to Banaskantha and thousands will be comforted by Rathods good home-cooked meals once more."

Farming accounts for 15 percent of India's $2 trillion economy and employ more than half of its 1.3 billion people."
5a0dd0f19855b76bf13d148c,What’s in a bulb,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/whats-in-a-bulb-onion-prices-rise-price-today-4782952/,2017-08-05,"The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The fall in profit was on account of lower sales owing to GST transition. M&M made a provision of Rs 144 crore to support dealers with respect to duty paid for goods lying with them following the transition to GST to overcome unavailability of input credit for certain taxes paid, as well as due to tractors being exempt from excise duty in the earlier regime.It may be noted that the auto sectors sales were affected during the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal due to phasing out of BS-III vehicles. Moreover, saturation of replacement demand coupled with production constraints of BS-IV models led to sales being the lowest in the previous 13 quarters, it added.Sales in auto sector were impacted due to transition to GST.

5a0dae9e9855b76bf13d0c01,In Karnataka  low rain drying up Cauvery,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-karnataka-low-rain-drying-up-cauvery/article19437612.ece,2017-08-06,"A severe deficit in rainfall in the Cauvery catchment areas of Karnataka could now lead to another crisis year for farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.What is the problem?At a deficit of 34% compared to normal monsoon rainfall, Indian Meteorological Department data show that the south interior Karnataka region, which encompasses the Cauvery catchment, is currently witnessing the worst monsoon in the country. In Tamil Nadu, the shortfall is 20%; and theres a 30% deficit in Kerala. Earlier this week, four major reservoirs in the Karnataka side of the Cauvery basin had a storage of just 43.18 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet). This is barely 40% of total capacity, and is even lesser than the 51 tmcft recorded last year (a drought year).In Mettur dam in Tamil Nadu, the biggest reservoir along the river, water storage was 10.35 tmcft or barely 10% of total capacity.Experts say the same conditions which saw record rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan in July caused the Cauvery deficit. Off-shore troughs or depressions (areas of low pressure) in the southern Arabian Sea or the southern Bay of Bengal allow for accumulation of south- west monsoon clouds in south India. This year, however, the depressions were off the coast of Maharashtra and Gujarat, and rain-bearing monsoon too migrated there.Locally, other factors may have played a role in reducing reservoir levels. According to environmentalists, large-scale deforestation in the Western Ghats, continued sand mining and the inability to revive tributaries have led to declining health of the catchment area and river capacity. Adding to this is the heavy dependence on the Cauvery for water-intensive crops such as sugarcane and paddy, which dominate the agrarian landscape, and the proliferation of borewells, which have had an impact on surface run-off.What is the fallout?Any deficit in the Cauverys source has a cascading effect through the basin, leading to agrarian distress. The crisis has deepened as the region is still reeling from three consecutive years of drought. There has been a spate of farmer suicides, assurances of loan waivers, and protests including those by Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi.This year, Karnataka has already stated that water will not be released for Kharif crop sowing. Instead, preference has been given to drinking water needs, estimated to be 30 tmcft (more than half of it for Bengaluru city alone) till the next monsoon. With lower water release from Karnataka, the main samba crop in Tamil Nadu will be under threat. Last year, Tamil Nadu, which is in the grip of an unprecedented drought, had witnessed a 41% dip in sowing area.What next?Preparations for drought have started, with the Karnataka government drawing up a contentious Rs. 30 crore plan for cloud seeding (spraying clouds with silver iodide to amass rain-bearing clouds).However, many experts say this will do little to alleviate the situation.For now, all eyes are on the Supreme Court which is hearing appeals by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala challenging the 2007 Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal award. The share of Cauvery had been determined as 270 tmcft to Karnataka and 419 tmcft to Tamil Nadu, among others.This year, conflict over water-sharing is bound to rise again. In June and July, Karnataka was to release 44 tmcft to abide by the award. So far, just 7 tmcft has been released.With elections looming in the State, water release is a politically-sensitive issue. Last year, Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles were set on fire in Bengaluru and one person was killed after the Supreme Court order to release water.Moreover, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah hails from the Cauvery belt and it is here that the Congress has to perform well if it hopes to return to power in the State; the BJP is in a bind as the NDA-led Centre cannot be seen as favouring either of the States.Mohit M.

The study was conducted with a sample group of 330 male drug users at three de-addiction centres in Jogeshwari, Bandra and Borivali.The study said 35% of the users are below the age of 29 while 27% are between 30-39 years. Only 18% were aged 40-49 years. Majority of the respondents (53%) were educated up to secondary school, 19% were illiterate, and only 7% were graduates.Out of the total respondents, 66% were Muslim, 32% were Hindu and only 2% were Christian. Almost 59% were married, 36% were unmarried, while 4% had separated from their life partner and 1% were in a live-in relationship. As much as 44% of the respondents were sole bread-earners for the family, 25% were earning along with other family members and 31% depended on the family for their bread and butter.About 99% had used brown sugar, 77% had used charas, and 38% had used ganja, while only 1% had used LSD for their drug abusing practices, the study said.

Khot, however, refused to step down from the ministry, saying chief minister Devendra Fadnavis would take a call in the matter.""Khot has not performed his duties as a member of the party and has also used objectionable language against workers. His loyalties towards the farmers are questionable and hence we have decided to sack him,"" said Dashrath Sawant, head of the four-member inquiry committee appointed by the SSS to take a call on Khot's removal. Sawant was speaking to reporters in Pune.Sawant said, ""The SSS has a minister of state berth in the Fadnavis government. Since Khot has been ousted from the organization, he must quit as minister.""Asked whether the SSS would withdraw support to the state government, Sawant said, ""A call will be taken by the state executive.""It may be mentioned here that the SSS has no elected member in the state legislature. Khot was appointed as a minister through the BJP quota. The SSS has an MP in its president Raju Shetti. The BJP feels the need to keep an alliance going with the Swambhimani Paksha because the SSS has a strong presence in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra.Khot had recently appeared before the SSS inquiry committee which was mandated to probe his ""anti-party"" stance and other activities since he joined the state cabinet. Shetti has been expressing displeasure over Khot's growing proximity with the BJP.Interestingly, SSS had a pre-poll alliance with the BJP and it was Shetti who insisted on Khot being included in the cabinet. However, Shetti and Khot fell out over various issues including the latter promoting his son in politics.Speaking to TOI after his sacking, Khot said, ""I have toiled day and night for the farmers. I have made every possible effort to take decisions for their welfare. Shetti has formed an alliance with different parties at different levels and takes decision without consulting anyone. He is an opportunist politician and takes decisions based on what he can get for his benefit.""Asked whether he would join the BJP or float a new party, Khot said, ""I cannot speak on this issue now. I will have to talk to my followers before announcing a future course of action.""Meanwhile, Shetti said it was up to the state government to decide on retaining Khot as a minister. Speaking to reporters in Kolhapur, he said, ""Our inquiry committee worked for more than a month and held discussions with several party officials before deciding to expel Khot. As per my information, there were several complaints from party activists regarding his style of functioning which might have resulted in his removal.""Shetti said, ""Our party has already given an ultimatum to the state government over the issue of loan waiver. We will soon hold a meeting of party workers to discuss continuing support to the government.""Meanwhile, senior BJP leader and cabinet minister Chandrakant Patil told reporters, ""This is an internal issue of the SSS and I don't think it is appropriate for me to comment.

The state government with the help of 2030 Water Resources Group (2030WRG) has decided to save and divert a large quantity of water, going surplus to perennial crops such as sugarcane , to water-starved rabbi crops like jowar and tur. Maharashtra 's sugarcane cultivation covers less than 4% of the cropped area but uses 70% water for irrigation in command areas. The government hopes to reduce water use in the sugarcane sector by bringing 50% sugarcane cultivation under drip irrigation in two years. Agriculture uses 80% freshwater in the state.The state and 2030WRG on Monday launched the Maharashtra Water Resources Multi-Stakeholder Platform, which will have six members each from government, private and civil society. C A Birajdar, secretary of state irrigation department, said while diverting 50% sugarcane water to rabbi crops, such as gram and other vegetables, the use of the remaining water for sugarcane will also be optimized to ensure greater sugarcane production over 1.5 million hectares.Studies show Maharashtra faces a high risk to climate change with longer dry spells, more frequent droughts and high-intensity rainfall. Already, farmers in rain-fed areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha are hard hit by recurrent droughts. However, a recent 2030WRG's hydro-economic analysis shows Maharashtra can achieve 6% agricultural growth in rain-fed areas by shifting to higher value crops, and through better and more efficient water use and management.Bastiaan Mohrmann, co-lead, Asia, 2030WRG, said the project will improve the livelihood and strengthen the resilience of marginal and smallholder farmers in Maharashtra. ""We are developing a project proposal for $270 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund, a body which aims to scale up climate change adaptation in rain-fed agricultural areas to be implemented across Marathwada and Vidarbha to make them drought-proof,"" he said."
5a0f11cd9855b76bf13d5b6f,Maharashtra Kranti Morcha: All you need to know,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/aug/10/maharashtra-kranti-morcha-all-you-need-to-know-1641248.html,2017-08-10,"MUMBAI: Wednesday was the completion of one year of the silent protest marches by the Maratha community of Maharashtra. The Maratha Kranti Morchas represent the churn going on among intermediate caste groups in several parts of India, for instance, the Jats in Rajasthan and Haryana, the Gujjars in Rajasthan, the Patidars in Gujarat and the Kapus in Andhra Pradesh.Seen together, these communities are united by a demand for reservation, regardless of the fact that they enjoy reasonable access to resources and social status. In each state, they represent a challenge to the ruling coalitions headed by the BJP or its allies.In the context of Maharashtra, the Maratha protests, triggered by the gang-rape of a minor girl from the community on July 18, 2016, could pose a challenge to the government of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in the months ahead.The first of the 58 Maratha Kranti Morchas was taken out in Ahmednagar on August 9, 2016, in the aftermath of the Kopardhi gang-rape. It was the first time that the community came together on a non-political platform to make demands such as reservation and a reining in of the Atrocities Act. Within a span of a couple of months, 30 such protest marches were taken out across Maharashtra. The latest was held in Mumbai on Wednesday when more than half a million people marched.As in other protests by intermediate caste groups in other states, the Maratha rallies have remained steadfastly apolitical, a quality that confounds the traditional political parties. The Congress and the NCP, parties that traditionally enjoyed the support of the Maratha community in Maharashtra, made initial advances to claim leadership of the agitation but backed off in the face of fierce opposition from the marchers.While professing to be apolitical, it was significant that the flare-up of the morchas last year happened at a time when Maharashtra was in the throes of local body elections, which were seen as a sort of a mid-term vote on the performance of the Fadnavis government. The results were not too encouraging for the Congress and NCP: the Marathas did not vote for them despite the two opposition parties joining hands against the BJP. The BJP was able to retain the support it had earned in the 2014 Assembly election.However, the agitation polarised non-Marathas social groups -- mainly other backward classes (who account for more than one-third of the states population) and backward caste voters.During the post-demonetisation period in November 2016, the agitation saw a lull. After the protest march at Nagpur during the winter session of the Assembly, there were small, localised rallies to keep the issue burning. But Wednesday's big march in Mumbai, coming after a gap of eight months, has again boosted the marchers' fervour.Congress leader Narayan Rane said on the eve of the Mumbai march, If the government doesnt agree to all the demands, future battles will be fought in the way that the Marathas have always fought.In the popular reckoning, the Marathas are not an economically or socially underprivileged community. But its leaders have in recent years been making a case for its inclusion in the reserved category. In a report submitted to the state government in 2014, Narayan Rane said, The Marathas are mostly farmers and labourers who depend on the employment guarantee scheme. Their economic condition is pathetic. Maratha students are poor and often dont have money to complete their education and struggle to get good jobs. The committee, headed by Rane, recommended a 16 per cent quota for the Marathas and the BJP government brought in a proposal to grant it to them. However, as with other such political tactics in other states, its risks coming up against legal hurdles. A similar decision by the UPA government in Maharashtra was quashed by the court.As a response to the court setback, a committee was constituted under education minister Vinod Tawde to gather evidence of the social backwardness of the community. However, there was a new twist to the issue when talk began of constituting a backward class commission that would review the committee's findings. Not much has been done on that issue in the past few months, though the government has given some educational sops to students of the community. However, the leadership of the community is not quite satisfied with such measures.On the strength of the Mumbai march, the agitation looks poised to increase in intensity and political heft. This likely to test the political acumen of Fadnavis, a Brahmin, as he steers his party towards the next Assembly election in the state.Maratha demands1. Speedy prosecution and punishment of the culprits in the Kopardi rape and murder case.2. Reservation in education and government jobs.3. Implementation of recommendations of the M S Swaminathan Committee.4. Amendment to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 to stop its misuse.5.

Stop distortion of history and defamation of the Maratha community and its revered personalities.Maratha dominanceJalgaon, Dhule, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, Latur, Osmanabad ------Who are the Marathas?The Marathas constitute around 36 per cent of Maharashtra's population. Eleven of the 18 chief ministers to the state have been from this community.However, their representation in government jobs is 15 per cent, and 12 per cent in technical courses and higher education. About 73 per cent of the community falls in the middle-income group. Fifty per cent of land sellers and 67 per cent of borrowers in the state are Marathas.The Marathas dominate 16 of the 36 districts of Maharashtra. Their population in these districts is 48 per cent of the total population of the district.The community controls the dairy and sugar industries in these areas and controls about 90 per cent of the professional colleges.The trigger: Kopardi gangrapeOn July 13, 2016, a 15-year-old Maratha girl from Kopardi village in Ahmednagar was gang-raped and murdered by four students, allegedly from a Dalit community.The incident took place when the victim was returning after meeting her grandfather. She was accosted by three men who raped her before throttling her to death. There were many injuries on her body. The rapists broke her limbs before throttling her to death.The incident triggered a series of silent protests by the Maratha Kranti group. For over a month, marches were held in Akola, Nanded, Beed, Osmanabad, Aurangabad, Jalgaon and Jalna districts.Similar quota demands in other statesJats in Haryana: The Jats have been agitating for inclusion in the other backward class (OBC) category in Haryana, Rajasthan UP, and the National Captial Region.Patidars in Gujarat: This influential community in Gujarat has been on the war path for quotas since 2015, lead by a young politician Hardik Patel. The Patidars, like the Jats of Haryana, demand inclusion in the OBC category.Gurjars in Rajasthan: Gurjars are included in the OBC category in Rajasthan. But they want Scheduled tribe status. Their protests have often turned violent.Kapus in AP: The Kapus are an agrarian community in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, whey they constitute more than 25 per cent of the population. They have been demanding reservation for three decades, led by their leader Mudragada Padmanabham."

The seven-twelve land title documents of these farmers do not have mention of these loans, so they will be eligible for fresh loans from banks,"" the minister said.Seven-twelve or ""saat-bara"" extract is a document maintained by the Revenue Department for agricultural land which contains information such as survey number and owner's name.

Perhaps, Shah doesnt know how to behave, Siddaramaiah told reporters seeking his reaction on the issue.On Sunday, Shah visited the seer in what was seen as a move to woo the Vokkaliga community, which holds the Mutt in high reverence. However, Shah courted controversy when a picture showing him seated crosslegged in front of the seer went viral. Sitting with one leg crossed on top of the other is considered informal and disrespectful.The chief minister also hit back at Shah for calling the Karnataka government Indias most corrupt. He has no moral right to speak on corruption when he has corrupt people flanking him all the time. In the last four years, Congress has given a scam-free administration in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah said.Earlier in the day, Union Minister D V Sadananda Gowda targeted the Siddaramaiah government for not waiving loans taken by farmers from nationalised banks. Governments of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra wrote off farm loans taken from nationalised banks. It wont be a new thing if Karnataka does it. It was under the Modi government that we gave interest-free loans to sugarcane factories and ensured that 90% farmers got their dues. Also, the devolution of central funds to states is up from 32% to 42%. It is the state governments responsibility to ensure the excess 10% reaches farmers, Gowda said.Siddaramaiah responded by pointing out that former prime ministers, Manmohan Singh and V P Singh, had waived farm loans worth Rs 72,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore, respectively. If he (Manmohan Singh) could do it, why cant Modi? If the BJP doesnt do it, they are anti-farmer, he said.DH News Service"

These robbers have slashed commuters during peak hour and have also not spared RPF sleuths.""Most of the men caught for looting cellphones or cash from commuters are drug users. They are hooked to brown sugar, mephedrone or whitener and need to make Rs 1000 to 2000 per day to fund their addiction. Besides blades, they could carry pen knives or cigarette lighters. They may even use the weapon to injure themselves so as to avert a conviction,"" a senior RPF official said.On August 5, three men were spotted in the CCTV footage of Kurla station, around 1 pm, while they were robbing a commuter's cellphone near a first-class coach. The RPF kept a watch for the men to return. At 3.20pm, one of the three was spotted again on platform 1 and was picked up. On sustained questioning, he led the RPF to his associates. ""At the chowky, one of the robbers Sakir Sayed, slashed his neck with a blade that he had been hiding in his pocket,"" said senior inspector Suresh Atri of Kurla RPF. Offenders may later claim, before court, that the prosecuting agency had inflicted the injury on them. ""We shot a video clip of Sayed where he admitted he had hurt himself. Sayed claimed he wasn't involved in any crime and was only hanging out with a friend when he got arrested,"" said Atri.Another trick used by these offenders is to fake an attack of epileptic fits on being arrested. Sadiq Shaikh, who was nabbed last month, remained coiled on the floor till we sprinkled some water on him,"" said an RPF officer. Another offender, Manoj Kamble, caught on Saturday, started frothing from the mouth while his questioning was on. But he too sat upright soon after.The RPF has compiled CCTV grabs to understand the different modus operandi used by these offenders. ""In some cases, a robber discreetly pokes a commuter standing at the door of a train that has just begun to move. The commuter drops his phone on the platform, as a result. The robber then picks it up and pretends he is all set to hand it to the cops while he actually pockets the device,"" said an officer. Another method used by robbers is to jump into a coach, along with the other co-passengers, as soon as a train arrives on the platform. The robber then steals someone's phone in the melee and gets off, claiming he has boarded a wrong train.A pickpocket, Gafar Ali Shaikh, who has been nabbed by the Kurla GRP over and over since last year, gave a demo to investigators on how he hides a razor blade in his cheek and pulls it out whenever he has to slice a commuter's pocket.The RPF has now issued an advisory for commuters to keep a check on their belongings every time they board or alight from a coach and to not brandish their phones or valuables while standing at the compartment entrance."

However, a neutral policy stance was retained owing to expectations of a higher inflation trajectory in coming days, the report noted.According to Nomura, July inflation data confirmed that inflation troughed in June, and going ahead inflation is expected to see an uptrend due to rebound in vegetable prices.Moreover, GST has also resulted in a slightly faster pace of core inflation momentum.""Most MPC members highlighted upside risks from the implementation of house rent allowance (HRA) increases, fiscal impulses such as farm loan waivers, proximity to 2019 elections, the recent uptick in inflation expectations, rising vegetable prices and the impact of GST,"" Nomura said.The wholesale inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent in July from 0.90 per cent in June 2017, mainly on account of turnaround in prices of food articles, especially vegetables.Retail inflation jumped to 2.36 per cent in the month, chiefly driven by hardening of prices of sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants.""In view of the recent data on inflation and the neutral bias of most MPC members, we expect the RBI to stay on hold in October likely with a 5-1 vote,"" the report said.Nomura expects the GST-related activity disruption to also wane, and growth and inflation to trend higher in the next 6-12 months."

5a1283dc9855b76bf13e0cdb,Indian American develops breakthrough therapy for sepsis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indian-american-develops-breakthrough-therapy-for-sepsis/article19527527.ece,2017-08-20,"Each year globally, more than 600,000 infants die of sepsis, a condition of bacterial infection that spreads fast and leads to organ failure. But a therapy developed by a team led by an American professor of Indian origin, Pinaki Panigrahi, over the last 20 years and details of which were published in Nature this week could do wonders. The therapy has been found to reduce the risk of infection by 40% in trials and it can be inexpensive  less than one dollar for a course  Dr. Panigrahi told The Hindu by phone.Dr. Panigrahi is a professor of epidemiology and paediatrics at the Child Health Research Institute and Center for Global Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Centres College of Public Health.The therapy is to feed the infant with good bacteria that will populate his/her gut and block harmful bacteria. The probiotic bacterial strain is aided with a non-absorbable sugar to enhance its ability to effectively colonise the gut  researchers call the probiotic-sugar combination a synbiotic. The oral therapy starts during day 2-4 of life, as a preventive measure, much like a vaccine.More than a quarter of neonatal deaths in India are due to sepsis, which is one of the two most common causes of neonatal deaths globally, according to a study published in the Lancet Global Health in 2016. In a significant number of cases, the infection probably begins in the gut.Dr. Panigrahi is happy about the outcome of the trials that began in 2008 in Odisha, where he grew up. But he is equally excited about the prospects of some unexpected and surprising collateral benefits that the therapy appears to provide. This includes a reduction in lower respiratory tract and other infections among the infants who were administered the synbiotic, indicating an overall improvement in immunity status.Apart from saving babies from sepsis and respiratory tract infection, this type of intervention has much bigger and wider ramifications. The most relevant is its impact on stunting, said Dr. Panigrahi, explaining the wide prevalence of stunting in India, which is due to gut dysfunction that starts early in a childs life.Tropical enteropathyEarly infections and continued exposure to a large bacterial load during the first two years of life results in tropical enteropathy (an intestinal disorder that affects the ability to absorb nutrients), which did not exist when I went to medical school in India 30 years ago. It was something we read about in our textbooks. Such tropical enteropathy and gut dysfunction is rampant in India now and 40% of children under the age of two are stunted, he said, adding that stunted children end up with low cognitive development. When coupled with intrauterine stress and fast accumulation of fat during early infancy, stunting leads to chronic disease such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood. Dr. Panigrahi hopes to expand the therapys dose and duration to combat the prevalence of childhood stunting, which stunts the countrys economy and development too.The probiotic study in neonates, largest in medical history, covered 4,556 babies, and stopped short of the initial plan to cover 8,000 of them. The ethics of medical trials require that once it is found to be definitively good or bad, it must stop. In this case, the results were clear and undeniably good according to an independent data safety monitoring board. Dr. Panigrahis team screened over 280 strains of probiotic bacteria before hitting upon a specific strain of Lactobacillus plantarum, abundantly found in curd, and fermented fruits and vegetables. These bacteria populate the healthy infant stool rather quickly and the strain used in the experiment was isolated from the diaper of an 11 month-old healthy baby.Averting health crisisThe indiscriminate use of wide-spectrum antibiotics is causing resistance to many drugs and a probiotic solution such as this could avert a health crisis in the making, Dr. Panigrahi said. A graduate from MKCG Medical College in Odisha, Professor Panigrahis heart remains in India. He travels to Delhi, Mumbai, Puducherry and various sites in Odisha multiple times a year. He says the results of the trial are also an indicator of the unexplored potential of ancient Ayurvedic discoveries made thousands of years ago in India.The concept of consuming probiotics in the form of curd and the importance of gut health dates back to the originating days of Ayurveda that dates back to 6,000 BC, he said, adding that the current national interest in Ayurveda should expand to support modern clinical trials of traditional medicines.This study is a testament to the world-class research done by my colleagues at the Asian Institute of Public Health in Bhubaneswar, as well as U.S. collaborators at the Emerging Pathogens Institute in Florida and the Medical Center at Michigan State University. Whats more, it demonstrates Indias ability to find its own solutions with overseas collaboration, he said."

He was arrested on August 13, four days after the massive pilferage of government funds by non-governmental organisation (NGO), Srijan Vikas Sahyog Samiti, came to light.Also the father of a local JD(U) leader, Mahesh Mandal was charged for working as a conduit between banks and the NGO in siphoning off hundreds of crores of government funds over several years.

The crushing has only began this season and officials at the factory told TOI that so far, it was well below par.""Only one of our two boilers is working, sugarcane production is low too,"" said Rame Gowda, a former managing director of the factory who has now been roped in as adviser.A few kilometres away , the Pandavapura Co-operative Sugar Factory, remains shut.""There is no work happening here,"" said the security incharge, the only person on the premises. Four other factories in the region have shut over the past three years.Venkatesh Murthy, vicePresident of Bannari Sugar Factory and committee member of the South Indian Sugar Mills Association, said there was no way the demand for sugar would be met domestically this year.""The government has al ready imported around 5 lakh tonne of sugar this year. The situation in Karnataka, which is the third largest sugar producing state after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, is likely to further push sugar prices up,"" Murthy said.He added that the factories -which take stock of the sowing during the season -are expecting only 50% of the average sugarcane this year. ""Sugar price has already touched Rs 35 (in the wholesale market), and we expect it to hit Rs 45 to Rs 50 in the absence of timely imports,"" he said. In the retail market, sugar costs upwards of Rs 45 a kilo.""Last year too, crushing was poor with only about 50% having been achieved. The situation was particularly bad in south and central Karnataka,"" Murthy said.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of All India Sugarcane Growers' Association , said the trouble began in 201314 when sugar factories could not pay the farmers. The following year, sugar prices increased to Rs 35 per kilogram from Rs 25.""However, sugar factories could not pay the dues even that year, pushing several farmers into distress. And since that year, monsoon has failed,"" he said. Factories still owe some Rs 700 crore to farmers, he said."

Not only did St Kitts & Nevis put on a gutsy show against opponents ranked 28 places above them, but did so with a B team made up of amateurs and semi-professionals, and an average age of 22.8 years.A precise header from the 57 Jackichand Singh, assisted by Rowlin Borges, had put India in lead in the 39th minute but the visitors hit back with a goal in the 71st minute. Even though India emerged at top, having beaten Mauritius 2-1 in the first match, in the tournament, it wasnt the best of shows India has put up in recent times, which has seen them climb to 97 in the rankings. With the AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Macau, away from home, on the horizon, these two matches were mainly used to get players some game time.But the young Indian team, without their Bengaluru FC stars including Sunil Chhetri, failed to stamp their authority on their lower-ranked opponents. The team has failed to sustain level of play the full 90 minutes, and it was evident on Thursday against the side from the Caribbean as the hosts failed to back up their solid first-half performance.They gave their opponents too many chances and too much space to come back. The substitutes by St Kitts & Nevis were the ones who led the fightback. Forward Bertie Carlos set the ball in motion, when his shot at goal was saved by Indian goalkeeper Subrata Paul. That led to a sequence of corner, free-kick, corner, corner for the visitors, and their confidence seemed to grow with each set piece.On the last corner, the ball was directed to Hanley Tiran, standing outside the box. He flicked it on, and Amory Gvaune caught it on the volley and sent it at the back of the net. Indias desperate attempts in the five minutes of added time came to zilch as they could not quite get the final shot.deepti@newindianexpress.com"

The appointment of the managing director and other staff, and granting of support price to the cane farmers was previously handled by the agriculture department, but these works would be now carried out by the cooperation department, Sardesai said.The factory is presently facing a huge loss and in an attempt to bring back profits to the lone state-funded cooperative sugar factory, the state government had plans to modernize it before the 45th crushing season of the factory, which is likely to start in October-November.The four decade-old factory had become a white elephant, incurring losses of over Rs 80 crore with a technical committee suggesting the necessity of modernization. Following the suggestion, the factory has already submitted a proposal , costing Rs 29.32 crore, to the state government long ago.The factory has a crushing capacity of 1,200 metric tonnes canes a day and the government wishes to enhance the crushing capacity to 1,800 metric tonnes canes per day. Records reveal that, on an average, the factory crushes about 1.2 lakh metric tonnes , including 85,000 metric tonnes of local canes, to produce about one lakh tonne of sugar every year."

Ever since Rane's son, Neelesh, lost the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Rane lost the 2014 assembly election and a by-election in Bandra, he seems to have made up his mind to quit the Congress. Rane's contention is that when he joined the Congress on the assurance that he would be made the chief minister. Rane may have considered joining the BJP as he felt he would not get along well with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and the BJP would be a better option.Reports of his feelers to the BJP were leaked to the media after he met Shah in the presence of Fadnavis in Ahmedabad. Senior BJP leaders are of the view that if Rane defects, it would improve their position in Konkan belt. ""Rane will join the party if the offer comes from the BJP leadership and the entry will be on his terms,"" said a BJP minister.Speculation is that Rane covets a cabinet position and wants Lok Sabha and assembly tickets for elder son Neelesh and Neetesh. But the plan has been indefinitely delayed due to a leak in a section of media.'Advani' in the makingBJP leader Eknath Khadse says he is ""L K Advani in the making"" after suspense continues over his induction into the state cabinet.

In the wake of a row over the MIDC land deal, the BJP leadership sought Khadse's resignation. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had appointed former Bombay high court judge Justice D S Zoting to probe into the charges of irregularities against Khadse and submit a report within three months. The committee took nearly a year to complete the work. Khadse was expecting that since the report has been submitted and there are no major strictures, he would be inducted into the cabinet.

In Baramati , the Maratha strongman's home town, all eyes were on how Pawar would react. The former Union agriculture minister took the matter sportingly and send a quintal of sugar to the Pune meteorology office. Under the rules, it was not possible for the staff to accept the ""gift"". But subsequently it was resolved to distribute the sugar to nearby educational institutions. While this time the meteorology department's forecast was spot on, but its predictions have been incorrect on several occasions. Pawar's contention was that in view of the massive advances in technology and emergency of satellite-imaging system, why was it difficult for the meteorology department to provide an accurate forecast.""It is high time that the meteorology department secures new technology gets its act together,"" says a former Chief Secretary.Congress leader Narayan Rane is cosying up to the BJP. He is said to be expecting a proposal from BJP chief Amit Shah and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Ever since Rane's son, Neelesh, lost the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Rane lost the 2014 assembly election and a by-election in Bandra, he seems to have made up his mind to quit the Congress.Rane's contention is that he joined the Congress on the assurance that he would be made the chief minister, but the party did not honour its promise. Rane may have preferred joining the BJP as he felt he would not get along well with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and the BJP would be a better option.Reports of his feelers to the BJP were leaked to the media after he met Shah in the presence of Fadnavis in Ahmedabad. BJP leaders are of the view that if Rane defects, it would improve their position in Konkan belt. ""Rane will join the party if the offer comes from the BJP leadership and the entry will be on his terms,"" said a BJP minister. Speculation is that Rane is vying for key posts for himself and his sons.BJP leader Eknath Khadse says he is ""L K Advani"" in the making after suspense continues over his induction into the state cabinet. Khadse made some controversial remarks at a public meeting in his home district, Jalgaon. After Khadse left the venue, his rival, medical education minister Girish Mahajan, took control of the meeting.In the wake of a row over the MIDC land deal, the BJP leadership sought Khadse's resignation. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had appointed former Bombay high court judge Justice D S Zoting to probe into the charges of irregularities against Khadse and submit a report within three months. The committee took nearly a year to complete the work. Khadse was expecting that since the report has been submitted and there are no major strictures, he would be inducted into the cabinet. During the monsoon session of the state legislature, Khadse had raised the issue of his rehabilitation, but it appears that fortune does not favour the ex-revenue minister."
5a0f51779855b76bf13d7e47,"In Mumbai, it's granola and chilly modaks this Ganeshotsav!",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-mumbai-its-granola-and-chilly-modaks-this-ganeshotsav/articleshow/60275115.cms,2017-08-30,"You can barely walk past the busy Ranade Road, Dadar and not buy a modak . For, the area is known for its melt-as-you-bite-into it traditional sweet. The city's other areas that are thronging with Ganeshotsav festivity, also see a steady stream of customers for this steamed delight. But it's no longer found in just mawa and barfi variations. This time, how about tucking into healthy modaks with unique flavours, like some city-based sweetmakers are trying out...You might think the idea for a granola modak might take time to catch on. No, says Tanvi Kewal Chheda, who decided to make the novel recipe this year. ""This is a modak, but with a homemade granola addition, comprising rice bran, wheat bran, wheat or corn flakes and rolled oats, and raisins or cranberries for flavour,"" she says. And the modaks won't crumble away if that's what you're thinking  dates are the binding agent here. ""This is a good replacement for the usual mithai versions,"" she adds.Seeds have several health benefits and they've also popped into modaks this year. Bandra-based foodie Yajur Khanna makes about seven variations with pumpkin and chia seeds. ""I've also tried date-oat-coconut, lemon and saffron and kesar-pista  so they're interesting flavours with a healthy twist. She explains, ""No ghee, khoya or sugar is used in the preparation. For sweetness, we use dates, raisins and cranberry paste.""And are you a peanut butter fan? Your breakfast staple has also gone a la modak. In this, the sweet is made with a little low-fat homemade peanut butter and saffron milk as the binding agent. ""We started these different healthier versions this year as there is so much awareness about health issues and with so many Mumbaikars shifting to different diets there is a demand for these. Yes, the healthier modaks may cost a little more than the regular ones as dryfruits and other ingredients are used as the base here, but I have heard people say, 'It doesn't matter; health comes first. It's good to know people are willing to make a healthier switch,"" she adds.Folks seem to want to push the proverbial envelope and go ahead of the regular fare, which is what is prompting foodies to make zany flavours such as red velvet and strawberry. Chef Rakhee Vasawani tried a refreshing chocolate and paan modak and Kemps Corner-based confectionist Shradha Mehra Virani, has fused innovation into the sweet with flavours like sea salt-caramel and cupcake modaks, with themed toppings. Other quirky flavours include orange, blueberry, coffee and a 'kairi modak', too! ""A few years ago who would have thought of green mango modaks, but today people are more willing to accept other tastes when it comes to festive sweets. This one is more tangy, for instance,"" says Khushboo Soni from Andheri who started making these flavours from this year. If you want to spice things up, take your taste buds on a ride with a 'chilly modak'. Adds Khushboo, ""When you bite into this modak, it's sweet and then comes the piquant flavour.""Kings Circle resident Neetu Nandrajog has gone a step further to make cake modaks. She explains, ""These are cakes carved into modak shapes. You can do so many flavours apart from the normal chococlate cake, like rasmalai-cake modak. To make it, the cake is moisturised with milk used for rasmalai and has pieces of the cottage cheese in between the layers. You can also do a blackforest-rasgulla cake modak in the same way.""Fusion has found its way here as well. Foodie Richa Lulla is doing a fusion modak, with 'til gul-praline'. ""These are two popular flavours so I thought why not merge them and it's been a hit,"" she says.If you're having family and friends over at this auspicious time, serve them these dessert-style 'waffle modaks'. Here, mini-sized modaks are made and placed in the pockets of the waffle. Shaved coconut is added on top and it's drizzled with maple syrup or honey."

The seminar at NEDFi House, Dispur, was held in concert with the Centre's target to double farmers' income by the end of 2022. The conclave comprised three sessions - Opportunities and challenges in agri and allied sector in the Northeast, Upscaling the non-farm sector in rural northeastern region and Rural services for livelihood promotion and imparting skills, empowering people. The deputy general manager of Nabard, S. Samantara, said: ""We are aiming to double the income of farmers in nominal terms by 2022. Agricultural growth should be increased to more than four per cent. To achieve this, a double-edged strategy of increasing production and raising prices is being contemplated. Ninety per cent of farmers in the region are small and marginal farmers. The farmers' income comprises 45 to 50 per cent from the primary sector, 20 to 30 per cent from the allied sectors and the rest comes from other activities.

Samantara also stressed development of post-harvesting facilities and warehousing to add value to agricultural products. ""Innovation in mission-mode provided by Nabard through innovative products such as Kisan Credit Cards, is required,"" he added. North Eastern Council member C.K.

In order to realise the vision of our Prime Minister to double farmers' income by 2022, specially in the Northeast, per hectare-productivity has to increase; multiple crop farming is needed and farmers needs to get involved in allied sectors. Other potential areas in the region include fishery and piggery. Farmers should consider cultivating products in high demand like lentils, coconut, black pepper, sugarcane, among others, in the Northeast. Due to small land holdings among farmers in the Northeast, formation of cooperatives is required"". ""There is an urgent need for packaging and processing of agriculture and horticulture products in the Northeast,"" project director, Assam Skill Development Mission, A.P. Tiwari, said while delivering the special address at the inaugural session of the conclave. He said products like betel nuts are being exported from Assam but there is no processing and packaging facilities. He also highlighted that banana cultivation in the Northeast needs to be popularised and should be marketed as in Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. ""The Northeast has human resources but no industry. This is leading to exodus of human resources from the region. Industrialisation of small-scale products which are unique to the Northeast should be started to cater to the local market with indigenous and locally produced goods in order to restrict import of similar items,"" Tiwari said. ""Mechanisation will increase production and lead to better quality control. In Assam, there are entrepreneurs in bell metal products, but it is still being imported from Moradabad to the Northeast. There is a scope for big industries in areas like dairy which has huge potential."""

The most immediate challenge for the country is to become number five in the foreseeable future, but in the end my vision for India is we will be one of the top three markets in the world for Coca-Cola company. We had a rough few months  end of last year and beginning of this year  but things are starting to come back. India is going to return to a vibrant growth, Mr. Quincey said, addressing a select gathering of mediapersons.Buyer preference for non-sugary healthier beverages had led to tepid demand for aerated drinks. Promising to reduce sugar content in Coca-Cola products, Mr. Quincey said faster growth in India would also come from non-carbonated (non-sparkling) drinks, as elsewhere. However, sparkling drinks will continue to grow here and our immediate focus will be on the same. The company has introduced Minute Maid Pulpy Santra which contains juice from oranges locally grown in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The company aims to invest $1.7 billion in Indias fruit circular economy over the next five years, of which $900 million would be towards procurement of processed fruit pulp and fruit concentrate. On competition, Mr. Quincey said, We pay a lot of attention to what competition does, not just the big players but also new entrants because they are doing something that the consumers find interesting.Mr. Quinceys visit comes four months after he took over the reins of Coca Cola from Muhtar Kent, who remains chairman of the board at Coca-Cola globally.At the moment, we have got a lot of investments in the bottling operations in India and we are very happy with them and thats going to continue, he said."
5a10e94d9855b76bf13daa3f,Sugar output likely to rise by 18%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sugar-output-likely-to-rise-by-18/article19597862.ece,2017-09-01,"The country's domestic sugar production in 2018 is likely to increase by 18%-20% to around 24.5 million tonnes, rating agency ICRA said on Thursday. It said that the growth was driven principally by a recovery in cane availability in Maharashtra and north Karnataka, supported by monsoon rain and an increase in sugar production in Uttar Pradesh.ICRA, Senior Vice President Sabyasachi Majumdar said that in comparison to the sugar year of 2017, the domestic sugar production in sugar year 2018 could rise by 18%-20% and production could be between 24  24.5 million tonnes.Sugar production in south Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is likely to remain impacted by consecutive seasons of poor rainfall. This, coupled with an increase in the cane costs due to higher fair and remunerative price in sugar year 2018, is likely to negatively impact the performance of the sugar mills in these regions, he said.Drought impactMr. Majumdar said that in terms of profitability, the south-based mills especially those in Tamil Nadu and south Karnataka are likely to be adversely affected in the financial year of 2018. This is due to continued drought which is expected to significantly impact their cane availability in sugar year 2018 and the increase in the cane costs.While mills in Maharashtra and north Karnataka are likely to be negatively impacted by higher costs, they are likely to reap benefits of higher production. As far as Uttar Pradesh-based mills are concerned, they are likely to be benefitted by the healthy sugar prices along with continued healthy volumes and recovery rates, although that impact could be partly offset by higher cane prices, he said.He said that according to ICRA estimates, sugar year 2017 would end with a stock between 4 - 4.5 million tonnes, which is likely to be sufficient for around two months of domestic consumption, although there is a possibility of a localised sugar deficit in the southern and western States during the forthcoming festival season. While the shortage in the west is likely to be mitigated by early commencement of cane crushing, the deficit in the south is largely likely to be handled by way of imports from west and north India, said Mr. Majumdar."

Today, apart from the forts and ruins, some dating to the pre-Mughal period, this place is famous for one more thing  its desserts like khowa jalebis and gulab jamuns.Khowa Jalebi is a special sweet of Madhya Pradesh, locally known there as mawa jalebis.While this delicacy is made in Indore, Jabalpur and many other towns and cities, Burhanpur is one place which really prides itself for this sweet.Unlike the usual jalebis made of maida, this jalebi batter is made using a batter of khowa, and milk with a little maida just to bind it together.The prepared batter is squeezed out from a cloth into jalebi patterns and deep fried in oil to get its dark brown colour. Finally, the jalebis are immersed in sugar syrup to soak up the sweetness. The sweet can be enjoyed standalone or it can be enjoyed with milk or malai.Looking at the popularity of the dish, mithai shops from Burhanpur decided to take this sweet outside the town and set up outlets in other cities.In Mohammed Ali Road of Mumbai, a branch of a well-known jalebi shop from Burhanpur is extremely popular, especially during Ramzan.Shahjahanabad of Old Delhi is another place where this delicacy is available.In Hyderabad too, Burhanpur Khowa Jalebi, a small shop in the Old City, is exclusively selling the khowa jalebis and gulab jamuns from Burhanpur.Mohammed Dawood is the owner of Burhanpur Khoya Jalebi, an outlet opposite Mir Chowk Police Station on the Mur Alam Mandi Road. He set up the place about a decade ago when he migrated from Burhanpur where his relatives are still in the khowa jalebi business.According to him the khowa jalebis of Burhanpur stand out due to the richness of extra khoya providing the taste. The jalebi is prepared in a huge kadhai right next to the shop. It is interesting to see the colour gradually turn into brown as it is gradually fried, and a garland of jalebis being transferred from the oil to sugar syrup.Business is brisk throughout the day. People from all over the city flock to the shop and large orders are delivered regularly for various functions.The jalebis are priced at Rs 300 for a kilo. The customers seem to love the taste of the jalebis, and the sweets get sold in no time.As Mohammed, son of Dawood says about their product, Dekh ne me kaala, lekin bada dilwala  the jalebis may look black in colour but the taste touches the heart.

He quit the job of a police officer, became an MP and now as a Union minister he aims to work for the entire country with renewed energy.""Singh's first posting was as assistant superintendent of police of Nasik. He then went on to become the superintendent of police of Buldhana.Prior to being appointed the Mumbai Police chief, Singh was Maharashtra's additional director general of police. He has also served as the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) in Mumbai.He has also been on deputation to the CBI and received a special service medal for extraordinary work in Naxalite areas of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. He received the President's Police Medal for distinguished service in 2004, the President's Police Medal for meritorious service in 1996 and the DG's Insignia in the same year.During his tenure in Mumbai, he is credited with breaking the backbone of organised crime syndicates that terrorised Mumbai in the 1990s, including the Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel and Arun Gawli gangs.During the same time in the late '90s, when gangsters were active in Mumbai and the mafia in Mumbai went berserk with several high-profile killings, Singh formed special police squads and cracked down on several underworld figures.That tenure saw several encounter killings in Mumbai with specialists such as Daya Nayak, Pradeep Sharma and Vijay Salaskar given the licence to take on the underworld. It was during this stint that the 25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings at Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar took place.As Police Commissioner of Nagpur, he began an outreach programme called 'Mission Mrityunjay'. This was an anti-terror initiative that aimed to enlist college students in the fight against terrorism whereby students recommended by college authorities assisted the police in intelligence gathering and reported suspicious and anti-social activities on campus and in the city.Identical programmes were launched in Pune as well as Mumbai during his tenure as the police chief of respective cities.As Nagpur police chief, Singh had also busted the 'matka' gangs there, unearthing a local politician's links to the high-profile racket.His tenure as Pune Police Commissioner was witness to the 2010 Pune bombing which occurred at the German Bakery that killed 17 people and injured at least 60 more.In June 2011, weeks after being appointed chairman of a special investigation team constituted by the Gujarat High Court to probe the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, Singh was replaced after requesting the court to relieve him after he cited differences of opinion between two other SIT members.On 23 August 2012, Singh was appointed as the Police Commissioner of Mumbai after his predecessor Arup Patnaik faced flak and was eventually shunted out for his handling of the Azad Maidan riots that occurred on August 11 in the city.Several policemen were injured in that melee.On 31 January, 2014 Singh tendered his resignation and applied for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and sought to be relieved as soon as possible from his post so he could contest the Lok Sabha elections.He was then quoted as saying, ""My inner voice is telling me that it's time to change profession. As a police officer, I have worked for the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra for many years, but now it's time to work for the entire country with a renewed energy.""Born in Basauli village in Meerut district on November 29, 1955, he is a BJP MP from Baghpat in western UP.He was pitted against Rashtriya Lok Dal supremo Ajit Singh from Baghpat where he won with a thumping margin of 2,09,866 votes, defeating Samajwadi Party's Ghulam Mohammed and pushing Ajit Singh to the third spot with only 1,99,516 votes.In Parliament, Singh has been vocal about farmers issues, advocating the need to involve the farming community actively in drafting of the Union Budget. He has also been raising the problems faced by sugarcane farmers in western UP who are debt-ridden in the face of non repayment of their heightening dues by sugar mills. He has actively been campaigning for Government regulation of sugar prices.Singh is also a vocal proponent of holistic health, yoga and vegetarianism.He has a keen interest in vedic studies and regularly delivers lectures on spirituality, religious extremism and corruption."

Of the registered 530 units across all seven taluks, at least 65% are facing acute shortage of sugarcane and over 50% have become non-functional in recent weeks, officials at the District Industries Centre and Department of Agriculture said.The arrival of jaggery declined by around 50% in the last few days, said D.R. Pushpa, secretary, Mandya APMC. Speaking to The Hindu on Saturday, she said: The APMC used to get around 30 loads [around 2,400-2,600 quintals] of jaggery every day. But, the arrivals have been hovering between 1,200 and 1,300 quintals a day in recent days.Currently, the prices are quoted at Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 4,050 a quintal at the APMC in Mandya, Ms. Pushpa said.The trend is mainly attributed to lower acreage of sugarcane and farmers switching over to less water-intensive crops as Mandya district is witnessing severe drought for the sixth consecutive year.A target of cultivating sugarcane on 24,829 hectares was set for the current season. However, just 3,100 hectares have been covered till Saturday, said sources in the Agriculture Department.The district has five sugarmills. While first grade of the produce is supplied to mills, the remaining cane is procured by the aalemanes.While a small unit can produce around 2 quintals of jaggery a day, big units can produce up to 35 quintals. There is a greater demand in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for bucket-shape, box-shape and cube-shape jaggery that is produced in Mandya.APMC used to get 2,400 to 2,600 quintals of jaggery every day.

He received the President's Police Medal for distinguished service in 2004, the President's Police Medal for meritorious service in 1996 and the DG's Insignia in the same year.During his tenure in Mumbai, he is credited with breaking the backbone of organised crime syndicates that terrorised Mumbai in the 1990s, including the Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel and Arun Gawli gangs.During the same time in the late '90s, when gangsters were active in Mumbai and the mafia in Mumbai went berserk with several high-profile killings, Singh formed special police squads and cracked down on several underworld figures.That tenure saw several encounter killings in Mumbai with specialists such as Daya Nayak, Pradeep Sharma and Vijay Salaskar given the licence to take on the underworld. It was during this stint that the 25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings at Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar took place.As Police Commissioner of Nagpur, he began an outreach programme called 'Mission Mrityunjay'. This was an anti-terror initiative that aimed to enlist college students in the fight against terrorism whereby students recommended by college authorities assisted the police in intelligence gathering and reported suspicious and anti-social activities on campus and in the city.Identical programmes were launched in Pune as well as Mumbai during his tenure as the police chief of respective cities.As Nagpur police chief, Singh had also busted the 'matka' gangs there, unearthing a local politician's links to the high-profile racket.His tenure as Pune Police Commissioner was witness to the 2010 Pune bombing which occurred at the German Bakery that killed 17 people and injured at least 60 more.In June 2011, weeks after being appointed chairman of a special investigation team constituted by the Gujarat High Court to probe the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, Singh was replaced after requesting the court to relieve him after he cited differences of opinion between two other SIT members.On 23 August 2012, Singh was appointed as the Police Commissioner of Mumbai after his predecessor Arup Patnaik faced flak and was eventually shunted out for his handling of the Azad Maidan riots that occurred on August 11 in the city. Several policemen were injured in that melee.On 31 January, 2014 Singh tendered his resignation and applied for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and sought to be relieved as soon as possible from his post so he could contest the Lok Sabha elections.He was then quoted as saying, ""My inner voice is telling me that it's time to change profession. As a police officer, I have worked for the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra for many years, but now it's time to work for the entire country with a renewed energy.""Born in Basauli village in Meerut district on November 29, 1955, he is a BJP MP from Baghpat in western UP.He was pitted against Rashtriya Lok Dal supremo Ajit Singh from Baghpat where he won with a thumping margin of 2,09,866 votes, defeating Samajwadi Party's Ghulam Mohammed and pushing Ajit Singh to the third spot with only 1,99,516 votes.In Parliament, Singh has been vocal about farmers' issues, advocating the need to involve the farming community actively in drafting of the Union Budget. He has also been raising the problems faced by sugarcane farmers in western UP who are debt-ridden in the face of non repayment of their heightening dues by sugar mills. He has actively been campaigning for Government regulation of sugar prices.Singh is also a vocal proponent of holistic health, yoga and vegetarianism.He has a keen interest in vedic studies and regularly delivers lectures on spirituality, religious extremism and corruption."
5a10d5f99855b76bf13da326,Proposed housing regulator to be on par with judicial forums,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/proposed-housing-regulator-to-be-on-par-with-judicial-forums/articleshow/60369917.cms,2017-09-05,"MUMBAI: While proposing creation of a housing authority to oversee affairs of cooperative societies , a state-appointed expert committee has recommended that the body be given quasijudicial powers and its decisions be regarded as equivalent to those by a civil or cooperative court. Legal experts have slammed the proposal saying society members should be allowed to approach courts as the authority heads may not have the requisite legal knowledge to handle such matters.The committee has further proposed that a three-quarters majority at an annual general body meeting is all that is required for a society's members to decide on redeveloping a building--even if the structure is not in a dilapidated condition or has been declared unsafe to live in. The state-level authority would also deal with issues ranging from society elections to allotting parking spaces.These are some of the major recommendations that the committee has listed in its report which it recently tabled before the state cooperative department. The panel has suggested amending the Maharashtra Cooperative Society Act 1960 to widen its scope to deal with housingrelated issues with the setting up of an independent authority .The state has around 95,000 housing societies, of which 25,000-odd are located in Mumbai and its suburbs.As of now, the Act is applicable to sugarcane and cotton industries, milk cooperative societies, cooperative banks and cooperative credit and housing societies. Currently , housing society issues are handled by the registrar's office, though. The panel has suggested that Authority of Housing Societies be formed to redress grievances of housing societies so that members don't need to move cooperative or civic courts.Reacting to the proposal, Vinod Sampat, lawyer and president of Cooperative Society Residents Association, said, ""The intention to create a housing authority is good but it requires a lot of study and research, proper infrastructure and budget.Certain powers like allotting parking space to members should not be vested with the authority. A quasi-judicial authority can decide on issues to a certain extent, but its members don't have the knowledge of law. As far as legality is concerned, they might face a lot of limitations."" Sampat said people should have the right to move court.Neha Nagothanekar, another lawyer who handles cooperative society matters, said she fears that corrupt practices may rise if the authority is not headed by a person with a legal background. ""If the government has decided to create a housing authority for cooperative societies, it should be headed by a person with judicial knowledge and not a political personality, as this would lead to a rise in corruption,"" she said.""The reason why cases are pending in cooperative courts is non-judicial staff,"" said Nagothanekar. Every year, around 6,000 cases are filed in various cooperative courts in Mumbai.The committee report sug gested that in its general body meeting, a society would allot parking spaces to its members on the basis of their flats in keeping with Development Control Regulations (DCR). If a society fails to allot parking spaces, the registrar would exercise powers vested with him. In case of dispute, the matter would be referred to the housing authority , which would take a decision after hearing concerned parties.Instead of conducting society elections under an elected officer of the registrar as is the current practice, the committee has suggested that polls be held at the society level during annual general body meetings.The report has omitted the mandatory condition of appointing scheduled caste and tribe committee members, citing non-availability of reserved ca ndidates in some societies. However, another condition has been added--mandatory appointment of a woman candidate.Following vociferous demands, the requirement of a minimum of 11members for a society's registration has been reduced to five. In other words, even five members could form a society and conduct committee elections--provided the amendment is passed by the legislature.BJP MLA Ashish Shelar raised the issue in the legislative assembly last December and demanded a separate authority to deal with housing society affairs. Shelar said, ""Instead of a three-forth majority , 51% of total members with voting rights must decide a building's redevelopment. I will suggest the necessary changes when the report is discussed in the legislature."""

Highly placed ED investigators said repeated e-mails to the foreign company had bounced.A letter sent to the firms office in Bulgaria has returned stating that no such address existed. No one has so far represented the firm before the agencys adjudicators though the Bulgarian Embassy had requested the immediate return of money that had been seized under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.Investigators said the fraud unearthed so far was only the tip of the ice berg. The suspicious transaction could be part of an international professional money laundering operation to help the Bulgarian mafia clean the proceeds from the narcotic trade, illegal sale of stolen antiques and human trafficking.It could also be an attempt by some Gulf-based hawala syndicate to reroute corrupt takings as legitimate business earnings to Kerala.Account holderThe account holder, a 67-year-old resident of Kochi, is the only person named as a suspect in the case so far. His case was that the cash was for the export of sunflower oil and sugar to Bulgaria. He also submitted records showing that the shipment had left the Mumbai port for that country.Fabricated recordsHowever, the ED found last week that the records were fabricated and no such shipment had left Mumbai. The Harbour police in Kochi has registered a case of forgery and cheating against the suspect. Investigators said that the accused had registered several paper companies in Mumbai, Jaipur and Coimbatore.However, his only known business activity in the past 15 years was the export of Rs. 1.5 lakh worth of sunflower oil to a foreign country in 2014. The ED has told the court that the suspect was not cooperating with its probe. He had travelled to Dubai despite pleading ill health to appear before the agency. The agency has sought the cancellation of his anticipatory bail."

For, the elephant had been feeding on sugary prasad from temples and 200 vada pavs a day, and had become obese at 5000 kgs, she was overweight by 1800 kgs. Laxmi's companion elephant, suffering from similar health issues due to severe neglect, had collapsed and died in front of her eyes.Today, she not only walks gleefully, but also plays in a pool and wallows in the mud as she has shed 700 kgs during her stay at Mathura 's Elephant Conservation and Care Center (ECCC) run by wildlife conservation charity Wildlife SOS . She was put on a calibrated diet of green fodder and nutritious vegetables. The abscesses in her feet have now healed and Vitamin D3 supplements keep her arthritis in check.""For a young elephant of 18 years, being 1,800-kg overweight could have severely impacted her ability to live,"" said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of the conservation charity. Elephants life for 40 to 65 years.""She had those mental scars (the companion's death),"" said Satyanarayan. ""She was severely traumatised and frightened of other elephants too."" After four years of love and medical care, she has transformed into a gregarious and playful elephant. She is particularly fond of the bulls, and squeals with excitement whenever she smells or sights one of them while out on her walks. ""She is the only one who squeals in this typical happy tone,"" says Satyanarayan. She enjoys two walks every day with her friends-Bijli and Chanchal.But Satyanarayan and Laxmi cannot rest easy yet. ""We are still caught in a court battle to retain her custody as her previous 'illegal' owner and abuser still claims ownership and keeps filing cases in different courts,"" he said. ""The legal battle is taking up a lot of our resources but we are committed to Laxmi and will not let her down."" Laxmi was poached as a calf from her wild herd and initially trained to work at a circus. Later, the female elephant was used for begging outside temples in Mulund.Wildlife SOS is providing critical medical treatment and care to 24 elephants rescued from circuses, street begging and manual labour. While 21 of them enjoy the comforts of the care centre in Mathura, three are housed at a similar facility in Haryana. ""Every elephant you see in captivity is stolen from its mother at a very young age; once in captivity, it is tied up and beaten for months to break its spirit. Later, sophisticated pain inflicting tools are used to make it submissive and obedient,"" he said while speaking at an awareness event about the plight of elephants in the country hosted by the Royal Western Indian Turf Club (RWITC) at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Friday.The club along with the horse owners' association presented a cheque of Rs5 lakh for the care of these elephants.

5a12f6d99855b76bf13e2297,How India became the world leader in Trump projects,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-india-became-the-world-leader-in-trump-projects/articleshow/60505734.cms,2017-09-14,"75-story Trump skyscraper +Modi hugs Trump at the White House in Washington +In western India, a pair of shiny black Trump buildings with gold insignia tower over the city of Pune. In nearby Mumbai, awill be one of the tallest in the megacity. In a swanky suburb of Delhi, two Trump partners have big plans. And in Kolkata, a new Trump tower is under way.Three years after Donald Trump arrived on his private jet for a deal-making tour, India has become the only major developing country where his business is roaring. It has the most construction projects with Trump licensing deals of any country outside of the U.S.After his election, Trump abandoned a number of international projects and promised not to engage in new foreign deals that could trigger conflicts of interest. With the Indian deals struck earlier, his company is barreling ahead. While in office, Trump has been building a strong bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi  as his company builds ties with some partners who have faced legal troubles., on June 26.Modi was one of the first to visit Trump after he took office and invited daughter Ivanka to lead a delegation to a business summit in November. All of this has raised fresh questions about whether Trump Organization's deals with politically-connected foreign tycoons could put his interests ahead of the nation's and entail special treatment by foreign authorities.India is a key US ally in Asia and its rivalry with both Pakistan and China fosters many areas where Trump and Modi need each othernuclear weapons, anti-terrorism, Afghanistan and trade, among others. So far, Trump doesn't seem to have spared India in policies ranging from visas for technology workers to the Paris climate accord. Still, the risk that he might let his business interests outweigh national needsor that Modi might cut him a break on taxes or permits in exchange for policy tweaksremains a big concern for government ethics experts in the US. A spokesman for Modi did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Asked about potential conflicts in India, the Trump Organization said it's ""very proud of the success we have achieved in that market with five active properties under various stages of development."" The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization.Trump's Indian partners Atul and Sagar Chordia celebrated the U.S. victory by flying immediately to New York to congratulate the president-elect, increasing congressional calls for Trump to divest his businesses. He opted instead to hold onto his assets and hand management to his two older sons.Whatever concerns have been raised in the U.S. regarding the blending of business and policy, Trump's election seems only to have increased the value of his brand in India, though some voices in the Indian press have begun to question the effects of politics and well-publicized conflicts of interests on his brand. Here, political ties have long been the fastest route to get approvals for big projects. Only Afghanistan is more burdensome when it comes to dealing with construction permits, according to a ranking of 186 nations in the World Bank's 2017 Doing Business report.In fact, the link between construction and politics is so tight in India that research by political scientists Milan Vaishnav and Devesh Kapur shows that cement consumption declines in the lead-up to state assembly elections because firms redirect cash from construction to campaigns.""No one in India would think twice about him being engaged in politics on the one hand and real estate on the other,"" said Vaishnav, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It's an open secret that to be successful in Indian real estate, you have to be well connected in politics.""In a more surreal display of Trump's allure in India, a small village, encouraged by a charity group, renamed itself Trump Village and put up a Trump billboard to help get much-needed toilets. A local commissioner lashed out at the stunt and ordered the billboard removed. Bindeshwar Pathak, an activist who led the effort, expects the name will stick, however: ""You can now say 'I want to go to Trump Village' and people will tell you how.""One question facing Modi is to what extent his changes in real estate policy could impact the bottom line of Trump Organization or its partners. Last year, he ended a tax loophole often used by the rich to buy property in someone else's name.In his high-profile visit to Mumbai in August 2014, Trump praised Modi for winning the country's first single-party parliamentary majority in 30 years.""India is a great place to invest, especially after the elections,"" Trump told reporters. He held a banquet attended by 500 of Pune's rich and powerful, in which TV cameramen pushed for position while a Bollywood star interviewed the American tycoon.Trump spoke about his global ambitions to build towers in China and South America. As it happens, those projects have largely failed to materialize. His group scrapped deals in Brazil last year after being cited in a local corruption probe, in which the group hasn't been charged with any crimes, and several projects in China and Russia have floundered.Not so in Modi's India, where an extended economic boom and the political influence of Trump's allies have helped his business flourish.In Pune on a recent afternoon, men in military uniform guarded the entrance of the Trump towers as auto rickshaws buzzed about on the street outside. The twin 23-story buildings stand out in the city's unremarkable skyline. They were erected by Panchshil, the real estate business of the Chordia family. Patriarch Ishwardas Chordia, who hailed from a family of sugar traders, was college buddies with a powerful political broker, Sharad Pawar, whom Modi has lauded for his guidance in his early days in politics, and whose family members have shared business interests with the Chordias.When Chairman Atul Chordia, his brother and an associate visited Trump days after the election, Trump praised Modi. The Chordias had been negotiating a second deal, which Trump scrapped along with other projects days before his inauguration. Chordia declined to comment.In nearby Mumbai, Abhishek Lodha is trying to secure approvals for the last few floors of the Trump Tower Mumbai. The managing director of Lodha Group said in an interview at the firm's office that he negotiated the tower deal over six months prior to Trump's election, which included a visit to Trump Tower in New York for meetings with Donald Jr. and Ivanka. Once in Mumbai, Trump the elder made a few tweaks to the project: bigger kitchens, air-conditioning in the lobbies and kitchens, and he picked out the facade design.Lodha is no political novice. His father is the deputy boss in Maharashtra state for Modi's Bharatiya Janata party. After the government revised rules to allow transfer of development rights to the city of Mumbai in November, Lodha was the first to take advantage and surrendered some mill land. The group gained rights to more floor space in the city but hasn't said how it will use it.Almost 900 miles to the north in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, Pankaj Bansal is one of two Trump partners in a city where a Dubai-style boom of sky-rises emerged almost overnight out of farmland. Bansal, who traveled with Modi in business delegations to Russia and Japan, agreed to meet at M3M's Golf Estate, though declined to comment on his Trump tie-up.The entrance to the resort is flanked by shanties of workers. Bansal collects cars and likes to sky dive, and his company sells dreams to those fancying themselves as ""the gentry""a promotional video by his Polo Suites project offers a chance to ""breathe the air of nobility, and live your life king-sized, to walk like gods amongst men.""Gurgaon's market is tough at the moment, but Bansal said he expects the family-run company to weather India's economic slowdown by delivering on projects as competitors face crises. Two managing directors of Unitech Limited, for example, are fighting allegations that they duped customers after they were arrested in April over a delayed project. Unitech, which is not a Trump partner, did not respond to requests for comment.""People who are delivering are doing okay,"" said Bansal. ""People who aren't are bleeding blood.""The nameM3Mtells something about the company's self-image. It stands for Magnificence in the Trinity of Men, Materials and Money. The group has been facing some legal troubles of its own. It has denied allegations in a police report in March that an executive bribed forestry officials to clear 2,200 trees at a development site. The company says the allegations are completely false.The company was entangled for years in a tax investigation into the suspected use of fronts in land purchases, a practice which is banned in India. M3M's chairman offered to pay millions in advance tax when investigators raided group offices and seized funds and valuables in 2007, though court documents show the funds were later recouped after no incriminating evidence was found. The company said an appeal by the income tax department was dismissed in its favor in 2015.Trump's other partner in Gurgaon, IREO, also had its offices searched by tax investigation in 2010. The group said in an emailed response that it complied with tax authorities and provided all of its relevant shareholding details. No charges were filed. The executive who announced the Trump deal for the private equity real estate firm is the brother-in-law of Sudhanshu Mittal, a ruling party leader, though the company said he is not associated in any ownership or management capacity.Harsh Patodia, chairman for Unimark Group, who has an arrangement with the Trump Organization in Kolkata, declined to comment by phone. Tribeca Developers, whose founder Kalpesh Mehta is a Trump representative in India who visited Trump Tower in November with the Chordias, also declined requests for comment.During his 2014 visit, Trump knew how to flatter his audience.""I don't consider this an emerging market, I consider this an amazing market,"" he said in an interview with NDTV, citing real estate prices that are cheap by his standards, though out of reach for most Indians. ""India was very divisive at one point and people were afraid to invest and I think people have great confidence in the new prime minister.""Trump's courting of India is already paying off: his personal financial disclosures, which released details of his income in ranges, show India deals bringing in between $1.6 million and $11 million in royalties since 2014."

We might consider orange juice a healthier option but 100 ml of it contains 9 gms of natural sugar. He explains, 100 ml of an aerated drink contains 10 gms of sugar. So, it is more healthy to have the fruit. You feel full after having one. For a glass of juice, they add about four oranges, increasing its sugar content.It is important to know the amount of nutrients you are consuming. Veer says Indians tend to have an unhealthy diet. Indian foods are heavy on carbohydrates and fat as there are rotis, rice and curries are made with lot of oil and butter. And, once you try them, you get addicted and it is difficult to get out of them. He says 35 per cent of his subscribers are from India. People from Mumbai and Delhi are more fitness conscious than Bengaluru, he adds.Todays youngsters want to look good and Bollywood impresses an image of that perfect body. They go to a gym but dont realise that gymming is just 20 per cent of the equation. The rest 80 per cent is food, he says adding people think it is important to consume proteins for developing muscles. It is true. They eat chicken but the meat contains fat too. Hence, it is important to eat in right amount, he adds.Veer founded The Food Analysts four months ago and has more than 60,000 subscribers from USA, UK, Middle East and India, India being the biggest market.He says, I used to spend a lot for a trainer and gym. But, I wasnt satisfied with the results. He downloaded a fitness app that tracks intake of food. I had to break down the food into its different nutrients and upload pictures and data on the app. I thought why not have someone else to do it for me, he adds. People usually click food pictures to post on Instagram, Facebook. With TFA, they can post the pictures on a WhatsApp group and get a report on the nutrients in their diet.I didnt want to inconvenience users, with downloading an app and then uploading pictures. Instead, I decided to have it on WhatsApp so they can chat like friends, he says.How the platform worksSign up on the platform, giving basic details such as weight, height, food habits and exercise routine. You can choose a monthly package or a yearly one. A registration fee of `400 per month for a year is charged. Once you register, you can start chatting with the nutritionists on WhatsApp. You can send the pictures of your food and get a report on the nutrients you have consumed. The nutritionists can also suggest a change in diet, if required and suggest the foods you should consume.How accurate is this platform?Veer Ramlugon, founder of The Food Analysts claims that they have a database of five million food items that have been tested in labs for its nutrients.

In the month of August alone, the state saw 260 farmer suicides.The farm loan waiver was announced on June 2, but the benefits are expected to roll out only by late October. The government has extended the last date of online applications for the waiver by a week to September 22.Overall, Maharashtra has seen 1,881 farmer suicides in the eight months between January and August. This is a slight decline from the 2,062 cases recorded in the same period last year.In two crucial regions however, farmer suicide figures are higher than last year. The sugar belt of Western Maharashtra has recorded 70 farmer suicides till the end of August. The figure stood at 54 during the same period last year. The vulnerable districts of Amravati in the cotton-growing belt of Vidarbha have recorded 691 cases till the end of August compared to 688 cases in the same period in 2016.The Vidarbha region is once again experiencing distress on account of the long dry spell in the region. In Nagpur division's major dams, the water level is 35% compared to 58% last year. In Amravati division, it is 26% compared to 65.8% last year.Overall, farmer suicides continue to be highest in Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The region reported 854 farmer suicides till August-end compared to 931 during the same period last year.""The long dry spell has hit Vidarbha the worst. Entire fields of soya bean are drying up. This may wipe out the benefit of the loan waivers,"" said farmer activist Vijay Jawandhia. The preliminary assessment of farm output by the agriculture department last week shows a dip in the production mainly of cereals and pulses and sugarcane in the state's kharif crop. The area under cultivation has dipped by 1 lakh hectares.'Even small nullahs in Vid-arbha are drying up. At this rate, even the rabi crop could be hit,"" said Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik She-tkari Swavalamban Mission, the state task force on agriculture. Marathwada has reported 628 farmer suicides compared to 745 till the end of August 2016. North Maharashtra, the epicentre of the farmer agitation which led to the announcement of the waiver, reported 325 farmer suicides compared to 332 cases last year. The Konkan region has reported only four farmer suicides this year."

Consider this: a staggering 273 dams have been built in the Upper Bhima basin across the state and 90% of canal water diverted from such dams is used to irrigate sugarcane. Agri expert Nishikant Bhalerao says the reason for such disproportionate distribution is, ""Politicians wanted to ensure sugarcane growers don't face water shortage.""Sugar mills became the lynchpin of the state's rural economy and its politics over the decades. ""Every MLA wants a sugar mill...we help them as we have to keep them (happy) with us. But today , we are suffering because of this policy ,"" said Sharad Pawar recently . Most of Pawar's satraps own two or three sugar mills.In the last decade and a half, Maharashtra's share in sugarcane output rose from 15.6% to 21.9% while Uttar Pradesh's marginally declined. UP tops in sugarcane production in the country (38.7%) followed by Maharashtra (21.9%).In the Upper Bhima basin, 19% of the cultivated area--more than six lakh hectare--is under sugarcane. In 2016, amid acute water shortage when Sec 144 was imposed to protect water sources in Marathwada, sugar mills continued to receive copious quantities for the cane-crushing season.Sugarcane tracts in western Maharash tra thrive on a combination of flood irrigation and high doses of fertilizers. Water treated with chemicals remains stagnant in fields, but this process has degraded more than six lakh hectares of land, turning them saline, according to a recent study. Salinity is multiplying annually by 10% in the sugarcane belt.The paper on `Severity of soil salinity and sodicity problems in Maharashtra and their reclamation' said salt concentration is high ""owing to injudicious management of canal irrigation water"" and this is expected to reduce land productivity .Expressing concern over excessive use of water for sugarcane, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has now directed agriculture officials to make cane growers take to drip irrigation."

Post-GST, it was abolished. Therefore, the government has now chosen another route in the form of area development tax on the farmers,"" Shetti told PTI today.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader said the tax is in violation of the government's promise that there would not be any additional taxes apart from the GST.""The area development tax is expected to garner around Rs 400 crore. Earlier, the sugarcane purchase tax was never used for any development purposes and I have no doubt that even the funds to be collected from the area development tax will be utilised somewhere else,"" he said.Shetti had recently snapped ties with the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra, accusing them of being anti-farmers.""The government is aware of the fact that prices of chemical fertilisers, pesticides, farm equipment and locally made tractor-trolleys used for sugarcane transport have gone up in the post-GST regime. The charges in the name of area development fund is nothing but adding insult to injury,"" Shetti said.The state government had accepted the Rangarajan Committee's recommendations for sugarcane sector, which had laid down revenue-sharing formula between farmers and sugar mills at 70:30, he said.""However, he state government has never implemented it. This is injustice to farmers that the recommendations which are aimed at increasing their income are deliberately ignored, while additional taxes are imposed,"" he alleged."

There are several sectors where the cooperative sector can help make a positive difference.""He asked cooperatives to assess how farmers' income can be doubled by 2022 through their movement. ""See what best practices to adopt and give up the old ones and move ahead,"" he said, while asserting that rural India should not be left behind in the growth path.Stating that farmers are facing many problems, Modi said there is a need to establish a system to ensure farmers buy and sell at wholesale rates. ""Today, farmers buy at retail rate and sell (their produce) at wholesale rates. Can it be reversed? If they buy (inputs) at wholesale rates and sell at retail price, then nobody can loot them, not even middlemen,"" he said.Farmers associated with dairy cooperatives have grown as they buy and sell milk at wholesale rates, Modi said adding that farmers would not have earned more had they sold their produce to private firms. There is a need to build such cooperatives to ensure better income to farmers, he added.Observing that cooperatives are mainly present in sugar and dairy sectors, the Prime Minister said the cooperative system suit to India and there is a need to foray into new areas. He also gave examples of sectors in which cooperatives can help farmers in raising additional income.For instance, he said, there is demand for neem oil for coating of urea fertiliser and woman farmers can collect the key basic ingredient required to make the oil. Another area is beekeeping, where farmers can bring 'Sweet Revolution' through cooperative movement. It is not only honey but there is a big market for beewax worldover, he said.Even in fishery sector, additional work can be provided to fishermen during off-season by encouraging them to go for seeweed farming. Modi said there is huge demand for seaweed in pharma industry and its juice can be used to boost soil health. ""Cooperatives can bring change in rural economy through small initiatives like this,"" he noted.The Prime Minister also asked cooperatives to self-reflect whether the ""cooperative spirit"" has got lost in its legal structure. It is important to keep the spirit intact, he added.Modi recalled his association with cooperative leader Inamdar saying that he was a person of inspiration and learnt many facets of his life after his death. Stating that Inamdar was an ""unknown"" figure but he contributed immensely to the nation through cooperatives, Modi said. ""The first success mantra of cooperative is that the leader works behind the scene taking everyone along.""Inamdar led cooperative movement and formed 'Sahakar Bharati' way back in 1979 in Mumbai, Maharashtra.The Prime Minister also released two books on Inamdar and other nine important leaders of cooperataive movement. He also gave mementos to seven cooperatives for excellent work.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and two Minister of States, Krishna Raj and Gajendra Singh Shekawat, were also present."

I have worked there so I will easily defeat anyone, Koth said.Khot and Shetti started out together in politics, especially farmer agitation, in Kolhapur district as part of the Shetkari Sanghatana started by the late farmer leader Saharad Joshi in the 1980s. In the late 1990s after differences arose over an agitation for better sugarcane and milk prices, they formed a separate organization.Initially they aligned with local Congress leaders but drifted away to join hands with the BJP just ahead of the 2014 elections. After Khot became a minister last year, differences between him and Shetti started surfacing."

(File photo | Reuters)NEW DELHI: India's rice output is likely to fall by 1.9 million tonnes (MT) to 94.48 MT in kharif season this year on account of poor rain as well as floods, official sources said.The production of pulses and coarse cereals is estimated to have fallen, dragging the overall foodgrains output in kharif (summer-sown) season to 134.67 MT from a record 138.52 MT in last kharif, as per sources.Kharif foodgrain basket comprises of rice, pulses and coarse cereals. Harvesting will start from next month. Barring sugarcane, the production of all major kharif crops is likely to decline.The Union Agriculture Ministry will release its first advance estimate on Monday.Rice ouptut is estimated to fall at 94.48 MT in the kharif season of the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the record 96.39 MT in last kharif, the official who did not wish to be named said. Pulses output could drop to 8.71 MT from the record 9.42 MT due to depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur and urad are pegged at 3.99 MT and 2.53 MT, respectively. Coarse cereals output is also seen lower at 31.49 MT against 32.71 MT in last kharif season.Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from 33.09 million bales.

Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22 MT.The fall in kharif output is attributed to dry spell as well as floods in some parts of the country. The overall southwest monsoon, crucial for rain-fed kharif crops, was projected normal, but till first week of this month it was less by five per cent.Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states.The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting."

The lyrics of the background song have been written by IAS officer from State, Shah Faesal. He was 2009 UPSC topper.The film shows how an old Kashmiri man, on the way to purchase sugar in the market, ends up taking a tourist couple to sightseeing as they mistake him to be their driver.

5a1739c39855b76bf13f011f,Reservation of Women should be above party politics,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/arise-awake-and-stop-not/reservation-of-women-should-be-above-party-politics/,2017-09-26,"Google Doodle honouring Indias first female scientist Asima Chatterjee, Sushma Swaraj the roaring lioness speaking on behest of India and on Indias foreign policy in UNGA, and Sonia Gandhi urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that the Womens Reservation Bill meets a logical conclusion.After decades of delay in the domain of women empowerment, 2017 has been a fast paced roller coaster ride, and the current government is keeping us on our toes in the hopes of seeing more rapid progress and development.If anybody delves into the history of India they would know that such slow progress was unwarranted and would find its roots deeply entrenched during the colonial period of British India. The British Empire didnt want the citizens of our nation rising to a respectable level. So our legal system barely budged as a matter of fact it retrograded, and our manner of living was purely medieval. Yet out of the prevalent evils of casteism, and female subjugation some women of our nation became leading pioneers and are globally acclaimed. Here, we name a few:1. Asima Chatterjee, a renowned Indian chemists 100th birthday was marked by Google with a Doodle on the 23rd of September. An organic chemist, Asima Chatterjee paved the way for Indian women in science and improved the odds of survival for patients with cancer, epilepsy, and malaria.2. A pioneering botanist and cytogeneticist, Janaki Ammal, born 1897, is credited with putting sweetness in Indias sugarcane varieties. There is even a flower named after her, a delicate bloom in pure white called Magnolia Kobus Janaki Ammal, only a few nurseries in Europe cultivate the variety.3. Born in 1865 in an extremely orthodox Brahmin family in Maharashtra, a 9 year old girl got married to a widower who was almost thrice her age. The girl later on became the first Indian woman to qualify as a doctor. Her name was Anandibai and her husbands name was Gopalrao Joshi. Gopalrao, was determined to educate his wife when she expressed her wish to study medicine at the age of 14. Unfortunately, before she couldnt practice medicine as she left her heavenly abode at the age of 22.4. Dr Rukhmabai has the honour of being the first practicing lady doctor of India. Her journey was not an easy one, she was married at the age of 11, child bride Rukhmabai Bhikaji contested her husbands claim to conjugal rights in an iconic court case that led to the passage of the Age of Consent Act in 1891. In 1888 despite the out-of-court settlement, this case became a landmark in colonial India for raising issues of age, consent and choice for women in marriage. Rukhmabai was ostracized by society, but she didnt let this affect her ambition of being a doctor. She finished her studies and obtained a position as Chief Medical Officer in Surat. She never married again and remained active in social reform till her death in 1955 at the age of 91.Though Dr. Rukhmabais case might have played a pivotal role in the Age of Consent Act, the age limit was only increased from 10 years to 12 years. India is still fighting the confusing interloped situation of child marriage and the Age of Consent, where logic dictates justice albeit practice otherwise. In the fight for proper judicial and legislative rights of women, Sonia Gandhi wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 20 September, 2017, urging him to take advantage of the majority BJP members in Lok Sabha to pass the Womens Reservation Bill. The womens Reservation Bill plans for 33% reservation of women in the Lok Sabha and all state legislative assemblies, yet Panchayati Raj and Civil Bodies already have this reservation for women. If passed, India can be acknowledged as a leading global figure in political and participation equality of women. It can help surpass the few number of women that we hold dear as leading figures or pioneers who work so hard to break the glass ceiling, and provide the nation with many more women defying the patriarchal assigned roles.Currently the global average for Women in Parliament is 22.4%, India stands at a meager 12%. On a global scale we rank 103rd from a list of 140 countries, and in Asia we rank 13th out of 18 countries. Its about time that we quit hiding behind the curtain that India is one of the youngest nations in the world. After 70 years of Independence, a rapidly growing nation, and the vision of our founding fathers its time to take action and not hide behind a veil of excuses.As shown by the stories of the pioneering scientist women of India reservation is not a necessity, but it is a good set up. The women scientist pioneers of India were fortunate to have husbands, or fathers support them at a time when women were prone to child marriage and pushed to bear children. The manner in which they broke the chains of society was with the help of the chain makers of society, the men in their lives. Its time for us all to stand up and give our women a helping hand, in the form of a mother, father, sister, and brother."

A majority of people in the country consume green leafy vegetables, milk and milk products, sugar and jaggery and other nutritious foods in quantities lower than recommended daily allowance ( RDA ).This has been telling on the general health of people in India, leading to non-communicable or lifestyle diseases. One in every three people in urban areas suffers from high blood pressure while one in four complains of high blood sugar levels. One in three men consumes alcohol and one in seven smokes. Coronary heart diseases occur in Indians 10 to 20 years earlier than people in West.Only half of 1-3 year old children (56%), two-third (68%) of 4-6 year old children and half of pregnant women (56%) in India consume adequate amounts of both protein and calories. Even though the prevalence of underweight (25%), stunting (29%) and wasting (16%) among under five is lower than rural and tribal children.The city-based National In stitute of Nutrition (NIN) has compiled a database on diet and nutritional status of urban population. . It is based on a research study lead by Dr Avula Laxmaiah, head of the Division of Community Studies.Various ICMR and non-ICMR institutes participated .The report said the prevalence of stunting is the highest in Uttar Pradesh (40.8%), followed by Maharashtra (36.4%), New Delhi (35.7%) and West Bengal (34.4%) and lowest in Puducherry (11.6%).The prevalence of hypertension among urban men and women is 31% and 26%, respectively.

5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."

According to the first advance estimate released today by the agriculture ministry, the production of all kharif crops - rice, pulses and coarse cereals - is projected to decline from the record 138.52mt last kharif. Harvesting will start from next month. According to the latest data, rice output is likely to fall by 1.9mt to 94.48mt this year from the record 96.39mt in the previous kharif. Pulse output could drop to 8.71mt from the record 9.42mt because of depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur is estimated to be lower at 3.99mt from 4.78mt, while urad output may rise to 2.53mt from 2.17mt in the last kharif season. Coarse cereal output is also seen lower at 31.49mt, against 32.71mt in the gone-by kharif season. Maize output is pegged at 18.73mt against 19.24mt a year ago. Oilseed output is estimated to be down at 20.68mt compared with 22.40mt in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22mt against 13.79mt last kharif. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the earlier 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69mt, from 306.72mt before. Production of jute and mesta is estimated to decline to 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) from 10.60 million bales last year. The overall monsoon was projected normal, but till the first week of this month, it was less by 5 per cent. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced a dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states. The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting. Sugar production The government is expecting about 24 per cent increase in the country's total sugar output to around 25 million tonnes in the marketing year beginning next month on likely higher output in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra following good rains, an official source said. This is an initial projection based on the inputs of the state governments. The estimate, however, is in line with the industry body ISMA's projection. The country's sugar output in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) is estimated to be lower at 20.2 million tonnes because of poor rains. India is the world's second biggest sugar producer. In a meeting with state cane commissioners called by the Union Food Ministry, official sources said state governments have submitted the sugar production figures after assessing the likely sugarcane output and recovery level. Based on their inputs, the country's overall sugar output is expected to be around 25 million tonnes in 2017-18 marketing year, the sources said."

And in terms of diabetes, they rank third in the country. A whopping 36.2 per cent of men and 28.2 per cent of women in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana suffer from high blood pressure. As far as diabetes is concerned, AP and Telangana together have 22.7 per cent of men and 8.6 per cent of women, who reported high blood sugar levels. The city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), which entered its 100th year on Tuesday, has released updated data with regard to nutrition and non-communicable diseases among urban men and women in the country. According to the report, the overall prevalence of hypertension among men and women is 38.5 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Among men the prevalence is high in Kerala 46.6 per cent), followed by Assam (45.8 per cent) and Maharashtra (43 per cent). Among women it is high in Kerala (38 per cent), followed by Assam (36 per cent). Andaman and Nicobar islands has the lowest hypertension rate.The NIN data, which is based on a comprehensive survey, revealed that two-thirds of the urban men (63 per cent) work for more than eight hours a day while three fourth of women (72 per cent) work for less than eight hours. Most of them do office work in the sitting posture. More than a fourth of urban men (28 per cent) do physical exercise walking (21 per cent) and yoga (four per cent), 15 per cent women participate in exercise. Only a minuscule number of people exercise daily.Faulty nutrition coupled with physical inactivity is leading to non-communicable diseases. The prevalence of diabetes is the highest in the age group 60 to 70 years."

On Thursday, the lab announced that while half of them had low levels of the good cholesterol or HDL, two in every five had high levels of bad cholesterol of LDL.In Chennai, more than 8% of the people have very high levels of cholesterol and at least two out 10 are on the borderline. What was more worrying was that nearly one in ten has either high or very high levels of the bad cholesterol.Metropolis Healthcare head Dr Kirti Chadha said lifestyle, lack of exercise, junk food, increased stress level and smoking has pushed up risk of heart diseases.Most senior doctors say they aren't surprised by the numbers. ""High levels of cholesterol have been one of the leading causes of heart diseases in the country,"" said diabetologist Dr RM Anjana. ""Nevertheless, the numbers will be far higher in epidemiological studies compared to data from labs, where many people could be on medications,"" she said.Meanwhile, another survey by Suffola life 2017, which aimed to understand the barriers to heart health, among 1,306 respondents across Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata found long working hours, work stress, lack of sleep and long travel were key reasons.In Chennai, 85% of people said temptation for food comes in their way of putting efforts towards having a healthy heart. Studies have also shown that most people in the city eat high amount of carbohydrates such as rice and sugar and low levels of protein-rich food. While 80% also complained that long working hours and work stress prevent them from making efforts towards healthy practices such as exercise, 72% of them blamed it on distraction from phones and tablets.But more than 6 out of 10 people pointed out that the city does not have adequate space walking or exercising. Mumbai-based endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi said while there is a rising awareness about heart health, compliance and action is a big area of concern in India.Studies have shown that active lifestyle, which includes daily chores at home like cleaning, moping and gardening can reduce the risk of heart diseases and death."

A scene from Pune filmmaker Manouj Kadaamhs Kshitij.Sometimes, a simple story told beautifully can have an impact beyond imagination, and Pune filmmaker Manouj Kadaamhs Kshitij is one such tale. Kshitij, a story of a 12-year-old girls struggle to continue her education in the face of severe adversity, has made it to the Cape Town International Film Festival to be held from October 12 to 21 at Cape Town.The film revolves around a girl Vacchi, who comes from a poor family. Financial struggles pushes the family to leave their village and go to a neighbouring town to do back-breaking labour in sugarcane fields. Despite the challenging situation and days filled with hard toil, Vacchi quietly finds time to study, much to the irritation of her father, a simple farmer who has very little sympathy or understanding for her aspiration.Vacchi faces all these obstacles with a quite positivity that finds a way to solve all these problems as they occur. Her efforts, however, bring her closer and closer to a confrontation with her father, says Kadaamh. The film has also been selected for the Indian Film Festival Houston, to be held in Houston, Texas, US. Kshitij has been produced by Media Filmscraft.Talking about the inspiration behind the film, Kadaamh said that it is inspired by a short story by Professor Raybhan Davange. I wanted to see it on the big screen as it had a very positive approach towards life. In face of all odds  natural, situational or man-made  theres always a story of hope, he adds.The film was shot in a single schedule in November last year at Nanaz village, Jamkhed District, Ahmednagar, Beed, Pune and various villages in Islampur District. The film stars Upendra Limaye, Vaishnavi Tangde (Vacchi), Kanchan Jadhav, Rajkumar Tangde and Arnav Mandrupkar, among others.For the role of the protagonist Vacchi, Kadaamh was particularly looking for a village girl who was not just emotional but also used to working in farms barefoot in the hot sun and could carry water and loads on her head. The team conducted auditions in different rural areas in different parts of Maharashtra for the role and after 17 auditions, they found Vacchi in Vaishnavi Tangde.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a15871e9855b76bf13eea0a,"‘Next step, the making of a river rejuvenation policy",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/next-step-the-making-of-a-river-rejuvenation-policy/articleshow/60917666.cms,2017-10-03,"Rally for Rivers, the river-rejuvenation initiative led by Sadhguru, concluded in Delhi on Monday. The month long pan-India rally covered 16 states, enlisting support of governments, civil society, spiritual leaders and media, creating a plan to rejuvenate rivers. This includes planting trees for at least a kilometre on either side of a river and helping farmers upgrade irrigation with professional inputs. In Haridwar on the last leg, Sadhguru spoke to Vishwa Mohan about the campaign.With the help of experts, we have prepared a draft policy on river revitalisation that is a little over 700 pages. We'll present this to the Centre on October 3 or 4. We will share this with all the states, prominent environmentalists and media houses. We will give them three months to share their wisdom, knowledge and experience. There is no absolutism when it comes to environment. There are always better ways to do certain things. Once this is over, the legislative, legal, cultural and administrative challenges will take another 6 to 12 months.Execution will be a big challenge. It is a legislative challenge, a legal challenge, and its execution will also have many complexities. But we have charted out as clear a path as possible. I'm happy to say we've been to 15 states ruled by seven different parties who have spoken with one voice. It says something about the maturity of our political system. Even in states in election mode, like Karnataka, the CM, ex-CM and possible future CMs spoke with a single voice for the purpose.Tremendous. We crossed 12 crore missed calls five days ago. I've been asking for 30 crore. We still have a month. Missed calls are like votes (in the campaign's favour). About 30 crore is nearly 40% of the electorate. It'll send a very strong message.It's about setting a national agenda. The task calls for huge financial outlay, and long gestation period. We're talking 20-25 years for rivers to flourish again. Four to five governments are likely to come and go. All governments must be focused, for which an overwhelming 'yes' (in the form of missed calls) must come from India, so they know so many voted for this one cause.We want to create a large-scale workable module. India has 20,000 km of riverine land. Nearly 25% of this is government land. This will be forested. We want to prove to farmers that their income from tree-based agriculture will far exceed returns from cropbased agriculture. This will be done in a scientific way. All support will be provided. We are speaking to CII. Baba Ramdev has said he will provide minimum support price to farmers for their tree-based produce. Farmers don't want to shift from paddy and sugarcane, the thirstiest of crops, as these have a support price. We have to tell farmers how the shift from crop-based farming to tree-based farming can increase their income three times over. If farmers get a guarantee that their produce will be procured, they will switch over to the tree based farming. This model will work.When in survival mode, as we've been in the last 50 years, we did many things and benefited from it. Don't go about damning the dams now. That was a certain phase of development. Now we're thinking differently as we want sustainability. There are those for river linking and those against it. I seek a solution. We'll find one only if science and politics marry and I'm trying to officiate the marriage.The survival rate for what our volunteers are doing on private land is very high. When government plants on a large scale, it can get political. I say don't announce you'll plant so much in a day. If you say one year, you can plan better. MP, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are doing it, and geo-tagging all trees. So you know when a tree has to be replaced, using technology.In the last month, media has done a fabulous job. We appreciate the support of the Times of India, its leadership, the editorial and reporting teams for its relentless support through this month long campaign. TOI took ownership of the Rally for Rivers and also published many reports on the state of India's rivers that raised awareness and will play a role in the making of a river revitalisation policy. There's been some fantastic reporting in the vernacular media as well.I am trying to disconnect the emotion from the behaviour. Emotions do not translate into practice, or action. There is a time for emotions and politics, but now we have to think scientifically and strategically. Which is why, when someone says they'll plant a tree I say, no, your satisfaction is not a solution. You get me 10 missed calls instead."

Express The election for the Shri Dudhgana Vedganaga Cooperative Sugar Mill in Kolhapur will see Congress tie up with Shiv Sena. ExpressPolitics makes strange bedfellows. In the sugar belt of Maharashtra, it has made arch enemies come together to gain power. The upcoming election for the Shri Dudhgana Vedganaga Cooperative Sugar Mill in Kolhapur has seen the BJP siding with the NCP to take on Congress-Shiv Sena combine. This election has generated much interest for many see as the BJPs effort to enter the cooperative sector.Located in the Kagal taluka of Kolhapur district, this cooperative mill, like others in the area, has been under the control of leaders who are from the NCP or Congress. Though the mill is located in Kagal taluka, its more than 54,000 members are spread mostly in the talukas of Radhanagari, Kagal, Bhudargad and Karveer. They will be participating in the election to elect a new 21-member board of director for the mill, which will run the show for the next five years.The outgoing board of director was headed by KP Patil, an ex-NCP MLA and majority of the directors were either from Congress or NCP. This time around, Patils panel is pitted against another panel formed by veteran Congress leader Dinkarrao Jadhav. Jadhav had held the chairmanship of the mill for more than a decade and his relations with Patil was cordial once. But, now, both have become arch rivals. The election of the cooperative sugar mill might have gone unnoticed had it not been for the strange alliances it has created. In the run-up to the election, Patil decided to enter into a formal alliance with the BJP and of the 21 candidates it has put up, five are from the BJP. On the other hand, the panel put up by Jadhav decided to enter into an alliance with the Shiv Sena, with Prakash Abitkar, the Sena MLA from Radhanagari, joining hands with Jadhav to bring down Patils panel.In this election, what has made the BJP leaders hopeful of favourable results is the induction of leaders like Rahul Desai, son of former NCP MLA Bajrang Desai. Millers like Samarjitsinh Ghatge, chairman of Kagal-based Shri Chattrapati Shau Maharaj Cooperative Sugar mill and Vinay Kore, director of Tatyasaheb Kore Warna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana, had earlier joined the BJP, which has boosted its prospects in the region. Abitkars decision to join hands with the Congress is mostly because of the fact that Patil was his opponent in the 2014 Assembly elections. Incidentally, Abitkar had switched over to Shiv Sena from Congress just prior to the polls.Kolhapur happens to be the home district of state Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil. Patil has been trying to increase the partys footprint and presence in the sugar belt as well as the cooperative sugar mills. Patil has been in the forefront of this alliance, but leaders close to him say this is a purely local arrangement and nothing much should be read into it. Given the fact that the BJP is looking to make strong inroads in the cooperative sector, this election is being viewed with interest by many. During the 2014 elections, Shiv Sena had bagged six of the 10 Assembly seats in the district while NCP and BJP had won two seats each. But since then, the BJP is on the rise in Kolhapur, with the zilla parishad elections witnessing the party sharing power with a local party called Tararani Aghadi.With both sides putting their best foot forward to win the elections, no one is leaving any stone unturned. Shareholder voters who are outside Kolhapur are being called back to be present to exercise their franchise.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

As if that was not a strong enough signal of intent, he topped it with a sweet lisp: ""It would be wrong to call the BJP a communal party. Remember, TMC was a BJP ally at the TMC's inception in 1997.""If Roy indeed joins the BJP, it will serve the party rather nicely. The Trinamool castaways fortress is the Kanchrapara railway scrap yard in the northern suburbs of Kolkata. Its a densely populated part of Kolkata on the east bank of the Hooghly, with a mixed migrant populace. Mukul Roys entry would enable the BJP to establish a bridgehead in a nicely festering location ideal for social engineering.Was it notun gur, Mukul?But Babu Moshai Mukul Roy didnt say whether the rosogullas were made of sugar syrup or jaggery. Surely with winter approaching, hed have known that jaggery is the flavor of the season? Winter is when Kolkatans switch to cane sugar from the rather run-of-the-mill mill-manufactured sucrose syrup for their rosogullas. Priced between Rs 7 and Rs 10, jaggery rosogullas are given as presents and prepared in large numbers for marriage ceremonies, many of which are solemnised in winter. The special rosogullas, which are available only in winter when jaggery is aplenty, give a boost to the confectionary industry concentrated in rural Bengal.Oxygen days ahead?Analogous to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai, the east Kolkata wetlands are the citys natural lungs, filtering out much of its pollution even though the city has grown more than three times since Independence. However, with a steady rise in pollution levels coupled with the state government plans to build a flyover right through the wetlands, its just a matter of before the eastern Kolkata wetlands begin to dry up the like the lost lakes of Hyderabad and Bengaluru. But wait there is a business opportunity for you: package and sell oxygen cylinders like in Beijing. Kolkata might need them very soon.No good movies, yetiThis holiday season has been bereft of timepass movies. The much-hyped film on the mythical Yeti fell flat on its face during the Durga Puja hols and not many new releases are lined up. Kolkatans have had no good movie to go see with the family this season. Single-screens and multiplexes are wearing a gloomy look with very thin attendances. Bollywood and Hollywood arent helping either.Hilsa getting smallerThis is the all-time Kolkata crib. How come hilsa sold before Durga Puja are bigger and those sold after are smaller, how dare they? Its cold consolation to Kolkatans that prices of hilsa have come down since Puja. Though the state government does issue strict orders to fishermen not to catch smaller hilsa and let them grow, fishermen disobey the diktat due to demand for hilsa in the festive season."

Ghana are here with their very own war dance, Jama. Unlike the Maori version, though, Jama isnt a fierce display of strength that is performed before the kickoff. Instead, the Black Starlets perform what is similar to the Maharashtrian lezim dance with a few of them playing cymbals. They dance to a traditional tune, blaring from a mobile phone, from the team bus to the dressing room. Thats how they psyche themselves up for a match, Ghana coach Samuel Fabin says. Ghana had sizeable support as well  all students from Noida  who added to the atmosphere. Alas, neither Jama nor the crowd could help Ghana enough. They crashed to a 1-0 defeat to the US.

(Source: AIFF Twitter) Boris Singh had missed the first game against USA because he was suspended. (Source: AIFF Twitter)Thangjam Mohesh, Indian defender Boris Singhs father, came to the stadium pretty early and chose a seat in line of the right-back position (if India were attacking from left to right) so that he could have an unobstructed view of his son. Boriss family sat along with the parents of other Manipuri players. Captain Amarjit Singhs mother and brother were here, so was Jeakson Singhs mother. But it was Boriss family who were the most anxious. He had missed the first game against USA because he was suspended. So we hope he plays well, like the other players did the other night, Mohesh says. I spoke to Boris before coming to the stadium. He is never nervous. I am, though. By half time, Moheshs nervousness was gone. He was signaling thumbs up to everyone who looked at his direction, clearly satisfied with his sons performance. Mihir Vasavda in New DelhiForce of habitAs soon as play stopped between Mali and Turkey, the DY Patil Stadium ground staff rushed onto the pitch with the blue tarpaulin they use to cover the centre of the field  just like they do when a cricket match is in progress and it rains. The first game of the evening was played in heavy rain. New Zealands coach Danny Hay had mentioned on the eve of the first match that the football ground is firm at the centre because of the cricket pitch. Paraguay and New Zealand had to warm-up around the blue patch as the centre square was covered. It would not be removed till just before kick-off. Some cricket habits die hard. Shahid Judge in MumbaiWine, wine everywhere, but not a dropIn the vast lobby of the Crowne Plaza hotel was spread a giant table almost nearly 20 metres in length and 10 metres in width. On it were splashed 1,000 kg of dates, 500kg of almonds and 100kg of sugar soaked 50 litres of home-made red wine and 25 litres of rum. The support staff and team officials were gently mixing the ingredients and making into a paste. The aroma hits almost a mile from the lobby. None of the players, though, were visible. A few curious ones hung around and some of the tried to peep. But they were rushed back to their room. A member of the Brazil support staff explained why the boys are here: We dont want to see these kids nursing a hangover in tomorrows match. You know our boys are very capable of that.

Fadnavis also said that government would be filing cases under Section 304 of the IPC which amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.Pesticide poisoning toll in the region climbed to 35 after Chandrapur administration confirmed the death of a 23-year-old farmer from Babapur village in Rajrua. He had passed away a few weeks back. However, the cause was confirmed on Tuesday.All the deceased farmers had allegedly used a concoction of chemicals to get rid of pests that were threatening to destroy cotton crops. Sources said they were also not using protective gear as recommended by manufacturers.Fadnavis said a team headed by additional chief secretary (Home) Sudheer Srivastava is already investigating the issue. However, considering the multiple issues involved, the SIT too has been constituted.Officials say that the announcement of forming the SIT was in response to a public interest litigation (PTI) filed in the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court. The division bench of Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Swapna Joshi has sent notices state agriculture secretary, agriculture commissioner and Yavatmal collector directing them to file their replies before October 30.Fadnavis also said that it has come to light that most of these farm hands were using a newly introduced Chinese-made spraying pump which has no mechanism to regulate the flow of pesticide. ""We will ban use of these Chinese-made sprays,"" said Fadnavis.The state government has lodged an FIR against agro-chemical firm Gharda Chemicals in the wake of the pesticide-related deaths. It is also mulling to lodge a case against agro-chemical firm Syngenta, state agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said on Tuesday.""We have lodged a case of cheating and culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Gharda Chemicals. Its pesticide  'Police'  was among those used. It is not meant for the cotton crop but for sugar cane and it is meant to be released in the soil, not for spraying,"" he said. He said that the pesticide should not have been sold to dealers in the cotton belt.""FIR is also likely to be registered against Syngenta, which manufactures pesticide 'Polo',"" he said. The companies could not be contacted at the time of going to press.The government has also issued a show cause notice to the agriculture development officer of Yavatmal Zilla Parishad. He is likely to be suspended, sources said. The notice was issued after a government committee led by Srivastava found that several unlicensed shops were operating in Yavatmal district, officials said.Suraj Parkhi (23) was engaged in pesticide spraying work at Babapur village when his condition started deteriorating and he was rushed to Rajura rural hospital. He breathed his last while undergoing treatment a few weeks back. The body was sent to Chandrapur GMC for post mortem, which confirmed Parkhi's death due to indirect consumption of organophosphate based pesticide.No fresh casualties were reported from other parts of the region even though four new patients of pesticide poisoning were admitted to the Yavatmal GMC on Tuesday taking the number of patients undergoing treatment there to 24. The number of casualties from the district remained at 19 (11 deaths in GMCH and 8 in other hospitals) as no death was reported till filing of the report.Of the 24 patients in the GMC, 6 are in the ICU and the remaining 18 are in other wards. ""Of the 6 in the ICU, three are on ventilator support. Though their condition is critical, they are stable,"" informed head of the department of medicine Dr Baba Elke. Three patients were discharged today.At GMCH Akola, one person affected by pesticide was brought in on Tuesday taking the number of patients undergoing treatment there to 4. One of the four is in critical condition and is kept in the intensive care unit (ICU).Chandrapur resident deputy collector, Vaibhav Nawadkar, confirmed Parkhi's death due to pesticide poisoning. However, the data compiled by his office about the number of people from the district affected by pesticide poisoning does not match with that of the record of the Chandrapur GMCH.Nawadkar informed that reports submitted by tehsildars of all 15 tehsils in the district suggest that only 24 people were affected by pesticide poisoning. They include 17 from Warora tehsil, five from Bhadrawati and two from Bramhapuri tehsil. On the other hand, civil surgeon Dr Umesh Newade claimed that 33 patients were admitted to the GMC since September. Out of these, 28 patients belong to different tehsils in Chandrapur district, while the remaining five are from adjacent Yavatmal and Gadchiroli districts, he said. Dr Newade also informed that only eight persons are undergoing treatment at present while others have been discharged.Two of the pesticide affected persons remained on ventilator support at the Nagpur GMCH.Meanwhile, Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission (a state task force for agrarian crisis) chairman Kishore Tiwari chaired a meeting at the local Bachat Bhavan on Tuesday to review the progress of Mahatma Jyotiba Fuley Jeevandayi Yojana of the state government. According to Tiwari, the norms for availing the benefits under the scheme have been relaxed and now all pesticide poisoning affected persons would be given the benefits and 13 hospitals availing the scheme are enlisted to give the service and reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the kin of the affected persons.'We have also proposed to procure 12 more 108 ambulances in addition to the 23 available in the district to ensure prompt health care to the needy from the rural areas,"" said Tiwari.""I have talked to the principal secretary of medical education Sanjay Deshmukh to ensure that adequate stock of medicines will be made available in the GMCs so that no patient is forced to buy medicines from outside agencies,"" said Tiwari.Yavatmal police have booked 8 Krishi Kendras in the district under Section 304A of the IPC (causing death due to negligence not amounting to murder) and Section 29 (1) of the Insecticides Act, 1968. The administration has already cancelled the licences of 5 kendras while it has issued warning to a kendra."

Beaches, history, music, culture or temples? 27-year-old anonymous artist Chitra Iyer, an illustrator, associates herself with the food and food joints in the city. And mind you, they are not just the popular ones. From filter kaapi to dosai at Sangeetha, Chitra recently did a series of 25 drawings called Chennai Doodle Series, where she takes you through her food memories in Chennai.A true blue Chennai girl, she started this series as timepass. ""My initial idea was to do a recipe blog; instead of taking pictures I wanted to draw them. But then I realised they are aplenty and are too common. I wouldn't be able to do anything new with it. Hence I started this series for fun,"" she says. The series not just has hotels and shops on paint and paper, but also food items that she relished as a kid. Thaen mittai, vadai and kuzhipanniyaram made the cut.The series includes Sathyam popcorn, Grand sweets murukku, Frankie, and Jigarthanda. So what are her early food memories in Chennai, considering that the scene is changing frequently and rapidly? ""Early food memories definitely include the masala dosai from Saravana Bhavan that was right next to our house; the small family-owned sweet shops; the roadside sundal especially near Marina Beach and of course panju mittai and kuchi ice,"" she shares.As there are umpteen favourites in the city, Chitra had to make tough choices sometime. ""My idea was to paint those that look visually appealing. I wanted to draw the Murugan Idly Kadai but it is just a white building with a white board, so I had to choose something colourful, like the Balaji sandwich shop,"" she says. The series also involves her favourites from Coimbatore, where she spent a few years. ""It is mostly all Chennai, but some memories from Coimbatore too. I didn't want to call it Tamil Nadu doodle series.""Chitra has been sketching for quite some time and has taken to painting only now. While she took close to two hours at the beginning of the series, now she finishes them in 30 minutes. It was easy for her to get ideas, as she has been to all these places. Yet, she did put out tweets for public opinion. ""Most of it were my ideas. Many wanted me to draw the Venkateswara Boli Stall, but I have never been there. And there were polls on choosing between Mansukh Chat and Balaji Sandwich Shop,"" she says. There were some that didn't make the cut. ""Some of them were Ratna Cafe, The old Grand Sweets and also the small shops I visited as a child. They are no longer existed and I don't have any photographs of them too.""Among all the hardest was sundal! ""Can you believe that?! They are all the same colour and it was very hard to give dimension to it. As much as I wanted to do, I had to drop it. Even bhajji is hard to paint. But my latest one was a molaga bhajji but water spilled over it and I replaced it with sugarcane juice. I will do a bhajji series soon; it's my favourite beach food,"" she smiles.The series has 25 photos and she will now move on to series on other cities she lived in- Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The series has received good response but there are a few who have asked why certain other favourites were not included. ""I might do a separate series but not include it in this set. I might call it 'favourite restaurants of India' or something,"" she points out.Follow her on Instagram at @analiensart"

On Monday, the agriculture department said that 32 farmers died because of pesticide. This is the third such probe in Vidarbha region ordered by the state government. The government had not announced details of the probe till late on Tuesday.Addressing the media, Fadnavis added that a case of culpable homicide will be registered against the pesticide manufacturers and dealers for circulating non-certified pesticide in the region. State agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said, A culpable homicide case has been registered against Gharda Chemicals Ltd for selling a pesticide that is not recommended. We are in process of registering a case against Syngenta  an agro chemical company  under similar section of the Indian Penal Code.Gharda Chemicals Ltd. manufactures a pesticide with trade name Police, while Syngenta makes a pesticide called Polo, Fundkar said. Hindustan Times had reported on Tuesday that the state agriculture department had detected that Police a pesticide recommended for sugarcane crop  was sold in Yavatmal, Akola, which primarily cultivate cotton.Cases against Krishi Seva Kendras or agro-input centres have also been filed under the Insecticide Control Act 1968 for selling non-certified pesticides and selling pesticides without mandatory license. Apart from the death of the farmers, around 25 farmers have reportedly lost their vision and close to 800 farmers have been admitted to state-run hospitals after they complained of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc.Meanwhile, the findings and the recommendations of the probe that was headed by Sudhir Kumar Srivastava, additional chief secretary (home), were discussed in the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The probe was set up after complaints of negligence and to inquire whether more than the prescribed level of chemicals has been used.According to Fundkar, the district administration failed to report the matter to the state government. The report has suggested that SOPs were not followed and there were lapses in the system to report the incident. Medico-legal cases should have been registered, Fundkar said. The state government has suspended the Yavatmal district agriculture officer.A senior bureaucrat added that Srivastava recommended that farmers who employ labourers to spray pesticide should also be made accountable. One of his recommendations was that the farmer has to provide the labourer the safety kit--gloves goggles. He (farmer) will also be responsible to take him to a doctor in case there are any issues with his (labourer) health due to spraying of pesticide, the official who was part of the Cabinet meeting said. The minister added that there are about 25,000 labourers, mostly from Telangana, that are employed for spraying pesticides in the state. He added that the state government has distributed 12,500 safety kits in the affected districts and said that kits will be made compulsory."

The state government has set up a special investigation team to probe the deaths and lodged an FIR under the charges of `culpable homicide not amounting to murder' against agrochemical firm Gharda Chemicals.Another firm, Syngenta , also faces action.CM Devendra Fadnavis said a team headed by additional chief secretary (home) Sudhir Srivastava was inves tigating the deaths, but the SIT was constituted given ""the many sides to the issue"".Talking about the firms in question, state agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said on Tuesday, ""Gharda's pesticide `Police' was among those used. It's not meant for cotton, but sugarcane, and it should be released under the soil, not sprayed."" ""We're going to lodge an FIR against Syngenta in connection with their pesticide `Polo',"" he added. The companies could not be contacted for comment at the time of going to press. Officials said a PIL filed before the Bombay high court could have prompted the SIT.The Srivastava committee, which has recommended the suspension of the Yavatmal agriculture development officer (ADO) and a ban on `Polo' and `Police', has raised the hackles of the agriculture department. Officials said the core reason for not spotting the problem, which was the failure of the district machinery, wasn't addressed, and banning the pesticides would be a problem since they were essential for sugarcane.The government has issued a showcause notice to the Yavatmal ADO after the Srivastava panel found that several unlicensed shops were operating in the district, officials said. Eight FIRs have also been filed against Krishi Kendra (agro input centre) proprietors in Yavatmal, and licences of five cancelled."

In 1972, his father Brig RS Randhawa (retd), an Armoured Corps officer commissioned into the 8th Cavalry, was camping near Nanpara village of Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh during a field exercise. The village falls in the Terai region and abounds in the jungles and wildlife immortalised through the shikar tales of Jim Corbett.After partition, many Sikh farmers settled here and turned an inhospitable terrain, swarming with perilous creatures, into profitable, agrarian tracts by sheer guts, blood and hard work. Senior Randhawa was hooked to Nanpara as wild boars, red junglefowl and even an occasional tiger roamed freely. He set up a farm here. Jyoti, thus, grew up with the many sounds and spectacles afforded by the Terai wilderness, especially on magical moonlit nights when hog deer and grunting boars would crash through vast sugarcane tracts.This childhood passion for wildlife evolved into an easy accompaniment to Jyotis travels across India and the globe to play professional golf. On one such golfing odyssey, he took time off to visit the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.Five of us got onto a machan made near a waterhole. A tigress and a cub came to drink water. After they left, a majestic male arrived. The male eased into water backwards to cool down and drink water, which was fascinating. One of my friends made the slightest of sounds, but that did not escape the tigers attention. After his bath, the tiger came lumbering towards the machan to investigate. One of my friends, whose legs were dangling down from the machan, quickly pulled them up, Jyoti recalls.Perched on the machan and holding on tightly, we shuddered at the thought of what would happen if any one of us were to be caught alone on the ground with this brute. But the funny thing was that as the tiger came under our machan, he somehow got unnerved. The king of the jungle turned tail and bolted from the spot like a stray dog, leaving us equally puzzled but thrilled to bits by this once-in-a-lifetime experience! Jyoti told this writer while playing the championship at the Chandigarh Golf Club.UNPROVOKED ATTACKThe dog bite mark on Rajiv Kumar Jatiwals leg. (VIKRAM JIT SINGH)You never know which stray dog is grinning at you in abject servility and which one may suddenly pounce on you and hack your flabby calves without so much as a warning bark. On October 8, professional golfer Rajiv Kumar Jatiwal Boney was playing a practice round ahead of the 1 crore Take Open Championship at the Chandigarh Golf Club. He mounted the vacant tee at the eighth hole bound to the west by thick bushes, and sought shade under a tree.A brown dog emerged from the bushes and quietly came up to me. I noticed it had a redness around the face and carried bite marks on the body. There was a look of madness in the dogs eyes. I turned and ran to get a golf stick, but the dog chased me and bit me under the right knee. I fell down, tearing a muscle in the left leg. I have spent Rs 18,000 on rabies and allied injections and have missed the championship due to this unprovoked attack, Jatiwal told this writer.On Friday, ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singhs path to the sixth hole tee was blocked by a dog. Uncertain of the strays intention and the Boney attack fresh in mind, Jeev was naturally apprehensive, as have other golfers been on numerous occasions.The areas dogs are neither neutered nor vaccinated and the adjoining Sukhna Lakes multiplying strays spill over to dig retreats in cool sand bunkers. Under the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, the club can get dogs trapped, neutered and vaccinated but they must be released back at the same spot.THE MARIGOLD HONOURA portrait of a long-tailed shrike atop marigolds (NITIN SONAWANE)If all goes well, the humble marigold will soon be declared Indias National Flower of Remembrance and December 7 as the National Day of Remembrance for soldiers who sacrificed their lives in wars. It is learnt that the Ministry of Defence has already accorded approval to these remembrance symbols and the three chiefs of the armed services are scheduled to meet on October 18 to sanctify the noble initiative.As part of the evolving India Remembers project, the marigold symbol is modelled on the same concept as the flaming poppy, which is the Commonwealth Flower of Remembrance, and November 11, which is established as Remembrance Day in western nations.The idea behind the project is that on December 7, which also marks the annual Armed Forces Flag Day, Indian citizens will be encouraged to identify a serving or retired serviceman or servicewoman, present them with a marigold flower and thank them for their service and sacrifice for the nation. The marigold has been chosen as the flower due to its rich resonance with Indias cultural and social life as also at funerals. It is an inexpensive, fine cut flower found across India, and blooms throughout the year.(The writer can be contacted at vjswild1@gmail.com)"

Beware of cheap mawa. Activists have written to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about more than 15 tonnes of adulterated mawa being allegedly sold in sweet markets across Maharashtra.Activists wrote to FDA minister Girish Bapat and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,saying an illegal mawa racket has been running in Maharashtra and Gujarat for the past two years.While mawa is usually made from milk fat, it is adulterated using vegetable oil, milk powder and sugar. More than 40 trucks of adulterated mawa have been travelling from Gujarat to Maharashtra before Diwali for the past two years, said RPY Rao, president, Society for Social Awareness of Civil Rights, an NGO that works in the field of public health.Rao said the adulterated mawa is distributed in Thane, Ghatkopar, Kurla and Mumbai Central, using which barfis or pedas are made and are sold during Diwali.It is packaged under an unknown brand name, and sold in packets of 5kg and 10kg at almost half the market rate. I have urged the minister and the CM to carry out an inquiry with the help of the FDAs vigilance commissioner, Rao said.Pallavi Darade, FDA commissioner, Maharashtra, told HT she hasnt received any notification yet. I will definitely look into the issue, she said.She said the FDA has been seizing adulterated sweets and other edibles since August 20.We have seized more than 2,44,888kg sweets across Maharashtra as a part of our festive drives. As many as 961 samples are being tested in our laboratories to find out how they have been tampered with, Darade added.A letter by the Food Safety Standards Authority of India  addressed to Dr H G Koshia, food safety commissioner, Gujarat, and Dr H S Kamble, food safety commissioner, Maharashtra,  directed both states to initiate action on a complaint filed by Rao regarding the sale of barfi made using adulterated mawa.Both states are aware of the issue, but no action has been taken since the pat two years. Officials shouldnt wait for a tragedy, such as mass food poisoning, to initiate action, Rai added."

The state government stopped distributing sugar through the public distribution system (PDS) that could have been used to make festival delicacies. The promise of farm loan waiver, too, proved to be false as waiver certificates issued by the government didnt have any mention of the amount, Malik alleged.NCP leader Chitra Wagh put up black Diwali lanterns outside official residences of ministers, namely revenue minister Chandrakant Patil and water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar.In the past few weeks, the party has upped the ante against the BJP government and has become more aggressive.

It wished the recipient good health -- defined by an ideal waist-hip ratio, body mass index, good and bad cholesterol level, and normal blood sugar and blood pressure. Its popularity on social media is an indication of increased health awareness among at least urban Indians.Unfortunately, awareness alone is not enough. There is little matching action among urban Indians to ensure for themselves a healthy diet. Worse, rural India is fast catching up.Medical research illustrates overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases and cancers are not only on the rise but have already assumed epidemic proportions among city dwellers. Nutrition transition, coupled with sedentary and unhealthy lifestyles, are to blame.Maternal and childhood undernutrition are also among the causes triggering a rise in non-communicable diseases. About 2.6 million Indians are forecast to die of coronary heart disease, which constitutes some 54% of all cardiovascular deaths in India by 2020.A recent survey by the National Institute of Nutrition in 16 states waves the red flag. Among urban population, between a third to half the men and women suffer from overweight and obesity-related problems. One in three urban men and women have hypertension, and one in four men and women have diabetes. Hyperlipidemia afflicts one in three men and women.In summary, its a public health disaster on our hands. Lack of time, coupled with easy availability of convenience foods and misleading advertisements, drive the nutrition imbalance in the cities, said Neelanjana Singh, nutrition consultant at Heinz Nutrilife Clinic in Delhi and a member of the Indian Dietectic Association.Indias growing prosperity therefore comes at the cost of the health of its citizens. Take diabetes, for example. The NIN survey showed overall prevalence of diabetes among urban men and women was 28.1% and 23.3% respectively. Among men, prevalence of diabetes was the highest in Puducherry, followed by New Delhi, Karnataka and Kerala. Among women, the trend was almost similar  Puducherry, followed by New Delhi.A separate study commissioned by the Indian Council of Medical Research on Indias diabetes trend came up with the disturbing finding on how the lifestyle disorder is affecting more urban poor. The diabetic epidemic shifts towards the poorer section of the society living in affluent states including Karnataka.Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat are among the states and union territories with the highest prevalence of diabetes, according to the ICMR survey. Tripura is an exception as the north eastern state has one of Indias highest diabetes prevalence despite not being a rich state.Cities in more affluent states have transitioned further along the diabetes epidemic. As the overall prosperity of individual states and the country increases, the diabetes epidemic is likely to disproportionately affect the poorer sections of society, a transition that has already been seen in high income countries, said Viswanathan Mohan, president, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai.But the nutrition imbalance in the cities is only half the story as overnutrition and undernutrition coexist in India. The NIN survey also points out how the prevalence of low body weight, stunting (low height for age) and wasting (low weight for height) remains high among children from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It found 39% stunting among boys below five years from Dalit households and 34% among those from tribal families. For the backward classes and the rest of the population, the corresponding figures are just under 28% and 27% respectively.Poor nutrition was higher in kids from households with low per capita income, illiterate fathers and lack of access to sanitary latrines.A comparison between urban and rural children show those from the cities enjoy a better nutrition profile. But pitted against the children of the developed world, the same set of urban boys and girls turn out to be malnourished. Even in affluent families, there areshortage of micro-nutrients in diet though there is no shortage of food, said Singh."

You can find out for yourself at Desi Klub, a three-month-old restaurant in the city, which has a special chocolate thali on their menu.Desi Klub is a Mumbai-based restaurant that has franchises in Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai and they are looking to expand. Five partners  Sushil Mehta, Arvind Baheti, Suresh Gundecha, Pavan Surana and Abhishek Bokadia, are happy to have brought the concept of Mumbai street food with a twist to the city.Though chocolate thali was always a part of the menu, we never publicised it much before. It is only now that we have started putting it out on our Instagram and Facebook pages and are getting rave responses, says Shrey Mehta who takes care of operations.Disclaimer: The thali is only for hardcore chocolate lovers. There are eight items in the thali: Chocolate khakhra, chocolate shrikhand, chocolate kheer, chocolate gulab jamun, chocolate swiss roll, chocolate barfi (truffles), chocolate ice cream and a white chocolate lollipop. It has a mix of dark and milk chocolate with infused flavours, that doesnt give you a sugar rush, says Shrey, but we are not convinced till we take a bite of the items on the thali. And boy was he right!First up is the chocolate khakhra, where a plain khakhra is coated with chocolate sauce. Shrey tells us he cant share the recipe, for obvious reasons, but that everything is prepared in house, except the ice cream and khakhra. We source the chocolates from abroad. We make sure that there is a balance of sweet, bitter and other flavours, he adds.The chocolate truffle aka barfi, is made of dark chocolate and coated with chocolate powder, the swiss roll has an orange filling in it, the gulab jamun oozes chocolate as you cut into it...aah its pure bliss even to watch the plate!The thali menu is decided by the main restaurant and the Chennai team had to do a small survey to see if it will work in the city. It is definitely a different concept and nowhere in Chennai do you have a chocolate thali. We tapped that, adds Shrey. Now, they have a minimum of five orders everyday, and they are also quite popular on social media. Most of their customers who prefer chocolate thali are the youngsters. The next step is delivering their food, including chocolate thali, and they are currently in talks with Swiggy, Zomato and Foodpanda.If you are a choco lover, flip right to the end of the menu, to the desserts section, where it is listed. It is intended as a dessert where people can either share or relish individually. But some have had it as their main course itself. We still havent had a customer who could finish the entire thali on their own after the main course, says Abhishek. Why not keep a contest? He laughs, We are planning on it!Have the thali when it is hot...the chocolate gulab jamun just melts in your mouth. As its a dessert, it doesnt matter what you eat first or last. Another tip they give us; dip the khakhra in chocolate kheer (warm dark chocolate sauce). It gives sinfully sublime a new meaning!Priced at `415, the thali is available at Desi Klub on Harrington Road (opposite MCC School).For details, call: 30853689"

The jaggery produced in Bhadravathi is sold in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra. Over 1,000 persons are directly employed by these units from August to March, the season for crushing sugarcane.Sugarcane is cultivated on more than 5,000 hectares in the district.

Carbonated soft drinks are also growing but growing slower in the last five years. The beverage category is growing in high single digits and within that, carbonate soft drinks will be in lower single digits, hydration would be in double digits, and juices in low double digits.Increasing awarenessAn increasing health awareness among Indian consumers and their preference for health and wellness products may be the reasons for a strong demand for juices, according to research firm, Euromonitor International. Carbonates, both cola and non-cola, are likely to see sustained slowdowns.Juice and juice-based carbonates remained the most important priorities for Indias soft drink companies last year, which also saw new entrants such as Manpasand Beverages and Hector Beverages fighting for shelf space with PepsiCo India and Coca-Cola India, according to Euromonitor.PepsiCo would reduce the calorific value in its drinks as part of a global commitment that two-thirds of the companys beverages will be less than 100 calories per 355 ml by 2025, Mr. Prakash said.We will reduce the sugar in our carbonated soft drinks. We launched 7UP with reduced sugar, 30% less, in Gujarat. We launched it as a a test pilot a year ago. The pilot has been a success and we will be extending it to many more parts of the country in the first quarter of 2018, he said. Similarly we are working on Mirinda, Mountain Dew and Pepsi.Zero-sugar productsThe company is also working on how to accelerate zero-sugar products, Mr. Prakash said.Things like Pepsi Black come in there. We have other products such as Tropicana Essentials which do not have added sugar. That is a very small portion of the portfolio now. Another element is..., how do you introduce beverages which are inherently lowe [in] sugar? That is where hydration becomes extremely critical.Hydration is the largest in the liquid refreshment category today and the fastest growing. The strange thing is that (in India) 99% of it is plain water. If you go to any other country it will be between 60-70%. About 30% is what we call value-added water. We want it to be 80:20.PepsiCo is also working on products that have flavours of herbs and fruits with vitamins added to it. It aims to add one new product every 6-12 months on the Aquafina platform, such as the recently introduced Aquafina Vitamin Splash with Kiwi lime and Raspberry mint flavor  both fortified with vitamins.The Splash range of beverages took about 18 months to develop, Mr. Prakash said. It is the first time we are calling out a benefit and a claim on the pack. One is for immune function and one is antioxidants. It is India-specific and was developed for people with certain deficiencies like B12, Vitamin E.He said PepsiCo was taking baby steps in the dairy business. At least for the next two years, we will be in a learning space. We have much to learn in this segment.The firm has 62 manufacturing plants in India  43 for beverages and 19 for snacks. The factories are a mix of company-owned plants, franchisee or bottler-owned, co-packers and bulk water units.The franchisee business is about two-third of our overall business and one-third is the company-owned bottling units, which is mainly in the south, Mr. Prakash said.The franchisee bottling plants are owned by Delhi-based billionaire, Ravi Jaipuria of Varun Beverages, C.K. Jaipura in coastal Andhra Pradesh, S.K. Jaipuria in central India, parts of Maharashtra, Dharwad area, Jharkhand and Anurag Jaipuria in Jammu. Lumbini Beverages, run by Ravi Khilani, owns a plant in Bihar.Varun Beverages holds a significant portion of the business. They have the whole of north India  in New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajastan, Goa, West Bengal and they have recently acquired plants in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha from S.K. Jaipuria, Mr. Prakash said."

(File) Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis. (File)FUNDAMENTAL changes in the functioning of the agrarian economy to benefit small farmers was a key promise made by the Bharatiya Janata Party when it rode to power in Maharashtra in 2014. Three years down the line, the state government appears to be perplexed with the challenges that the fickle agrarian economy has thrown at it. In its first year, the government was forced to tackle negative growth in agriculture and scarcity due to drought. This year, an oversupply of produce such as tur dal (pigeon pea) brought in a fresh set of problems.The governments inability to address these vagaries of the agrarian economy had led to an unprecedented farmers agitation, with the simmering discontent threatening to weigh the BJP government down.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has tried to fight his way out by announcing a Rs 30,000-crore farm loan waiver that will further deepen the states debt burden of around Rs 4 lakh crore.Another criticism has been the agriculture departments operations. The state Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar has often been described as too low profile. His deputy Sadabhau Khot, while more visible, has had to focus on his own political survival after quitting his party, the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, which supported the farmers strike earlier this year.The agriculture sector is like one big giant wheel rolling down a hill. It will move ahead even if you do not do anything. The real task is to stabilise this motion and ensure that it does not crash. The policies of this government, however, are such that they have left this sector to fend for itself. There is not much difference in how previous governments and this government have addressed the agrarian issues, said Dr Giridhar Patil, a farmer leader.Despite a decent monsoon this year, sowing area for kharif declined marginally. As per the Maharashtra governments economic survey, the kharif season of 2016-17 saw sowing on 152.12 lakh hectares of land. This year, agriculture ministry data shows that sowing has been completed on only 146.49 hectares of land.Farmers say the pinch from demonetisation last year, which threw APMCs out of gear, has continued to manifest in the complete paralysis of district cooperative banks and credit societies.Their paralysis meant drying up of institutional finance for most farmers in the state. Four days after demonetisation, the RBI had imposed sanctions on district cooperative banks on the assumption that money could get laundered through these banks.A lot of time was taken to address the issues of district central cooperative banks, which did create problems in the rural areas, Chairman of the Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank Narendra Darade said.Another crisis was the massive glut of tur dal and the poor price realisation.In Maharashtra, the production of tur went up to 11.71 lakh metric tonnes against 4.4 lakh metric tonnes last year. Due to improved rainfall, the tur sowing increased sharply but the market could not absorb the excess supply.This meant that farmers were getting rates well below the Minimum Support Price. The government subsequently sanctioned a market intervention scheme to purchase tur stock from farmers, but this was mired in allegations that a large chunk of the tur dal procured by the state had been purchased from traders who had, in turn, got it from farmers at well below the MSP.The state has also not been able to reverse the low coverage of crop insurance in Maharashtra, where it presently stands at less than 30 per cent of farmers.On the positive side, the government launched the farmer-to-consumer markets alongside more APMC reforms for more barrier-free markets. It also started an innovative reform of giving 10,000 solar pumps for agriculture, offering round-the-year power, a reduced demand-supply gap and a lower subsidy burden on the state electricity board.Another important decision that the government took this year was to make drip irrigation mandatory for the water intensive sugarcane cultivation. There had been rising concerns about over-exploitation of water in cultivation of sugarcane.The government has also started a bid to encourage group farming, and the Maharashtra government plans to give Rs 1 crore in incentives to farmers who will pool 100 acres of land and common resources. The government aims to create 200 such farmers groups in the state so that resources can be used in common and farmers can derive more profits.We believe that this sharing of resources and knowledge will help farmers attain better productivity and profits. We need to bring in newer ideas to maximise returns of farmers. The governments endeavour has been to ensure that farmers get returns, which commensurate with the hard work they put in, Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Once formalized, the MSP norm will have to be followed by even private dairies, which account for 60% of the milk procurement in the state.At present, the procurement rates fixed by the government are only for state-run and cooperative dairies. Over the years, the state-owned and -run dairies have systematically reduced procurement, and now they buy 0.5% of the total milk, while cooperatives control 39.5% of the market.""There are private brands selling cow milk for Rs 90 per litre but the farmer gets Rs 17-18 per litre. We cannot tell the brands at what rate they should sell that is their business model. But we can regulate the rates the farmer gets,"" Mahadev Jankar , minister for dairy development, animal husbandry and fisheries development, told TOI. ""The Act will allow the state to fix an MSP. The MSP will be finalized keeping in mind the 70:30 profit-sharing ratio on the lines of the sugarcane industrywhere 70% is for the farmer and 30% for the milk processor and middlemen,"" he added. The bill is likely to be tabled in the state legislature in December.Officials working on the legislation said milk is covered under the central Essential Commodities Act, and it has a provision for the states to enact state level legislations to set an MSP. The state has been asking farmers to rear milk-producing animals to supplement their loss-making agriculture-based income. The farmers, in turn, have been demanding that the state fix MSP for milk like it does for nearly 18 crops.""The Act will provide for setting up a regulatory committee to review the supply-demand situation and fix an MSP,"" said a senior official.The move comes after the June 1 state-wide agitation by farmers. One of their main demands was increase in procurement rates for milk. A farmer gets Rs 27 for a litre of cow milk, with 3.5 measures of fat and 8.5 measures of solids not fat (SNF). For buffalo milk, the government has prescribed a price of Rs 36 per litre. ""Many co-operatives don't follow even these rates. Since the direct procurement by government is negligible, farmers are left at the mercy of these buyers and we are aiming to regulate that,"" said an official.He also said that any failure to follow the MSP will attract penalties. An estimated 121 lakh litres of milk is procured daily across the state. Mumbai's daily requirement is 80 lakh litresthis is just packaged milk, loose milk is not accounted for."

(Express Photo: Sandip Daundkar) A dairy farmer in Lohegaon near Pune giving fodder to his buffaloes. (Express Photo: Sandip Daundkar)Bapu Yede, like many in Palasdeo village of Pune districts Indapur taluka, had wholeheartedly participated in the Shetkari Sampa or farmers strike early this June. He joined the movement, stopping supply of all produce to urban centres, mainly in the hope of realise a better price for his milk. The week-long stir culminated in the Maharashtra government hiking its procurement price for cow milk, containing 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent SNF (solids-not-fat), from Rs 24 to Rs 27 a litre.Till around end-July, Yede was actually getting the officially declared rate for the 30-35 litres of milk he supplies daily from his three Holstein Friesian crossbred animals to the Sonai Dairy at Indapur. Since August, though, the company owning it  Indapur Dairy and Milk Products Ltd  has rolled back its price to Rs 22.5 per litre. Most private dairies in Maharashtra are today paying Rs 21-23 a litre. The cooperatives are continuing to give Rs 27 to producer-members, but only Rs 22-23 for milk collected from farmers outside their core district areas.I hear they (dairies) may reduce prices further, maybe to the Rs 18/litre levels of 2016, fears Yede, who grows sugarcane on five acres and devotes the remaining two out of his seven-acre holding for cultivating fodder jowar (soghum), maize and napier or elephant grass. At Rs 22.5/litre, my monthly revenue from 30 litres per day comes to Rs 20,250. As against this, I spend Rs 13,500-14,000 on fodder and feed concentrates alone. Adding family labour and other unpaid expenses leaves me, as it is, with nothing. If prices dip to below Rs 20, I will have no alternative but to sell my animals, he adds.Dairies, especially in the private sector, attribute the falling milk prices to two factors.The first is a crash in international skimmed milk powder (SMP) prices. Since the start of this calendar year, SMP rates at GlobalDairyTrade, the fortnightly auction platform of New Zealands dairy giant Fonterra, have plunged from $2,660 to $1,797 per tonne. These rates are close to their all-time-low of $1,419 per tonne in August 2015 and way below the record $5,142 scaled back in April 2013. Dipping global prices has led to domestic SMP realisations, too, dropping from Rs 220-225 to Rs 155-160 per kg between January and now.The second factor has to do with the goods and services tax (GST). Prior to the new indirect taxation regimes introduction from July 1, butter, ghee and other milk fats attracted an overall duty incidence of 5-6 per cent. With GST, that has gone up to 12 per cent, even as there isnt any duty on liquid milk per se.Both these  crash in SMP realisations and 12 per cent GST on milk fat  have hit us particularly hard. Unlike cooperatives, which are mainly into liquid milk marketing, our revenues come predominantly from production and sale of commodities such as SMP, ghee and white butter, notes Dashrath Shrirang Mane, chairman of the Sonai Dairy. His dairy procures about 17 lakh litres per day (LLPD), of which only two lakh litres is sold as pouched liquid milk and the rest mostly converted into commodities.Rajiv Mitra, managing director of the Satara-based Govind Milk and Milk Products Pvt. Ltd, makes a similar point. We are now paying 5 per cent GST on SMP and 12 per cent on ghee/white butter. And since there is no GST on our raw material (milk), we cannot avail any credit on input tax either, he observes. His dairy procures 6 LLPD and, like Sonai, sells only 2.5 LLPD as pouch milk under its Govind brand.Private players have an estimated 60 per cent share of the total 150 LLPD or so milk handled by organised dairies in Maharashtra. Many of them  specifically those dealing in cow milk fat  had incidentally benefited, when the Yoga guru Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved Ltd launched its branded cow ghee. The latter, in early-2016, was reportedly sourcing white butter, containing 82 per cent fat, from dairies in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu at Rs 190-200 per kg, while retailing the end product (ghee has 99.5 per cent fat) at around Rs 450 per litre (one litre of ghee equals 910 grams). As Patanjalis procurement grew  it accounts for anywhere between 1,200 to 1,800 tonnes of the countrys branded cow ghee market of 3,500-4,000 tonnes a month  so did the price of white butter. With white butter currently fetching Rs 290-300 per kg  they had touched Rs 360 levels in January-February  Patanjali has had to raise its own ghee retail price to Rs 560-580 a litre.The 12 per cent GST has affected us much more than Patanjali, as it is paying the same rate on its raw material (white butter), which partially at least offsets the increase in duty incidence on the final product. We dont have even that luxury. Dairies cannot claim input credit on their own ghee production, whereas those making it by procuring white butter from us can do so, says a dairy industry source, who does not want to come on record.But even cooperatives are not happy. Given that their main product  liquid milk  attracts no GST, there is no scope to offset taxes on inputs. That includes the plastic pouch film, which falls under the 18 cent rate slab. We cannot afford to also not pay the official Rs 27/litre procurement price. The government issues notices and imposes fines only on us, complains Vinayak Patil, chairman of the Sangli-based Rajarambapu Patil Sahakari Dudh Sangh, which markets liquid milk under its Krushna Dudh brand. Unviable SMP prices and GST, he claims, has resulted in his cooperative dairy registering a loss of Rs 1 crore each in both August and September.Even bigger a loser is, of course, the dairy farmer. If milk prices go back to Rs 19 a litre, farmers will most certainly exit dairying this time. And the cost will ultimately be borne by the consumer, warns Mane. Maharashtras dairies have already formed a four-member committee under former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to take up the matter with the Centre. We are seeking a meeting with the finance minister Arun Jaitley. Our main demand is a reduction in the GST on milk fat to 5 per cent, adds Mane.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0182509855b76bf13a9d4d,End of a protest: The story of Jantar Mantar as a protest site began in 1993,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jantar-mantar-protests-ngt-end-of-a-protest-2011-lokpal-agitation-anna-hazare-4922867/,2017-11-05,"Four days after the NGT order, the Jantar Mantar road, now cleared of debris and dissent, seems larger and quieter. Four days after the NGT order, the Jantar Mantar road, now cleared of debris and dissent, seems larger and quieter.With the NGT asking protesters to move out of Jantar Mantar, Aniruddha Ghosal tells the story of the tree-lined boulevard that for 24 years lent a space to anyone who wielded a placard and a cause  from a man fighting to prove he is alive to the 2011 Lokpal agitation that scripted a new political narrative.Last Thursday, Manohar Lal stopped hoping. His nearly 40-year battle for justice had ended, he had given up, he explained. Evicted from Jantar Mantar, the solo protester headed home to Dewas near Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Before leaving, he had dumped a few photocopies of pamphlets into a garbage bin at Jantar Mantar. It would have weighed me down, he says.The 60-year-olds protest began in 1978, when the small shoe factory he ran in Dewas was attacked by the management of a larger conglomerate. Extortion and violence allegedly followed, forcing him to give up the factory. A long legal battle saw him selling off almost everything he owned and he even ended up in jail. After he came out, in 2016, he headed to Jantar Mantar. When I came here, I realised that my experience was neither uncommon nor the worst. It was the most humbling experience to realise that there were so many people like me. It made me feel less alone. All of us wanted justice, wanted to be heard.On October 30, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned protests at Jantar Mantar, in the heart of New Delhi, after some residents of the area argued that they had to put up with noise pollution and unhygienic surroundings. The NGT found merit in their plea and asked authorities to shift the protesters to an alternative site  Ramlila Maidan, about 4 km away. The tribunal cited three grounds while issuing these directions  there is no executive order that demarcates Jantar Mantar as a protest site, that its marked as a residential area in the Delhi Master Plan and finally, that the agitations caused noise pollution.Supporters of the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement in 2011 that changed the political narrative. Supporters of the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement in 2011 that changed the political narrative.And so, on October 30, dissent lost a 24-year-old address. The proposed alternative, the 15-acre Ramlila Maidan, run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, usually lets out the ground for a fee  to one party at a time for Rs 50,000 a day  for big political rallies, religious functions and even weddings.Jantar Mantar, on the other hand, was the capitals Hyde Park, where all you needed was a cause, a placard and a voice. That is how some of the protests, big and small, came to be held on the lane abutting the 18th-century observatory  from 36-year-old Santosh Murat Singh, who has been fighting to be proved alive after being declared dead 12 years ago, to the 2011 Lokpal agitation led by Anna Hazare that shook the establishment of the day. The physical proximity of the site to Parliament  less than 2 km away  was crucial to its relevance. Some see a larger symbolism in the NGT ruling  that the establishment, by moving the protesters further away from the seat of power, was muffling the voice of protest.Four days after the NGT order, the Jantar Mantar road, now cleared of debris and dissent, seems larger and quieter. Still barricaded on both sides, it is only at lunch time that the roadside eateries, with the usual fare of dosas, idlis and chole bhature, see some queues. But these are orderly; dissent, if any, is restricted to the lack of seasoning.******The story of Jantar Mantar as a protest site began in 1993. There was no ordinance, no official declaration, yet the tree-lined boulevard that connects Tolstoy Road to the Ashoka Road roundabout came to be the only place in New Delhi where Section 144  the 19th-Century British-era law that prohibits the assembly of more than five people  was not imposed. That year, the capital got its new dissent square  Jantar Mantar.Until then, at a time when Delhi was still to expand its boundaries southwards and eastwards, it was the Boat Club, with its view of Janpath, Rajpath and Parliament, that was the iconic space for resistance. But with the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid movement gripping the country, the Congress-led government, already rattled by an earlier agitation in 1988, imposed a ban on gatherings at the Boat Club.Former PM Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee addresses an anti-price-rise rally at Boat Club in January 1989.The 1988 agitation had been led by western UP farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait. With five lakh farmers and their cows, Tikait had reportedly paralysed Delhi. After initially camping at Raj Ghat, they had moved to Boat Club and finally taken over the lawns of India Gate in their bullock carts, camping there for weeks.A police officer posted at that time at the Parliament Street police station said, The entire movement was a nightmare for us. Imagine Delhi, the way it used to be  quiet, far fewer cars New Delhi especially was pristine. Suddenly, there were cows and farmers everywhere.Tikaits organisation, the Bharatiya Kisan Union, was born from the spectacular success of that Boat Club rally, which had forced the Rajiv Gandhi government to accept his 35-point charter of demands.But after that, it became apparent to successive governments that the protest venue had to be controlled. Jantar Mantar seemed ideal at the time. Though it was close to Parliament, it was not large enough to hold a big crowd. Besides, the topography of Jantar Mantar, with its two main entry and exit points, was easier to manage.Initially a trickle and eventually a torrent, protesters began moving into Jantar Mantar. Having travelled hundreds of kilometres from home, Jantar Mantar was their home for as long as they had the spirit to fight. They came, hoping their stories would be heard - from a farmer reeling under debts after successive droughts, to women who had been raped, but had not found justice. Each of these stories shared a similar sentiment: We want to be heard, we matter.At Jantar Mantar, democracy and dissent shared a complicated relationship. While some protests fizzled out, others led to momentous shifts in political realities.On April 5, 2011, Anna Hazare, then a relatively unknown social activist from Maharashtra, began a hunger strike at Jantar Mantar to root out corruption and to demand a Lokpal Bill. The movement snowballed, with prominent activists such as Prashant Bhushan and Arvind Kejriwal joining in, finally leading to the birth of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Journalist-turned-AAP leader Ashutosh says, Boat Club was wide and vibrant, very different from Jantar Mantar. There was a lot of space. From one end you could see Rajpath and from the other, you could see Janpath. Jantar Mantar, on the other hand, is a much more closed space. But the proximity to Parliament, the seat of power, is much more symbolic at Jantar Mantar than at Boat Club. For years, Jantar Mantar was an essential training ground for young journalists  to see how democracy works and the ways in which it doesnt.Senior BJP leader Vijay Jolly, who began his political career as a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and served as president of the Delhi University Students Union from 1980-81, says that just as protests sites changed, so did the nature of protests. Today, with the advent of TV debates, political battles are no longer fought on the streets or college campuses. Instead, lung power is exerted on television debates. Now with WhatsApp and other social media tools, it is easy to get people to turn up for causes, he says, pointing out that parties such as the AAP mobilised their crowds at Jantar Mantar through some smart use of social media.Looking back to the times when he was younger and angrier, Jolly says, Back in 1977, I was able to protest at Patel Chowk and that is something thats impossible now for very important reasons. But in a democracy, protest is ones inherent right. A protest, by its very definition, is going to inconvenience some. But if you have to pay Rs 1 lakh at Ramlila Maidan to protest, it is just not right.Few know more about the political power that Jantar Mantar potentially possessed than the Congress. Their defeat in Delhi in 2013 was linked to the 2011 anti-corruption protests and the December 16 protests that began from Jantar Mantar and spilled onto the streets of India Gate. But the partys Ajay Maken says, Jantar Mantar is close to Parliament and that was important  one could say youre demonstrating outside Parliament. Now that has changed and that is simply undemocratic. Secondly, if NGT has raised the issue of noise pollution, wont it be an issue with Ramlila Maidan so close to GB Pant Hospital and LNJP hospital. And finally, the move is elitist youre not allowing common people to protest in Lutyens Delhi, keeping it free of the din of protests. Maken has been at the centre of several protests in Delhi, first as DUSU president in 1985 and then as the president of Delhi Transport Corporation Trade Union.Conservation architect Anisha Shekhar Mukherji, who has authored Jantar Mantar: Maharaja Sawai Jai Singhs Observatory in Delhi, says the decision to move out the protest site was reflective of the fragmentation of the city, reminiscent of how the British designed Imperial Delhi.Originally, the Jantar Mantar area was outside the city of Shahjahanabad (todays Old Delhi). In 1857, the area had served as a refuge for the inhabitants of Shahjahanabad, who had been turned out of the old city by the British. But when Lutyens was designing the new city, he actively ignored existing spaces and inhabitants  the new capital wasnt for common people. The same attitude continues today, she says, adding that the protests on the street outside were never an impediment to the historical structure. The only time in recent years that protesters entered the observatory was during a farmer rally in 2009, she says.Historian, activist and filmmaker Sohail Hashmi talks of how the space for protest shrunk even within Jantar Mantar. Back in 1993, we could hold protests at the triangular park between the monument and the road. I have participated in and organised several such protests. But they had to beautify the park, so they shifted the protesters to the road. Then they put up barricades, so the space shrank further, he says, adding, In the capital city of the worlds largest democracy, this was the last remaining site to air dissent. Such spaces exist in the heart of London, New York and Washington DC, but here, you close it down? For what? Because some rich people think that its too noisy?Not everyone agrees that the move to stop protests at Jantar Mantar is undemocratic. Back in 1993, when Jantar Mantar was designated the protest street, Ashish Sood was a fledgling politician and a former DUSU president. Now a BJP councillor with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, he recalls how the shift from Boat Club had triggered a similar debate.Earlier, protests would take place at a chowk on Akbar Road, then they moved to the Boat Club, and finally, they came to Jantar Mantar. When VP Singh was PM, I rode my scooter right up to his 7 Race Course Road residence to protest, at a time when the party was taking up the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi. Later, when I protested against the Bofors scam, I marched all the way from Jantar Mantar to Parliament. Now all that is unthinkable. But the population of Delhi then was a mere 25 lakh. Today, Delhi is growing at an incredible pace, and traffic and pollution are major concerns. The question that one needs to ask is whether protesting for ones rights can infringe on the rights of others, he says, adding, If the cause has substance, if it has the power to move people, the venue is irrelevant.Historian Narayani Gupta agrees, Its one thing to get nostalgic about Jantar Mantar, but one also has to be pragmatic and find a practical solution for a space to protest. The park outside Feroz Shah Kotla, for instance, can work.At least one person has already made plans for a protest. Tikaits son, Rakesh Tikait, wants to hold a farmers rally in Delhi at the end of November. The issues are almost identical as those his father raised in 1988. The lives of farmers have not improved Sugarcane prices need to be raised. In Uttarakhand, the BJP is in power, but farmers loans, payment of sugar mill arrears and declaration of the minimum support price are still big issues. We will hold a massive rally, but with Jantar Mantar closed, I will come next week and figure out where we can protest.Asked what he would do if the government doesnt give him a place to protest, he says, I will speak to the commissioner of police. They have to give us space. If they dont, they are basically saying that it is okay if farmers die.******For now, the Ramlila grounds, though hardly ever empty, rarely looks angry. On Wednesday morning, there are a few cars parked outside the ground, a few inside. Students from the nearby Zakir Hussain College use the ground as a short-cut to walk to the campus from Ajmeri Gate.Jivan Das, a farmer from Odisha who was protesting at Jantar Mantar, has come to inspect the new address for dissent in Delhi. He isnt impressed. There is nothing to eat here. Nothing to drink. There are no trees no shade. Its dusty and far louder than Jantar Mantar ever was. Who will come to listen to a lonely protester? No one.Its at night, however, that Ramlila Maidan looks a world apart from Jantar Mantar. Long after the office crowd, stray journalists and Metro commuters had thinned out, Jantar Mantar Road would take on another form  gas-stoves get lit and the aroma of different regional cuisines fill the air, while some of the protesters would head to nearby Gurdwara Bangla Sahib for langar. Later, blankets of varying degrees of wear and tear would appear and dissent would take a temporary break, only to come alive the next morning.The Ramlila Maidan, in contrast, is deserted at night. There are few lights inside and the road outside is lifeless. For now, dissent is yet to find its new address.Protests elsewhereMumbaiAzad Maidan is Mumbais address for dissent. Part of the ground is where Mumbais budding cricketers practise their craft. The Special Branch, the intelligence wing of the Mumbai Police, and an outpost of the Azad Maidan Police station, mark the entrance to the ground. They act as a channel between protesters and the governmentHyderabadFor years the citys version of Jantar Mantar was the Dharna Chowk at the Indira Park, located close to the state secretariat and Assembly. In May this year, however, the Telangana governments decision to bar protests at Indira Park and move the designated site to a spot on the outskirts of the city sparked clashes between Opposition parties and residents of colonies near the park. Six people were injured in the clashesChandigarh/JalandharThe Rally Ground in Chandigarh has been the hub of protests since 2010, when a rally at the earlier earmarked site, Matka Chowk, turned violent. In Jalandhar, the proximity of the protest hub, the Desh Bhagat Yaadgaar Hall, to the deputy commissioners office (500 metres away), where protests culminate, ensures the city is never shut down by protestersGuwahatiThe city has no legal space for protests as the Gauhati High Court has banned protests on the banks of the Dighalipukhuri, the traditional venue for dissent. While the court ordered the government to identify an alternative site, authorities have so far failed to do soChennaiThe space near the Valluvarkottam campus and a part of the road outside Chepauk stadium are usually allowed for protests, though only under strict police guidelines. But the city has no venue for sustained protests. In January, a gathering at Marina Beach of a dozen students, who were protesting against the Jallikattu ban, had emerged as a mass movementKolkataWith the shift of the secretariat from Writers Building to Nabanna, protests at the Benoy-Badal-Dinesh Bagh, formerly the Dalhousie Square, have stopped.

Sugar factories often set up distilleries for the production of liquor from the molasses generated in the process of producing sugar.Citing examples of the brands by some of the factories in western Maharashtra, the minister said the Satpuda factory should have named its liquor brand as Maharani instead of Maharaja. He said factories in Kolhapur and Sangli have named their liquor brands Julie, Bhingari and Bobby, and were doing good business.His comments drew sharp reaction from activists and the opposition. Social activist Paromita Goswami ,of NGO Shramik Elgar, filed a complaint against the minister in Mul Police station in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha. She demanded the case be registered under sections 504 and 509 of IPC for public provocation and insulting the modesty of women. The police are checking the legal standing of the complaint before registering it.Mahajan sought to control the damage, saying he would apologise for his first mistake in a political career spanning more than 25 years.It was a statement made in a lighter mood in response to the complaint by the factory members about poor sales. I have personally seen the response to the brands of the factories run by senior politicians such as Shankarrao Kale and Kolhe in western Maharashtra. Having said that, I admit it was an unintentional mistake and I should not have said it. I am issuing an apology tomorrow, Mahajan told HT.The womens wing of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) held a protest against Mahajan in Nashik and burnt his effigies. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also demanded an immediate apology by the minister.It represents the mindset of male politicians and the way they view women. It is a shameful statement in a progressive state like Maharashtra which has the legacy of Mahatma Phule and Chhatrapati Shahu Mahraj. Mahajan should immediately apologise for the statement, Pratibha Shinde, social activist from Nandurbar, said.Mahajan is no stranger to controversies. He had reportedly attended the wedding ceremony of a relative of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim earlier this year. He also invited criticism for attending a function meant for children with hearing and speech disabilities, with his revolver tucked at his waist, visible to everyone."
5a52fac39855b770e037c42f,Packaging ideas to take them home,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/641221/packaging-ideas-take-them-home.html,2017-11-05,"Hrithik Kiran Bagade, Bengaluru, DH News Service, Nov 7 2017, 16:55 ISTGoing grocery-shopping with a big shopping list and you find spices, mixes, teas, coffees, oils, beverages, ingredients et al wrapped, packed and sealed in safe, elaborate containers, bottlers, boxes and packets, waiting to be consumed. Behind the moment of being able to use the grocery shopping list, is the thought of 'how did all those products reach the store in the first place, and then, how were they able to be taken home'?The answer sits firmly packaged in one of the most important, yet working-in-the-background sort of industries  Packaging. And Manjusjree Technopack is a packaging household name today, with innovations in the plastic packaging space, which is the driving force of how food, beverage, and other home FMCG companies seamlessly position, sell and supply their products today.Way back in 1983, then Assam-based Manjushree Technopack set out producing flexible plastic packaging for the tea industry in Eastern India, supplying pouches, bags and other products. In 1994, it purchased a unit in Bengaluru.""A thought occurred to me: Why not, we expand out of Assam?"" reminisces Vimal Kedia, the Founder and Managing Director of Manjushree Technopack.""We had a plan to work in the plastic PET bottle space. We went around government departments, and met stakeholders to understand the market. We set up this facility totally new. We thought this is a good area for PET bottles, because all the Southern states are industrialised, with high literacy rate and per capita income, resulting in greater spending power. Bengaluru is where logistics works out very well, because of its proximity to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra. If you cover all of South India, 60% of consumption is covered,"" he tells DH.Manjushree's first facility in Bengaluru came up at Bommasandra, which also came to house a unique packaging heritage museum, exhibiting over 80 years of packaging.The PET at homePET or Polyethylene Terephthalate is one the greatest innovations in the packaging space, let alone plastic packaging. Over 20 years ago, PET bottles were not in vogue. When this innovation arrived in India, women were easily attracted to it because they could reuse the wide-mouthed PET jars, for keeping masalas, groceries, sugar, tea powder, salt, spices, and so on. Earlier, glass jars and tin cans were used. PET bottles are easy to handle, no breakage if dropped, and come in handy with the purchase of most items for the home and kitchen.""Initially, we would send PET consignments of tea packaging by train all the way to Eastern India, because the demand was huge, with limited players,"" Kedia says.Explaining the science behind PET packaging, with tea as an example, he says: ""In tea, only 100 gm, 250 gm, 500 gm, and 1 kg are popular sizes in India. The 250 gm tea packs constitute 60% of sales, either in pouch or PET containers, 25% are from 500 gm, while the balance is between 100 gm and 1 kg. The science here involves knowing popular sizes and what should be the volume by density. Tea will require a particular size of capacity to pack. In the same way, oil requires different sizing. A 250 gm tea pack requires a 750 ml jar, but to pack 250 ml oil or water, one requires a 250 ml bottle.""A second factory came up in 2003, which merged its earlier factory within itself, setting up unified operations. As business expanded, Manjushree acquired land in the Bidadi Industrial Area and opened a large factory to manufacture preforms for cola and bottling industries, owing to high tonnage  Every day, that facility produces about 250 tonnes, while Bommasandra makes only 50 tonnes. Production level has risen to an annual output of four billion units of PET preforms, bottles and containers, which corresponds to 15% share in the overall Indian PET market.""We moved up with all the industries, and our uniqueness was in service, quality and design. We invested in technologies and innovations, understanding customers' ideas. We imported bottle-blowing machines from Japan, preform machines from Canada, film machines from Germany, and multi-layer technologies from Italy, so as to never compromise on quality. The main crux here is reliability and integrity. If I get an order, which I don't deliver on time, my customer's factory will shut down. And if his product is out of the market for even one week, someone else will take over,"" Kedia says.Industry mantraPackaging has two formats: Flexible (wrappers), which is economical and cheap; and Rigid, which can be held in hand and is reclosable. General merchandise in India is packed in cheaper flexible packs, against expensive rigid packaging. Premium products like shampoos, cosmetics, and colas, are packed in rigid bottles, which are convenient to use, carry, refrigerate, and reuse.Today, Manjushree is one of the largest manufacturers of 'anything in rigid packaging', supplying to a mega host of customers and industries. The company caters to 12 sectors including food and beverage, edible oil, alcobev, dairy, personal care, and home care, among others.Last year, Manjushree acquired rival Varahi, emerging as a pan-India company  with seven operational plants in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam, with a total annual manufacturing capacity rising to 1,25,000 MT. Today, the company's clients, who number around 200, include Patanjali, Dabur, SC Johnson, Marico, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Reckitt-Benckiser, Mondelez, and many others. It also exports to 10 countries.""Totally, we have over 1,000 designs from 5-ml containers to 20-litre potable water bottles. We can manufacture any size for any industry. We are capable of making bottles for any product, be it acidic, processed food, or dry product, as we even have moisture and oxygen barriers. Besides PET, we work with Low-density polyethylene (LDP), High-density polyethylene (HDP), Polypropylene, LED bulbs made of Polycarbonate, and Polystyrene,"" Kedia says.Plastic perilIndia's plastic packaging industry, which is largely unorganised, is expected to reach $73 billion by 2020, at 18% CAGR, according to a report by FICCI and Tata Strategic Management Group, which also states that the size of the industry in India today is at $32 billion, constituting only 4% of the global packaging industry.The largest consumer of plastic products is the beverage space at 40% in India (global is 60%), led by colas, followed by liquor (10%), pharmaceuticals (8%), and then other health supplements, and miscellaneous products.With plastic comes the question of its inherent threat to the biosphere and its unfortunate ability to degenerate the environment, if not treated or disposed of properly.""The biggest challenge is plastic mismanagement. The government has come out with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, which specifies producers' responsibilities. Even citizens must be disciplined enough to dispose of plastic in a separate bin, lest we all continue to suffer,"" Kedia, who is also the President of PET Association for Clean Environment, says, adding that awareness and stringent punishment is needed.Manjushree is carrying out R&D on biodegradable plastics, which isn't in much use, owing to its high cost. ""It has to be produced from plants  sugarcane to molasses, from which Monoethylene glycol has to be sourced. Biodegradable plastic doesn't fulfill requirements of all industries,"" he says.A way out would be to reduce the weight of a plastic bottle or container, and also using recycled plastic. ""We look at new designs through our dedicated design studio, on how to reduce weight and plastic use. By this, the customer reduces his packaging costs, and it is our objective to reduce plastic usage every year,"" he adds.Till date, Manjushree Technopack has invested over Rs 500 crore. Last year, it logged a turnover of Rs 650 crore, and will close this year at Rs 850 crore, a growth of 30%. ""We eye Rs 1,000 crore in turnover by 2019,"" concludes Kedia."
5a1549869855b76bf13ecf0a,Network issues scuttle cashless drive in this Maharashtra village,http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5mhB4pa4UP2O9aQ1aA2mJ/Demonetisation-anniversary-Network-issues-scuttle-cashless.html,2017-11-06,"A resident of Maharashtras Dhasai village counts the cash he withdrew from a an e-kiosk. Photos: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintDhasai (Maharashtra): Anant Bhoir, a 46-year-old farmer from Dhasai village in Maharashtras Thane district, opened an account with Bank of Baroda four months ago just so he has a backup option to his Vijaya Bank account. Plus, he was super excited at the prospect of using his ATM card at the smart-looking Bank of Baroda Express kiosk inaugurated in June by veteran anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare.On 2 November, when Bhoir went to the kiosk to check his savings account balance, it said: Transaction not allowed. This has been the refrain these past four months. He has learnt from experience that the same internet service provider serves both the Vijaya Bank branch and Bank of Baroda kioskstate-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd or BSNL.So what does he do? He goes back to Vijaya Bank, fills up a withdrawal slip, takes a token, and awaits his turn in the queue.At the banks Dhasai branch, officer Ravi Gaikwad is used to negotiating long queues of account holders like Bhoir. BSNL internet is down as usual. If you go to the BSNL office, you wont find a soul there who can attend to these daily complaints. The story about cashless Dhasai is for all to see here, Gaikwad says.Dhasai went cashless on 1 December last year amid much fanfare in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modis 8 November demonetisation announcement. Today it is back to its old ways of dealing in cash.Back in December 2016, even a roadside shack selling snacks boasted of an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) machine that Bank of Baroda distributed free of charge then. In fact, the bank gave away 50 such EDC machines in the village.The machine has not been used for more than two months now. People give cash because they have cash now. Why would people want to swipe a card when they have cash and when they know that the machine wont work because network is down, asks shack owner Vijay Sukose, who got an EDC.Salman Sayyad, who runs a meat shop, says his machine has gone for repairs. Soon after notebandi (withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1000 currency notes), 70% of my sales were executed on the machine. But its usage dropped to 15% by August when it developed snag, he says.A resident of Dhasai pays his electricity bill in cash at Maharashtra State Electricity Board counter.Sayyad adds that the idea of going cashless will work only if all agenciesBSNL most prominent among themwork towards it.Dhasai sums up the quintessential Indian way of doing things with great fanfare only to undo them later. If in December 2016 it enthusiastically joined Modis cashless and digital drive and attracted nationwide attention, a year later the exercise hardly merits mention.According to Ranjit Savarkar, chairman of the Maharashtra Military School near Dhasai and the main agent of change last year, It is like keeping the milk container on the stove and then stepping out to buy tea and sugar. Things have fallen apart because the right sequence has not been followed. Last year when the government was keen to showcase Dhasai as a cashless village, I told them to put in place a system first so that other things follow as a logical corollary. But that has not been done for a variety of reasons.Savarkar believes the Dhasai story has not turned out the way it should have because of the dearth of imagination on the part of banks and government agencies like BSNL as well as the absence of follow-up action.They can still redeem the situation by issuing as many debit cards as the number of applicants. Debit cards will enable not only Dhasai residents but tribals who live in 60 hamlets around Dhasai to access the Bhim app. And for Bhim to run efficiently, they must provide wi-fi at least in select locations, Savarkar says.Bhim or Bharat Interface for Money app, launched on 30 December last year, enables users to send and receive money over the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.He proceeds to transfer a small amount to grocery shop owner Swapnil Patkars account using the Bhim app. Both Savarkar and Patkar run the app using their mobile data network.Mobile data does not work in interior parts and that is why wi-fi should be provided. Imagine a tribal woman getting the remuneration for the forest produce she sells directly deposited into her account. That will give her access to her money which, if given in cash to her husband, mostly gets wasted in drinks. Give her a debit card and access to Bhim app and she would be on her own, says Savarkar, who thinks some smaller policy interventions like these and a concerted technological push could permanently make Dhasai a cashless but also help nearby hamlets use digital transaction.Patkar, president of Dhasais retail merchants association, says 60 of the retail establishments had been issued EDC machines. But very few are using them now. The real culprit is the network problem. BSNL only has to only extend the broadband cable 3km from nearby Umroli village but that has not been done for two years now, he says.It is like keeping the milk container on the stove and then stepping out to buy tea and sugar. Things have fallen apart because the right sequence has not been followed. - Ranjit Savarkar, chairman of the Maharashtra Military School near Dhasai.Ashok Warghade, branch manager of Thane District Central Cooperative Bank, says the network issue should have been sorted out to ensure Dhasai consolidated the gains it made during the initial months of demonetisation. Of our 27,000 account holders who are from nearby villages, 2,500 have ATM cards. We have also issued 3,000 RuPay cards. But due to network problems and availability of cash, people dont tend to use ATM cards. Also, there has there been no rise in the number of applications for debit cards, he says.Dhasai resident Rajendra Joshi mocks the villages cashless tag, saying it was true just for the month of December. Government agencies and people who are at the forefront of this initiative are well aware of all the problems.Network problem also predates demonetisation. But at least after the village was declared cashless, all agencies and elected representatives should have worked together to address the problems and ready Dhasai for digital transactions. But nothing has been done by way of follow-up and things have gone back to their default setting, he says.Savarkar, who remains hopeful that the cashless dream can be realized, says all the training and awareness that locals carried out in schools on cashless transactions will go to waste if students are not kept invested in the project. Now, banks come up with all sorts of rules... That students cannot be given debit cards and so on. What use is mere theory if students are not allowed the practicals, he asks, standing in front of a poster from 2016 which hails Dhasai as Rokhmukt gaav (cash-free village)."

If you name your liquor as maharaja, who will buy it. If you use maharani, then see. Liquors are generally named as Bobby, Julie. This is how it is marketed, Mahajan had said at a programme at a sugar factory in Nandurbar district on Saturday.Goswami, who runs NGO Shramik Elgar working for tribals and women, filed a complaint against Mahajan at Mul police station in Chandrapur district on Sunday, seeking action against the minister. The police have sent the complaint to Government Pleader to check the legal aspect. I feel it should attract Sections 504 and 509 of IPC for public provocation and contempt for women respectively, Goswami told The Indian Express.Later at a press conference at Chandrapur, Goswami said, When, as minister, he should be trying to take the state on the path of prohibition as mandated by the Constitution, he is teaching people marketing tactics and that too in a misogynistic way by openly suggesting that a liquor should be named after womens names. He is not fit to be a minister and must be immediately removed from the position.When told that the minister said it in lighter vein, Goswami said, then it is all the more serious. If he wants to be a stand-up comedian, he should quit and do it. She also asked if Mahajan had ever thought of visiting Chandrapur to see how the farmers are distressed in the absence of water.If you want alcohol or any other things demand to rise,name it after a woman & see how the demand soars says Maharashtra Min Girish Mahajan pic.twitter.com/fEqy64vDzu  ANI (@ANI) November 5, 2017He is the Minister for Water Resources. Chandrapur district water reservoirs have only 25 per cent water left in them and the paddy farmers are burning their crop. Is he aware of this reality? Has he ever thought of visiting here and see what he could do for them, Goswami asked, adding, I appeal to the women of Jamner, from where he was elected, to defeat him in the elections next time.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

If someone has said that I must have by now come back to my senses, then let me tell all that I have no addiction. I do not even drink tea.

It was a mistake I made while talking in a completely different background, and in a lighter vein. I did not intend to insult women. I tender my apology for the statement, he said.The fact remains, however, that most local liquor brands doing good business are named after women, Mahajan said, adding that the purpose of his statement was to highlight the fact that the naming convention is insulting. There is a need to consider changing the names of these brands. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis may take a decision if a request is made to him, he said.Mahajan kicked off a row while inaugurating the sugarcane crushing season at Satpuda sugar factory in Nandurbar on Saturday when he advised the factory to name its liquor brand after women as it would earn better.Citing examples of the brands owned by companies in western Maharashtra, the minister said the factory should have named its liquor brand Maharani instead of Maharaja. He pointed out that factories in Kolhapur and Sangli have given their liquor brands names such as Julie, Bhingari and Bobby, and are doing good business.Even tobacco brands with names such as Vimal and Kesar are selling well, Mahajan added.The statement drew a sharp reaction from women activists and Opposition parties, both of whom strongly condemned the comment and insisted that Mahajan apologise.Social activist Paromita Goswami of NGO Shramik Elgar filed a complaint against the minister in Mul police station in Chandrapur district, Vidarbha. She has demanded that a case be registered under sections 504 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code, for public provocation and insulting the modesty of women.This is not the first time that Mahajan has got embroiled in a controversy.

The licence to sell local liquor could be cancelled if majority women of a particular village passed a resolution against it, the Sena noted, wondering whether Mahajan was aware of such a movement.""You (Mahajan) may not be able to talk against liquor because of its heavy revenue generation (for the state) but (the minister) should avoid giving out such marketing tips,"" the Sena said.""It seems that Mahajan himself is charged up to increase the sale of liquor, which could be because of dropping revenue figures,"" it said.The Sena also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulating Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the decision to prohibit consumption, stocking and sale of liquor in his state.The ruling alliance partner said it was thankful to the Maharashtra government for not having a ministry for cemetery.If Mahajan headed such a ministry, he might have issued an advisory to increase deaths to boost the sale of items required for last rites, the Sena quipped.Mahajan had said at the event in Nandurbar, ""As I was discussing the mill's issues with the management, I came to know that liquor sales are not picking up. I visited some of the major producers of liquor brands having names such as 'Bhingri', 'Bobby' and 'Julie', whereas this mill's brand name is 'Maharaja', how will it work.""

The private doctors association has called for a Belagavi Chalo agitation against the State governments attempts to monitor pricing in private hospitals for services offered.Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Hasiru Sene and State Sugarcane Growers Association have also plans to lay a siege to the Suvarna Soudha in support of their various demands, including remunerative prices for farm produce and payment of arrears by sugar factories.

About 37 years ago, a cooperative sugar factory named Bhimashankar Sugar Factory was planned in Indi taluk in which over 16,000 sugarcane farmers had invested, but owing to political interference, the factory could never become a reality. The farmers who had invested in the factory, which was supposed to come up in 181 acre land, had lost all hopes, but today their hopes have rejuvenated, he said.The man behind turning this almost impossible task into a reality is Congress MLA of Indi taluk, Yeshwantraigouda Patil. Mr. Patil had promised in the last assembly election that he would retire from politics if he does not get the factory established.Thanking Mr. Siddaramaiah for granting all approval and financial aid of Rs. 39 crore, he claimed that no single cooperative factory of the State has ever received so much financial aid from the government.After the governments help, we also borrowed loan from various banks, and with the total amount of Rs. 156 crore, the factory work was started. Today, in less than five years, the factory is completely built and ready for inauguration, Mr. Patil said.He said that with the crushing capacity of 3,000 to 5,500 tonnes, the factory will also generate 14 MW of power which will be sold to KPTCL at an estimated Rs. 5.61 per unit. This money will help us in clearing the bills of farmers who supply sugarcane to us, he said.He said that the factory will help farmers of Indi taluk who cultivate around 6 lakh tonnes of sugarcane.The factory will also save transportation cost as earlier, the farmers had to take their commodity to factories in Maharashtra. Now, they have the factory within 20 kilometre radius, Mr. Patil said."

So, it is in great demand across the country.The market was set up exclusively for trading tender coconuts, to dispatch the produce to Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, New Delhi, Rajasthan, Kolkata and other states.According to sources, the transaction was Rs 137 crore in the year 2015-16 and had sold 18 crore tender coconuts. In 2016-17, which is said to be a year of drought, a transaction of Rs 100 crore has already been recorded and in 2012-13, the transaction was Rs 96 crore. With a steady rise in transactions, it has turned into a lifeline for the farmers, traders, and workers.Raitha Sangha leader K Boraiah said, the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir did not reach its maximum level since two years and MySugar factory had suspended operations. ""Farmers, who had grown sugar cane, paddy, and other crops, faced huge loss and hundreds of them ended their lives unable to repay the mounting debts. But it was the Maddur's tender coconut market that saved the farmers,"" he said.TradingAround 90% of the business is completed at the coconut farm as the prospective buyers book the produce and harvest them. Later, they are transported to various states. This spares them the transportation cost. Only 10% of the farmers bring their produce to the market for sale.Maddur APMC has given license to 150 traders. More than 600 labourers are working at the market.Speaking to DH, APMC Secretary B Srikantaprabhu said, around 15.5 lakh tender coconuts arrived at the market on a single day on March 16, 2015. Sub-markets have been established at KR Pet and Gudigere in Maddur taluk. Even after 30% of the produce is diverted there, Maddur market still makes record transactions, he said.Private companiesMany private companies have set up their units in the taluk, which process the tender coconut and sell them in bottles. This has created a demand for tender coconuts. 'Coco Jal', a tender coconut water brand, processed and bottled by a private company at the Gejjalagere Industrial area, has become popular at Bengaluru International Airport, Srikantaprabhu said."
5a420d9a9855b7256d1b6687,Maharashtra moves to protect its farmers from suffering losses due to rigged we...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-moves-to-protect-its-farmers-from-suffering-losses-due-to-rigged-weighbridges/story-O6FVqkXmqQJWh445YYaqmN.html,2017-11-11,"In a move aimed at protecting lakhs of farmers in Maharashtra who suffer losses when selling crops to traders or industrial units on account of faulty or rigged weighbridges, the states Legal Metrology Department (LMD) has issued a circular making it mandatory that new digital weighbridges be checked thoroughly and certified before they are put to use.The step comes in the wake of the petrol pump scam, which was busted in June, wherein hundreds of pumps were found dispensing less fuel than displayed on the machine through illegal installation of electronic chips.Similar unfair practices by weighbridge operators cannot be ruled out, said Amitabh Gupta, controller, LMD.At least 8,300 weighbridges are already in operation across the state, and thousands more are waiting for licence.The circular, issued on November 8, asks operators of digital weighbridges that have the capacity to weigh vehicles (or goods carriers) with cargo of five tonnes and more to submit a detailed form before the machine is calibrated. The operator has to make several declarations in the form, including the version of software used in the machine and whether theres provision for auxiliary fitting or computer interface in the set-up.The circular will be applicable for all units that will be calibrated after November 15. Vendors [of the software and other parts of the machine] will also have to make a declaration of accuracy, Gupta said, adding that the particulars in the declarations will be scrutinised during the machines annual audit.Under the current practice, after a weighbridge is installed, its calibration is checked by using authorised weights. The operator is then issued a certificate after this verification process. Again, during the annual audit, the weights are used to check the machines calibration. The old practice is similar to the audit process applied at petrol pumps earlier. But the petrol pump scam brought to notice the possibility of manipulation of the digital machine, Gupta said. Unless every component of digital weighbridges is thoroughly checked, it will be difficult to ascertain if it has been rigged.For the 8,300 weighbridges already in operation, sources said the LMD would issue a circular next week to bring them under a similar declaration and audit regime. To begin with, weighbridges at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, sugarcane markets and cotton gins would be brought under the ambit of the circular. These are the places where the bulk of farmers produce in the state is weighed and sold. It is extremely important to rule out manipulation of weighbridges as it has direct bearing on rural economy, Gupta said.Many of these weighbridges have got licences decades ago, and the switch to digital systems has been made without any authority authenticating the components used in them. Considering that every day thousands of trucks carrying farm products are weighed at these places, a few kilograms of manipulation in each truck would mean a colossal gain to the traders and middlemen, at the peril of the farmers, Gupta said."

Last years monsoon recovery raised hopes of a production rebound in the new season, beginning October 2017.Sugarcane growers in Maharashtra are set to get the second instalment payment within the next month. This comes after the Cane Control Board (CCB) sealed the payments as per the revenue sharing formula, and farmers will gain Rs 96.56 crores as per the calculations.The cane season of 2016-17 was the first when Maharashtra paid growers as per the revenue sharing formula of the C Rangarajan Committee. The panel had recommended sharing of revenue between growers and millers in the 70:30 ratio. Mills in the state had, however, paid more than the fair and remunerative price (FRP) last season as paucity of sugarcane had triggered a price war. The CCB has representatives of millers and growers and gives the final nod to the calculation according to the formula.Sambhaji Kadu Patil, the commissioner, sugar, said the total FRP payment due to the growers was Rs 8,307.40 crores. The payment amounted to Rs 8,614.76 crores as per the revenue sharing formula, he added. Mills in the state had already paid Rs 10,287.80 crores. Kadu Patil stated that of the 150 mills that had taken part in crushing last year, 112 had complied with the formula while the rest are yet to comply, he said. These mills have been given a month to pay the excess Rs 96.50 crores to the growers.After a resolution was reached regarding the first instalment between growers and millers, sugar mills in the state have commenced crushing in full force. More than 81 mills started operations with mills in western Maharashtra taking a lead. The commissionerate has initiated the online issuance of crushing licences from this season and till date, around 140 licences have been issued. Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, the Vice-President of the Maharashtra Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, said barring six mills in Hingoli and Nanded, no mills have faced any issue regarding water availability. The quality of cane this year is good, in terms of weight and quality, he said. The state is set to see a production of over 72 lakh tonnes of sugar this season.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0cb93b9855b76bf13cfa32,Vidarbha pesticide deaths: Probe panel may file report this week,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/YtxwY9FhCdap9ra8aBWx4J/Vidarbha-pesticide-deaths-Probe-panel-may-file-report-this.html,2017-11-13,"Since July, over 40 cotton farmers and labourers have died in Vidarbha, 21 of them in Yavatmal district alone, reportedly of pesticide poisoning. Photo: MintMumbai: The deaths of over 40 farmers and farm workers in Maharashtras Vidarbha region since July has put the spotlight on the abuse of pesticides and lack of protection for those spraying them, even as a committee investigating the case prepares to submit its findings this week.A seven-member special investigation team (SIT) formed by the Maharashtra government to find the cause of farm deaths is likely to submit its report this week, a member of the SIT, who did not want to be named told Mint. The panel was set up on 13 October and given three weeks to complete the investigation. The SIT member cited above said the team has met all stakeholders and nearly completed its probe.Meanwhile, the SIT has come under pressure from two broad sections of stakeholders. Pesticide poisoning deaths have triggered a bitter battle between farm activists, environmentalists, non-government organizations, and advocates of organic farming on the one side and pesticide companies and some sector experts on the other. The activists have held pesticide companies and also genetically modified (GM) Bt cotton seeds including illegally sold herbicide tolerant (HT) seeds responsible for the spate of pesticide poisoning cases. But pesticide companies and experts have cautioned the SIT against arriving at populist conclusions not based on scientific data.Maharashtra has the largest area under cotton cultivation in India4.1 million hectares on averageand Yavatmal district alone has the largest area under cotton cultivation in India4.5 lakh hectares on average. Vidarbha alone accounts for 1.6 million hectares under cotton.Vidarbha and Marathwada alone account for 65% of cotton cultivation in Maharashtra, said a senior official from the Pune-based directorate of agriculture. In the 2017 kharif season, both Maharashtra and Yavatmal districts saw larger than average area come under cotton cultivationmore than 4.2 million hectares in Maharashtra and 4.70 lakh hectares in Yavatmal district, according to the directorate of agriculture. There has been a significant increase in cotton cultivation this season. In the 2016 kharif season, cotton was grown in 3.8 million hectares in Maharashtra because farmers moved towards pulses, especially tur (black pigeon). But since farmers did not get a good remunerative price for tur, they moved back to cotton this year, the official said.Since July this year, more than 40 cotton farmers and farm labourers have died in Vidarbha, 21 of them in Yavatmal district alone, reportedly of pesticide poisoning. At one point in September, more than 800 persons were being treated at different government hospitals in Yavatmal district for pesticide inhalation and poisoning. Farmers and farm workers Mint spoke to in Yavatmal district said less-than normal rainfall, extreme humidity, abnormally high growth of cotton plants, and intense infestation of pink bollworm which forced farmers to resort to higher-than-normal spraying of pesticides and use of different concoctions, were the primary causes.A team of scientists from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) undertook ground surveys in September to find out the reasons for pesticide deaths and came out with a report on 20 October. The report maintains that the majority of the poisoning cases were associated with the use of insecticides like Monocrotophos, Profenophos, Cypermethrin, Fipronil, Imidacloprid and Diafenthiuron. Monocrotophos, the report claims, is the most commonly used insecticide in combination with other insecticides and growth regulators.Monocrotophos stimulates growth and has a greening effect on plant. Use of Monocrotophos has been banned on vegetables in India. However, its use on crops like cotton, paddy, maize, pulses, sugarcane, coconut, coffee, etc., is still allowed keeping in view of its bio-efficacy and cost-effectiveness. According to the World Health Organisation-Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification 2009, Monocrotophos is categorized as Class 1b (Highly hazardous), the CICR report says. Similarly, Diafenthiuron has been classified as a slightly hazardous insecticide (Class III).The CICR report also pointed to lack of protective gear while spraying pesticides; prolonged and frequent direct exposure to insecticides; humid climate during September with day temperatures 20 degrees higher than normal and which induced profuse sweating that facilitated absorption of pesticides through skin; abnormally high growth of cotton plants up to 5-6 feet (1-and-a-half feet taller than the normal height) which forced farmers to direct the sprays above their shoulder height and increased the chances of contact and inhalation of pesticide directly and in higher quantity.Sachin Kathale, a 31-year-old farmer at Kalamb in Yavatmal district, demonstrated in his farm how factors like extreme humidity, lack of protective gear, abnormal height of cotton plants, intense infestation, and depleting resistance of Bollgard II Bt cotton seeds caused poisoning. I myself felt dizzy after I mixed the pesticide with water. I immediately ran under tree shade and rested till I felt better. But farmers and farm workers who suffered more serious inhalation probably did not take precautions and sprayed the pesticide in extreme heat and against the direction of the wind, Kathale said.He said the intensity of the pink bollworm attack this season was unprecedented. I have been growing Bollgard II Bt seeds for the last eight years but never experienced this scale of pink bollworm attack. So, I too did four rounds of spraying, which I have never done before. Obviously, the Bollgard II seeds are losing their resistance to pest attacks, he said.C.D. Mayee, chairman of the Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC) and former CICR director, said it was clear that pesticide alone could not cause such heavy tragedy and that it was a result of multiple factors. Why has it been so rampant only in Yavatmal when there are several other areas of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and even North India where much more spraying is being undertaken by cotton farmers? Let us compare grape or apple plantation sprays. In grapes, on an average, nearly 47 sprays are given but we have not heard any such tragedy. In brinjal in Bengal and Odisha, on an average, 50 sprays are given to control fruit and shoot borer but rarely such tragedy is noticed. The tragedy is the culmination of contractual spraying methods where the same person daily undertakes spraying from morning till evening without any protection mixing incompatible chemicals, lack of protective apparatus while spraying, fog type droplets remaining in air in colloidal state which could get inhaled, and chewing tobacco or drinking water or liquid without washing hands, could expose inner parts to the chemical reactions, Mayee said in an emailed response.A fact-finding team formed by the Delhi-based Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) studied the pesticide deaths and came up with a report that blamed, among other things, lack of regulation over use of pesticides and GM seeds including the illegal HT seeds. Farmers and their use of hazardous technologies is getting more and more desperate in the countrythis is apparent with pesticides and GM seeds and the rampant misuse, with regulators and others turning a blind eye to the unfolding problems. It is clear that end use regulation is not going to be possible since there is no existing mechanism or possible mechanism by which the use of the pesticide by the buyer, after the product leaves the retailer, can be monitored and regulated. The fact-finding team can clearly anticipate chronic health and environmental problems that are bound to emerge sooner or later, especially with the illegal use of herbicide tolerant GM cotton, the report said. The team demanded that the government ban all those pesticides involved in the poisoning cases as well as those pesticides that have been banned elsewhere. The report also demanded that the Maharashtra government revoke licences of sales of these pesticides in the state without waiting for a decision on their prohibition from the government of India.In its submission to the SIT, the Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI), the apex trade body for Indian crop protection industry, has claimed that there is no causal link between pesticide application and alleged deaths reported from Yavatmal district nor is there any observed co-relation between the two. The news that the deaths were caused by occupational exposure to certain pesticides application appear to be motivated rumours spread by foreign-funded activist NGOs subtly exploiting the public suspicion about chemicals and pesticides. Their ultimate agenda is to tarnish the image of Indian cotton as per the dictates of their donors, the CCFI said in its submission to the SIT."

It changes the surface chemistry of the active particles (chemicals) automatically. If proper safety is not taken, it will have a lot of bad effects on humans and the entire surrounding ecosystem (due to a higher presence of chemicals), explained Rajkumar Bollem, an operations manager for a private company.Bollem, who belongs to the Prakasam district and works in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, claimed that 39 farmers in Maharashtra had recently died due to this problem. That was the official number, but unofficially, it was about 200. There also needs to be a policy regulating drones that spray pesticides, he told Mint on the sidelines of the event.Taking note, Naidu said there was a need for regulating automated sprays and also drone usage. He added that his government would also look into the other matters presented to him by farmers during the interaction.We will even give more preference to farmers than industries. More youth should become agri(cultural) entrepreneurs and not just entrepreneurs, he said, addressing farmers at the interaction. Naidu also said his government would provide all the resources required by the agriculture sector without any restraint.J.B. Appa Rao, a former employee of Andhra Pradesh Grameen Bank who took to farming post retirement, said one of the major challenges in the agriculture sector is getting back equal or more returns than the money invested in farming. Untimely rains only add to the problem, he added.This year I have opted for a new variety of sugar-free rice that was introduced last year. Earlier we used to go for traditional varieties of farming, Rao said.P.

Suicides and accidents are the other leading causes of deaths. In fact, the State stands fourth in the country in the number of suicides. On the brighter side, life expectancy has improved from 58.4 years for females in 1990 to 71.9 years in 2016. Among males, it has increased from 57.7 to 67.3.The data is revealed in the report titled - India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative (ISLDBI)- released by the Central Government on Tuesday. As per the report, which was painstakingly compiled by the ISLDBI - a collaboration between the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, and experts and stakeholders from close to 100 institutions across India, the DALY rate for Ischaemic heart disease is the highest in Punjab and Tamil Nadu, followed by Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. DALY stands for Disability-Adjusted Life years, that is, years of healthy life lost to premature death and suffering. DALYs are the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability.If in 1990, a tenth of the deaths was caused by a group of risks including unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and overweight, which mainly contribute to ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, the contribution of this group increased massively to a quarter of the total disease burden in India in 2016. The combination of these risks is the highest in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra in 2016.

Reason: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis visited Shivaji Park to pay homage to Sena founder, the late Bal Thackeray, and later in a closed-door meeting with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday.The last time the two leaders were together at a public function was at the launch of NCP leader Praful Patels pictorial biography in May 2017.Thackeray is unlikely to campaign for the Sena candidates in the Gujarat Assembly polls or send top leaders of the party for this. Significantly, Thackeray also refused to comment on the police firing on agitating sugarcane farmers in Ahmednagar, in which two farmers were injured.On the fifth death anniversary of the Sena founder, Fadnavis visited his memorial at Shivaji Park and later launched a website for a new Bal Thackeray memorial, which is planned at the mayors bungalow. He followed this up with a 30-minute meeting with Thackeray.There were speculations that the two leaders discussed the Senas objection to former chief minister Narayan Ranes entry to the state cabinet as the BJPs ally. While there was no official word on what transpired at the meeting, Thackeray seemed to have softened his stance a bit.He said no decision has been taken as yet on his visit to Gujarat for campaigning.Read moreFollowing the meeting with Fadnavis, Thackeray was asked by a group of reporters whether he would address a rally in Gujarat, he said, It is not decided yet, but if I do, you will say that being in the NDA, we are campaigning against the government.He also refused to take any stand on the recent firing incident on farmers in Shegaon, Ahmednagar district. Interestingly, the party has taken a pro-farmer stance in the past few months and has demanded a loan waiver from the BJP-led government and even staged walk-outs in the state Assembly on the issue. Another indicator of the renewed stance is that the Sena has decided it wont field a candidate against the BJP for a Mumbai civic body by-poll in Kandivli. The gesture from Thackeray came at a time when both parties are trying to wrest control over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Will this truce last long? Nobody in the ruling alliance can guarantee this.The Sena is going to contest around 60 seats in Gujarat where the polls are slated on December 9 and December 14. Last week, it had planned to take key leaders and even its ministers in the state government to campaign in the neighbouring state.A senior Sena leader, who is involved in poll planning, said they are currently evaluating candidates in the state and would soon put out a list of the candidates. According to the leader, the party does not have a strong base in Gujarat. We are still evaluating the list of people we can field. The Sena as a party does not have a strong base there. So electorally and politically we dont stand to gain much from the election, the senior leader told HT.Fadnavis said the process of handing over the land for a memorial was in the last stages. Once the process is completed, the plot will be handed over to the Shiv Sena Pramukh Balasaheb Thackeray Memorial Trust. The government is making all efforts to clear it as a priority,he said.The Sena also handed over cheque of Rs2 crore for the CMs Farmer Relief Fund to Fadnavis.

Express Bhagwant Mapari with the children of his brother Uddhav. ExpressA day after two farmers were injured in police firing during an agitation by sugarcane growers, an uneasy calm hangs over Telwadi village in Paithan taluka of Aurangabad. At Uddhav Vikram Maparis house, relatives console his ageing mother. Her blood pressure has shot up, we are worried about her well-being, said Bhagwant, her youngest son. Mapari is one of the farmers injured in the firing. A few kilometres away, the other injured farmer Narayan Bhanudas Dukales house is locked. Neighbours said the family has been camping at the hospital where Dukale was admitted. We have not known such violence in our village. And to think all this happened because we stood up for our rights, said a villager.Thousands of farmers, including Mapari and Dukale, had taken to the streets in Ahmednagar on Wednesday, demanding an increase in fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane. The farmers had been agitating since November 12. The police said they had to use force to control the large number of agitators. At Khanapur in Shrirampur taluka of Ahmednagar district, they had to open fire to control the protesters, injuring Mapari and Dukale.A bullet hit Mapari on the chest, while another brushed Dukales hand. Four policemen, including deputy Superintendent of Police Sudarshan Munde and police inspector Suresh Sapkale, were injured in stone-pelting. Located near the catchment area of the Jaikwadi dam, cane for Telwadi and other nearby villages is the only source of sustainable income. While villagers do go for crops like cotton and onions, it is cane which gives them an assured income. Both the injured farmers have around 4 acres of cane, which is ready for harvest. However, growers in the area are unhappy with the functioning of the mills. Bhagwant said his brother, being the eldest of three, was concerned over lack of payment by the mills. He participated in the strike so that we get a fair price for our hard work, he said.Last year, mills in the area had promised to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne of cane, but paid only Rs 2,300. Santosh Suryavanshi, Aurangabad head of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said mills were yet to clear payment to the tune of Rs 34 crore. Last year, farmers in the area had contacted us to support their fight. This year too, they had asked us for support, he said.Nitin Pawar, a villager, said the refusal by mills to even discuss the matter with the farmers had irked them the most. Unlike western Maharashtra, majority of the sugar mills in this area are private-run and thus have just a single payment for cane. Pawar and other farmers alleged the mills indulge in unfair practices and often intentionally reduce the weight of cane being brought for crushing. After Wednesdays violence, mills have declared the first installment price of Rs 2,525 per tonne. The FRP for cane with 9.5 per cent recovery is Rs 2,550 for the present season.The start of the crushing season in Maharashtra is often synonymous with strife between millers and growers over payment. In the cane belt of western Maharashtra, MP Raju Shetti calls for an Oosh Parishad (cane conclave), where he places his demands for the first installment payment. A middle ground is found after discussions with millers after which crushing starts.This year, millers of Sangli and Kolhapur have decided to pay Rs 200 over the FRP following discussions with the Sanghatana. While the crisis in Ahmednagar and Aurangabad seems to have blown over, it is simmering in Solapur. Ravikant Tupkar, youth president of the Sanghatana, said until and unless the farmers were united, they will not be able to get good prices.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It can make us notice details we may have overlooked, emotions we may not have tapped into, and, at its very best, give us a completely new perspective. While writers are the rulers of the worlds they create, photographers must make do with the world they inhabit. They must observe it patiently, waiting for that fleeting momentthat split second when everything comes together in visual coherence.Some use the medium to document the ordinary in the extraordinary, like Showkat Nanda, 34, with his haunting images of the widows of Kashmir (featured on page 1). Others use it to comment on the erasure of natural habitats, like Asmita Parelkar, a documentary-wildlife photographer whose series on animal trafficking helped create awareness of the urgency of the problem.We list young photographers with different areas of focusdocumentary, street, wildlife, fashion and interior-architecturedelving into their practice and seeking to offer insights into their visual thinking.To curate this list, we reached out to galleries and senior photographers. While we couldnt include many deserving names, we hope this gives you a glimpse. They come from different regionsKolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabadbut their photographs transcend the boundaries of time, space and geography. Each photographer has a compelling story to tellof that decisive moment which prompted them to pick up the cameraShowkat Nandas self-portrait.Showkat NandaBest known for: documentary photographyShowkat Nandas childhood memories of Kashmir are singed with the strife of the 1990s. A reticent child, he dreamt of becoming a surgeon. As violence tore through the state, however, Nandas dream crumbled. I began to believe that I would never live to grow into a young man. Survival became the topmost priority, he says. He lost his 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old cousin to the conflict. But while many children his age would go on to pick up stones, Nanda picked up the camera.Throwing stones at the Indian forces was a natural, human response to the situation one witnessed every day, he says. But I wanted to tell stories of my people. The desire to show the world the reality of a conflict that has devastated thousands of lives turned me towards photography. He borrowed his first camera, a Cosina C1 SLR, from his friends brother in 1997; he was 14 years old.I wanted to tell stories of my people [in Kashmir]. The desire to show the world the reality of a conflict that has devastated thousands of lives turned me towards photography.-In 2009, Nanda would shoot an image which would leave an indelible mark on him. I shot the image of a 12-year-old boy throwing stones at an armoured vehicle of the Indian forces, moments after his schoolmate died in my arms, Nanda says. It was a defining moment since he, a photojournalist, was compelled to play his role of a silent observer, while his instinct told him to pick up stones. He didnt rebel.Haleema, whose husband was arrested in 1998, on her way to a sit-in.Nandas photographs offer the insiders view of Kashmir. Perhaps one of his most bone-chilling works is The Endless Wait. It features Kashmiri women and children, often in isolation, waiting, silently, for the return of their husbands, brothers, sons and fathers (who disappeared mysteriously during the conflict). A womans face was the most prominent symbol of suffering in Kashmir, explains Nanda. In the early 1990s, during the crackdown, many men left their homes in fear of being arrested, spending days in forests. The only people left behind were elderly men, women and children. Nanda goes beyond the archetypal front-page images of women protesting and delves into their personal tragedies through quiet, yet haunting frames of longing and loneliness.Today, the 34-year-old has won recognition for his work: He has been a recipient of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Fund grant (2016), won the National Press Photo Award (2011), and a Fulbright fellow (2012). He has done his postgraduation in photojournalism from the University of Missouri, US, and in mass communication, from the University of Kashmir. Nanda is currently busy teaching visual storytelling to young photographers in Kashmir.Deepshikas self-portrait.Deepshikha JainBest known for: architecture photographyFor architecture photographer Deepshikha Jain, the process of looking at a building for hours and observing its intricate detailing is akin to reading a novel. One has to know and learn every part of it. Jain belongs to a group of young photographers who believe it is important to document the architectural facades that define an urban landscape. Architectural photography in India, as a niche or a specialization, didnt exist (until) almost eight years ago, she says.Jains two series, BOMbai and Urban Postcards, capture the different facets of the city, from modern skyscrapers to buildings caged in scaffolding. It is an attempt, perhaps, to immortalize the city through black and white stills.-Her interest in the visual arts led her to pursue a masters in architectural photography from the Spos International Photography School, Paris (2009-10). While many of her batchmates chose the field of fashion photography, Jain chose to shoot archaic arches and modern symmetrical squares. She was invariably drawn to mansions falling into disrepair, as well as modernist masterpieces. I love architecture that is rooted, that has a story, that is raw and minimalist, and is all about the form which complements the function, she says.From the series Urban Postcards.Her first assignment was photographing some buildings designed by award-winning architect Anupama Kundoo in Auroville, in 2010. Jain has since worked for architects such as Annkur Khosla, Riyaz Tayyibji, and the architecture firm Morphogenesis, and shot for various publications, including Architectural Digest, Harpers Bazaar and Vogue.I think Bombay has influenced my sense of storytelling. I find urban stories very compelling, says the Mumbai-based 31-year-old.Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier, Paris, France (built from 1928-31).Her two series, Bombai and Urban Postcards, capture the different facets of the city, from modern skyscrapers to buildings caged in scaffolding. It is an attempt, perhaps, to immortalize the city through black and white stills.Bombay as we knew it has been disappearing. Matunga and Dadar were different from Bandra; Andheri was different from Borivali. But as the old structures are being erased and newer ones are built, my attempt is to document that change.Asmitas self-portrait.Asmita ParelkarBest known for: wildlife photographyMumbai-based Asmita Parelkars favourite image is from 1989. Its a photograph by Michael Nichols of primatologist Jane Goodall, with strands of her hair, backlit by the sun, seeming to fall delicately into the palm of a chimpanzee. It was the tenderness shared between two species that resonated with me, she says. At a broader level though, that tenderness is absent between humans and animals.Parelkar, 34, refers to another photograph, by Biplab Hazra, who won the Sanctuary Wildlife Photographer of the Year award earlier this month. The image, shot in West Bengal, shows a baby elephant on fire as it flees a mob with its mother. We dont respect animals or their habitat at all. Wild habitats are burnt down in the name of urbanization. That angst informs Parelkars photographic direction. Stories related to wildlife conservation and endangered species form the backbone of her work.From the series Illegal Wildlife Trade.Her series Illegal Wildlife Trade puts the spotlight on the brutality behind the slaughter and trafficking of animals. Parelkar was allowed access by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (which regulates the import and export of flora and fauna in the US) for it. They have a lab in Long Island, which works as a repository for the animals that are confiscated at harbours and airports. I made two-three trips and managed to photograph the animals, she says.As humans, weve pushed animals out of their natural habitat. While zoos exist under the pretext of protecting these animals, they ironically serve to entertain us.-While studying photojournalism at the International Center of Photography, New York (2010-11), Parelkar worked on a series that featured animals in captivity, particularly those living in zoos. As humans, weve pushed animals out of their natural habitat. While zoos exist under the pretext of protecting these animals, they ironically serve to entertain us, she says. Parelkar shot the series in five zoos across New York and its boroughs. In comparison to the zoos in India, she observes, these man-made habitats in New York were pristine. The dioramas replicated the natural habitat of the animals really well. But if you think about it, the paintings on the walls were fake. They have been done for our eyes. These animals were still in a confined space.From the series Giraffe Behind The Door.This project Giraffe Behind The Door, still ongoing, was published in The New York Times in 2011.Parelkar, who also designs photobooks, is part of the BIND collective, a platform that curates visual book exhibitions. This year, she has helped the collective put together Travelling Library, a pop-up photobook exhibition at the GoaPhoto festival (23-26 November).Saumya Khandelwals portrait by Reuben Singh.Saumya KhandelwalBest known for: documentary photographySaumya Khandelwal uses her camera as a truth-telling instrument, taking us on a cross-country ride to the peripheries, and making us look at social anomalies we would rather hide under the carpet. Her ongoing series, Child Brides Of Shravasti, shot over a period of three years, is a peephole view into the lives of young girls from a small town in Uttar Pradesh who are prematurely pushed into adulthood. There is an incomparable beauty in her imagesthey are piercingly intimate and poignant. My approach to making photos is always to reveal something more about the people I am photographing than just the information of whats happening, says Khandelwal. Instead of objectifying them, I would like to make it subjective, where the viewer can put a context to the lives of these people.Khandelwals ongoing series, Child Brides of Shravasti, is a peephole view into the lives of young girls from a small town in Uttar Pradesh who are prematurely pushed into adulthood.-From Alex Webb to Raghubir Singh, Khandelwals visual language has been influenced by their phenomenal oeuvres. Having been mentored by senior photographer Amit Mehra since 2012, she has gone on to assist Delhi Photo Festivals co-founder Prashant Panjiar, and VII photo agency photographers Jessica Dimmock and Stephanie Sinclair. The 27-year-old is also the recipient of the Getty Images Instagram Grant (2017), National Foundation of India Award (2017) and the Neel Dongre Photography Grant (2014 and 2015).Images from the series Child Brides Of Shravasti.Currently an in-house photographer at Thomson Reuters in New Delhi, Khandelwal also works on personal projects. They are reflective of her meditative documentary skills, where she immerses herself into the milieu, slowly unravelling its layers, one photograph at a time. Her first serious project was WaterThe Dying Lifeline (2013), which documented the devastating conditions of Indias existing water bodies. The series proved to be a turning point, convincing her to consider photography as a profession.Images from the series Child Brides Of Shravasti.When she was working in an Indian publication, she was the only woman photographer in the team. I hadnt looked at my profession through the lens of gender before, she says. I would get stories that involved women with the expectation that the subjects will be more comfortable in my presence, she says. So it was an opportunity to work on good stories. To make a mark in the field as a woman is challenging. But Khandelwal used it to her advantage. With an approach that is steeped in ethnography and visual journalism, Khandelwal is a photographer to reckon with.Ronny Sens portrait by Shreya Dev Dube.Ronny SenBest known for: documentary/street photographyRonny Sen is self-effacing as he tries to recall the first image that left an impact on him. It was a black and white image by Pablo Bartholomew in 1975, of Poohperhaps one of Bartholomews most unforgettable subjectslying on a bed, looking directly at the camera. There was something very special about the photograph, says Sen. Its a memory of an infatuation that grew into something incomprehensibly more. When I look at this photograph, it almost makes me touch that time. Thats the power of this medium.Sen received the prestigious Getty Images Instagram Grant last year for his powerful documentary work on Jharkhands Jharia coal town that has had, for decades, an intense, uncontrolled fire burning underground. He also has a string of accolades to his name, including being the recipient of artist residencies in Japan (2012) and Poland (2015). The 30-year-old, who began his journey in photography in Salt Lake, Kolkata, in 2006, began shooting in monochrome. His visual language has been heavily influenced by the works of the Japanese photographers Daid Moriyama and Eikoh Hosoe, as well as Bengali film-maker Ritwik Ghatak.Untitled from the series Dont Breathe.A large part of Sens pictorial record is marked by compositions of barely recognizable figures shot in low light, often accompanied by grains and blurs. There is a jarring, almost unsettling theme that pulsates through his work: shattered windows, deliberately blackened faces, an anonymous arm here, an unrecognizable torso there. Sens photographs are hypnotic, be it his first, dark, quasi-surreal photobook Khmer Din (2013), which depicts the grim underbelly of Siem Reap, Cambodia, or the palpably raucous atmosphere depicted in Dont Breathe (a series that began in 2008 and was first exhibited in 2011), which conveys the experience of travelling in unreserved train compartments.Growing up in the late 1990s was pretty chaotic. We were surviving one day at a time. It was the fear of death that got me closer to photography.-To an untrained eye, however, his frames may seem imprecise and flawed. Many of his works carry macabre overtonesreminiscent of a difficult past. Sen grew up on the streets of Kolkata, where many of his friends were addicted to brown sugar. Growing up in the late 1990s was pretty chaotic, he says. We were surviving one day at a time. Staying alive was a big deal. It was the fear of death that got me closer to photography, says Sen. To give some meaning to my life, art became extremely important.Untitled from the series Khmer Din.His series New World Chronicles Of An Old World Colour (2015), which he created while at an art residency at the Gdask City Gallery in Poland, was a departure from his black and white photography. Polish film-maker Krzysztof Kielowskis Three Colours trilogy served as inspiration, with Sen depicting the melancholic Polish winter, while looking for traces of red, where solidarity had once emerged and how capitalism had finally taken over today. He is currently working on his first feature film, titled Cat Sticks (slated for release in early 2018)the screenplay has been co-written with Soumyak Kanti DeBiswas. He is also working on a project commissioned by Royal Enfield (in association with the India Foundation for the Arts) to travel and photograph his journeys for a possible book.Swarat Ghoshs self-portrait.Swarat GhoshBest known for: street photographyAcross the canvas of sky, an outstretched arm, an umbrella thrown in the air and a plane taking flight. In another time, in one of Hyderabads oldest wrestling precincts in Yakutpura, a young boy catapults against a wall with the help of a rope, his head coveringalmost merging withthat of another boy standing next to him. There is a certain charm, a nuanced idiosyncrasy in Swarat Ghoshs images.His images, never static, are often characterized by levity. Ghoshs angles are peculiar; there are figures that seem to appear by chance; and others that seem to merge. Each element in the composition, though, falls into an unexpected coherence.Ghoshs angles are peculiar; there are figures that seem to appear by chance; and others that seem to merge. Each element in the composition, though, falls into an unexpected coherence.-It was in 2012 that Ghoshs wife gifted him his first camera, a Nikon D3000, for Durga Puja. I had never shot a single image before that, so I dont know what made her give me a camera, Ghosh says, laughing, over the phone. The gift kindled his interest in photography. Based in Hyderabad, Ghosh had a demanding 12-hour job as a graphic designer, but in his spare time, he enrolled in photography clubs, and explored different parts of the city with his group.Photographed near Mumbai airport, from the series Beyond Street.As an aspiring street photographer, the 37-year-old spent nights poring over booksfrom Robert Franks exquisite visual book, The Americans, which captured the lives of people in the 1950s, to Raghu Rais revolutionary documentation of Kolkata locals, Calcutta. In addition, the collective works of veteran photographers Kaushal Parikh and Prashant Godbole influenced him too.He has been a finalist in the reputed LensCulture Street Photography competition (2017), won the Neel Dongre Awards for Excellence in Photography (2016-17) and has been featured in one of the most sought after international photography publications, BURN magazine, as well as the National Geographic Traveller magazine. His works have been exhibited in Paris, London, Glasgow and Istanbul, as well as Mumbai and Hyderabad, among other cities.Young wrestlers at Yakutpura, Old Hyderabad, from the series Beyond Street.While his ongoing series, Beyond Street, emerged on the edit table when he realized that certain patterns and repetitions emerged while placing the images together, another series that he has been working on features his family. I think it is our personal stories that are the real stories which need to be preserved in memory and in physical form, he says.Nisha Purushothamans self-portrait.Nisha PurushothamanBest known for: wildlife photographyWildlife photography is defined by two demanding prerequisitessolitude as an occupational trait and invisibility as a skill to master. A large part of Nisha Purushothamans life involves living away from the city, meandering through sprawling, open grasslands, and turning wildlife photography into her own branch of animal anthropology. From a group of cheetahs that appear to have broken away from a serious discussion, to capturing a rhinoceros crowned by birds as the sun setsPurushothamans images capture the interiority of the animal empire, making the unseen seen.We have to ensure that our work is used effectively to comment on issues as diverse as mountaintop removal mining and deforestation, or the very real impact of oil spills on marine life.-Purushothaman was born in Paravur, a small coastal village in Kollam, Kerala. Paddy fields and the Polachira wetlands were a 10-minute walk away from home. Becoming a person who loved nature, therefore, was not difficult, she says. It was only years later though, in 2008, when Purushothaman shifted to Dubai to work as a project manager at an advertising firm, that her interest in wildlife photography surfaced. It all started with a weekend photography trip during which she spotted over 150 species. I fell in love with birds. Slowly, instead of weekends, I started to shoot every day, at least an hour before I headed to work. And the more time I spent shooting, the more I became motivated to become a nature photographer.Cheetahs in Maasai Mara, Kenya.Since then, Purushothaman has travelled to some of the most forbidding terrain across India, Kenya, Tanzania, Alaska and Russia. She has photographed over 200 birds, as well as tigers, leopards and lions. As a practice, Purushothaman visits sanctuaries near her home in Dubai at least two-four times a week. I start from home around 4.30am and shoot till 10am. Nothing comes easy. As a wildlife photographer, you need to be fit in order to carry equipment, which can be as heavy as 10kg. Sometimes you even have to trek long distances, she says.An elephant in Amboseli National Park, Kenya.In 2004, Purushothaman, along with her friend Hermis Haridas, established Paws Trails Explorers, a global platform for wildlife conservation, travel and photography. Using photographs to protect animals is immensely important to her. We have to ensure that our work is used effectively to comment on issues as diverse as mountaintop removal mining and deforestation, or the very real impact of oil spills on marine life. In 2016-17, Purushothaman became a finalist for the Hamdan International Photography Award. A TEDx speaker, she has hosted over 30 photography workshops around the world.Hashim Badanis self-portrait.Hashim BadaniBest known for: fashion photographyA model struts across a blur of crayon-ish greens and neon. In an Irani caf, a woman leans back in a chair. Atop an old cement terrace in Kolkata, a scarf swirls in the air, lending anonymity to its owner as it veils her face.Hashim Badanis fashion photographs involve a bit of tasteful drama. They seem to be scenes plucked from a Wim Wenders or Wong Kar-wai film.A large portion of my work involves working with Bombay, whether its my personal work, editorials for fashion magazines, or otherwise. I am drawn to everything about the city.-Cities, particularly Mumbai, where he lives, often appear as characters in his compositionswhether it is Kolkatas Howrah bridge, which served as a misty backdrop for a Harpers Bazaar shoot celebrating the salwar kameez, or Mumbais old Irani cafs, which are practically historical landmarks. A large portion of my work involves working with Bombay, whether its my personal work, editorials for fashion magazines, or otherwise, admits Badani. I am drawn to everything about the city. He is currently working on a book on the citys Irani cafs with Simin Patel, founder of Bombaywalla (an organization that celebrates the citys history), which will be published by Roli Books.Badani began his career as an in-house photographer for Time Out Mumbai in 2010, and then moved to Lonely Planet Magazine India, where he is still a consulting photographer. He ventured into commercial fashion photography in early 2016 to explore his ability to shoot differently. His fashion shoots developed an idiosyncratic identity, involving a blend of orchestrated and real people/life situations.An Irani caf fashion shoot for Vogue India.Badanis process of conjuring up images is akin to film-making. I try to build a narrative in my head. There is a loose script and the models are characters in that story. I assign a mood, a personality and situation to them, and it makes the process a lot more fun, he says. In fact, as an ode to Wong Kar-wai, Badani collaborated with Mumbai-based fashion brand Obataimu to weave in the theme of Chungking Express into a shoot for the brands Wabi Sabi line.Having shot for Vogue India, Rolling Stone India, Lonely Planet Magazine India and National Geographic Traveller India, Badanis work is not confined to fashion photography. He is currently collaborating with writer Zeenat Nagree on a story on Myanmars Rohingyas. Were trying to document the challenges they face in their daily life, their culture, and what the future holds for them, keeping in mind the current government stand, he says.Anshika Varmas portrait by Adil Hasan.Anshika VarmaBest known for: interiors/documentary photographyPhotographing interiors is a tough task. Attention to detail is of prime importance, of course, but its the ability to convey the intimacy of a luxurious restaurant, the quaintness of a caf, or the charm of a newly opened retail store, that marks out a good photographer. It involves the craft of making a three-dimensional space look visually appealing in the format of an uncompromisingly flat, often rectangular frame.Anshika Varmas initiation into photography happened when she was a student of social communications media at Sophia Polytechnic in Mumbai. I felt that images could transport people to different worlds. It was perhaps the multiplicity of different realities that got me hooked to photography, she says. Her first camera, a borrowed one, was a Nikon F65 SLR film camera. I had asked my mother to lend me her camera and some film so that I could walk around Bombay with it. I still have the camera up in my studio although I dont use it any more.Detail from a space designed by Adil Ahmad, Mumbai.From images of interior spaces that are suffused with dense, contrasting colours, to framing objects that come together in a seamless symmetry, Varma has the ability to balance the incongruous. Symmetry becomes primary for me while working with interiors. Whether the aesthetic of design is minimal or ostentatious, its important for the eye to not get lost in clutter, she says.Symmetry becomes primary for me while working with interiors. Whether the aesthetic of design is minimal or ostentatious, its important for the eye to not get lost in clutter.-In fact, Varma has explored myriad facets of photographyfrom documentary (dealing with themes of identity, memory and objects) to curating exhibitionsshe was co-curator of A Million Mutinies Later: India At 70, which was shown at Ffotogallery in Cardiff, Wales, in July. It looked into the everyday revolutions that are slowly and steadily transforming the social, cultural and political fabric of the nation, she writes on her website. Varmas work has appeared in Cond Nast Traveller, Motherland and People magazines, among other publications. She has also worked for independent brands like restaurants DIVA, Qla and Mainland China, and fashion brands like Shantanu & Nikhil.Prarthna Singh.Prarthna SinghBest known for: fashion photographyCouched in minimalism, Prarthna Singhs fashion photography veers away from the theatricalthere arent any extravagant backdrops or carnival-esque props. The women inhabiting her images often carry a soulful lookat times pensive, at times looking directly at the camera. They appear to be everyday, ordinary women rather than models, shot in natural light. In Singhs pictures, the clothing is the hero.Singhs photography journey began at the age of 19 when she bought her first cameraa second-hand Nikon FM2. She would spend hours in the darkroom drenched in the dull red glow, watching pictures come to life. She found it therapeutic.Couched in minimalism, Prarthna Singhs fashion photography veers away from the theatricalthere arent any extravagant backdrops or carnival-esque props.-She studied photography at Rhode Island School of Design, US, and says that gave her exposure to myriad experiences, prodding her to become a thinker within and beyond a particular artistic medium.Her visual languageone that is unadulterated by the superfluoustakes cues from the world of August Sanders Citizens Of The Twentieth Century, a monumental collection of 431 frames featuring individuals from different strata of German society between 1892 and 1952. My early introduction to portraiture was through Sanders work, says Singh. What I admire most about his powerful, yet subtly composed, imagery is the honesty in both thought and approach, she says. Even today, when I am looking for inspiration, I revisit it, and it affirms my belief that a compelling portrait is an invitation to envision.An image from Neighbourhood Watch, a personal body of work.In the past two years, Singh has consciously steered away from fashion photography to focus on personal projects that are driven by reportage and deal with socially relevant themes. The Wrestlers, for instance, features female wrestlers who have struggled hard to upend the feminine stereotype and transcend social norms in India. The series offers an insight not only into Singhs versatility as an artist, but is a reflection on her awareness as an observer on gender in a patriarchal set-up. The Wrestlers was part of Photographing The Female, which was exhibited at the FOCUS Photography Festival in Mumbai in March. For me the wrestlers are symbolic, wrote Singh in her introduction to the series. Each of their stories speaks of overcoming innumerable hardships, fighting family pressure and most importantly, living gender differently.An image for fashion label Bodice.In 2017, Singh was one of the 29 finalists at the FCBarcelona Photo Awards, and was handpicked by Focs Scotland (an international platform that invites conversations on identity and culture) to exhibit her work at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow. As an independent photographer, her images have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Elle India and Vogue India, among other publications. She has worked on numerous lookbooks for fashion labels, including Bodice, Sanjay Garg and Nor Black Nor White.

She died a few years ago.However, recent seizures have led ANC sleuths to suspect that the same drug is being circulated once more.Little is known about Kamlis personal life. Her foray into the narcotics trade came at a time when the D Company facilitated the inflow of synthetic opioids from Pakistan and south-east Asia into the city in the 1980s. The deadly drug  mostly brown sugar  was called smack or skag and peddled in the streets. Its customers? Celebrities and children from across socio-economic strata.At that point of time, Kamli, a migrant who had settled in Tardeo slums, held sway over the drug trade in south Mumbai through a trusted network of peddlers. It was said that the market for her drug was the dark alleys of Ballard Estate. After the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, the police initiated an all-out crackdown on the drug syndicate. After a few run-ins with the law, Kamli shut shop temporarily as the supply chain had dried up.Taking advantage of the lack of drugs available on the market, Kamli resumed operations once more in the late 1990s as the prices of contraband soared. By this time, she had found a way to bypass the law  through a newfound chemical spray that altered the molecular composition of the drug while retaining its effectiveness.She began peddling Kamli, which became an instant hit among the poor and lower middle-class as it cost a fraction of what pure heroin did, said sources. Its composition also meant that users and peddlers could get away in case of arrest under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Old ANC records suggest that Kamlis men were caught peddling the drug several times. However, the police had to let them ago after forensic tests to detect brown sugar came back negative.Now, ANC sources suspect that a new cartel has resumed the production of Kamli using the old modus operandi.Cartels procure high-grade heroin at a street price of Rs2.5 crore a kg. Later, harmless additives such as baking soda or monosodium glutamate is added to increase the quantity and bring down the retail cost. For every kg of pure heroin, 4kg of additives are added. Each kg is sold to small distributers at Rs1 crore a kg.Retailers convert the adulterated drug into Kamli by spraying it with a certain chemical. Sources said they suspect that the operation is carried out at rented flats on the outskirts of Navi Mumbai.While a pouch containing 1g Kamli is sold at Rs250 to Rs300 on the street, pure drugs of the same volume cost around Rs5,000.Noted anti-drug campaigner Dr Yusuf Merchant said it was difficult to alter the molecular composition of the drug by adding another chemical to it.

This will affect cash flows, which may prove detrimental to the interests of sugar producers and very soon may impact their paying capacity to the sugarcane farmers,"" it noted.The government has extended the stock holding limit on traders by two months till December 31.As per the latest data, mills have produced a total of 13.73 lt sugar till November 15 of this season as against 7.67 lt in the year-ago period.Of this, mills in Uttar Pradesh - leading sugar producing state - have produced 5.67 lt as against 1.93 lt in the same period last year.Maharashtra - the country's second largest sugar producer, has manufactured 3.26 lt so far this season as against 1.92 lt a year ago.""The main contributors to the higher production of sugar are the sugar mills in UP and Maharashtra,"" ISMA said. Sugar output in Karnataka till November 15 of this season is almost same as that in the year-ago period. The production situation in other states is almost similar to last year, it added.According to ISMA, sugar offtake from mills during last two months was lower. ""With higher production in 2017-18 season, the sugar sales need to improve to ensure better cash flows and a stable sugar prices,"" it added. LUX ANU"

The two-fold increase is not only because of higher number of operating mills  80 mills started operating this year against 67 last year  but also because of a quantum jump in cane crushing from 29.25 lakh tonne in October-November last year to 68.05 lakh tonne this year.The sugar production also got a boost because of better sugar yielding cane varieties grown by farmers. Not surprisingly, sugar recovery rate also rose from 9.42% to 9.60%.""Sugar production looks impressive because of head start to cane-crushing. It needs to be maintained for next five to six months,"" said a senior official in the department.The high quantum of cane crushing and subsequent sugar production comes nearly 20 days after the state government increased the state advisory price (SAP) for sugarcane by Rs 10.UP had surpassed Maharashtra to become the highest sugar producing state in the country last year.Officials said that given the present production rate, the state would certainly repeat its performance this year.UP always had highest cane cultivation area in India but average and poor grade cane variety were limiting factors for sugar production.However, millers fear that the high production in first month may result in sugar glut, eventually leading to fall in prices.UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), which represents private sugar mills in the state, is apprehensive of a fall in sugar prices affecting their compensation paying capacity."

A month after Diwali and three weeks ahead of the winter session, there was no news about the expansion. In fact, developments on last Friday were seen contrary to what was being expected. On Sena founder the late Bal Thackerays fifth death anniversary on Friday, Fadnavis made it a point to visit Thackerays memorial at Shivaji Park. He attended a small function organized by a government-appointed committee to develop Thackerays memorial at mayors Bungalow and later had a half-an-hour long meeting with Uddhav Thackeray.After the meeting, Thackeray seemed a bit softened towards the BJP. He chose not to criticise the government over firing at sugarcane farmers in Ahmednagar on November 15, which was in sharp contrast to what the Sena has been doing -- leaving no opportunity to target the BJP governments in the state or at the Centre. Thackeray also indicated he was unlikely to campaign against the BJP in Gujarat, where the Sena is fielding candidates.In political circles, these developments led to speculations whether the Sena was happy with Fadnavis for preventing or at least delaying Ranes inclusion in the state cabinet. Thackeray has been strongly opposed to his bete noire Rane entering the state cabinet.A section in the BJP was also pointing out that the party top brass has been busy with Assembly elections in Gujarat and as such the decision on cabinet expansion in Maharashtra could be taken after the elections in the neighbouring state. Some Sena leaders, too, wanted the expansion to be postponed till the Gujarat election results were declared. Their logic was the BJPs attitude towards allies may change if it suffers a setback in Gujarat.The developments on Monday, however, indicate there could be an expansion of the cabinet in the coming days. Does that mean Fadnavis has managed to convince Thackeray to let Rane  technically a BJP ally -- be part of the state cabinet?In any case, several equations in Maharashtra politics are set to change if the BJP goes ahead with Ranes inclusion. Will Sena, especially Thackeray, forgive Rane or will it plan an exit from the National Democratic Alliance? The rumours about the same have been around ever since NCP chief Sharad Pawar disclosed that Thackeray met him and seemed upset with the BJP. On the other hand, if Fadnavis manages to broker peace between Thackeray and Rane, the NCP would be forced to return to the Congress-led UPA camp. Already, Pawar has started praising Gandhi familys role in Indias politics.Countering the selfie-attackRecently, public works minister Chandrakant Patil had to face an attack of selfies, after NCP MP Supriya Sule started a selfie with potholes campaign to highlight the issue. In response to her appeal, a large number of NCP workers clicked their selfies with potholes on roads and posted on Twitter, tagging Patil. Irked with it, Patil has now asked public works department officers to click pictures of the road repair work and post it on Twitter. He makes it a point to retweet these pics."

Illustration: Jayachandran/MintThe India: Health Of The Nations States report, released last week, makes two things abundantly clear. The first is that the lack of such a granular, state-wise assessment of Indias public health scenario and trends in a common framework until now has been an inexplicable failure on the part of previous governments. The Narendra Modi government has done well to rectify the lack. The second is that the nature of the countrys health challenges has changed sharply over the past couple of decades and is going to continue changing.The latter should not come as a surprise. Global precedent shows that a countrys health profile changes as its economy and level of urbanization grow. The threat posed by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseasescollectively termed infectious and associated diseases in the reportdeclines, and the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) grows. India is no different, even if the rapidity and extent of the change are startling.In 1990, the total disease burden of infectious and associated diseases in the country, measured using the metric of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was 61%. The burden of NCDs at the time was 30%. Cut to 2016 and those numbers have just about flipped: infectious and associated diseases account for 33% of the disease burden while NCDs account for 55%. This trend is going to continue to play out as Indias socio-economic contours change. In roughly the same period that the report coversthe past quarter centurytwo thirds of the deaths globally have been because of NCDs. The World Health Organization predicts that over the next decade, NCD deaths will increase by 17% globally. And in high-income countries, generally speaking, they account for 80% or more of deaths. All of this leads to two conclusions.The first is the need for decentralized health policymaking. There is wide divergence between the health profiles of various regions and states in India. While infectious and associated diseases now account for less than half of the disease burden in all the states, the transition happened as early as 1986 and as late as 2010 depending on the state in question. Likewise, the NCDs burden covers a substantial rangefrom 48% of the state disease burden to 75%. Drill deeper and it gets even more complicated. The burden due to specific diseases within the NCDs and the infectious and other diseases groups differs substantially. This is true not just between groupings of economically similar statessay, industrialized states like Maharashtra and Gujarat, and Empowered Action Group states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradeshbut between similar states as well. This divergence, naturally, extends to the risk factors that cause various diseases. In the face of this reality, Centre-dominated health policymakingsave in its broadest contours such as increasing insurance coverage, setting standards for public sector health institutions and deciding drug policymust inevitably diminish the effectiveness of state response.The second takeaway is the nature of state response will have to enter relatively new territory. According to the report, The leading individual cause of death in India in 2016 was ischaemic heart disease... The other NCDs in the top 10 individual causes of death included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Risk factors such as dietary risks, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and tobacco use rank correspondingly high.In a journal article Beyond Carrots And Sticks: Europeans Support Health Nudges, Lucia A. Reisch, Cass R. Sunstein and Wencke Gwozdz note that tools such as nutritional standards, fiscal measures and hard regulation such as banning advertisements for certain products have been less effective globally than hoped for in addressing such risk factors. Instead, they note: Increasing research evidence suggests that a key to changing nutritional and activity patterns is the purposeful design of living and consumption environmentsthe so-called choice architecture. In other words, nudges, brought into prominence in recent years by the work of Nobel Prize winning economists like Daniel Kahneman and Richard H. Thaler. An increasingly large number of countries are incorporating this in policymaking; the UKs Behavioural Insights Team is perhaps one of the most well-known attempts.Building an effective choice architecture can require direct government action. Urban planning is perhaps the best example of this. Ensuring that citizens lead a more physically active life would directly address a number of risk factors for NCDs. That means ensuring ease of access from everything to pedestrian access to public transport and communal green spaces. Effective architecture will require bringing private enterprises on board in other instancesfrom displaying health information and advice in stores to appropriate food labelling, high salt warnings and product placement in stores.This sort of broad and diffuse response will not be easy to implement. And certainly, addressing the weak fundamentals of Indias health system is critical. But NCDs are called lifestyle diseases for a reason. Evidence from developed economies shows that addressing them requires inducing basic changes in the manner citizens live their lives, effective health systems notwithstanding. Achieving this without straying into state paternalism and heavy-handed regulationan ever present risk in Indiais going to be tricky but essential for fighting tomorrows health battle.Can nudges effectively address Indias growing NCD burden?

Photo: PTINew Delhi: Thousands of farmers protested in Indias capital, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts, underscoring the challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces before elections in his home turf Gujarat next month and nationally in 2019.Representatives from 184 farmer organizations squatted on a road leading to the parliament building in the heart of New Delhi, demanding a nationwide waiver of crop loans on the lines announced by some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, higher prices for their produce and lowering seeds and fertilizer costs.The protest is the latest challenge for Modi who promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and ensure a 50% profit over the cost of production. The number of farmers committing suicides climbed about 42% to 8,007 in 2015 from a year earlier, according to a farm ministry statement in parliament in February.I am struggling to take care of my family and considering the current situation, I dont think I can get out of this mess without any help from the government, said Jayesh Bhai Hurabhai, a farmer from Gujarat. We have come here with a lot of hope as farmers from all parts of the country have joined hands this time to protest.Some farmers travelled for more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from different parts of the country to reach New Delhi to participate in the two-day protest that ended on Tuesday. As many as 300 widows of farmers who have committed suicides in the past years due to high farm loans also took part in the protest, with some holding placards that read Farmers are Robbed.Dwindling incomesAbout 800 million people of Indias 1.3 billion depend directly or indirectly on farming, with agriculture accounting for about 16% of the economy. The country is the worlds top grower of cotton and the second-biggest producer of wheat, rice and sugar.The farming community is agitated over falling food prices and high debt levels. Bumper harvests, boosted by a normal monsoon last year after back-to-back droughts and good rain this year, have hurt prices of crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Depressed prices, combined with poor arrangements for government-assured purchases, have triggered these protests.I have heard that the country is becoming prosperous. But what am I getting out of it?, said Pintu Patil, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. Rising input costs and household expenses are making it difficult to manage a seven-member family with an annual income of just about Rs2 lakh, he said.Indian farmers are likely to fetch about Rs36,000 crore less this crop season due to lower market prices of top seven commodities, including paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and some pulses, than what they would have received by selling at government-set minimum purchase prices, according to All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Minimum support prices for cotton, paddy and sugar cane have risen between 7% and 16% in the year ending in March 2018 from the start of 2014-15 when Modi came to power, according to government data.The government procurement agencies, which are mandated to purchase some agricultural commodities at fixed rates to support prices and supply to the government for its welfare programs, buy only a small portion of a commoditys total output, leaving million of farmers across the country to sell at the market-determined levels.

The gas, which is responsible for trapping heat and raising global temperatures, is stored in biomass as carbon.CERE identified 10 fast-growing native species that are efficient at capturing CO2 (see box). The uniqueness of our project is that we focus only on urban areas because it is high time we start greening our concrete jungles, said Dr Rashneh N Pardiwala, founder and director, CERE, and an ecologist from University of Edinburgh. We plant native species because we want to regenerate local flora and fauna as well.Among the 56 native species that have been planted are Peepal (sacred fig), Arjun, Bakul, Palash, Teak and Rudraksh. CERE calculates the amount of carbon captured at each plantation site and takes into consideration species type, age of tree and projected growth rates to assess carbon sequestration in the trees. Plants use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into sugar, cellulose and other carbon-containing carbohydrates that they use for food and growth.Plantation site near Malabar Hill. (Kunal Patil/HT)Pardiwala said that the carbon sequestration potential of each tree is measured using a model that calculates the above-ground and below-ground bio-mass of the tree. We measure the height and diameter of the tree and then multiply its volume by its species specific density. This helps us calculate the mass and the dry weight of the tree in carbon units. This can then be converted into carbon dioxide (using its molecular weight), telling us just how much CO2 a tree of a specific species and age can sequester, said Pardiwala, adding that while international papers take an average value, we know the exact amount being sequestered to the second decimal point considering growth rate, wood density and other specific details.HT had reported earlier this month that India is the third-highest CO2 emitter in the world after China and USA, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based energy policy advisor. The study found that CO2 levels from fuel combustion increased in India from 181 million tonnes (MT) in 1971 to 2,066 MT in 2015, a 1,041% increase.Some of the areas where maximum plantations were carried out include  5,858 trees across villages near Bhiwandi, 3,747 trees at Ambawadi in Malabar Hill, 1,000 trees each at the Mulund forest headquarters and both at the Borivli and Thane ends of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.We plant large well rooted trees that are three to four years old and at least five feet tall. We do this to ensure high survival rate in the hostile environment in a city like Mumbai where pollution levels are high and there is poor soil quality and limited watering facilities, said Pardiwala. Once these trees are planted, we geotag them to know that exact latitude and longitude of saplings planted. It is updated on a real-time database on our website so that there is complete transparency.She added that even though CERE is aware about species that capture maximum CO2, they focus on having mixed plantations. We are looking create natural eco-systems and biodiversity islands. The plantation is chosen keeping in mind nurturing the biodiversity of birds, butterflies and reptiles at every location, she said."

Officials from the regional EPF office in Solapur had called a meeting of the representatives of sugar factories and contractors Friday to discuss labour laws being made applicable to sugarcane labourers and transporters.The representatives of sugar factories were informed that sugarcane labourers and transporters were eligible for EPF. These labourers are involved in the essential activity of the factory. The factories make payments to supervisors and transporters who then pay the labourers. Though the factories deduct these payments from sugarcane growers payments, the factories and sugarcane growers fall in the category of owners, said an official.The official said the representatives of the factories were also given a copy of the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the Orient Paper Mills case of 2005. The court had held in that case that the workers loading and unloading bamboo for the mill were workers of the mill. The nature of work of sugarcane workers is similar, added the official.However, the sugar factories said there was no question of extending EPF to labourers. The sugarcane labourers and transporters are not employees of the factories. It is the responsibility of the sugarcane growers to transport the sugarcane from the field to the factory. We merely help them in that work by engaging the Mukadams and transporters and deduct the charges from their payments. So, they cant be called factories employees and the question of providing EPF does not arise, said a representative who attended the meeting.Another representative said the issue was raised in 2003 also and they had then written to the Delhi EPF office. Sugar factories wont be able to bear the burden and it may lead to shutting down of factories, he said.

(File Photo) The bank aims to issue tenders, inviting applications to either lease or buy non functional sugar mills. (File Photo)For the crushing season of 2017-18, the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank has earmarked Rs 3,500 crore as the cumulative sugar pledge loan to be distributed to the 32 sugar mills associated with it. M L Sukhdeve, chairman, Board of Administrators, also indicated that the bank aims to issue tenders, inviting applications to either lease or buy non functional sugar mills.The bank has approved sugar pledge loans to allow mills to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to growers. The pledge loan is based on the valuation of sugar, which the bank reviews every three months. Last year, the bank had disbursed about Rs 2,200 crore as pledge loan for the sector. The MSC bank has recently reduced sugar prices by Rs 300 per quintal, which had worried the sugar sector.Sukhdeve defended the move, saying the bank either considers the three months average or the current valuation of sugar and adopts the lower one.Meanwhile, the MSC bank has also decided to change its strategy regarding non-functional sugar mills, which the bank has attached due to default in payments of loan.This strategy, the chairman said, was adopted in view of the benefits of an operational mill for the farmers. Of the 13 mills, which the bank has floated tenders for, one has found a buyer. Sukhdeve said they will be retendering the mills to look for more players.Financially insolvent cooperative sugar mills by the MSC bank has been a politically sensitive matter for the bank with the then Opposition, BJP, leaders accused the NCP and the Congress leadership of intentionally weakening the mills.Between 2006 and 2013, the MSC bank had sold 26 such mills, which later started operating as private mills.Multiple petitions have been filed regarding the matter, with social activist Anna Hazare being one of the petitioners. Last year, the bank had issued tenders for the sale of seven mills, which owed the bank about Rs 300 crore.However, lack of buyers led the tenders to lapse, following which the bank has reissued the tenders.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express file Mills, especially those facing a liquidity crunch, have started selling sugar at prices lower than the market rates. Express fileA month after sugarcane crushing season started in Maharashtra, millers in some parts of the state are worried about the momentary slide in sugar prices, which they say might affect their ability to pay growers. Mills, especially those facing a liquidity crunch, have started selling sugar at prices lower than the market average, thus depressing the market for other players.Since the start of the crushing season, November 1, ex-mill prices of sugar have dipped by Rs 120 per quintal. At present, the ex-mill price of sugar is between Rs 3,280 and 3,450 per tonne, with most mills preferring not to sell below Rs 3,400. Some millers, however, are reported to have indulged in price undercutting, which is looked at seriously by the industry. Some newer mills in Marathwada have started this practice as they require cash to pay farmers the first installment payment.Mukesh Kuvadiya, secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Trader Association said the phenomenon was restricted to a handful of mills. Sugar prices have fallen by Rs 100 since start of the season and most millers are selling at around Rs 3,400. However, mills facing liquidity crunch are resorting to lower prices, he said. B B Thombare, chairman of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA), the apex body of private millers, also admitted to this phenomenon. In our region, we have requested millers not to sell at below Rs 3,400 but some of the millers are still doing so, he said.A cooperative miller from Kolhapur said new mills that have already pledged their sugar to traders at lower prices are the ones indulging in this practice. These mills would normally have a short season and need to have ready cash to pay farmers. Growers normally do not trust such mills, pointed out the miller. Most such mills are expected to end their season by mid-January, and sugar prices are expected to stabilise by then.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Foreign Minister Tar Kon said in October: We are in an era when Japan has to exert itself diplomatically by drawing a big strategic picture.Military normalisation is one prong of Japans new foreign policy, but even if a controversial revision of Japans pacifist Constitution, as proposed by newly re-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe goes through, the archipelagos armed forces will remain under strong, self-imposed constraints. The constitutional revision would merely recognise the legality of Japans long extant Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Offensive weapons and preemptive strikes would remain outlawed.Countering ChinaHis nationalist leanings notwithstanding, even Mr. Abe realises that remilitarising alone will not provide Japan with an effective solution to its diplomatic dilemmas. What Tokyo needs to prevent the region from succumbing to a Pax Sinica is to use its strengths, its capital, its technological know-how and its democratic credentials to win friends and influence countries across the region and beyond. It needs to beat infrastructure sugar daddy China at its own game.A large part of Chinas rise has to do with its indispensability to global trade. But Japan is a trading heavyweight too, and is attempting to stake leadership on the regional platform with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). With the U.S.s departure from trade negotiations, Japan has become the principal driving force keeping the deal alive. At Novembers Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, Japan got the 11 countries still involved to agree on the core elements of a deal. It wants to lead rule-making on trade in the Asia Pacific, rather than let China set the agenda with alternatives to TPP such as the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).At the same time, Japan is stepping up aid and investment in Southeast Asia. A train line near Manila, a seaport in Cambodia, and assistance in the reconstruction of Marawi City in the Philippines are some examples. As the top source of development aid to Vietnam, it has helped construct a new airport terminal in Hanoi as well as the first subway line in Ho Chi Minh City.Mr. Abe recently committed 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) to the Philippines over the next five years, with a continued focus on infrastructure development. Japanese investment in major Southeast Asian countries is estimated to have averaged $20 billion per year, from 2011 to 2016, more than double the average annual flows between 2006 and 2010.Japanese sales pitches to countries in the region always have one eye on China, emphasising advantages in areas where Beijing is vulnerable such as safety, reliability and solutions that deliver benefits to local populations.Looking to IndiaChinas $900 billion, Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure building campaign across Eurasia is a gauntlet that Japan has picked up by turning to the only country in the region with the heft to match China, India.Japan and India have announced an Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, aimed at creating sea corridors linking the countries of the Indo-Pacific to Africa. In addition, Japan is cooperating with India in third country infrastructure projects such as Irans Chabahar Port, Sri Lankas Trincomalee port, and the possible joint development of the Dawei port along the Thai-Myanmar border.Japan has bagged the $17 billion contract to build Indias first high speed railway line, linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Tokyo is also investing in development projects in the Northeast and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. And Japans Diet gave the go ahead to a Japan-India civil nuclear energy deal earlier this year. The possibility of purchasing Japanese submarines and search-and-rescue planes to help the Indian Navy is being discussed.Creating a QuadA free and open Indo-Pacific, a phrasing that places India as a major actor in the Pacific, is an idea being proselytised by Japan in conjunction with the U.S. This is a response to concerns over the expansion of the Chinese navy and Beijings territorial claims in the South China Sea, waters through which a huge majority of Japanese energy supplies transit.It is against this background that Tokyos championing of the Quadrilateral dialogue with the U.S., India and Australia aimed at creating a community of democratically oriented interests in the region must be understood.Tokyo wants to use the bilateral ties it is developing to create a multilateral architecture in the region. Like Germany in post-World War II Europe, Japan is aware that unilateral moves by it invariably conjure up images of militarism and expansionism. However, without making genuine amendments for its past aggressions, an idea that Mr. Abe does not seem interested in, Japans attempts to shape the future of the region will remain constrained.Pallavi Aiyar has reported from China, Europe, Indonesia and Japan.

The meeting assumes importance as the opposition parties have been trying to present a combined front against the government before the start of the state assembly session.Talking about the meeting, Shetti said Chavan had called to ask him to join the farmers protest organised by the Congress. I told him that we will be taking a decision about the same soon, said Shetti. The farmers leader also said that he had thanked Chavan and the Congress for the pro-farmers stance taken by the party. When I had raised the issue of corruption in the way the contract was given for the software to implement the farmers loan waiver, Prithviraj Chavan had supported me. I thanked him for the same, he said. Asked if this meeting could start a new political move in the state, Shetti said it was too early to comment. Such things are never decided in a hurry, he said.Chavans meeting with Shetti comes in the backdrop of the opposition parties taking to the streets to protest against the anti-farmer policies of the state government. The NCP has already started a morcha from Yavatmal to Nagpur to highlight the farm distress in the state while Congress is also planning a similar rally before the start of the winter session of the state legislature.Shetti, along with some farmers leaders, had organised a massive rally in New Delhi earlier this month to protest against the Centre.Shetti clarified that the rally in the national capital was non-political in its affiliation. Since his decision to part ways with the BJP and NDA, Shetti has been vocal against both the state and central government. While he has remained non-committal about his future political moves, party insiders have not ruled out a new coalition to take on the BJP in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Six months after the announcement of the loan waiver, the implementation of the scheme appears far from satisfactory.Veena Manikrao Kadam, like 1,400 other account holders from Arvi village in Parbhani taluka and district had filed the online form for loan wavier way back in July. Six months have passed since Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced the Rs 34,000-crore Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Saman Yojana, but Kadams loan is yet to be waived. Just five people from our village has got the waiver till date. All of us have filled the form online but there seems to be no sign of the waiver for the others, she said.Kadam, who has close to 10 acres of land, has an outstanding loan of Rs 1.45 lakh, which she had availed from the State Bank of India. Compounding her worries, the crop loan disbursal for the present Kharif and now Rabi season this year has been bad. It seems the farm distress does not exist for the policy makers. Its just some thing they talk about and not follow up with action, she told The Indian Express.Six months after the announcement of the loan waiver, the implementation of the scheme appears far from satisfactory. As the clamour of protests gets louder, the state government admits to technical glitches, which seem to have put brakes on the scheme that was envisaged to benefit over 80 lakh farmers in the state. The number of beneficiaries was, however, brought down to 67 lakh after scrutiny, with officials claiming to have detected around 22 lakh ghost accounts.Faced with an unprecedented farmers strike in the first week of June, the state government had announced the farm loan waiver. The first government resolution was issued late in June, which had capped the waiver amount to Rs 1.5 lakh of the outstanding loans. Loans which are outstanding from April 1, 2009, till March 31, 2016, were to be waived and non-defaulters were to get an incentive of Rs 25,000. The process was to be linked with the Aadhaar number of the farmers to prevent any leakage. Government servants, elected representatives, directors of sugar mills and other cooperative institutions and those who have paid service tax were deemed ineligible for the scheme. This was to be second loan waiver witnessed in the state in the last 10 years.Back in 2008-09, Maharashtra had seen a loan waiver where loans to the tune of around Rs 7,000 crore were waived. The erstwhile Congress-NCP government had come in for severe criticism as allegations of misappropriation of the funds were raised. To avoid such a scenario, the current government had said it would use Aadhaar to authenticate the data filled by the farmers, and they were asked to file details online instead of dealing directly with the bank.Banks were to file information online and the loan waiver was to be implemented after matching and authenticating the farmers data. Technically, farmers were not to receive the amount in their savings accounts, but banks would receive drawal from the state government in tandem with the outstanding amount. Once the amount was received, banks would write off the loans.Right from the word go, the scheme had faced problems both technically and policy wise. At the policy level, the state government frequently changed the eligibility criteria for the scheme, which had proved challenging for the implementing agency. The scheme originally was to be extended to accounts that were outstanding between 2012 and 2016, but later included accounts that had become outstanding from 2009 onwards. The operation guidelines for the scheme itself took a long time to be finalised and were published only in late August. The scheme had seen 1.05 crore registration and as many as 56,59,187 applications were received.The over reliance on technology, which was supposed to make the scheme error-free, however, turned out to be its Achilles heel. At the ground level, complaints about the facilitation centres charging farmers for filing the online forms to the crashing of Aadhaar website had plagued the process. Farmers were given the deadline of September 22 as the deadline for filing the online forms, post which scrutiny of the database and the real work for disbursal were to happen. The first green list of 4.5 lakh farmers was released early October with the state government marking the occasion with a solemn function. Fadnavis had presided over the function and said the whole process would be completed by mid-November. The second list of 15 lakh beneficiaries was issued in the second week of November. Ajit Newale, secretary of the coordination committee for the farmers movement, said there was still confusion about the real numbers. The government has refused to share the lists with us, he said.As the deadline seems difficult to meet, officers point to the inherent flaw in the software. The genesis of the problem lies in the mismatch between the software used by the government to authenticate the data filled by farmers online. Errors in the database, has delayed generation of the green list. The lists being generated, say officers, have errors like same Aadhaar or bank account number for multiple farmers. Also, in some cases, the same names are appearing in the lists of both eligible and ineligible farmers. In case of such errors, the banks are asked to re-verify the data manually, and the field-level officers are coordinating the matter. Till date, it is estimated around Rs 4,000 crore has been disbursed under the scheme.Minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh denied the reports of any major technical fault but said the process was delayed due to some snags. Disbursal of the amounts is going on and we are confident it will be completed soon. Due diligence has to be followed and whatever snags have come are being addressed, he said. The process, the minister said, involved uploading data and then running the software. It is a technical process and is bound to take some necessary time, he said. That the system has developed serious faults was also admitted by Minister of State Sadashiv Khot who however said work was on war-footing to rectify the same. As soon as the technical glitches are resolved, the scheme will start full-fledged. We are also answerable to the people, the minister added.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana MP Raju Shetti had levelled charges of corruption against the government in the way the software contract was awarded to a Nagpur-based company. IT Secretary Vijay Kumar Gautam was moved out of the department even as both the IT and the cooperative departments struggled to correct the database. After adverse criticism from various quarters, officers of the cooperative department have been asked not to share information with the media at large.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The State government is keen on ensuring that the institute in Coimbatore is not closed or merged with other ICAR institutions, the Chief Minister stated.While the NRC in Tiruchirapalli had significantly boosted the production of bananas to meet the demand from consumers, the CIBA in Chennai provided regular technical support to all coastal States on brackish water aquaculture, he pointed out, and insisted that these institutes should not be closed or merged.The closure or merger of these ICAR institutes would have a detrimental impact on the interests of the farmers and fisherfolk of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Palaniswami said.Closure or merger would have a detrimental impact on the interests of the farmers and fisherfolk of T.N."

However, this year, organisers of agricultural fairs rue the fact that the spending by farmers have gone down which is affecting the turnover of the exhibitors.In the sugar belt of western Maharashtra, Yashwant Krushi Udyog Pashu Pakshi Pradarshani in Karad is a major agricultural fair.Organised by Karad wholesale market, the average turnover of the market is more than Rs 8 crore. Sandeep Gidde, the organiser coordinator of the fair, said that this year the fair could manage to notch about Rs 6 crore worth of business only. The agricultural community does not have money in hand, he said. Last year, this fair had shot to fame after introducing an internal currency called Yashwant chalan to tide over the cash crunch during demonetisation. Gidde said that while cash was no more a problem with the rural market, the spending power of the rural markets have reduced drastically. Giddes company has lined up several agricultural exhibitions in western Maharashtra and Konkan, but he is pessimistic about the business outlook.Milk, which is an important cash earner in this region, Gidde pointed out, has been fetching dirt cheap rates and many farmers who supplement their income through dairy are hit hard. Its ironical that milk prices have collapsed to Rs 19 per litre whereas a bottle of water is priced at Rs 20, he said.Prices of vegetables and fruits for the last few months have also been very low which has hurt the farmers spending power.Niranjan Deshpande, the organiser of major fair titled Kisan, said the quest for farmers for newer technology continues unfazed by their economics. Deshpande mentioned that farmers continue to patronise online registrations with Kisans Green Pass  the online registration facility  recording almost five times as traction as compared to 2016. Till December 6 last year, 2,469 registrations were recorded. This year, we will have a day-long conference by Israeli companies which are looking for tie-ups with Indian companies in terms of technology transfer etc, he said. The Kisan fair, which is to start from December 14, will also see a pavilion for agricultural start-ups.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

While petrol dealers initially shrugged off their complaints, the Pune unit of All Indian Petroleum Dealers Association (AIPDA) has now decided to take up the matter with oil companies such as BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil.Petrol dealers have been receiving complaints from customers, who say that their vehicles have been abruptly coming to a halt and they have not been able to restart it. Some customers claim that their mechanics told them that the petrol contained some amount of water, which was the primary reason for their vehicles not working properly, said Ali Daruwalla, spokesperson of AIPDA.Most of the complaints have been received from rural areas of Pune and Satara districts, said Daruwalla. So far, there have been no complaints from city areas, but people from rural areas have complained about petrol being mixed with water, he said.Daruwalla said they had received information about a petrol pump on the Mumbai-Goa Highway, in Nagothane area of Raigad district, giving free petrol to customers last week after they complained about getting petrol mixed with water.However, Daruwalla said the problem could be caused due to the mixing of petrol and ethanol, which contains water. Two years ago, the government had ordered that ethanol be blended with petrol. This mixing is done at the Loni Oil Depot, he said.However, Vijay Avate, managing director of the Kolhapur-based Shree Chhatrapati Shahu sugar mill, said, Ethanol does not contain water at all. Ethanol is produced only after removing water from it.The AIPDA, meanwhile, stated, Though the government directive initially stated that 5 per cent of ethanol should be blended with petrol, it later raised the amount to 10 per cent.B Bhaskar Rao, deputy general manager of HPCL, dismissed claims of petrol being mixed with water. There is no question of this we have a fool-proof system where we rigorously carry out checks on a daily basis to weed out any chances of water being present in petrol, he said.Rao said the oil companies send 350 tankers to 550 petrol pumps in Pune district. As much as 20 lakh litres of the fuel is distributed across Pune dailythe amount of ethanol in petrol is about 10 per cent, he said. Stating that they have received no complaints so far, Rao said petrol pump dealers should check the underground water tanks, and whether there were chances of water seeping into the fuel.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The leopard till December 6 had killed seven people in the area.Shafath Ali Khan told TOI, Before turning into a man-eater the leopard injured several people in Jalgaon district. It started killing people in the last two months. The chief conservator of forests of Maharashtra invited me and asked for my help in putting an end to the menace. They gave orders for either tranquillising or shooting down the cat. Tranquillising was ruled out as the area is an agricultural area spread with cotton and sugar cane crops and the animal visibility is less. Finally, we opted to gun it down as it became dangerous and started entering human habitations. I reached the area on December 4 along with my son Asghar Ali Khan. We identified the daytime resting area of a leopard while tracking it. On December 9 it entered the village and was circling the houses. We alerted the villagers. We already formed village committee, members of whom were armed with sticks. At 10pm I saw the animal crawling towards a group of men who were on a vigil. Unaware of the lurching danger they were talking to each other. It was almost within 30 metres of its target. Depending on its body language it was confirmed that it was the man-eater and was about to strike. I had to take a quick decision, and fired at it.One shot from my .375 Magnum rifle brought the leopard down. It was a female aged four years, and it fitted the description provided by the forest department. She was the one that killed many people. A 70-year-old woman fell prey to the animal just 100 metres away recently. The leopard separated the head from the body of the victim. Leopards are territorial, so it was the same one. In the past five days, I noticed a female leopard was also moving in the area with the cubs. She also injured people. There may be chances of this leopard turning man-eater too in the area, Shafath Ali Khan added.Explaining why the leopard turned a man-eater, he said, The leopard strayed out of the forest. As it is an agriculture area, it lurked near the villages and preyed on goats and dogs. As it moved close to human habitations, it slowly lost the fear of the humans. Kids and old women became its target. It became bold and started injuring first and then turned into a man-eater.The big cat killed seven persons in the village of Malegaon tehsil of Nashik and Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district. Forest officials formed 10 teams, put up 13 cages and camera traps.Shafath Ali Khan is the secretary of Wildlife Tranquil Force , an NGO. The leopard was on the prowl in the Upkhed beat of Chalisgaon range.The latest victim was seven-year-old Kunal Prakash Ahire of Sakur village in Malegaon. While Kunal was sleeping near his mother the leopard snatched him away and killed him, said Shafath Ali Khan."

Archive Pune district has around 15,000 registered cooperative housing societies. ArchiveWhen it comes to conducting of election, the cooperative housing societies in Pune seem to have a huge backlog. In fact, the backlog and slow pace of elections at these societies have recently prompted the State Cooperative Election Authority (SCEA) to issue 1,450 letters to the housing societies, urging them to hold elections at the earliest.One of the major reforms in the cooperative sector was the provision of direct elections and formation of the state cooperative election authority. Headed by Commissioner Madhukar Chaudhari, this body is entrusted with conducting free and fair elections for more than 1.95 lakh cooperative institutions in the state. Cooperative housing societies form the bulk of the societies and are the largest cooperative bodies in urban centres like Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik etc. Since its formation three years ago, the authority has conducted elections in more than 95,000 cooperative institutions which includes banks, sugar mills, spinning mills etc. As per the Act, the cooperative bodies are supposed to intimate the election authority about their due election. The election authority, in turn, appoints an observer and conducts elections through secret ballot. The failure to conduct timely election can lead to the dismissal of the board.However, the cooperative housing in Pune seems to be lagging behind when it comes to notifying the authority about the expiry of their executive body. Given the workload on the district deputy registrars, action against defaulting societies has also not been taken. Cooperative housing societies are expected to elect an executive body among their members who, in turn, take over the running and maintenance of the society. The executive body also looks after the budget as well as issues arising in the society. Pune district has around 15,000 registered cooperative housing societies.Speaking about the notices, Chaudhari said they were issued to housing societies as many of them have failed to intimate the authority about the term of expiry of their executive bodies. The letter, while asking them to conduct election immediately, has also listed out the manner in which the elections can be held, he said. Prior to the issuance of the letters, the Authority had, through advertisements, urged housing societies to contact assistant registrars or ward officers to inform them of the expiry of their term and conduct election. We have also asked the Federation of Cooperative Housing Societies to help us in raising awareness about the matter, he said.Suhas Patwardhan, president of the Pune District Cooperative Housing Societies Federation, agreed there was a problem and said they had taken up the matter in all earnest. We have written about it in our monthly magazine and also talk about the same everywhere we go for holding seminars and camps, he said. Patwardhan said the federation sought that the housing societies be allowed to hold election in their annual general meeting, which normally sees good attendance.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express Mills in the Nanded region by far have the best record in payment with the 27 mills there paying 88 per cent of their dues. ExpressA month since the start of the 2017-18 crushing season, sugar mills in the state have paid around 44 per cent of the total fair and remunerative price (FRP) due to the farmers. Of the Rs 1,578.47 crore payable to growers, mills till November 30 have paid Rs 693.04 crore, leaving Rs 963.02 crore as unpaid arrears.At the start of the crushing season, farmers organisations had upped their demand for payment above the designated FRP of Rs 2,550 per tonne of cane. Mills in the Kolhapur region have agreed to pay Rs 200 above the FRP while those in the Solapur region have agreed to pay Rs 400 above the fixed price. Farmers bodies had demanded higher pay given the then bullish sentiments in the sugar market with the sweetener trading over Rs 3,500 per tonne during the start of the season.Mills in the Nanded region by far have the best record in payment with the 27 mills in operation there paying 88 per cent of their dues. Kolhapur, Pune, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad region have recorded 45, 36, 23 and 62 per cent payment, respectively. The four private mills operational in the Nagpur region have paid only 6 per cent of their dues to the growers.Meanwhile, millers have expressed serious concerns about the drop in sugar prices, which they say will affect their ability to pay the growers. Sanjay Khatal, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, talked about how sugar prices have dropped significantly since the start of the crushing season. Also, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank recently reduced the valuation of sugar from Rs 3,390 to Rs 3,270, which will make it difficult for mills to pay the growers upfront. External factors especially the decision of the Pakistan government to promote export subsidy to 15 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar has further worried the sector.Calling for an immediate removal of the stock limit on traders, Khatal said the government should step in to stop the further erosion of sugar prices. Already, Philippines and Iran have banned the import of sugar and until steps like export incentives are given to the Indian millers, it will be difficult for us to pay the FRP, he said.Khatal also called for the creation of buffer stock to help stabilise the prices. With talks of a bumper crop in the offing, millers are apprehensive about a further drop in sugar prices.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Ahead of the regional outfits organizational elections, scheduled to be held later this month, the MGP has begun holding block-level meetings in constituencies where it feels the party has a sizeable presence.At one such meeting in Sanvordem recently, MGP president Pandurang Deepak Dhavalikar hinted that the party was aiming at securing more than 10 seats in the next assembly polls.We won three seats in the last two assembly elections. We now need to have more MLAs in the assembly and need your support for that to happen. Going by the current strength of the party, I can comfortably say that the party is in a position to secure 10 seats. We need to strengthen the MGP in Goa as it is the only party which can preserve the ethos of Goem and Goemkarponn, Dhavalikar said.He said that the MGP will remain an independent entity and wouldnt remain in servitude to anybody.Advising party workers to stay united and work at strengthening the party at the grassroots, Dhavalikar said, Have patience and work at building the party, just as we have done in Madkai constituency (represented by MGPs PWD minister Ramkrishna `Sudin Dhavalikar) over the years, Dhavalikar said.MGP also held meetings in few other constituencies including Cumbarjua.Earlier, the partys Sanvordem MLA , Dipak Pauskar, briefed Dhavalikar about the problems faced by the people of his constituency. Pauskar pointed out that while 430 jeeps owned by locals were registered with the tourism and forest department for ferrying tourists to the Dudhsagar waterfalls, the restriction of only 225 vehicles per day has been causing losses to owners, many of who have been unable to repay loans. He said the restrictions must be relaxed. Dhavalikar said that he will try to resolve the matter.Dhavalikar also pointed out to the sorry state of affairs at the Sanjivani sugar factory owing to which, he said, sugarcane cultivators in the constituency have been facing losses."

Lets take a look back at how the BJP has fared in these areas in the past to understand what to expect this time.Two historic milestones characterize this region. Mehsana, in north Gujarat , was the only Lok Sabha seat that the BJP won on its own in the 1984 Lok Sabha polls. Central Gujarat, had delivered one of the most stunning verdicts, post polarization in 2002, 37 on 41 for the BJP. The Gujarat riots actually had their hinterland spreading far and wide deep into pockets of north and central Gujarat  pre delimitation these regions had 95 seats put together. Of these 95, the BJP won 73 in 2002, a strike rate of 75%, where barring a few tribal pockets in North Gujarat, the entire populace voted BJP with their feet.In 2007, the BJP continued its sweep of north Gujarat with almost a similar vote share as in 2002 (52.4%), however its sway over central Gujarat reduced substantially with the tempers cooling down. The fact, that the son of the north Gujarat Modi was seeking re-election after a complete five year term, led to the non-tribal and rural areas of north Gujarat giving a thumbs up to Modi  26 seats then. The BJP won 24 out of 26 such seats. North and central Gujarat put together gave the BJP 56 seats that time, almost explaining most of the loss that the BJP suffered in terms of seats between 2002 and 2007.A heightened GPP campaign in 2012, along with the consolidation of Bharat Sinh Solanki and Shankarsinh Vaghela, led to the BJP plateauing in 2012, winning 52 seats here out of the 93 at stake post delimitation. However the devil lay in the details. If you bar the urban seats of Phase 2, there were 54 rural seats (including tribal) at stake In 2012, the BJP won less than half, only 23, while the Congress with its then ally the NCP, won 31. That explains why a little anti-incumbency could spell doom for the BJP in this election. In terms of vote share in rural areas of Phase 2, the BJP was just 0.2 % ahead of the Congress party, polling 43.1% of votes vs 42.9% of the Congress.Of the 17 assembly segments that the Congress led in Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, 12 were in the phase two districts. Many of these districts are home territory to Hardik Patel (Mhesana being the epicentre) , besides Alpesh and Jignesh contesting from their respective seats in north Gujarat.Clearly the turn of events challenges the BJP to come up with that many more innovative strategies to halt the Congress in its tracks. It must be remembered that the cradle districts of brand Amul  Kheda and Anand have always been Congress strongholds. Much like the Sugar barons of Maharashtra the BJP has come up with Milk barons to contest seats. There are a total of 21 assembly seats here that can be influenced by presidents of milk cooperatives. Of the 21 such key contests, only three of them are contesting on Congress tickets, most others on BJP tickets. Since 2012, no less than 15 non BJP leaders have moved over to the BJP and obtained BJP tickets to contest elections, of these 9 are in Phase 2 seats. In the remote north eastern tribal swaths of the state, the BJP is experimenting with say an IPS officer PC Baranda to contest in his native assembly seat to wrest a long held Congress stronghold. In many ways, this is a new socio-economic segment that the BJP is trying to appropriate--old entrenched Kshatriya Congressmen, Dairy Barons, and new tribal leaders.Key contests in this phase will determine whether the BJP retains its tally of 115 or threatens to slip into the grey zone around 100. If it does it will be one more milestone in the BJPs journey of social engineering, albeit of a new kind, and not the one based on religious identity alone.Jai Mrug is director VotersMood Research (VMR)."

The Shetkari Bachao Kruti Samiti has warned of an agitation if the plan is not withdrawn from Maval area.Alleging that the decision to set-up ring road was primarily taken to benefit politicians and builders, the Samiti said that the PMRDA ring road plan would hit several villages, including Salumbre, Dhamne, Parandwadi, Sangwade and Nere. Even a sugar factory will also be affected. In these villages, irrigated and fertile land is spread in vast area, and the plan has been framed to benefit politicians and builders, the Samiti said. 70 per cent of farmers in these villages are marginal farmers and they will be affected badly if the PMRDA goes ahead with its plan, the Samiti added.The Samiti said this was not the first time that farmers in Maval were being put under pressure. Earlier too, whether it was for Pavana Dam or for constructing Pune-Mumbai Expressway, several farmers lost their land and source of livelihood, the Samiti said.Farmers in Maval have also stalled the Rs 400-crore water pipeline project of PCMC, since 2011. They have alleged that the PCMC was taking away their share of water from Pavana Dam and that they would not get adequate water.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Highly placed sources in the government told The Indian Express the process of completing the loan waiver exercise would not take more than another month. We have shortlisted 69 loan waiver beneficiaries. Almost 43 lakh farmers names have been cleared. For the remaining 26 lakh, the process is under way, said a senior officer who did not wish to be named.The officer added: Once the loan waiver amounts are credited in the accounts of the individual, a coordination committee comprising representatives from the ministries of cooperation and marketing, information and technology and the State Level Bankers Committee will review the process. The final list, along with funds credited to their accounts, would be made public. The government will furnish all details of the loan waiver exercise, highlighting the numbers of debt-ridden farmers, incentive schemes and one-time settlement schemes.The sources said Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had categorically directed officials of the ministries concerned and the State Level Bankers Committee to ensure there is nothing secret about the loan waiver, and hence the names of each and every farmer who availed the benefits would be recorded in public domain. Officials in the Ministry of Cooperation and Marketing claimed that this was the first loan waiver exercise that would document each and every beneficiary. We have no records of the 2008-09 loan waiver beneficiaries, said an official.The governments decision also aims to silence the Opposition, which has accused it of keeping the exercise a secret. Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The government should have announced the Rs 1.5 lakh loan waiver to all farmers instead of having different categories. Also, it should make all the decisions related to loan waiver public. Even the farmers offered an incentive of Rs 25,000 for being non-defaulters should get the waiver of Rs 1.5 lakh, he added. BJP members have countered the attack by Congress and NCP leaders, arguing that they had turned a blind eye to higher capital investments of Rs 76,000 crore made in the agriculture sector by the government. Unfortunately, Congress and NCP leaders priorities are more for the sugarcane and dairy sectors. They are raising these issues repeatedly even during the Winter Session being held in Vidarbha, said a senior Vidarbha MLA.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Leaders of the two Opposition parties met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Friday and urged the government to take some policy decisions to provide stability to the sugar sector.They demanded an increase in the import duty and scrapping of export duty. They also said the government should make payment of fair and remunerative price mandatory as an ad hoc system was not practical, especially at a time when sugarcane crop was surplus and prices had steeply declined.

The perseverance displayed by top leaders to make the sugar sector a common cause is good. But they never display the same unity or commitment when it comes to fighting for the rights of Vidarbha issues, said a senior Congress leader who did not wish to be named. Another Congress leader said, The Winter Session (of the state legislature) in Vidarbha is held once a year. And it lasts for just two weeks. Yet, if we look at the Oppositions overall concern, very few Vidarbha issues are highlighted and taken to a logical end. As a result, the BJP walks away with advantage in successive elections in Vidarbha.Meanwhile, the alarm raised by sugar mill owners cutting across party lines over Pakistan sugar has been dismissed by a section in the BJP and the Shiv Sena. A Sena minister said, It is not as if Pakistan sugar is coming to India for the first time. Moreover, sugarcane crop brings assured profit. And successive governments at the Centre have always given Sharad Pawar an audience every time he meets the Prime Minister to discuss problems related to the sugar sector. However, NCP leader Dilip Walse-Patil argued, When we raise issues related to sugar industry, it is for the larger welfare of the state and its farmers.

Both the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories and the Indian Sugar Mills Association have made presentation to the government asking for an ease of the stock limit on traders to boost prices. The central government had imposed stock limit on both mills and traders just before Diwali to prevent sky rocketing of sugar prices in retail markets.By the end of October, mills were supposed to have only 8 per cent of the sugar produced with them. The move had led to large scale sale of sugar by the millers and a subsequent drop in the retail prices. Similarly, stock limit was put on traders to prevent hoarding of sugar.Since the start of the sugar season in the 2017-18 fiscal, prices of the sweetener have fallen by Rs 400 per quintal. Ex-mill gate prices are now between Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,400 a quintal with reports coming in for sales at lower prices as well. Some mills in Marathwada have reportedly sold sugar below the Rs 3,200 mark also. The free fall of sugar prices had set alarm bells ringing among millers who claim it would be difficult for them to pay the designated fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs 2,550 per tonne to growers. Sugar prices, they had said, should be in the range of Rs 3,500 to Rs 3,600 per quintal to enable them to pay the grower.Officials of both the Federation and the ISMA had met officials of the civil supplies department to seek immediate removal of the stock limit on traders. This, the officials said, would boost sugar prices by Rs 100 per quintal at least. Rohit Pawar, the newly-elected Vice-President of the ISMA said he was hopeful of a positive feedback from the ministry. The stock limit was anyway set to lapse by end of December but there are indications that it might be removed earlier, he said.Meanwhile, sugar millers also want a reduction of export duty on sugar to zero as well as a total import ban on the sweetener. These, the millers said, were necessary in view of the decision of Pakistan to provide export subsidy to 15 laky tones of sugar, which they say, will eat up Indias traditional market of Bangladesh. Philippines, millers said, has put a ban on sugar import and they want a similar ban to be introduced in India as well.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

However, the government is unsuccessfully conducting surveys and every time there is a change in action, failed attempts to find out the number and there is no solution, activist Heramb Kulkarni said.The NGOs have said that the government should have drafted an action plan by now for students remaining out of school.After the two surveys conducted by the state government failed, activists and NGO representatives have been consistently following up with the government.Vivek Pandit, another activist, said, The government said last year that a new survey will start after the monsoon, but there is nothing happening. In the wake of this lethargic attitude of the government, the high court decision is appropriate.The NGOs have been demanding that they be involved in this exercise of spotting out-of-school children for years.Kulkarni said, We are well networked with the migrants, children of sugarcane and brick kiln workers and others who are vulnerable to the situation of remaining out of school. Hence, it has been our demand to survey the children.A list of close to 862 NGOs working in this field in Maharashtra has already been submitted to the state education department.When contacted, state education secretary Nand Kumar said, The government has been doing work to enrol out-of-school students in schools. Various measures have been implemented from time to time and the biggest responsibility to ensure all children in age group of 6-14 are educated is on teachers.He added that a set of new measures were recently announced which included a stroll by teachers near sugarcane factories, brick kilns and construction sites. Teachers must find migrant children from these sites and a list should be prepared. These students should be enrolled in the nearest schools."

He continuously rolled the matchsticks on the chapathi slab to collect inflammable powder from the matchheads and then tightly packed it into an elbow pipe filled with rusted iron nails (which would become the shrapnel). And this is how he rigged up the Improvised Explosive Device (IED), with nail polish-filled Christmas lights, to announce the arrival of Daesh ()-inspired lone-wolf attack on Indian soil.On December 28, 2014 at 8.30 pm, Afridis IED exploded with a loud bang on Church Street, killing(37), who was out on a Sunday evening stroll with her family. He managed to slip out of the city and cool off in Mumbai, but his luck soon ran out and thefinally arrested him in January 2016, but only after he committed arson on theon MG Road.On Monday, Afridi will start facing the legal consequences of his actions with the trial in the Church Street blast case commencing at the Special NIA court here. Charges were framed against him in custody in September 2017 and with P Prasanna Kumar appointed as the special public prosecutor about three months back, the state is set to try him for his crime.A Gujarat riot victimAfridi hails from Juhapura in Ahmedabad and is a survivor of the 2002 Gujarat riots. He faces as many as 35 terror cases in Gujarat for his involvement in the 2008 Ahmedabad and Surat serial blasts. He reportedly was an active member of the SIMI. In two cases registered in Odhav police station there, Afridi is charged as the bicycle bomb planter at two of the 14 spots of the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts.Sources told BM that Afridi crossed onto the dark side to avenge the Gujarat riots but later started harbouring a deep-rooted hatred towards Israel, claiming it was the reason for the global hatred against his community. He drifted out of Gujarat and was on the run under multiple guises as a lorry mechanic and salesman at a sweet shop in Haryana.During his stint as a lorry mechanic, he made friends with interstate drivers and one of them suggested he move to Bengaluru sometime before 2010, said a source involved in the case.After arriving in Bengaluru in 2010, Afridi assumed the identity of Mohammed Rafiq and managed to get ID cards and bank account in that name.He joined as an apprentice to an AC mechanic near BTM Layout. He also got married in the city and managed to take a house on rent. He started taking independent Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) of air conditioners in various commercial buildings in the city.According to the NIA probe, Afridi started watching anti-Israel videos online. He also reportedly participated in some of pro-Palestine and anti-Israel protests in the city and had extremist literature in this regard in his possession. He committed arson twice at the Israeli Visa centre here on MG Road on August 5, 2014 and November 29, 2015.The NIA chargesheet also says that he had conducted a recce of the Jewish synagogue in Kochi and wanted to execute a strike there but was caught before that.In July 2014, Afridi came in touch with a Facebook user under the profile name Abdul Khan. After months of online chatting, Khan told Afridi that an Israeli delegation would be at Hotel Coconut Grove on Church Street on December 28.Afridi wanted to target the Israeli nationals and so decided to plant the bomb, the source said.The bomb makerAccording to the charges levelled against Afridi, the NIA has stated that Abdul Khan forwarded a password-protected online link for a crude IED assembling manual on December 16, 2014. Afridi had exactly 12 days to get his bomb assembled and he bought an elbow-shaped iron pipe with 2.5 inch inner diameter and 5 mm thickness from a scrap junk shop in Bommanahalli. He bought two couplings for it from a hardware store in Madiwala. He also bought 1 inch nails, battery, a small analog table clock, 250 gram sugar, a set of Chinese decoration lights and hundreds of matchboxes and set to work. He started rolling the match sticks on the Chapathi belan to collect the flammable chemical which was to be tightly filled inside the iron pipe and then sealed with sugar as a combustion fuel along with nail shrapnels.He took off the outer covering of the decoration bulb and then poured nail polish and then sealed it again as it was to serve as the detonator to initiate combustion of the explosive after its circuit was completed with battery and timer, said sources. The NIA chargesheet states that at least 250 grams of the chemical mixture from matchheads were used in Afridis IED.The lone-wolf attackOn December 28, Afridi had his IED assembled along with the timer unit. He purchased an Andhra Jyothi newspaper to wrap his bomb and headed out on his two-wheeler, which he parked on Mission Road in Shantinagar and reached Church Street on foot at around 5.30 pm. His target was to keep the bomb near Hotel Coconut Grove. He had picked a spot during his recce on December 23.At 7:15 pm, he managed to plant the bomb and made a quick exit from the spot. He took his bike and reached home at 9.00 pm. The next day he went to Nelamangala to sell his bike and then stayed for a couple of days with his friend in BTM Layout, then fled to Mumbai for a couple of days.Suicidal tendenciesThe NIA had informed the court that Afridi tried to ingest stones to kill himself when he was picked up. During his stay as an undertrial at Parappana Agrahara prison, he claimed he was feeling extreme guilt and had suicidal tendencies.Afridi was provided medical help but he stopped taking medicine and started hoarding it to carry out suicide threats. These were heavy dose sedative tablets, sources added. The NIA in its charges has stated that Afridi had 20 sleeping pills in his possession at the prison.The NIA has also named the users of online aliases  Abdul Khan and his aid Ayan Khan Salafi  as the second and third accused in the case. The NIA in April had deported Azam Khan, a Rajasthani based in Saudi Arabia, suspected to be an online recruiter for the Daesh in the sub-continent using the name Ayan Khan Salafi."
5b5060109855b708a7ccc122,New health cover to cut old age premium,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-health-cover-to-cut-old-age-premium/articleshow/62110502.cms,2017-12-18,"TNNMumbai: Apollo Munich Health Insurance has introduced a health cover where part of the payment during the earlier years can be used to fund higher rates in future. The advantage for the customer in paying a higher rate now is that the premium is eligible for tax breaks and most youngsters do not use up the full amount of Rs 25,000 for this.Unlike life insurance where insurers are allowed to level the risk premium and charge a uniform rate, health insurance rates rise progressively with the age of the insured. While non-life companies cannot offer products with savings components, Apollo Munich has devised a Health Wallet plan where part of the premium goes toward reserve benefits. The reserve premium can be used to fund health-related costs not covered by insurance. Every year, the unused reserve amount gets carried forward and earns a 6% bonus. This accumulated reserve kitty can in turn be used to pay up to 50% of the renewal premium, after five continuous renewals.To illustrate, a Rs 10,000 annual contribution towards reserve from age 30 will result in a cumulative reserve of Rs 8.48 lakh by age 60. This factors in the 6% bonus on the carried-forward amount every year.The out-of-pocket expenses the reserve funds can be used for includes purchase of medicines, vaccinations, dental expenses, diagnostic tests, spectacles, contact lenses, medical devices like blood pressure and sugar monitors, and consultations with medical practitioners.Apollo Munich Health Insurance CEO Antony Jacob said, It addresses the Indian savings and returns mindset and allows the customers to fund for their health insurance premium in the later years. After retirement, people are worried about funding health insurance premiums. These pertinent concern areas of customers led us to reinvent the industry.For customers who can take care of the first few lakhs of healthcare expenses either with their personal funds or corporate insurance policies, Health Wallet also comes with a deductible option. By opting for deductible, the customer chooses how much expense he/she will be able to take care of in case of a health emergency."

Dr Abhay Hake and Jasveer Singh.Along with the manufacturing sector, Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices now hope to address some of the burning issues related to agriculture as well. Sense It Out Intelligent Solutions Private Limited, a Pune-based start-up, has come up with a solution which aims to optimise water usage using sensors and on-field connected devices. Called Sensor-based Intelligent Crop Centric Automation (SICCA), this solution uses sensors to measure soil moisture to optimise water usage on fields. Jasveer Singh, co-founder of the company which has developed the technology, said on-field sensors will help them reduce the quantity of water needed for irrigation. In order to get the best yield per acre, correct water usage plays a very important role. However, at present most of the farmers have back-of-the-envelope calculations to control their water usage during the life cycle of the crop, he said.Singh cited the example of sugarcane whose cultivation, especially in areas like Maharashtra, has often been criticised because of the enormous amounts of water it requires. Most sugarcane farmers, Singh said, practised what is called dubuk irrigation to water their crops. Farmers throw a random stone at the remotest part of their field. Only if the stone makes the typical sound of hitting the water, indicating ample water levels, the water supply is switched off. A lot of water gets wasted in the process, he said.Singh said SICCA solves this problem by regular monitoring of the soil moisture content through sensors which are installed in the field. At the start of the cropping cycle, all that the farmer has to do is to select the name of the crop from the drop down menu of the app. The app will accordingly calculate the amount of water and intervals when the crop would require watering. Based on this input, the drip irrigation system will only allow the required amount of water to flow into the field, he said. As and when the sensors indicate moisture stress, the pump will be instructed to run the watering cycle again.This smart irrigation system, Singh said, improves the yield per acreage by 1.2-2 times and reduces water wastage by almost 60-70 per cent. The data so obtained can be used for drought management and economise the water usage in periods of severe stress, he said. This system requires almost no human interference and the installed app will send out message only in case of emergencies.The product, which is two years old, had won a grant from the Centre and was also one of the top 20 start-ups under the Innovate for Digital India challenge. Along with Singh, Dr Abhay Hake co-founded the start-up and their working prototype is ready for field trials.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

With the Doklam crisis slowly receding into the background, traders living along the border in Himachal Pradesh want Indian authorities to start talking to their Chinese counterparts about some rather mundane issues.The Kinnaur Indo-China Trade Association recently submitted a memorandum to the Kinnaur deputy commission-cum-trade authority for Indo-China border trade via Shipki La and demanded a quarantine laboratory at the trade centre at Chupan (Namgia) so that livestock trade can resume.The association also wants Indian authorities to talk to Chinese officials during flag meetings about having a proper mule track from Shipki La Pass to the China trade centre at Shipki village along with provision for water and electricity.In the last four years livestock imports from China have been banned through this route which has severely affected the business of the sturdy Chamurthi horses and Chigu goats  the main attraction of the cross border trade. The animals are in great demand in Kinnaur and other mountainous regions.In 2013, the customs commissionerate had informed the Kinnaur deputy commissioner that livestock import was governed by the Livestock Importation Act, 1898, which restricted import of horses and other equidae to the four international airports  Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. Since then no horse or goat has been imported through this route. The biggest hitch is the absence of a quarantine station.The Chamurthi breed is in high demand here because it is native to high altitudes and is used extensively as a beast of burden. Besides being popular in Himachal Pradesh, it is also popular in Uttarakhand . Although the government has a breeding centre in Spiti valley, the demand is so high that the animals need to be imported, mainly from Tibet Hishey Negi of the Kinnaur Indo-China Trade Association says, To ensure that trade starts from June 1, we have demanded that the process of trade passes be completed by May 15 every year. We have also requested the authorities to raise the issue of having a proper mule track from Shipki La to the China trade centre.He adds that a demand has also been made to include items like thermos flask, yak tail, religious books, religious Buddhist flag, local ornaments of gold and silver, wooden craft, Thanka paintings in the list of imported goods. They have also demanded to include items like sugar, dals (pulses), Kesar (saffron), butter tea leaf in the list of exported goods.Kinnaur-based social activist, Shanta Kumar Negi, says Chamurthi horses are known for traveling long distances in difficult terrain in altitudes of 5,000 meters above sea level and higher. He said that there is great demand for breed even in the army. But the import restriction is affecting the trade, he says."

Still High,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dry-still-highkallu-or-toddy-tadimahuakinnauri-195757?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-24,"Sonia SarkarBREWCREW: A Muria Gond tribal woman of central India prepares liquor from mahua (AFP)For tipplers in India, these are no happy hours. Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."

5a53850b9855b770e038032c,A mix of local flavours and tradition: How an Indian Christmas is celebrated,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-indian-christmas/story-K0tV83DZD1FRzvcMM8XPbP.html,2017-12-25,"Come December, and there is a mood of celebration in the air. Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

Archive The state govts directive of charging millers for harvesting and transport as per distance have invited flak from sugar sector. ArchiveWITH CHIEF Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Minister of State for Co-operation Gulabrao Patil deciding to skip the annual general body meeting in Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute, former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar took to the stage to advised the sugar sector to brace up for hard times.The recent directives of the state government of charging millers for harvesting and transport as per the distance have invited a flak from the sugar sector. The millers have also sought an appointment with the chief minister early next week to discuss the harvest and transport (HnT) charges, among other issues.Till last year, sugar mills charged a uniform rate of Rs 650 per tonne of the cane crushed as the HnT cost. As per the new directives, the HnT cost will depend on the actual distance of the field from the mills. Thus, farmers whose fields are closer to the mill will be charged lesser than those whose cane had to travel further distance.Unlike in Uttar Pradesh, millers in Maharashtra make arrangements for harvesting and transportation of cane from the fields of growers in lieu of a fixed charge, which is deducted from the final payment of the farmer.At the event, Pawar said this mechanism was not suitable for cooperative mills. I have raised the problems faced by the sector with both the central and state government. However, I do not know if they will be ready to help. In such a scenario, it is best for the sector to take steps to tide over the crisis. This will hit the availability of cane and needs to reconsidered, he added.Former minster and senior Congress leader Harashvardhan Patil said the decision was taken without taking into account the present legal framework. District collectors, Patil said, have been asked to determine the transportation costs, but barring Aurangabad, no one has submitted the data. We will be meeting the chief minister in the first week of January and are hopeful that the old system will be reinstated, he added.On the absence of the CM and the MoS, Pawar said the chief minister had gone to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Gujarat government and had expressed his inability to attend the meeting. Perhaps this would be the first year that the biggest event of the sugar industry happened in the absence of top government participation.The major part of Pawars speech was devoted to the greater crisis looming over the sector in view of a bumper crop next year (2018-19). Initial estimates have put the next years cane average in Maharashtra alone at over 9 lakh hectares and over 90 lakh tonnes of sugar is expected to be produced in the state. The former agriculture minister said, in view of the increased cane availability, mills might have to start their crushing operations earlier. Although, he added, it might result in lower sugar recovery. Growers are expected to get compensation in case mills fail to crush their cane in time.He said, The extra cane will seriously pose a problem for the millers but, in absence of government help, mills have to make arrangements themselves to ensure 100 per cent crushing. Mills might explore signing per-season MoUs to transport cane from surplus to deficit areas.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Dr Poonam Satpute was diabetic, could have suffered hypoglycemia that led to her death, says forensic expert.A day after the body of gynaecologist Dr Poonam Satpute was found in her Andheri West flat, Amboli police registered a case of accidental death on Wednesday. Autopsy conducted on the 50-year-old doctor revealed that she died at least three days before the body was found.The death of the doctor, who suffered from diabetes over a period of time, shocked the medical community as the news broke on social media platforms. A forensic expert said Satpute is suspected to have suffered from hypoglycemia  low blood sugar levels  due to diabetes that led to her death. It seems she missed her meals or was in stress. She seems to have suffered a natural death, a forensic expert said.Satpute was known to be one of the first few gynaecologists in the city to use robotic surgeries. In over 24 years of her career, Satpute worked in Singapore heading a robotic surgery department in a private hospital. Later, she worked in Chennais Apollo Hospital before moving to Mumbai a few years ago. Satpute consulted with several private hospitals, including Cloud Nine, and earlier in Brahma Kumaris Global Hospital and Research Center.She was my batch mate from 1986 to 1991 in KEM hospital. It is a shock to us that she passed away, said Dr Niranjan Agrawal, the chairman of Network of AMC hospitals (NOAH). Gynaecologist Dr Sangeeta Pikale said Satpute was known to be energetic and vibrant. Pikale said: She was very bubbly. It is difficult to imagine she may even suffer from depression.The police do not suspect homicide. Autopsy findings stated there was no external injuries on the body. It was found in a semi-decomposed condition. We have preserved viscera sample for chemical analysis to check if there was any drug overdose, a forensic doctor said.According to the police, on Tuesday, Satputes neighbours complained of a foul smell from the doctors second-storey flat in Four Bungalows, Andheri, and alerted them. The body was found late on Tuesday evening. Satputes younger sister and parents also stay in Andheri but the family members claim that no one was in contact with her on a regular basis. We are trying to cope with this. Our family is in shock, Satputes sister Neelam said. According to relatives, Satpute lived alone in a rented flat. Her husband, who underwent a bypass surgery two months ago, lives in Chennai.She moved to a rented accommodation after our building went under redevelopment few years ago. Perhaps because it was Christmas and an extended weekend, the hospital thought she was on leave and did not get curious about her absence, an old neighbour of Satpute said. The doctors last rites were held in Amboli on Wednesday afternoon. The post-mortem had been conducted at Dr R N Cooper Hospital.On Wednesday, doctors discussed how stress levels have increased amongst medical professionals. Despite being doctors, our life span is reducing because of stress, gynaecologist Pikale said. Satputes last communication on Whatsapp, her colleagues said, was on December 23 around 11 pm. An officer from Amboli police station said an accidental death report had been registered at the police station in connection with the case.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Maharashtra as the top sugar producing state in the country.Sugar millers from Maharashtra, already bogged down by falling demand and price, now have to reckon with sugar from Uttar Pradesh. Thanks to the logistical advantage, sugar from the northern state is fast posing a challenge even in the traditional markets which were monopolised by Maharashtras sugar sectorSince the adoption of the wonder variety Co 0238, Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Maharashtra as the top sugar producing state in the country. Two consecutive droughts had also hurt Maharashtras sugar production, which has further cemented Uttar Pradeshs claim.This year, while Maharashtra is projected to produce 73 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar, UP is all set to touch the 100 lt production figure.This variety, developed by Dr Bakshi Ram, director of the Indian Council of Agriculture Researchs Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Comibatore, has helped both millers and farmers in Uttar Pradesh. The higher sucrose content in this variety has helped millers recover more sugar per tonne of cane crushed and for farmers, this variety has resulted in higher yield per acre.Millers from Maharashtra say that UP millers, thanks to increased sugar production, have now started making inroads into markets which were traditionally cornered by them like Delhi, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. To add to Maharashtra millers woes, UP millers enjoy logistical advantage  they are geographically nearer to these markets and thus charge less on transport costs. UPs domestic consumption is around 37-38 lt and as compared to its previous production records of 50-60 lt, this year it is all set to produce 100 lt of sugar. The excess sugar obviously challenges the markets which were traditionally captured by us, said a miller from Kolhapur.On Friday, cooperative and private millers from Maharashtra held a meeting to discuss the various issues plaguing the sector. BB Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA)  the apex body of private millers in Maharashtra  said they have decided to meet the chief minister early in January to discuss the issues. In view of the falling prices, payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers is becoming a major issue for us. Unless there are some policy level tweaks, the mills will soon not be in a position to pay the growers, he said.To arrest the falling prices, millers in Maharashtra want the creation of a buffer stock of 50 lt along with 100 per cent ban on imports. The millers also want the 20 per cent export duty on sugar to be waived off along with the Re 1.2 per unit cost levied on captive consumption of electricity generated by millers themselves.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
