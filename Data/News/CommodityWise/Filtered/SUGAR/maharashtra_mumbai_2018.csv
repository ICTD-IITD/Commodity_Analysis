We have been able to successfully tackle this through very strong training and certification programmes, and maintaining centralized quality through sourcing the best ingredients from all over India (for example, we source our cinnamon from Kerala and our tulsi from Uttarakhand, the two best sources for these ingredients). So the chai you get at Noida DLF Mall of India Chaayos is the same as what you would get in Bandra Chapel Road Chaayos, Mumbai. In spite of being an offline retail cafe chain, we always believed in solution technology. We have developed in-house technology for all the processes at Chaayos. We invest a lot into training our teams who go through a three-month certification programme, which is also powered by our technology solutions and it tracks the effectiveness of what has been taught. The next level of consistence and standardization will come through our chai machine, Chai Monk, which is already being deployed across all our cafes.Today, Chaayos is not only about drinking tea. What are the product innovations that you have done over the years and why?At Chaayos, our vision is to cater to each and every chai drinking occasion of our customers. To achieve this, we have worked extensively on product development and come up with many innovations, many of which have been suggestions given by our customers.Having the right chai for summer months was an important objectivethis helped us develop aam panna iced tea and kalakhatta iced tea as unique flavours in our summer menu. These are very Indian flavours but given a fusion twist when blended with iced tea, were blockbuster products during our summer months in 2016.Our customers requested more food options that go well with chai, especially on the slightly more filling meals side we came up with thepla tacos, a Mexican-Gujarati fusion dish, a loaded open paratha (a paratha loaded with filling and topped with cheese) and palak pasta crisps (palak pasta chaat with jalapeos and a tamarind mayo). These innovations have given us a distinct differentiated edge, and helped us maintain high repeat, as our customers always have something new to look forward to.We serve 25 varieties of hot chai that can be customized in 12,000 ways, says Verma.Our customers in business parks would often ask us for delivery to offices. So, we developed a disposable kettle packaging that keeps chai hot for an hour, which helped us deliver to offices and residential areas.We wanted to offer our customers a portable way to have their chai when they travelso we developed our RTM (ready to mix) chai, which just needs to be mixed with hot water to create your perfect masala chai. We have since partnered with SpiceJet and IRCTC to serve on board flights and trains.What goes into making that perfect cuppa?...we make sure to offer the exact tea, just the way you like it. We have multiple add-ons and flavours from across the country to ensure a great chai experience. So basically, a perfect cup of tea is all about using the best quality ingredients, a chai blend that is concocted at our base kitchen and served with lots of love.How many varieties of tea do you serve? Which ones are favourites with customers?We serve 25 varieties of hot chai that can be customized in 12,000 ways. Our most popular hot chais are kulhad chai, honey ginger lemon tea and gur wali chai. We also have a shahi chai which is like Indias answer to the hot chocolate.In cold, we have over 15 varieties that include iced teas, thandi chais (our masala chai frappe), fruit shakes and lemonades (Modinagar shikanji being a favourite). Our most popular cold beverages are aam panna iced tea, kalakhatta iced tea, Modinagar shikanji and thandi chai in saunf flavour.What are your future plans?Currently, Chaayos operates 53 cafes across Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Chandigarh, and we plan to be 70 cafe-strong by the end of this financial year. We are planning to expand to other metros and important tier-II cities in the coming year. We will continue to innovate in many other ways to reach our customers and create lots of memorable chai moments for everyone."

Subsequently, NMCs anti-encroachment squad removed the temporary sheds constructed in front the food joint.Dharampeth zones assistant municipal commissioner Mahesh Morone stated the restaurant was being illegally operated from a residential premises. The flat is registered in the name of one Meenakshi Kalra and has been given on rent to Yohan Doongaji. Doongaji reportedly converted the flat into a restaurant and made structural changes without any permission from the zone office.According to development control rules and Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, one cannot carry out commercial activity in a residential flat or an independent house, he said.It is not the first time that the zone office has taken action against The Bawas. In the past too, similar action was taken. At that time, the owner had assured to remove the illegal constructions on his own. Later he approached the district court. Recently, he lost the case following which on Tuesday, the anti-encroachment team led by assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Patil demolished the encroachments.The owner tried to seek more time claiming they had filed a revision petition in Mantralaya. Morone asked to see the stay order and as owner failed to produce it, the squad armed an excavator demolished the illegal construction.Other residents of the building have objected to running of eating joint there. Since its opening, traffic jams have increased as visitors park their vehicles on road because restaurant has no parking place of its own. On Saturdays and Sundays, it is difficult to move on the road from Jaika Motors to old VCA gate, which is a narrow lane, residents said.The restaurant owner showed many other violations carried out in the same apartments. Morone was informed about illegal extension by a lawyer and another office of JJ Construction (Sand and Steel suppliers), Brown Sugar and Anchal Boutique.During the drive, Jagadeesan Krishnamurthy, a resident of Utkarsh-Anuradha Apartments and other residents met Morone and pointed out that since 2006, the 150 flat owners here had complained over construction of kitchen in the basement of The Heritage Hotel. The kitchen is also located next to electrical transformer creating a hazard.Residents pointed out they had only one exit point and that is beside the hotel. If a fire erupted, they would've have no escape route. The residents around the hotel have lodged complaints with the authorities a number of times. When almost 150 residents from Prestige Apartments, Jaika Apartments, Hemchandra Apartments, Manav Apartments and Utkarsha Anuradha Apartments approached the civic bodys town planning department they got a reply confirming that the hotel had violated all norms.Morone assured them he would take action against all violations including the hotel and commercial usage of residential flats. He directed the zone to remove an illegal pan kiosk too."

Several new varieties have been developed and the near-extinct, indigenous varieties from the region are back in business. The reason being that varieties from Lucknow are fast gaining ground in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and west UP. Farmers in Malihabad are growing these varieties not for the fruit but to sell guava grafts to other states. Hundreds of nurseries have come up in the area to meet the growing demand of guava grafts from across the country. Arunachal Pradesh is the latest to have taken at least a lakh guava grafts from Malihabad in July this year. Since it is guava season at present, flowers and fruits could be seen on the grafts already.""Guava is being preferred for cultivation in different parts of the country due to its hardy nature and ability to give higher profits with limited inputs,"" said director, Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture CISH ), Lucknow, Shailendra Rajan.Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR )-CISH, Lucknow, has been instrumental in developing commercially viable varieties. Scientists at CISH have used hybridization and selection as a major tool for developing new varieties. Guava breeding aims at developing high-yield and high-quality varieties with fruits of uniform shape, good size, attractive colour of pulp and skin, high lycopene content, lesser and softer seeds and, at the same time, being suitable as a table variety and for processing purposes and having a wilt-resistant rootstock. That makes lab varieties Lalit, Shweta , Dhawal and Lalima are better than the ones growing naturally.Notable breeding program for guava improvement started about 30 years ago at CISH. So far, the institute has developed about 2,100 guava hybrids and about 1,000 half-sib population of famous varieties like Apple Colour and Allahabad Safeda.The institute's commercial varieties like Lalit and Shweta are being cultivated commercially in wide range of agro-climatic conditions due to their high yield, good fruit quality, responsiveness to pruning and wider adaptability. Lalit has an attractive saffron yellow colour with red blush, pink pulp, good blend of sugar and acid. It is suitable for both table and processing purposes.Shweta is an off-white fruit with pink blush, soft seeds and high yield. It is suitable as a rainy season crop and its area is extending to Punjab, Haryana and west UP."

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint$500 millionWhat is it? The size of the deal that India had placed with Israels state-owned defence contractor Rafael to buy Spike anti-tank guided missiles. It has now cancelled the order.Why is it important? This is reportedly due to reservations on the part of the Israeli firm to fully transfer the technology as per the Make in India provisions and the Indian defence ministry reportedly deciding to back state-owned Defence Research and Development Organisation, which has said it will develop a world-class missile within four years. Till then, Pakistani foot soldiers are likely to have an advantage over Indias as they possess portable anti-tank missiles that can strike Indian bunkers and tanks at a distance of 3-4 km, while Indias equivalent missile tanks have a range of 2 km.Tell me more: The order cancellation could be taken up for discussion during Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahus visit to India in a couple of weeks.100What is it? The number of people who were detained across Mumbai on Wednesday due to a bandh called by Dalit groups in Maharashtra.Why is it important?

The expected consolidated free cash flow of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 2017-18, according to international brokerage firm CLSA.Why is it important? If RIL meets the forecast, it would mean the end of a four-year run of negative cash flows, which is a measure of a companys overall financial health and performance. This is likely to put Indias biggest firm by market capitalisation on a strong footing as projects worth $40 billion would begin to deliver as capital expenditure declines. Recently, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said the firm aims to be among the top 20 companies in the world.Tell me more: The brokerage said the monetisation of refinery off-gas cracker and petcoke gasification plant would boost the operating income of RIL.

The deceased, Anant Ingole , hailing from Samnapur in Beed district, worked as a computer operator with the Vasanwadi gram panchayat in the district. He also ran an internet cafe and an agency which helped prepare PAN, Aadhaar and other documents for people.Ambad deputy SP Ramesh Sonawane told TOI, Ingole had come to Aurangabad around six months back and was attending a course in preparation for his banking exam. During this period, he got to know the suspect and had invested the money with him to buy the truck. The vehicle was rented out to a Mumbai firm, which recently stopped its operations. Ingole then started asking the partner to return his money.Sonawane said that when matters began coming to a head, the partner, identified only as Dhumal, called up Ingole on Monday saying he wanted to discuss returning the money. Dhumal took Ingole in his car in which the other two suspects were already seated. They stopped at a dhaba in Pachod where they allegedly forced Ingole to consume alcohol.Sonawane said the trio took Ingole to Shahagad-Patharvala near Kuran phata in Ambad division of Jalna district. There, they assaulted him and tied his hands and legs. One of them illegally fetched petrol in a bottle from a petrol pump. They threw the petrol on Ingole and set him ablaze, he said.While at the dhaba, Ingole got a call from his friend Tukaram Gholap in Beed, who is also a gram sevak. Ingole told him that he was at the dhaba with Dhumal and two others. A couple of hours later, Gholap again called Ingole, who informed him that he was facing a threat to his life from the trio. Gholap called up a friend in Aurangabad, who contacted a policeman attached to the Pachod police. They went to a few dhabas in the area but got no information about Ingole.Ingole had also sent a text message to his older brother, Govind, who is a civil engineer in Pune. In the message, Ingole had mentioned that he was with Dhumal who owed him Rs 21lakh. He also told his brother about the threat to his life.A security guard employed with the Beed-based Samarth cooperative sugar factory saw the burning body and informed the Gondi police. A team headed by inspector Machindra Survase went to the spot. Ingoles identity was known from his PAN and Aadhaar lying nearby. The police contacted his family which identified the body."

Photo: MintMumbai: Ahead of the start of earnings season, domestic rating agency Crisil on Wednesday said it expects India companiess revenue growth to hit a five-year high of 9% for the October-December 2017 period.However, profits will continue to contract, primarily due to the rising commodity prices, the note by its research wing said. The aggregate topline of companies in key sectors will grow 9% over same period last year on higher realisations in steel, aluminium, cement and crude oil-linked sectors, and a pick-up in consumption-driven sectors such as auto and aviation, its research wing said.The revenue growth, which comes after a broadbased improvement in the preceding second quarter that was taken as a prelude to a cyclical upturn, is ahead of inflation by a meaningful margin now, Crisil Ratings senior director Prasad Koparkar said. He added for FY18, it expects a revenue increase of 8-9% for the listed companies.The research wing disclosed that its estimate is for companies across key sectors, representing 70% of the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies. Export linked sectors such as information technology and pharmaceuticals will disappoint, along with telecom where the incumbents are forced to slash tariffs due to aggressive play by the newcomer Reliance Jio.With the goods and services tax (GST)-related worries abating and trade channels reverting to normalcy, the consumption linked sectors are expected to be the primary drivers of revenue growth for the second half of the fiscal. The consumption-linked sectors excluding telecom had reported a 15% revenue growth in the second quarter.For the first two quarters, companies have reported a revenue growth of 6% despite the impact of GST implementation, it said, adding that if not for the reverses in telecom, the revenue growth would have come at 10%.From a profitability perspective, there can be a contraction of up to 1.30% in the pre-tax profits. EBIDTA margin fell for 8 of 21 sectors in the second quarter of this fiscal, and we expect this trend to continue. A contraction of 1-1.30 per cent in aggregate EBIDTA margin in the third quarter would intensify pressures because theres little latitude to control cost amid rising commodity prices, its director Hetal Gandhi said.Telecom services, pharma, sugar and housing will see the sharpest fall in margins, it said, adding that had it not been for these, the overall pre-tax margins for key sectors would have declined by only 0.40% in the third quarter of the fiscal."

Most excited among them are this years newlyweds and new parents who will be celebrating their very first Makar Sankranti adorned in fineries and the conventional Halwyache Dagine or sugar jewellery, amid hollers of tilgul ghya, goad goad bola. The festival falling on ameans more cheer for revellers as amidst the fast pace of city life, most traditions are being altered to suit convenience. Today however, the celebrations will be an elaborate affair, with ceremonies like suneche tilavan (welcoming the new bride) and balache bornhan being highlights.Maharashtrians residing in Bhopal and Indore ensure they follow all the traditions handed down by elders of the community. For newlyweds Pranay and Sharwari Gajbe, the lady of the house, Karuna Gajbe, got their customary look sorted. My son Pranay got married last weekend and this weekend we get to celebrate suneche tilavan for our daughter-in-law Sharwari. We wanted to make this a memorable event for the couple which is why a typical Marathi silk sari and halwyache dagine were ordered from our native place in Maharashtra. Though the jewellery is available here as well, the craftsmanship is different, shares Karuna. Sharwari, on the other hand, is excited to witness the festivities as a new bride, Im excited to wear the black silk sari my mother-in-law has got for me. Even she is going to don the traditional nauwari for the occasion, along with my elder sister-in-law. The family will converge at our in-laws place and they have even planned a menu with til laddoos, gulachi poli and more.The customary sugar jewellery, halwyache dagine, is sugar candies made out of roasted sesame seeds combined with sabudana and sugar powder. Smita Amol Chandwadkar, who makes the jewellery on order in Indore, explains, In ancient times, ladies used to make the jewellery at home. Today people either order from Maharashtra or some Maharashtrian stores in Krishnapura and Rambagh in Indore. I take orders for kamarbandhs, mukuts, bangles, necklaces and mathapatti for new brides and small ornaments like anklets, for new-born babies. Chandwadkar also sells and offers the jewellery on rent through social media portals. Neeta Thakur, who is conducting the ceremony for her daughter-in-law, ordered through WhatsApp. We are a Rajput family, but have a sweet Maharashtrian daughter-in-law Soudamini, for whom we will be conducting the ceremony. We sought help from her parents and they got us in touch with the ladies from the community who have been selling customised sugar jewellery online. We placed an order two weeks ago, and today she will wear it for the celebration, she informs.The quintessential black sari too holds a special significance. Irawati Paranjape, 68, matriarch of the Paranjape household in Bhopal and an erstwhile Marathi language teacher from Pune, shares, There is no religious significance of the black sari, but as the festival falls in the peak of winter, black is the preferred colour as it absorbs heat and keeps the wearer warm. Even men wear black on Sankranti. The week following Makar Sankranti will be marked by haldi-kumkum celebrations at various households, where Maharashtrian ladies will apply auspicious colours on each other and exchange sweets and gifts. English teacher, Snehal Deshmukh, 28, who will be hosting her second year of haldi-kumkum celebrations adds, Its a week full of revelry for our community as we welcome the new year with hopes of full harvest and prosperity. Food on this occasion will consist primarily of fruits specific to the season  like ber and amla  and of course more dishes with healthy helping of til (sesame) and gud (jaggery).While the Maharashtrian community will celebrate with tilgul and kites, the Punjabi community finished up royally with a night full of dancing around bonfires and getting decked up in vivid colours of the state. The ladies of Bhopal-based Agroha Ladies club made sure they left no stone unturned as they tuned up in their brightly coloured Patialas, parandas and jootis and danced away around the Lohri. Freshly harvested gehu (wheat) and rebdi was also offered to the fire as families shared popcorn and other sweets."

Sugar prices have fallen in the last one month and are expected to remain low for the coming months.The price of sugar in the retail markets in major cities have dipped Rs 1-4 per kg in the last one month while the rates have slumped by up to Rs 9 in some cities in the northeastern states, according to government data.While industry sources claimed the retail prices would not to go beyond Rs 40-42 per kg till the 2017-18 sugar season ends in September, the government said the price trend of will be clear by February.Enforcement of a cap on the stock limit for a longer period due to the Gujarat elections is said to be the major reason for the situation, which, millers said, has become ""loss-making"" for them.""The picture will be clear by February how prices are going to move. However, prices this year should be at comfortable and reasonable levels for consumers to procure from the market,"" Subhasish Panda, Joint Secretary (Sugar) of the Department of Public Distribution, told IANS.Retail prices differ from place to place but the average price in the major cities is currently hovering around Rs 40 per kg and industry sources anticipate they could even fall to Rs 38 in the coming months.In Delhi and Mumbai, the prices have come down from Rs 41 on December 14 to Rs 40 on January 14, as per the figures provided by the Consumer Affairs Ministry.Similarly, the prices have decreased by Rs 1 in Kolkata, by Rs 2 in Chennai and by Rs 3 in Lucknow.In the case of Gangtok, Imphal and Vijaywada, the dip is substantial as prices fell by Rs 9, Rs 8 and Rs 5, respectively, in just 30 days.The current situation is against the fundamentals of pricing and retailers were making money, the sugar producers said.Some of them held the government's decision to put a cap on the stock limit for a longer time responsible for the dip in prices, which are leading to losses at the production level.""The government could not lift the cap on the stock limit by the traders till December 19 due to the Gujarat elections. When it was removed, the festival season had almost come to end. Post-Christmas, the demand goes down,"" said one miller, who wished not to be named.The cap restricted traders from storing over 500 tonnes, Similarly, there was a cap on the mills -- not over eight per cent of total production in October and 21 per cent in November.According to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF), sugar production this year has been better as about 501 mills across the country have produced 125.20 lakh tonnes of sugar till January 10, as against 97.40 lakh tonnes during the same period last year.The demand from the market has slowed down, causing lower returns to the sugar mills.At present, the ex-mill sugar realisation ranges between Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,350 per quintal at the national level, while the production cost is about Rs 3,400 Rs 3,500, millers said.Notably, the ex-mill price was above Rs 3,500 per quintal till the cap on the stock limit was in force.The government is expecting the sugar industry would recover as demand increases in due course of time, but the millers are saying otherwise.According to the people from the industry, the demand was likely to increase in the Indian peninsular region in March and in the northern parts of the country in June as sugar consumption goes up during summer.However, it would not have much impact on the prices owing to the prediction of higher production in 2017-18, they said.""The prices will range between Rs 38-40 at least till October. Even if there is a surge, it will not go over Rs 42 in major cities. The government is comfortable with it,"" one miller said.In 2016-17, the government was seen taking several steps such as the cap on stock limit and higher duties to arrest the price rise in the domestic markets in the wake of low production."

Photo: BloombergMumbai: Indian sugar processors have undermined their own margins in order to meet government mandates on when to pay cane farmers, which required them to sell supply onto the market at the same time they agreed to pay more for sugar cane.India, the worlds second-biggest sugar producer, requires the processors to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. The mills agreed in May to pay the farmers 11% more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year, which started on 1 October.Many mills struggled to raise funds from local banks to make the payments, said a senior official at the Sahyadri co-operative sugar factory based in Maharashtra.This has caused some mills to have fallen behind on the payments by an estimated 20 billion rupees ($312 million), said a government official who declined to be named.To meet the funding shortfall, mills boosted sugar sales which has caused the refined sugar market to drop by 13.1% to 3,189.50 rupees ($49.77) per 100 kg.The liquidity crunch forced a few mills to make distress sales. Sensing mills problems, traders also tried to bring down prices, said B.B. Thombre, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).The rapid decline in sugar prices means margins in the current year are likely to be lower than the previous year, said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugars , the countrys biggest refiner.The mills agreed to pay the higher cane prices expecting stable refined sugar prices, but have been caught out by the slump.The fall could slash profits for companies like Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Shree Renuka, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars by at least 15% from a year ago, said a Mumbai-based sector analyst with a brokerage.Mills raw material cost has gone up, but prices of the finished product, sugar, are falling, said the analyst, who was not authorised to speak to media.Simbhaoli Sugars said it is difficult to comment on margins now, while Dwarikesh and Balrampur declined to comment, citing regulations that limit communications before quarterly results, due in the next few weeks.Sugar prices may remain under pressure as the countrys sugar output in the next season could rise above the record 28.3 million tonnes produced in 2014/15, said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.It is now difficult to pay the assured price to farmers unless government intervenes to support prices, said WISMAs Thombre.The central government fixes the price that mills must pay growers annually, but some cane growing areas, especially the state of Uttar Pradesh, raise the price further to satisfy the demands of cane growers, a key voting bloc.

Photo: MintNew Delhi: Sugar production in India is likely to be 26.1 million tonnes in 2017-18, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said on Thursday, raising its production forecast for the year by 4%. In early January ISMA had estimated production at 25.1 million tonnes.The latest estimate implies a 29% increase in sugar output year-on-year, from 20.3 million tonnes in 2016-17. Surplus production could lead to a decline in wholesale prices and pending payments to cane farmers.As of 15 December, Rs7,500 crores was due to cane farmers across India, according to ISMA. The current dues are lower than the dues of over Rs21,000 crore seen in 2015 following years of surplus production.Higher production in the 2017-18 sugar season (October to September) is due to better rains in growing areas and new varieties cultivated in Uttar Pradesh. Indias annual consumption of the sweetener is estimated at 25 million tonnes, leaving room for exports.Several sugar mills were unable to pay cane price to the farmers because of the recent fall in sugar prices which have started falling below the cost of production, ISMA said in a statement. It added that there was concern about sugarcane farmers getting affected due to their cane price arrears accumulating.Increasing dues to cane growers will worsen farm distress in states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka where falling prices of crops like pulses and oilseeds have led to a dip in farm incomes.To deal with the problem ISMA said it met the government twice this week. According to the association the government could initiate steps like mandating sugar exports for every mill. According to its statement, ISMA also requested the government to raise import duties to 100% (from the current 50%) to stop imports from Pakistan.ISMA said it is exploring possibilities of preferential import duties for Indian sugar for exports to neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. If this happens early, it will ensure that all the extra stocks from India can get disposed of very fast, ISMA said."

According to revenue department figures, 1,753 of these cases, which account for 60% of the total, were recorded after the loan waiver was announced in June.Despite the waiver, the number of suicides fell just 4.4% over the previous year. In 2016, the state saw 3,052 suicides.Yet, one region in the state saw a rise in cases. The sugar belt of Western Maharashtra reported 102 cases in 2017 compared to 75 in 2016, a rise of 36%.The Vidarbha region, from where chief minister Devendra Fadnavis hails, continued to report the highest number of cases. The region reported 1,344 farmer suicides in 2017, just 7% lower than the previous year. The five districts of the Amravati division saw a decline of only 20 cases since last year while the Nagpur division recorded a decline of 80 cases.By the end of 2017, cotton farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada had to contend with a massive pest attack of the pink bollworm. Vidarbha also faced another form of distress -- as many as 51 farm labourers died after the use of toxic pesticides in spraying operations. However, these figures are collated separately.Arid Marathwada reported 991 suicides in 2017, which was 5.8% lower than the previous year. North Maharashtra recorded 475 cases, almost on par with the 479 cases recorded in 2016. Konkan recorded five suicides in 2017, while in 2016 not a single case was reported.The government maintains the loan waiver will not bring down the number of farmer suicides and the solution is increasing investment in agriculture. The roll-out process was delayed initially owing to the lengthy verification process.Farm activists point to inefficient delivery of the loan waiver. There were so many eligibility criteria for the loan waiver that a large number of debt-ridden farmers were excluded and have been unable to benefit from it, says Ajit Navale from the Kisan Sabha.In some cases, money for the loan waiver has reached the banks, but farmers are yet to receive fresh crop loans, points out farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. He points out that crop pricing is yet to improve without which indebtedness will continue in the farm sector. Cotton prices are currently at Rs 5,200 per quintal, down from around 5,700 per quintal at this time last year, he pointed out."

We value each persons life equally. Under the ease of doing business initiative, we have eased processes including allowing shops and establishments to remain open for 24 hours, we have freed them from the inspector raj, introducing self-certification among other moves. So, it becomes their responsibility to ensure safety of workers in their establishment. There should be no negligence. We will now come out with an industrial safety policy for establishments and factories including a chapter on stringent norms for shops, eateries, etc. This will be a state safety policy, and we will fix the responsibility on the owners for such incidents.Is self-certification, under the garb of ease of doing business, has led to non-compliance with required norms?There are two sides to it. Those who are honestly doing their businesses will be troubled by some peoples action of not complying with norms while self-certifying. Our attempt is to protect such honest businessmen and to ensure that they are not troubled. And those who are not complying with norms will be punished for their acts.What is the biggest challenge in implementation of the 247 policy for shops and establishment?Womens safety will remain the most important aspect. The number of working women is not very high. By ensuring their safety, we hope to increase their numbers, and that will help to contribute to the nations growth.The labour department has proposed easing norms for factory closure without mandating permissions from the government. But labour unions have strongly objected. Whats your stand on it? I personally agree with the labour unions view completely. The amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act are just a proposal that came from the Union government. Some of the states have implemented it. We will discuss the matter extensively with labour unions to find a middle path to ensure that laborers rights are protected and also that industries do not migrate away from the state due to certain provisions in law.There is around Rs 6,000 crore in funds with the Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. Non-utilisation has been criticised repeatedly. Do you have plans for welfare of construction labourers?I admit that we have not been able to register the majority of construction workers with us. But we have increased the registration of construction workers substantially from last year. Now, we aim to register around 15 lakh construction workers, out of approximately 27 lakh, over the next one year. With construction workers registered, we will now introduce various schemes worth Rs 3,000 crore. These include the Maha Kamgar Awas Yojana for residences, training programmes for them, an essential kit and also midday meals.Despite having a large number of construction workers in the state, only around 3 lakh are registered. how will you make sure benefits of the proposed schemes reach larger numbers of workers?Earlier, there was a procedure to renew registrations every year. Now, we have changed the provision to renew it after five years. So, once a construction worker is registered with, he will be eligible to avail all the benefits and schemes for five years. One of the major reasons behind the low registration of construction workers is that the units where the construction laborers work are not interested in registering workers with us. It was due to a fact that the liability for any accidents will be on these owners. Now, we have made a provision that it is mandatory for all such units to register the workers with us. We have also decided that if a worker who is not registered is killed on site in an accident, he will be treated as a registered worker and will be given all benefits.The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) office in Solapur has issued notices to 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur, asking them to start extending EPF benefits to sugarcane laborers, but factories have refused to do so.The cane laborers are in the unorganised sector. The sugar factories have created this process so that the liabilities related to cane harvesting laborers is not on them. This system was prepared by the then government and all the factory owners. I feel that sugar factories must give EPF to the cane laborers. As the factories have so much money, they should not have any problem in extending EPF benefits to them.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Out of this, Rs 12,690.43 crore is the amount due within 14 days of cane delivery. But as per official data, mills have so far paid only Rs 10,582.34 crore, translating into arrears of Rs 2,108.09 crore.Mills in the state started crushing operations this time on October 25. Significantly, till about a month ago, the unpaid dues werent much. In fact, cane arrears on December 1 were minus Rs 141.01 crore, as mills paid more than what was due before 14 days. The arrears rose to Rs 304.09 crore on December 15 and Rs 851.20 crore by December 29, before spiraling to over Rs 2,100 crore.These would only mount further because we have crushed only 485.93 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produced 49.73 lt sugar till now. Sugar output will top 100 lt this season and we are still barely halfway, said a Bijnor-based miller.Also Read | A new supply problem: Harvesting labour shortage adds to Maharashtra mill woesHe attributed the rising arrears to ex-factory sugar prices in UP crashing from over Rs 37 per kg at the seasons start to Rs 31.50-31.75 now. They were ruling at Rs 34 even in December-end, but have since plunged below Rs 32, which makes paying the SAP near-impossible, he claimed.But the problem isnt limited to UP. Maharashtra mills have also run up arrears of Rs 1,843.80 crore, based on latest data till January 15: Out of the Rs 8,342.20 crore due to growers at the Centres fair and remunerative price (FRP), they have collectively paid only Rs 6,632.93 crore, with some mills paying more than the FRP. On Wednesday, ex-factory rates of S-30 grade sugar from Maharashtra, at Rs 28.5-29 per kg, were even lower than for UP.A miller from Sangli blamed the situation entirely on traders manipulating the market. The 2017-18 season began with sugar stocks of 40 lt. That, together with projected production of 261 lt, translates into total availability of 301 lt. After deducting domestic consumption of 250 lt, the ending stocks on September 30 would be 51 lt.That is equal to 2.5 months of consumption, which is also the prescribed normative opening stock requirement. Given this fine supply-demand balance, how are prices being driven down like this?, the miller pointed out.However, Praful Vithalani, president of the All India Sugar Trade Association, attributed competition among millers to sell as the main reason for prices sliding. Mills believe that sugar output would go up significantly in 2018-19 and, hence, want to sell more now. And when prices are falling like this, traders obviously want to buy less, he noted.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo: Daniel Stephen) A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen)Sugar mills in Maharashtra are in their third month of crushing, but the Javali unit of the Kisan Veer Satara Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana is yet to start operations for the current 2017-18 season (October-September). The reason: An acute shortage of cane harvesting labourers or oosh thodni kamgar, as they are called in Marathi.Their supply is down 50 per cent this season. Even our mills at Wai and Khandala were, till recently, running at below capacity. We have never faced such a serious labour crisis, complains Madan Prataprao Bhosale, chairman of the cooperative combine, whose all three units are in Satara district.The 2016-17 sugar season in Maharashtra was marked by low availability of cane following two consecutive droughts. Factories could crush just 373.13 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produce 42 lt of sugar, the lowest since 2004-05. This time, there is no dearth of cane, with mills already crushing 525.21 lt and producing 55.68 lt of sugar as on January 22. They may end up crushing over 680 lt, resulting in sugar output rebounding to 72-73 lt.But the current season has also witnessed a significant shortage of harvesting labourers, drawn mostly from Marathwada (especially Beed, Jalna and Osmanabad districts) and North Maharashtra (Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon). The former belong mainly to the OBC (other backward class) Vanjari community, while the latter are predominantly Adivasi tribals. The regions from where they come are drought-prone. The income from harvesting of cane grown in the irrigated lands of western and southern Maharashtra is what sustains them.While cane harvesting usually begins after Diwali, mills negotiate with muqaddams (contractors) for supply of labourers  an estimated 7-8 lakh of them are engaged during the season  well ahead of crushing. The muqaddams, many of whom are erstwhile labourers themselves, are paid a booking amount during June-July. That is when the mills would have made an assessment of their requirement based on the availability of cane. The booking cost, interestingly, depends on the vehicle that the labourers would use to transport the harvested cane from the field to the mill. Thus, booking a bullock cart that can accommodate two labourers  usually a husband-wife team  may cost Rs 50,000. It would be more, around Rs 90,000, for a tractor-trailer capable of bringing 6-8 labourer pairs. The bullock carts are usually owned by the labourers, while the tractor-trailer belongs to the muqaddam.A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen) A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen)The above time-honoured arrangement has, however, taken a huge knock in the current season. Maharashtra mills are reporting an average 15-20 per cent drop in the normal supply of cane harvesting labourers, with some pegging it even higher. The Kisan Veer Satara cooperative reckons that only 3,000-4,000 labourers  out of the 7,000-8,000 necessary for the full-capacity running of its three mills  have joined duty this time.Suryakant Patil, managing director of the Mohanrao Shinde cooperative sugar mill at Miraj in neighbouring Sangli district, estimates a shortfall of over 1,000 kamgars relative to his factorys requirement of 5,000. Our crushing capacity is 4,000 tonnes per day, whereas we are now doing only 3,200-3,600 tonnes. Even that we are managing by getting the existing cane harvesting labourers to work double shifts, as against a normal single 6-8 hour shift. But that will become difficult after February, when temperatures rise and doing two shifts gets difficult, admits Patil.The unprecedented labour shortfall is being attributed to two factors. The first is good monsoon rains (both southwest and northeast) in Marathwada and North Maharashtra, which has spurred local agricultural activity and reduced the incentive to seek seasonal migration work. I had tied up with 15 bullock-cart labourer teams. Four of them returned the booking amount and decided to stay back to tend to their wheat and chana (chickpea) crops. Theres enough water for rabi plantings this time, says Bharat Dongre, a muqaddam attached to the Sahyadri cooperative mill at Karad in Satara and who sources kamgars from Ahmednagar districts Jamkhed taluka.The second reason has to do with the migration of labour to Karnataka and Gujarat, where mills are learnt to be paying more. Maharashtra factories are currently giving Rs 198 for harvesting every tonne of cane to bullock-cart labour teams and Rs 228 per tonne to those working on tractor-trailers, with these adjusted against the initial booking amount. There is a separate 18.5 per cent commission for the muqaddam, payable on the harvesting charge. The muqaddam or tractor-trailer owner also charges (depending upon the distance) an average Rs 650 per tonne for taking the harvested cane to the mill. In case of transport by bullock cart, there is no payment in cash and the labourer only gets the green tops (leaves) that remain after the sugarcane is harvested. The cane tops, which are fed to his animals, are given free of cost.Gujarat and Karnataka mills are paying Rs 30-40 per tonne more. The current agreement (signed in 2014 between Maharashtras sugar industry and the Todni Vahatuk Sanghatana representing cane harvesting labourers) provides for just a 20 per cent rate increase over five years, alleges D L Karad, president of the Maharashtra Sugarcane Cutting and Transport Workers Union. His union, affiliated to the CPM-backed Centre of Indian Trade Unions, has given a notice for termination of the existing agreement. We have called for a strike in the next (2018-19) season demanding better pay, he adds.The threat from labour shortage is, nevertheless, turning into an opportunity for mechanised sugarcane harvester makers. The Kisan Veer Satara cooperative has, in the current season, deployed 15 such machines that would harvest roughly a tenth of the cane supplied to its Wai and Khandala mills. We will add another 26 machines by the next season. These are either our own or procured by entrepreneurs/farmer groups against bank loans, for which we would provide collateral in the form of guaranteed work. Mechanisation is the only way out of labour troubles, states Bhosale.His enthusiasm isnt shared, though, by others. Suryakant Patil notes that while his mill has invested in two mechanised harvesters, they are not being used. These machines need large unbroken tracts of cane. In contrast, most of our cane holdings are small and fragmented, he points out. But Bhosale feels this isnt an insurmountable problem. The equipment manufacturers have made changes to the machines to adapt them to our field conditions. We, in turn, have induced farmers to effect changes to their planting practices, such as maintaining a 4-4.5 feet distance between cane rows, as opposed to the prevalent 3-3.5 feet norm. It does not affect cane yields, even while allowing the machines to easily operate in the fields, he explains.All this is obviously music to the likes of New Holland Agriculture. The Italian agricultural machinery major, which assembles Case IH sugarcane harvesters at its facility in Chakan (Pune), has sold 270-plus machines in Maharashtra since 2010. The machinery owners are charging Rs 338-400 per tonne, more than the Rs 198-228 rate for manual harvesting. But the machines have the capacity to harvest 15-20 tonnes of cane per hour. That would translate into covering an acre in four hours time, which takes two days for a 6-8 labourer-pair team.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sugar prices (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) declined to Rs 33,000-Rs 33,500 per tonne in January from Rs 36,000-Rs 36,500 in November. They were ruling at Rs 37,000-Rs 37,500 per tonne in September-October last year.Based on the current cane-crushing trends, we estimate domestic sugar production at around 26 million MT (metric tonnes) against an earlier estimate of 25 million MT in December 2017, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice-president & group head, ICRA Ratings.This will translate into an increase in sugar production by 28% in SY (sugar year) 2018 from 20.3 million MT in SY 2017, mainly driven by an expected recovery in production in the key sugar-producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka, supported by relatively better monsoons during 2016 and 2017, he said.Further, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is also expected to touch an all-time high of around 10.2 million MT in SY 2018, supported by higher acreage and better cane variety, resulting in higher yields and recovery rates, Majumdar added.Upward revision in sugar production estimate along with most mills liquidating the produce to repay cane payments resulted in correction in sugar prices in January, he said.While short-term pressure is likely to remain on sugar prices during this quarter, ICRA anticipates prices to stabilise in the coming quarter, although at somewhat lower levels than those anticipated earlier. Closing stocks are likely to remain comfortable at around 5-5.5 million MT, the agency said."

However, the District Central Cooperative (DCC) Bank, Osmanabad, has got a stay against the EPF offices move, saying the sugar factory owes it Rs 227 crore in dues.Officials from the EPF office in Solapur said that the sugar factory was seized in 2015 after it failed to pay the EPF from 2008 to 2011. As per the norms, an inquiry was conducted to fix the EPF dues, including the fine and interest. The EPF dues are approximately Rs 12 crore of around 1,200 employees, said an official. The official further said that the e-auction process was initiated by the office and the Metal Scrap Trading Corporation was given the task for the auction. If any company or factory is closed or is in liquidation, then the EPF dues of the employees should be given first by selling its property, as per the EP Act, said an official from the regional EPF commissioner in Solapur.However, the DCC Bank, Osmanabad, had moved the Bombay High Court against the EPF offices move of auctioning the factory, seeking a stay on it. After the factory failed to pay the loan taken from us, we had seized the factory in 2012. Now, our total dues from the sugar factory is around Rs 227 crore. So, we moved the High Court and got a stay on the EPF offices auction earlier this week, said Vijay Ghonse Patil, managing director of the DCC Bank, Osmanabad.Patil further said the EPF office cant auction it when the managing director of the DCC Bank has been appointed as the official liquidator for it. We have communicated to them. If there are any EPF dues, then they should write to us and will consider them at the time of auction, he added. Officials from the DCC Bank, Osmanabad, said the auction has been pending as the sugar factory management has challenged the DCC Banks seizure action in the Debt Recovery Tribunal, which ruled in favour of the sugar factory. The tribunals order has been challenged by the DCC Bank in the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal and the case is still pending, said an official from the bank.However, officials from the EPF office said that it has now deferred the auction process and would move the High Court against the stay. We will move the High Court to ensure that the EPF dues are given on priority at the time of auction and will request the court to direct the DCC Bank to give an undertaking for it, said an official.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

5b2d6dde9855b723c6f4609e,A Republic of Inhospitality,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/republic-day-muslims-intolerance-beef-ban-bjp-dalits-hamid-ansari-5040847/,2018-01-30,"Dalit protest in Mumbai (Express Photo/Arul Horizon) Dalit protest in Mumbai (Express Photo/Arul Horizon)As India celebrates Republic Day, and the chests of millions of Indians swell with pride at the thought of our immense diversity and imagined military prowess, it is well to reflect on what kind of Republic the country has become. A republican form of government is not merely one in which the head of state is not a hereditary monarch; rather, the modern republic rests on the idea that sovereignty resides in the people, and that the will of the people, as expressed through their representatives, is supreme.What has, however, been critical to the idea of the republic everywhere is the notion of inclusiveness. In this respect, the stories that have been coming out of India in recent years tell a tale that is chilling to the bones, a tale which leaves behind a stench that no amount of sloganeering about Swachh Bharat or even something more than a symbolic wielding of the broom can eradicate.If inclusiveness is the touchstone of a Republic, what is characteristic of India today is how increasingly large constituencies are being excluded from the nation. Muslims and Dalits have been hounded, garroted, and lynched; the working class is being trampled upon; the Adivasi is nothing more than an obstacle course for a mining company. None of this is news, some might argue; perhaps things have only become worse. Such a view is profoundly mistaken because whatever India may have been in the past, it has never been, certainly not to the extent it is today, a Republic of Inhospitality.There are other ways, too, of understanding the pass at which we have arrived. On his last day of office some months ago, the Vice President, Hamid Ansari, warned that Muslims were feeling increasingly insecure in India and that there was a corrosion of Indian values. His successor, Venkaiah Naidu, was dismissive of these remarks and shot back, Some people are saying minorities are insecure. It is a political propaganda. Compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due. What Naidu, and the Prime Minister, who likewise took a dig at the departing Vice President, failed to understand was Ansaris unease at the fact that India no longer seemed a hospitable place to him. India does not even remotely feel like a hospitable place to the Africans who have been set upon by mobs or to those from the Northeast who have been humiliated and killed since they seem too much like the Chinesealiens all.More than anything else, India has long been a land of hospitality. I use the word hospitality with deliberation and with the awareness that our present crop of middle-class Indians who study hotel management and business administration with gusto will assume that I am speaking of the hospitality industry. There is a different story to be told here about how some of the richest words in the English language have been hijacked for the narrowest purposes. I use hospitality in the place of tolerance since both the right and the left have demonstrated their intolerance for tolerance. To liberals and the left in India, all discussion of Hindu tolerance is merely a conceit and at worst a license to browbeat others into submission. Surprisingly, but perhaps not, the advocates of Hindutva are equally unenthusiastic about proclaiming the virtues of Hindu tolerance. It was Hindu tolerance that, in their view, made the Hindus vulnerable to the depredations of foreign invaders. Hindu tolerance is only for the weak and the effete.What, then, does it mean to speak of the culture of hospitality that has long characterized India and that is eroding before our very eyes, turning this ancient land into a most inhospitable place not only for foreign tourists, African students, and the various people of northeast India but even for the greater majority of its own citizens?We may take as illustrative of this culture of hospitality three narratives that are humbling in their complex simplicity. There is a story that is often told about the coming of the Parsis to India, although some doubt its veracity. As they fled Iran, so the story goes, they were stopped on the border as they sought to make their way into India. The Indian king already had far too many people in his dominions and could not accommodate any more refugees. The cup was full. The Parsis are said to have responded, We shall be like the sugar that sweetens the cup of milk.Those who wish to make the story plausible will offer dates and there may be mention of the political dynasty that prevailed in Western India in the 8th century with whom the first batch of Parsis would have come into contact. The story may well be apocryphal, though if that is the case it is wholly immaterial: its persistence suggests something not only about the tenor of those times but the continuing attractiveness of the idea that those who came to India have each, in their own fashion, sweetened the pot and added something to the country.But there may have been many other registers of hospitality in India, as Tagore sought to explain to his audience on a visit to China. The Mahsud, a Pathan tribe inhabiting the South Waziristan Agency in what is now the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) in Pakistan, were being bombed from the air. A plane crash-landed in one of the villages; the pilot was trying, not very successfully, to lift himself out of the plane which was already on fire. Though the villagers had been plummeted by this very pilot, they ran to the plane and lifted him out of the cockpit; he was wounded, but they nursed him back to health, and some weeks later he made his way back to England.It was a culture indeed an ideal of hospitality, and their notion of dharma, that made the villagers act as they did; however, as Tagore tellingly adds, their behavior was the product of centuries of culture and was difficult of imitation.Though Nehru shepherded the country after independence, it was Mohandas Gandhi more than anyone else who was committed to the constituent idea of the Republic, that is inclusivity and what I have described as hospitality. It is, therefore, fitting that my last story should end with him.Gandhi was a staunch vegetarian, but he often had visitors to the ashram who were accustomed to having meat at nearly every meal. He took it upon himself to ensure that they were served meat; and he also adhered to the view that if he had insisted that they conform to the rules of the ashram and confine themselves to vegetarian food, he would be visiting violence upon them. Although reams and reams have been written upon his notion of ahimsa, little has been said of how hospitality was interwoven into his very notion of nonviolence.And, yet, it is in this very India that Muslims and Dalits have been killed on the mere suspicion of eating, hoarding, and transporting beef.

5b16275d9855b744d6394591,"Cashews can improve good cholesterol levels, says study",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cashews-can-improve-good-cholesterol-levels-says-study/articleshow/62782132.cms,2018-02-05,"Chennai: Cashew nut is the latest entrant into the list of fatty foods that have cracked their unhealthy tag. A palm full of these nuts a day could help reduce blood pressure and improve the level of good cholesterol, a new study has found.The findings, published recently in peer-reviewed Journal of Nutrition, is based on a study of 300 people in Chennai with type-2 diabetes. Half of them were asked to consume 30 grams of unsalted, raw, broken cashew nuts a day. At the end of three months, various parameters were studied: their blood pressure  usually high among those with diabetes  had dropped by 5mm. Their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, dubbed the good cholesterol, had increased by 2 milligram. There was no deleterious effect on the body weight or sugar levels.While studies across the world have shown the benefits of other nuts like almonds and walnuts, little has been done on cashews  considered a rich nut that adds flavor (and fat) to Indian curries and sweets.Nuts are rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)  the good fats. Current Indian diets are high on carbohydrates  derived largely from polished rice and refined wheat  which account for 64% of total energy intake, and low on MUFAs, which provide just 7-8% of the total energy. The recommended intake is 15-20%.Dr V Mohan of Madras diabetes research foundation and lead author of the study said unlike other nuts, cashew has higher amount of saturated fats  the bad fats found in oily food, ghee and meat.Around 20% of the fat in cashew nut is of the saturated variety. We wanted to check if this type of saturated fat has an impact on cholesterol. It didnt, said Dr Mohan. He, however, cautioned that these nuts are beneficial only if taken in their raw form and not when added with salt and other spices, fried or roasted.Both the study groups were advised to follow, in addition to their medication, a standard diabetic diet of 1,400 calories, with 6065% of energy coming from carbohydrates, 1525% from fat, and the rest from protein. One half, who were asked to take 30 grams of cashew nuts a day either as a mid-morning or evening snack, had to reduce their carbohydrates intake to make the comparison even. Biochemical tests were done in both groups to ensure they followed the diet and the nuts were consumed.Participants in the intervention group (those who were given cashew nuts) had a 1.9-fold greater reduction in blood pressure compared to participants in the other group. Those in the former group also had a 16-fold greater increase in HDL cholesterol compared to the others.Past studies have also shown that including nuts in breakfast could improve satiety and reduce second meal consumption in adults. Researchers also found that every 100 grams of cashew nuts have 20 grams of proteins.This is crucial as Indians are traditionally low on proteins because of high vegetarian intake, said Dr Mohan.The study is significant as past research has found that nearly 80% of Asian Indian adults have dyslipidemia, largely driven by low HDL cholesterol concentrations. Among those with type-2 diabetes, 86% of males and 98% of females have been shown to have dyslipidemia.The study was funded by the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India and supported by the ministry of commerce. Dr Mohan, however, denied the council had any influence over their research. We had asked them to be prepared for both scenarios  where the end effect is beneficial or detrimental. Other authors of the study were from Harvard T Chan School of Public Health and Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Spain.India is one of the largest growers, consumers and exporters of cashew nuts. Excluding groundnuts, cashew nuts are more affordable compared to other nuts like walnuts. The nuts are grown mainly in the south and western states of Karnataka, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra.The findings of the study arent surprising, considering recent studies have shown the benefits of fat, said Dr B Sesikeran, former director of the National Institute of Nutrition.People in the Mediterranean belt, for example, have the lowest incidence of coronary heart disease as their diet is rich in nuts, he said, adding that studies have shown that all nuts that grow on trees, like almonds, walnuts and pistachios did not increase body weight. But this has to be taken in measured quantity, he said."

The government buying will reduce availability in the market and prices could rise,"" said Subhash Deshmukh, the cooperation and marketing minister for the state government.India, the world's second-biggest sugar producer, requires mills to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. Last year, the mills agreed to pay farmers 11 percent more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year than in the previous year.But local sugar prices have fallen 17 percent since the start of the marketing year on Oct. 1, making it difficult for the mills to make payments.A few industry officials are sceptical about the plan, not least because of the cost to the state.Maharashtra's sugar output is expected to double to 8 million tonnes in the 2017/18 marketing year ending on Sep. 30, according to the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).That means the government would spend nearly 64 billion rupees - almost $1 billion - assuming it buys nearly 2 million tonnes from the mills, said WISMA President B.B. Thombre.""Government intervention is required, but I don't think the state can allocate such a huge amount for sugar buying,"" said another industry official, who declined to be named as the government's plan has not been approved yet.The mills have to store any sugar bought by the government in their warehouses until the state liquidates the stocks in the open market, Deshmukh said.""The government will not pay for storage and it would be the mills' responsibility to keep the stocks in good condition,"" he said.Some sugar dealers said Maharashtra's purchases could prop up sweetener prices across the country and help producers like Shree Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars."

Influential people cornered benefits in the lakhs in the old scheme, with amounts even crossing Rs 40 lakh in some cases. So, the Fadnavis government decided to bring in stringent rules while launching the Rs 34,022 crore loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers.A senior bureaucrat told TOI on Thursday that high-ranking officials of the cooperation, finance and information technology departments as well as bank nominees studied the 2008-09 loan waiver schemes before finalising the rules for beneficiaries.The cooperation department found that a veteran NCP legislator, along with his entire family comprising seven members, was granted the benefit of the loan waiver scheme. In addition, a senior NCP legislator, a former Congress legislator and heads of the cooperative institutions were major beneficiaries under the old scheme.The NCP legislator and his family received a benefit of Rs 1.6 lakh, while a chairman of a cooperative society received a benefit of Rs 38 lakh, another head of a cooperative sugar factory received a benefit of Rs 37.17 lakh and a former panchayat samiti head got a benefit of Rs 10.91 lakh. In certain cases, the amount was more than Rs 40 lakh. One rich family even received a Rs 50 lakh benefit. The loan waiver scheme was drafted for small, marginal and poor farmers, but it was observed that rich politicians took most of the benefit while poor and marginal farmers were ignored, the bureaucrat said.In the 2008-09 schemes, the main criterion was land area  farmers with under five acres would benefit, mainly to halt suicides. Since a large number of suicides was reported in Vidarbha and Marathwada, it was expected that farmers from these regions will be benefited by the decision of the government. However, 24.1 lakh poor farmers out of 69 lakh were deprived of the loan waiver scheme, since their land holding was more than five acres, the official said.The bureaucrat said that for the new scheme it was decided that sitting and former ministers, legislators, MPs, members of the ZPs, pensioners, income tax payers (other than from farm income), persons with income over Rs 3 lakh, office-bearers of cooperative societies and agriculture produce market committees, and government employees would not be considered for the loan waiver scheme.The official said the Rs 1.5 lakh ceiling was fixed after much home-work, as it was found that 82% of loans were up to Rs 1.5 lakh and 6.45% between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh."

A month after special CBI judge Loya's death, Shah was acquitted.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, countered the doubts raised by Jaising.Rohatgi said that in the inquest report, the ""way of writing"" was such that December ""1"" appeared as ""7"".Jaising told the court that the name of judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya had been incorrectly written as Brij Mohan Loya in at least 10 documents submitted by the Maharashtra government, which she said indicated that an attempt was being made to conceal certain truths.""The state has not produced the case diary. It is important to know the time at which the police station received a call that an accidental death had ensued. The diary would also provide a minute-by-minute account of the happenings,"" she said, urging the court to summon the case diary from the government for scrutiny by the bench.The senior counsel said Loya did not suffer from any cardiac, sugar or blood pressure problems and had led an active life, playing tennis for two hours a day, and that he was only 48 at the time of death. ""Statements of Loya's wife, sister, father and son that there is nothing suspicious as to the death have been procured under duress and are self-serving statements which should be ignored in view of their earlier statements,"" Jaising said.Advocate P.S. Surendranath, appearing for the All India Lawyers' Union, sought an independent probe into the death of judge Loya and urged the court to ensure that judges dealing with high-profile cases, particularly those belonging to politicians, should be provided ""Z-plus"" category security.The arguments will resume on Monday, when the Maharashtra government is expected to counter the submissions."

Even if half of these children contract diabetes when just 17 or 18 years old, it will affect progress of the country, bariatric surgeon from Saifee Hospital Mumbai, Dr Muffazal Lakdawala told TOI.Lakdawala was speaking on the sidelines of Dr Waradpande Oration he delivered at this years annual conference of Academy of Medical Science , on Sunday.Over 18% of all adolescents are overweight, he said, adding that adolescent obesity is high in India. We Asians and Indians are pre-disposed to type 2 diabetes. If Indians compare themselves with persons from other countries having same BMI, our muscle mass and bone mass is less than our fat mass. Most of us suffer from Central Obesity, which we call as beer belly. It is rapidly on the rise in India, he said.Lakdawala underlined the cause of adolescent obesity to excess sugar in food. He said, There is sugar in all forms. Even milk powder has 40% sugar, which is disguised under names such as malt syrup solids or corn syrup liquids. India is third among top five fat countries of the world. America tops the list, followed by China. We are second in the number of diabetics. If we merge both of them, there are a lot of people who suffer from diabesity.According to the Disease Control Centre of America , 40 types of cancer are linked to obesity, he added.Prevention, he said, is the solution to obesity. Losing weight should start from school, where a childs health is linked to his or her marks. We need to stop giving sugar to children, and focus on traditional foods such as jowar, bajra and millet in our diet, said Lakdawala."

Congress and NCP are in touch with Raju Shetti and seem to be making all-out efforts to woo him.FARMER leader Raju Shetti, whose party Swabhimani Paksh has fought a bitter battle with the Congress and NCP in Western Maharashtra, the sugar bowl of the state, appears set to join hands with the Congress-led front in Maharashtra, which could set the alarm bells ringing in the BJP ahead of the 2019 Assembly elections. Both the Congress and NCP are in touch with him and seem to be making all-out efforts to woo him.Come what may I am not going to rejoin the BJP-led NDA, Shetti told The Indian Express on Monday. On speculations that he would join the Congress-led front in Maharashtra before the 2019 elections, Shetti said a final decision would be taken at the partys national executive committee meeting slated in the coming days. We have had offers from the Congress to join their front. But we have not taken a decision so far, said Shetti, indicating that personally he was in favour of joining the Congress-led front but not the BJP-led front under any circumstances.Slamming the BJP, Shetti said the saffron party had cheated farmers. It promised to waive loans of debt-ridden farmers but farmers have so far got nothing, he said.In August last year, Shetti quit the BJP-led NDA alleging the Modi government had failed to keep its word on the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations on MSP to farmers. Shetti, who heads the Swabhimani Paksh, the political wing of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, has had two crucial meetings  one with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, the other with state Congress chief Ashok Chavan.While Chavan had personally met Shetti last month, Pawar met him after a function in Kolhapur two days ago. In Kolhapur, Shetti and Pawar shared the stage for the first time in 14 years. There was no bitterness when we met after so many years. In fact, Pawar justified my criticism of the Congress-NCP government when it was in power saying such opposition kept the government on toes, he said.Shetti, who represents the Hatkanangle Lok Sabha seat, said those words were music to his ears as the NCP had targeted him viciously during the elections. His party had faced similar opposition in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, the cash-rich sugarcane belt of Maharashtra.Shetti said though Pawar did not directly suggest his party join hands with the Congress-NCP, he had received feelers from top NCP leaders. In fact, Pawar showered praise on me, saying I have dedicated my life for the upliftment of farmers. Pawar also credited me and himself for the Centres decision on export of sugar and prohibiting import of sugar, he said. On his meeting with Ashok Chavan, Shetti said, Chavan personally met me at his residence and urged me to join the Congress-led front. Initially, they urged us to join the Hullabol agitation in Nagpur but for some reason we couldnt make it, he said.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said efforts were under way to get all like-minded parties together to take on the BJP. Shettis party is one of them. Preliminary talks have been held but nothing has been finalised as yet, he said.Sawant said if the Swabhimani Paksh joins the Congress-led front, it will surely give the BJP camp the jitters. Another Congress leader said Shetti could be a major game-changer as farmers across the state hold a grudge against the present government. Shetti said though his party had only one MLA, it secured 12 per cent of the votes in Western Maharashtra. Besides, I have been regularly visiting Marathwada where I have held several meetings with farmers. The response has been huge. Farmers are upset with the BJP-led government, he said.The BJP, however, played it down, saying Shetti was leaning towards those who tried to finish him politically. All his political life Shetti has fought bitterly with the Congress-NCP. Now, if he joins hands with them, it will certainly send out confusing signals among voters in Western Maharashtra. As it is, Shettis appeal is limited to certain areas only, said BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Another BJP leader said if Shetti joins the Congress-led front, it wont affect them much as his one-time close lieutenant, Sadabhau Khot, is a minister in the Devendra Fadnavis government and popular among farmers. Khot may not be equally popular but has good support among farmers, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

After all, its the meal that provides the body and brain with fuel after an overnight fast, helping to wake up the metabolism, says Tripti Gupta, a nutritionist from Mumbai. The absorption rate of all nutrients dwindles through the day, so its best to eat a bigger breakfast than a large dinner. You dont need a whole lot of refined flour, sugar or processed meat to make your breakfast interesting. Wholegrains, which are rich in fibre and protein, work just as well, delivering both taste and a health boost, says Gupta. The fibre present in grains like amaranth, rye, maize provides satiety and a long period of energy supply, while the carbohydrates break down to supply blood glucose for healthy functioning of body and mind. Besides, they are also excellent sources of B complex vitamins and most essential minerals. Adding nuts and oil seeds will take it up a notch, with healthy fats too. Berries and dry fruit catalyse the absorption of overall nutrients consumed in your first meal.Whole eggs are a good source of protein, amino acids, vitamin D and other important nutrients like vitamin B6, B12, choline, says Preeti Seth, a nutritionist from Delhi."

According to a trader in Anakapalli, Kandregula Satyanarayana, a majority of businessmen from West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar place orders from Anakapalli NTR jaggery market. But now, they are giving priority to UP and Maharashtra markets because of low prices when compared to Anakapalli market, he said.The first quality jaggery is priced at Rs 2,400 for 100 kg in Maharashtra and Rs 2m200 in Uttar Pradesh whereas the same kind of jaggery here is Rs 3,100. The difference of price is Rs 600 to Rs 800. Traders of other states which are traditional buyers of Anakapalli market are now placing orders at UP or Maharashtra, one of the businessmen of the jaggery market P Raghu said. He added that the farmers are not sending the jaggery lumps to the market after dip in prices.Not only this, Anakapalli jaggery lumps are in between 15 kg to 17 kg whereas UP, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been manufacturing smaller lumps. When the crop infections or fungal infections were showed their impact, farmers of Yalamanchili, Madugula and Chodavaram Assembly Constituency limits are now transporting the sugarcane to sugar factories. This has shown impact on jaggery making and also reducing the volume, trader Malla Satyanarayana told TOI.He further said that usually the market witnesses around 30,000 lumps everyday in January and February months because of festival season and also marriages season. But now the volume has not crossed 20,000 lumps a day so far."

LinkedIn has numerous Indian profiles offering escort services , adult entertainment and massages with happy endings, spanning across cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata.The LinkedIn profile of a girl named Pushpa (name changed) from Bengaluru describes her as a call girl offering a variety of massages across centres in the city such as Indiranagar, JP Nagar, Banaswadi, Domlur and Kammanahalli. Her profile provides a link to a website which claims to provide full body massage, happy ending massage and female-to-male body massage, among others.These services continue even though LinkedIn has banned them since inception. In its user agreement, the US company instructs its users not to create profiles or provide content that promotes escort services or prostitution.When contacted, LinkedIn said such profiles were in violation of its user agreement and said action will be taken.The LinkedIn profile of a spa in Bengaluru not only lists massages provided, but goes on to add that masseurs will be cute south Indian girls, pretty Kerala girls and can be chosen by customers. A random look at other profiles range from people in Vashi, Mumbai and Pitampura, New Delhi to a girl in Kolkata who describes herself as independent adult entertainer.STOI called a few contact numbers listed on the profile pages to ascertain if adult entertainment industry handlers were actively operating on the professional networking site. One call was answered by a girl and she admitted she was open to delivering all types of service along with a massage. She said, Well charge you Rs 2,500 for a three-hour service. We also have rooms at our place and you will like the experience. Come to Silk Board Junction and call, well tell you the exact address.There are profiles of women calling themselves naughty housewives, profiles looking for secret relationships, passionate sugar babies looking for one-night stands with cash benefits.LinkedIn India communications head Deepa Sapatnekar said in an emailed statement to STOI: The 47 million Indian members on LinkedIn, and the 546 million around the world, are members because they want to build their careers and become better professionals. Our user agreement clearly states that profiles or content that promote escort or prostitution services are prohibited. When we become aware of profiles and other activity on the site that may be in violation of our policies, we take appropriate action. We also encourage members to report any behaviour they consider to be inappropriate.The company, bought by tech giant Microsoft in 2016, added it is neither common, nor effective, to solicit such services on LinkedIn. We have robust measures in place that protect our members: They are empowered to block members who offend or threaten them. They can also report offensive conduct and the profile of that member can be suspended if found to have contravened our terms of service (and where necessary), remove them from the site altogether.A pimp in Bengaluru, who was arrested twice, told STOI that the prostitution business has moved online to a significant extent. The industry also uses social media tools such as WhatsApp. It reduces risk by ensuring anonymity for all, the man said.A senior officer of the police Central Crime Branch said the department had noticed such posts on social networking and professional networking sites, including LinkedIn. There have been no complaints received so far. Were monitoring the posts and will take suo motu action if needed, he said."

Activists alleged that the administration and the police were intimated about the marriages, yet no action was taken.Last week, an NGO Lek Ladki Abhiyan had conducted a grievance hearing about the issues minor girls face at Shirur Kasar tehsil in Beed district. During the hearing, school-going girls narrated the difficulties they faced. Lack of proper roads and public transportation were among the top complaints. Girls said they had to walk 4-5 kms every day to reach schools and they didnt feel safe on their way back home. Poor quality of education and unsafe school buildings were among other complaints.Most of the residents of Shirur Kasar are seasonal labourers, who migrate to Western Maharashtra to work in sugarcane fields in the production season of sugar factories. Almost 80 per cent couples in the area are away from homes for at least 5 to 6 months every year. As they are worried about the safety of their girls, unwanted marriages at the age of 13-17 and the early pregnancies are common, Advocate Varsha Deshpande, founder of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, stated in press release issued on Tuesday.In their report to the CRC, Deshpande, along with other activists of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, claimed to have informed the local administration and the police about the 13 child marriages that took place in the tehsil between 2017 and 2018.

(Express photo by Oinam Anand/File) A miller in Kolhapur said the reduction in prices was adopted to enable them to pay the farmers whose cane will come for crushing in the last few weeks of the season.  (Express photo by Oinam Anand/File)Sugar millers and traders have called for long term policy-level decisions to maintain healthy sugar prices to enable them to pay cane growers. While the recent decision of controlled sales have firmed up the price of sugar, millers fear a slide once the moratorium of sales ends in April. On Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC) Bank had revised its valuation of sugar by Rs 130 per quintal from the earlier valuation of Rs 2,970. This would be the sixth time the apex bank has changed the valuation of sugar since the start of the season in November. In the earlier five instances, the bank had reduced the valuations of sugar.Millers have been complaining of low sugar prices which have compromised their financial health and had subsequently led to default in payment to growers. Most of the mills have also slashed the first installment payment announced at the start of the season in view of the low sugar prices.The decision of the sugar millers to reduce the first installment payment had naturally not gone down well with growers with farmers organisations such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana taking to the streets against it. Sanghatana head MP Raju Shetti has also warned of further protests if mills did not revert to the promised payment. It might be remembered that even mills in Kolhapur, known for handsome payments to the growers, have reduced the first installment announced and are now paying Rs 2,500 per tonne.Since the imposition of controlled sales, which mandates sale of only 17 and 14 per cent of stock with mills for the months of February and March, respectively, sugar prices have firmed up by Rs 200-250 per quintal. Mukesh Kuvadia, secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association, said ex mill price in Maharashtra is between Rs 3,100 and Rs 3,200 at present. This price is solely due to the artificial stoppage created in the market due to the sales restrictions. Once the restrictions are removed, prices might come tumbling down, he said.This short-time price hike, the industry says, is not strong enough to let the mills pay the growers higher prices. Most millers have adopted a wait- and-watch policy in terms of payment as they fear a slide in the sugar prices. A miller in Kolhapur said the reduction in prices was adopted to enable them to pay the farmers whose cane will come for crushing in the last few weeks of the season. If we continue to pay the first installment payment as declared at the start of the season, we will not be in a position to pay the later farmers, he said.Both traders and millers now say a long term solution is necessary to deal this years crisis. Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), called for incentive for exports to deal with the glut. But Kuvadia was of the opinion that instead of export subsidy the government should incentivise sugar consuming industries to increase the domestic consumption of sugar. That will be a permanent solution to the problem, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Pests like Gram pod borer or Helicoverpa and other diseases have struck the gram crop in as many as 11 villages across Dhule, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon. The incidence of pests and diseases on gram has also crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) here. Crops like wheat, gram, jowar, maize have been affected by diseases and pests in this division.An economic threshold is the insects population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.In Pune division, gram crop in 32 villages across Ahmednagar and Solapur has been attacked by such pests currently. Here too, the incidence has crossed the economic threshold level. Crops such as wheat, gram, sugar cane and maize are expected to cause financial losses to growers due to pest attacks, the report said.Various rabi crops in as many as 19 villages in Latur, seven in Amravati and 41 in Nagpur, among others, are facing a similar situation due to the rain and hailstorm, with the incidence of pests and diseases crossing the threshold at these locations as well.Director of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited Amit Naphade , told TOI that whenever there is a variation in weather  sudden change from cold to warm, unseasonal rain, or no rain in the monsoon months  the incidence of pests and diseases on crops increases.Such changes are ideal for pests and diseases to flourish, since the crops weaken at these times and become susceptible to pest attacks. Most districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and some in north Maharashtra, are facing increased pest attacks following the recent unseasonal rain, with between 30% and 60% wheat crop getting destroyed not just because of rain but pest attack and diseases, said Naphde.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district of Akola said that had the unseasonal rain and hail not affected the region, crop health and production would have been 100% this rabi season. But now, various pests are hounding the crops, he said.Buldhana farmer Milind Pachpande said that between 25% to 50% of onion crop in his field is facing pest attacks. The onion crop is close to rotting in many areas, he said."

Playing on Prime Minister Narendra Modis slogan, he said achhe din were on the cards for the Congress as its party chief, Rahul Gandhi, was showing an inclination to learn and understand the issues facing the nation.Pawar was replying to a barrage of questions posed by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray during a two-hour marathon public interview held here. He ruled out dealings with the BJP when he said he will prefer an alliance with the Congress.Pawar lauded the PM for being a hardworking person and said he was successful as chief minister of Gujarat as he understood the issues there. But when you are running the country, you need to work with a team that understands issues across various regions. I doubt Modi has that team and inclination for building it (the nation).Pawar, who had once said he would never work under Rahul Gandhi, recalled the Congress chiefs visit to the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI) in Pune a couple of years ago. I was there and I saw him (Rahul) asking questions about cane farming and the sugar industry. He exhibited an enthusiasm to learn new things. Any person who has such an urge can improve and do better. He is ready to travel across the country and learn and understand issues, he said.The Maratha strongman referred to the BJP governments demonetization move and said it had caused huge losses for cooperative banks which have a strong presence in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. He produced a letter recently issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank, in which it has been said that the old currency notes with PDCC will not be exchanged and that it should show the money as losses in its books of accounts. The issue is serious but Modi is not ready to address it, he said.Pawar questioned the necessity of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. I am not opposed to the project per se. However, it should run between Mumbai and Delhi or Mumbai and Nagpur. Nobody will travel in a bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, he said.When Thackeray asked him how he viewed the bullet train project and similar such efforts by Gujarati businessmen and politicians to penetrate into Mumbai, Pawar said, Yes, there will be efforts to take control of Mumbai as it is the financial centre (of the country). But these (attempts) will not be successful. Both, you (Thackeray) and I will not allow Mumbai to be separated from Maharashtra.To another question, Pawar said that the local people of Vidarbha do not wish to separate from Maharashtra. Those calling for a referendum on a separate Vidarbha should know that the local people do not support this demand, he added."

They also fed bananas, sugar cane and watermelon to the rescued elephants Laxmi, Phoolkali and Maya, he said.Mr. Satyanarayan said that at the end of the visit, the family was presented an elephant footprint painting, Padhchinh, of Phoolkali along with a portrait of the majestic elephant.The Padhchinh is a unique series of artwork, born out of the collaboration of Singapore-based gifted artist Alpana Ahuja and the rescued elephants at Wildlife SOS, India.Translating into footprint in Sanskrit, Padhchinh symbolizes the elephants march towards a safer future.Perseverance is the keyThe first collection of Padhchinh paintings was unveiled in December 2013.Each footprint continues to be taken with tremendous patience, subject entirely to the elephants decision to participate in the process and largely influenced by bananas and other treats.The photo of Phoolkali was taken by Mumbai-based photographer Himanshuu Sheth.Phoolkali, who was blinded by her owners and used for begging on the streets, was rescued from Uttar Pradesh in 2012. Years of abuse and neglect had left her with terribly worn-out footpads and overgrown cuticles, which made it extremely difficult for her to walk or even stand.As part of her ongoing veterinary treatment, Phoolkali is given regular medicated foot soaks and her overgrown cuticles and footpads are trimmed and treated.For a greater causeMs. Ahuja said: It is a huge honour for me that a piece of art that I helped create with Phoolkali to support Wildlife SOS has a pride of place n the Canadian Prime Ministers home. I hope that the message of elephant conservation travels along with the art to Canada and more people from his country will support the wonderful work of Wildlife SOS to help protect elephants in India."

These mills have piled up Rs 2,230 crore arrears for the current crushing season and the amount is likely to rise in the next few months, say industry insiders.There are 184 sugar mills operational in the state this year most of which belong to politicians. Of the 136 mills hauled up for not paying farmers the pre decided Fair Remunerative Price (FRP), 97 are cooperative and 83 are privately owned. Sugar commissionerate officials said a total FRP of Rs 12,813 crore was to be paid to farmers, of which Rs 10,775 crore has been paid. The FRP is the minimum price mills have to pay farmers.Mill owners say the sugar prices in the open markets have dipped considerably this year leaving them saddled with huge stocks due to which they have not been able to pay the farmers. But officials say FRP is not related to market conditions. Officials also said that sugar prices were picking up due to policy interventions by the central government like increasing import duty and capping mill level sugar sales two weeks ago. Currently, sugar prices are ranging between Rs 2,850 and Rs 3,000 per quintal a far cry from the Rs 3,600 levels of November. The FRP is Rs 255 per ton of sugarcane with 9.5% sugar content.Farmers have decided to stage a protest if payments are not made soon. The market is controlled by mill owners. They will tweak it the way they want for own benefit, said MP Raju Setti who is also the chief of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana.

The agency also conducted searches at eight locations, including one in Hapur in Uttar Pradesh, one in Noida, and six locations in Delhi.According to the FIR, the bank filed the complaint on November 17, 2017.It was alleged that the Oriental Bank of Commerce sanctioned a loan amounting to Rs 148.60 crore in the year 2011 to the company (Simbhaoli Sugars). The loan was sanctioned for financing individual, joint liability groups, self help groups (SLG) and sugarcane farmers under the tie-up arrangement under the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Scheme to 5,762 sugarcane farmers supplying sugar produce to the company which was dishonestly and fraudulently diverted by said company for its own needs. The account was later declared as alleged fraud by the bank to RBI on May 13, 2015 for an amount of Rs 97.85 crore, stated the FIR, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint.The FIR added that the bank then sanctioned another corporate loan of Rs 110 crore to Simbhaoli Sugars on January 28, 2015, to pay its outstanding loan of Rs 97.85 crore.They adjusted the total liability of Rs 112.94 crore on June 30, 2016, by way of deposit of this new corporate loan. The corporate loan, too, turned NPA on November 29, 2016, thus resulting in its first outstanding loan of Rs 97.85 crore (as alleged fraud) and the fresh corporate loan of Rs 109.08 crore (as fresh outstanding), the FIR added.A spokesperson for OBC did not respond to a request for comment.Over the last 10 days, the CBI has filed more than seven cases on complaints filed by banks, including Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of Maharashtra and Telangana Grameena Bank. Most of them relate to conspiracy and cheating, and some involve employees of the bank.Apart from the complaint filed against the group firms of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi for the Rs 11,400 crore fraud at PNB and the complaint against Rotomac Global, complaints have been filed by banks against companies including Kalimata Krishipanya Bipanan Pvt. Ltd (by Bank of Baroda) and jewellery exporter Dwarkadas Seth International (by Oriental Bank of Commerce).One case filed by PNB involves an official opening fictitious accounts and diverting funds fraudulently to fake bank accounts, as well as perpetrating fraud under the governments Mudra scheme.Mint could not reach any of the companies mentioned above, for a comment."

Later that day, he received a phone call from a stranger: not only had this man found his wallet, he was returning it with all his money, Rs 9,000, intact. Yadav was in disbelief till he met Yatin Naik. He learned that his wasnt the only wallet the unassuming man had found and returned; he had been bringing succour to many for the past 10 years.Naik has been scouring the station area and tracks at Andheri, looking for wallets dumped by pickpockets after emptying them of cash. He has a trusted network of ragpickers, sweepers, beggars and gangmen who save discarded wallets and hand them over to Naik. The 53-year-old checks their contents to track down the owner.""I do it for the blessings and the smiles,"" said Naik, who lives in Khetwadi with his sister. . Commuters are overjoyed at getting back their wallets. Its not just about the money. People have memories attached to their belongings. They have pictures of their families, drawings made by their kids, besides government identity cards and ATM cards. Pickpockets dont care for these, said Naik, adding that Yadav was very lucky to get back his cash as he had wrapped it in a piece of paper.Recounting how he started off, Naik said he had landed in Andheri nearly 10 years ago to meet someone when he spotted a discarded wallet near a public tap. I picked it up and soon found another wallet. This got me thinking. I wondered if I could start tracking down their owners on my own as the police are anyway overburdened with cases. I started looking for addresses on identity cards and dialling MTNL to get the commuters landline number. Sometimes, I would write letters to commuters, he said. In Yadavs case, Naik found a receipt in his wallet with his mobile number scribbled on it.To earn a living, Naik puts together an annual directory of sugar factories in the state. I run around to gather advertisers and sponsors for the directory. But my heart lies in finding and returning commuters wallets. I dedicate three to four hours for it every single evening. There have been times when commuters touch my feet or start sobbing on getting their wallet back. At times, they call me back for help if a friend or relative has lost his wallet. I have limited resources and havent been able to venture out of Andheri, he said.But not all his experiences are savoury. There have been instances when commuters got their wallets back but not with all the contents intact. They vented their frustration on me. I promptly take these commuters to the police and ask them to intervene, he said. Naik is a known face at the Andheri GRP outpost.On an average, he finds at least two lost or stolen wallets every day. Andheri has among the highest crime rates on Western Railway and with the Metro station coming up next to it, the volume of commuters has grown exponentially. Naik has been meticulously maintaining a record of all the commuters he has helped over the years and has ended up filling three large diaries with names, contact numbers and photographs. It feels good to sit and go through the pages sometimes, he said."
5b17834e9855b762eced2cee,Few tickets for women despite call for equality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/few-tickets-for-women-despite-call-for-equality/articleshow/63101351.cms,2018-02-28,"BENGALURU: During his whirlwind tour of Mumbai-Karnataka, Congress president Rahul Gandhi assured that the womens reservation bill would be passed in Parliament and urged the state party unit to give more tickets to women candidates in the coming assembly elections. Going by precedent, though, the chances of the party delivering on his word seem bleak.Aspiring women leaders say the mindset of party leaders is the biggest obstacle. The Siddaramaiah government took a historic step by enhancing the reservation for women from 33% to 50% in panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies and reaped full dividends. Now the party has been promising more tickets to women aspirants to repeat it. But thats easier said than done in the assembly polls, said one of them. This is despite women accounting for 48% of the voters in the stateCongress fielded only eight women candidates in Karnataka in 2013 when Sonia Gandhi was at the helm. Of them, two won and a third woman candidate later won a bypoll and went on to become a minister in Siddaramaiahs cabinet. Congress is not alone; both BJP and JD(S) have been giving women a raw deal when it comes to contesting in polls. In the previous assembly polls, of 175 women who contested, including independents, only six got elected to the 224-member Karnataka assembly. This was three more than the number of women in the 2008 polls.The reasons are not hard to find. Political parties continue to doubt the capability of women candidates to compete with their male opponents and match them with money and muscle power. Given this scenario, tickets are issued only to women with connections to political families or with a cinema background.On occasion, the ticket has gone to a woman to ride a sympathy wave. Sugar minister MC Mohan Kumari (Geetha) was thrust into the hurly-burly of politics following the death of her husband, cooperation minister HS Mahadevaprasad. While party leaders campaigned for her, Geetha merely stood beside them with folded hands.Even if women do get elected, few have risen much further. Karnataka has not had a woman chief minister, deputy chief minister or home minister so far. Tellingly, none of the parties has had a woman president either.Womens leadership can only grow if they get adequate opportunities at party forums and with reservation, said a former woman minister. Patriarchal political systems which do not tolerate women at the highest level block all such opportunities by creating a separate womens wing. Unless backed by family or party, a woman cant mobilise support and win polls. Therefore, the need of the hour is reservation for women as it forces men to fall in line as it has happened in panchayats and urban local bodies."

All are manufactured in China.Pichkaris shaped like banjos and guitars are very popular. We have different sizes ranging from half-litre to 2 litres to suit children of all age groups. Another hot selling item is the cluster of 100 balloons in which you can fill water from one tap all at once. As they fill, the balloons seal on their own and begin to fall off the grid, said a shopkeeper in Crawford Market. The pichkaris cost Rs 150-450 apiece while the balloon cluster comes for a cheap Rs 125.Sweets are an indispensable part of Indian celebrations. The Sindhi community sees Holi as an important day on the festival calendar. This year residents of the Sindhi heartland of Khar are having to shell out at exorbitant Rs 800 per kg for gear, which is simply a large jalebi prepared from maida and sugar syrup.

A nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had milked thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects, revealed sources. NCP leaders who had controlled the department came under the scanner.Sources said the ED was looking into irrigation contracts that had been given to a Pune-based firm, Raj Group, during Pawars tenure as water resources minister. This is the only case in which Pawar can be accused of having directly benefited through his connection to the firm, which bagged irrigation contracts worth Rs803 to Rs1,000 crore.HT had broken the story of Pawars links to this firm through personal and business connections in July 2015.Here are five reasons why former deputy chief minister and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars nephew could land in trouble if ED pursues this case :1. Jagdish Kadam and Ram Nimbalkar are directors of the Pune-based Raj group. Kadam is Ajits cousin, while Nimbalkar is one of his close associates. The firm bagged irrigation contracts for at least 11 projects, collectively worth Rs1,000 crore. Two of these projects are in Vidarbha, one in Marathwada and ten in western Maharashtra. These contracts were allotted when Pawar was water resources minister.2. Kadam and Nimbalkar were also directors in a few of the 60 companies associated with Pawar that had interests in infrastructure, realty, wind and hydro power, sugar factories, distilleries and automobiles.The two were the joint directors of 15 such companies. Pawar was the director of five such companies until 2009. His wife, Sunetra, was the director of 20 of these companies until 2014. She and Kadam were joint directors in seven such firms. Nimbalkar and she were joint directors in one firm.3. Raj group bagged projects by floating different entities, including Raj Infrastructure Development Corporation, Raj Promoters and Civil Engineers Private Limited, Raj Construction. The firm violated the norm that a single company cannot win more than three contracts in any region. In the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC), the group got five projects under different names, including one joint venture.4. The costs of a majority of projects bagged by the group rose by 4.83% to 41%. All the cost escalations were cleared by Pawar as the then minister. These controversial projects include Kuntephal, Dhom Balkawadi canals, Umraodi and Karanjao project5. The Kuntephal lift irrigation project worth Rs209 crore, part of the larger Krishna-Marathwada project was seriously flawed. A special investigation team that probed the project had sought action against the officials who cleared it. Documents show that the work order for the project was given without getting an administrative order, violating the governors directives. Project officials did not seek the mandated green nod from the Union environment ministry either."

Chandrababu after visiting the Agricultural Research Station (ARS), Mannuthy, the Minister said he wanted to have a tie-up with the KAU to replicate its successful models in Maharashtra.I am impressed by what I saw and learned from ARS, Mannuthy. The Food Security Army, Agro Machinery Operation and Service Centres (AMOSC), mobile units for agro-machinery service and repairs are all excellent models. Growth of farmers income is possible only through such innovative and pragmatic approach. I want to extend these models to Maharashtra, may be two districts to start with, he said.Mr. Kesarkar said different regions in Maharashtra had different cropping patterns. While crops in the Konkan area are similar to those in Kerala, Central Maharashtra has sugar cane and turmeric and Vidarbha, cotton and oranges. Therefore, the FSA and AMOSCs required in different regions will be different. Integrated farming systems are what we aim for. For example, coconut plantations have to be supported with production units of neera and coir. Expertise of KAU scientists can be used to develop them, the Minister said.SHGs hailedMr. Kesarkar also praised the self-help groups (SHGs) involved in the development agenda of Kerala. I appreciate the successful involvement of SHGs in agriculture and other productive ventures. The Kudumbasree Mission, which has a forward and backward linkage with all levels of clientele, is a great example of empowerment and entrepreneurship. Such agencies enable smooth technology transfer, the Minister said.Dr. Chandrababu offered guidance and support for replicating FSA, AMOSC, and other allied models in Maharashtra.  Extending our technology for agricultural development in other States is highly satisfying, he said."

Officials of the labour department said the office space in Grahak Bhandar building in Parli, Beed, has been identified for the welfare board. The process of taking over the office space is in final stage and will be completed by next week. It will be taken on rent according to market rates. The boards headquarters will be in Parli, added an official. The Sugarcane Welfare Board has been named after late BJP leader Gopinath Munde.An official said there were close to four lakh cane labourers in Beed and its adjoining districts. Once the board is formed, we will begin the process of registering the labourers, he said. He added that the board would provide financial security and improve the standard of living of sugarcane labourers. Sources in the labour department said, however, there was still no clarity on the financial provision for the welfare schemes for sugarcane labourers.We are of the view that, like construction workers, some cess should be collected from all sugar factories that can be used for the welfare schemes meant for cane labourers. This will not put a burden on the state governments finances. The move of collecting cess is likely to be opposed by the sugar factories, said a senior official from the labour department.The state government plans to provide some funding in the initial years. In December, the regional office of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in Solapur had told 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur districts to extend EPF benefits to labourers engaged in sugarcane cutting and transportation. Officials had said, since sugar factories pay the labourers through contractors, an EPF should be deducted. However, opposing the move, factory owners said they would take up the issue with the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The state government has handed over 28.44 acres from the main campus of the college to the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Ltd for a maintenance depot.One of the biggest green spaces in the heart of the city  the College of Agriculture campus  has shrunk by 119.72 acres in the last three and half decades, according to data obtained by The Indian Express under the Right To Information (RTI) Act. (One acre equals 43,560 sqft). The lost green space has been used variously for widening roads, building subways and offices, agriculture-related schemes and, most recently, for building a maintenance depot for the Pune Metro.The College of Agriculture was set up in 1879 as a department linked to the College of Science (now the College of Engineering, Pune) and, later in 1907, became a separate institute. Back then, the campus sprawled over 150 acres.In later years, as activities expanded, the campus grew to 569.91 acres  this included land at the colleges Shivajinagar campus, farms in the Ganeshkhind area, the dairy department in Khadki and research plots in Manjari on Solapur Road. Data shows since the eighties, the college has relinquished land for various projects of the state government, the Centre and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) but was rarely given land in compensation by government agencies.The lush green college campus is not only popular with students who come here to study but is also a popular destination for nature lovers. The old stone college building is one of the most beautiful edifices in the city and the location for many a film shoots.Documents show the college received no land in return for a 35,000-sqft land it gave for construction of a subway on the Pune-Mumbai Highway, a 12,670-sqft land for the widening of Mula Road, a 1,23,202-sqft land for further expansion of the road, a 52,267-sqft land for widening of the Pune-Mumbai Highway, a 25,220-sqft land for the widening of University Road, a 1,549-sqft land for shifting the Mhasoba Mandir following the construction of a flyover on University Road and a 26,900-sqft land for a pumping station.In December 2000, the college gave 8.46 acres to Sakhar Sankul, the office of the sugar commissioner, but received no land in compensation. Besides, the college gave 30.66 hectares for setting up the Directorate of Floriculture, which comes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In the most recent instance, the college provided land for a maintenance depot of the Pune Metro, work on which started last year. The state government handed over 28.44 acres from the main campus of the college to the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) although the move was opposed by the college authorities.Communications sent by the college authorities to the Maha Metro as well as the state government, obtained under the RTI Act, show that the college argued if the land was handed over to the Maha Metro, it would hamper expansion plans of the college as well as affect its current academic and research activities.Agricultural education involves experimental learning modules, which require practicals on the fields. Also, availability of land is one of the criteria for grant of funds by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research. If we lose a major chunk of land, then these prospects will take a beating. shrinking of the area will affect the agricultural education model in the entire state, states another communication sent to the principal secretary (agriculture) on March 24 last year.The institutes administration had also pointed out that a whopping 6,133 trees, part of the genetically pure mother plant orchards, would be felled to clear the land for the project. The state government, however, went ahead with the land acquisition, asking the Maha Metro to transplant the orchards elsewhere on the campus.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The Narcotics Control Bureau of India was looking for him for peddling 12 kg of brown sugar in India.After a long search, he was arrested in Chennai and lodged in Central Prison till 2012. Since the validity of his Sri Lankan passport expired after his release, he got hold of forged documents through a broker, who obtained a passport for him in the name of Ibrahim.The CCB said he was staying in Chennai and visiting Malaysia, Dubai and Saudi Arabia, and indulging in drug peddling and hawala transactions.City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, in a press release said the suspect was staying in the city on rent and peddling drugs. He urged the public not to give their houses on rent to suspicious characters. Since movement of such accused is a danger, people should come forward to share information to the police, he said.Other investigating agencies are probing his links with drug cartels. A source said Shabudeen had been peddling drugs through his contacts with people in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. He had been staying illegally in Mannady for five years.Meanwhile, the Narcotics Control Bureau, Chennai Zonal Unit arrested Mohammed Lafir, 35, at the Chennai International Airport on Monday when he tried to smuggle 8.3 kg of ephedrine to Kuala Lumpur via Kolkata.The substance was concealed in two plastic packets in a carton containing a wet grinder."

It certainly did in the case of Inspector Daulatram Jogawat from Madhya Pradesh Police, who came under the spotlight after columnist-author Shobhaa De fat-shamed him in a tweet and which eventually led to Jogawat undergoing a bariatric surgery in Mumbai last year.Sixty-five kilos lighter a year later  Jogawat weighed 180-kg before he was operated on by well-known bariatric surgeon Dr Muffazal Lakdawala at Saifee Hospital  the Madhya Pradesh cop said not only was he no longer bitter at Des jibe, he wanted to personally thank her, with his family in tow.While De told Mumbai Mirror that she would be more than pleased to meet Jogawat, the latter said hell wait till he loses another 30 kgs before presenting himself in front of De, whom he refers to as his elder sister.In Mumbai for a routine check-up, Jogawat said he had become a different person after the weight loss operation. You can spot the confidence on my face, Jogawat, who now weighs 115 kg, said. I genuinely believe the weight loss surgery was possible only after Shobhaaji tweeted my photo. The doctors did not charge anything for the surgery, he said.Jogawats unintentional publicity came about when De posted his picture on Twitter on February 21last year  a day before the BMC elections  with the caption: Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today.While De was slammed by scores of people for fat-shaming Jogawat, the Mumbai Police pointed out that Jogawat was not even a part of their force. Today, De is happy for Jogawat. Im glad that my tweet not only helped him lose weight, he has also been rid of several diseases, some of which could be life-threatening. I thank Dr Lakdawala for acknowledging the tweet and treating Jogawat free of cost, De told Mumbai Mirror.Regarding being trolled for fat-shaming the cop, De said Jogawat himself had never complained, and that he had always maintained that the tweet helped him get the right treatment. Id love to meet Mr Jogawat who is no longer on heavy bandobast, De said.Dr Lakdawala credited Jogawats mental toughness and discipline for the weight loss, and said he could easily lose another 30 kgs. He is strictly monitoring his diet, which is essential post bariatric surgery as there are restrictions regarding food intake at least for a year. He had come in with fluctuating blood sugar levels, high cholesterol, hypertension, sleep apnea, lymphedema, joints pain basically the problems caused due to excessive weight. Now all his reports are normal, the doctor said.Jogawat is posted in the police control room in the town of Neemuch. He now hopes for a posting in Bhopal or Indore. Ill retire next year but before that, I want a good posting. I never got one all these years because my seniors in the force were worried that my health problems will come in the way of discharging duty. Also, such an overweight cop would have embarrassed the VIPs, he said.Jogawat, 58, said he started piling on weight 20 years ago. First came the slight paunch, which kept growing, he said. Within a matter of months, my weight had jumped from 69 kg to 105 kg. With mobility gone, I kept ballooning, he said.With his new-found frame, both physically and mentally, Jogawat said hes rediscovering the joys of living, such as taking a leisurely walk. I can walk without losing breath. Thats a wonderful feeling, he said.He has an advice for his colleagues and obese people at large. Dont mock an overweight person. Obesity is a disease, and it needs to be treated. Not many can afford weight loss surgery, and the police departments across the country should help cops in need of such surgeries."

5b115eea9855b775d37e13f1,WhatsApps for India from Maharashtra,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2018/mar/11/whatsapps-for-india-from-maharashtra-1785151.html,2018-03-11,"Shankkar Aiyar ByThe big picture is essentially composed of pixels. The micro details from states enable a better comprehension of the distance between what is and what can be in the political economy. This week the government of Maharashtra, arguably among the better-managed states, released its annual economic survey. Entrenched in the details are possibilities and predicaments that political India is faced with. Over 30,000 farmers from across Maharashtra are marching from Nashik to Mumbai. They plan to encircle Mantralaya, the seat of government, to corral political attention. The headline is about fall in overall growth, from 10 per cent to 7.3 per cent. The distress is located in the dip in agriculture and allied activitiesfrom 22.5 per cent to minus (-) 8.3 per cent.Credit to farmers is stymied by affordability and accessMaharashtras 40,959 villages have 2,979 banking offices. Of the net sown area of 17-plus million hectares, irrigation reaches barely 17.8 per cent. In the water-scarce state, the area under water guzzler sugarcane has nearly doubled since 2001. Yes, sugar pays more, but must it be cane, and why not tropical sugar beet, which consumes less water and delivers more? Given the impact of climate change, states need to adopt the paradigm of drip irrigation funded by incentives.Agriculture accounts for 11 per cent of GSDP but rural Maharashtra hosts 55 per cent of the 11 crore populace. Landholdings have shrunk to an average of 1.44 hectares, reducing viability. But naturally, the marching farmers are demanding a complete loan waiverand similar agitations are surfacing across India. The problem in Maharashtra represents the larger issue Bharat faces. Farming needs a new viability model with backward and forward linkages. All that talk about contract/group/collective farming must walk, and now!The consensus view is growth needs investments. State after state is holding investor summits (http://bit.ly/2ItemSongs7) announcing MoUs in lakhs of crores. But what is the conversion rate of intent into investment? The Maharashtra Survey reveals that between August 1991 and December 2017, the state received investment proposals worth `11.89 lakh crore, of which projects worth `2.92 lakh crore were commissioned.Mind you, Maharashtra is among the better performing statesone can imagine the gap in other states. Indeed, Maharashtra has claimed a better strike rate in the past years. The Survey says that of the `8 lakh crore worth of MoUs signed in 2016 in Maharashtra, investments worth `4.91 lakh crore are in various stages of implementation. Milton Friedman once said, The greatest advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science and literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized government. Ceteris paribus, or other things being equal, investment growth demands dismantling of the Centre-state permission raj.Development also depends on how the finances of the state are managed. On the face of it, Maharashtra is among the better-managed states. Yet it spends 12 rupees of every hundred to pay interest on its debt of `4.13 lakh croreand at an average of 8.4 per cent per annum. It begs a question: is the state government less sovereign than the Centre to pay a higher rate?Public finance ratios depend on how governments price services and manage subsidies. Take a look at the power sector. Agriculture accounts for 26 per cent of power consumption and Maharashtra is aggressively electrifying agricultural pumps. The question: must it be grid power why not promote solar-plus-hybrid pumps or inverters? Why not push metering and prepaid power through DBT for farmers?The Survey reveals: The aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of MAHADISCOM were 22.1 per cent, Tata Power 0.93 per cent and Reliance Infrastructure 3.63 per cent during 2017-18 up to October. AT&C is really a euphemism for inefficiency and theft  and it shows in the variation in losses between the state electricity board and private entities.An interesting factoid in the survey is about use of kerosene. The subsidised quota is about four litres per month and kerosene retails at around `25 per litre. The Survey reveals: Proportion of households using kerosene as fuel for cooking was highest in Mumbai Suburban (17.6 per cent) followed by Mumbai city (17.4 per cent) and Thane (14.7 per cent) districts. The reason, perhaps, is the high level of slum population. Why not bring these homes into the ambit of DBT-enabled LPG or piped gasbringing down subsidies, adulteration and pollution? The Centre has pushed for a kerosene-free regime in Puducherry and Chandigarh. Why not major metros?Reorganisation of expenditure will enable better spend on critical sectors like education and health. The Survey reveals the percentage of private unaided schools has shot up from 12.4 per cent to 21.1 per cent in just two years. Clearly, poor learning outcomes in government schools are a factorand the trend is national.This years Union Budget announced the big-bang National Health Protection Scheme. Maharashtra is an early subscriber of the idea of insured health care. The challenge is in the delivery. The infrastructure on the ground, with 6,981 government allopathic doctors and 108 beds per lakh population, is far from adequate. Rural Maharashtras 40,959 villages are served by 10,580 sub-centres, 1,814 primary health centres, 360 rural hospitals, 193 PHUs, 40 mobile units and 86 sub-district hospitals. At the national level, the inadequacy of capacity is worse. The issues embedded in Maharashtras Economic Survey have a national resonance. It is verily a WhatsApp message for India.shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

The total budget allocation for the agriculture sector this year is Rs. 18,112 crore while another Rs. 3,250 crore has been set aside for the rural development plans. Financial benefits of the budget will likely go to the industry and services sectors, farmer leaders said.H.M. Desarda, agriculture economist and former member, Maharashtra State Planning Board, said, There are only Budget announcements for the farmer, whose distress is growing by the day. This Budget is packaged as pro-poor and pro-farmer, but in reality, it is pro-rich and pro-industrialist.Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had said the Budget was farm-centric, and has special thrust on farming and food processing schemes. He also allocated Rs. 1,500 crore for the flagship Jalyukt Shivar project. But farmer leaders said the benefits of the scheme are not trickling down to them, and the outlays dont match the outcome.Atul Deulgaonkar, a Latur-based author and expert on Maharashtras agriculture sector, said, There is no synchronisation between the outlay and outcome in this budget, even as farmers remain in distress. Who is the government trying to fool with the Magnetic Maharashtra summits and promises of investments and jobs? Since this government has taken over, nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide. These statistics in the budget are just lies and more lies.Even the Economic Survey has painted a bleak picture while projecting a negative growth in the sector. This is worrisome, farmers said. Kaildas Apte, Executive President, Maharashtra Shetkari Sangahatna, said, The farmer of this State is selling milk for Rs. 16-17, while the government had promised a support price of Rs. 27. Rs. 3,500 crore is due to farmers in the form of RFP from sugar mill owners. The budget is silent on all this. There is nothing for the farmers in this budget except empty talk.Since this govt. has taken over, nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide.

5b17ba849855b75db2e7b04c,Sugar oversupply may hit profitability of mills,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sugar-oversupply-may-hit-profitability-of-mills/articleshow/63291206.cms,2018-03-14,"Coimbatore: Sugar wouldnt be sweet for sugar mills in the current season. With the sugar production estimated to set a new record by touching around 29.5 million tonnes in the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September) and likely to outstrip consumption by around 4-4.5 million tonnes, sugar mills may face pressure on prices and profitability in the near-term. The annual sugar consumption is pegged at 25 million tonnes.After hitting a low of Rs 31,500 per tonne in the first week of February, sugar prices picked up in the following weeks on the back of government initiatives such as the doubling of import duty to 100% and the imposition of limits on sugar sales by sugar mills.Prices, which increased to Rs 34,500-35,000 per tonne in the third week of February, have softened again and are currently hovering at around Rs 32,500 per tonne.Ratings agency ICRA has revised domestic sugar production for the 2017-18 season to around 29.5 million tonnes against its earlier estimate of at least 27 million tonnes. This has been driven principally by higher-than-expected sugar production in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior VP and group head, ICRA Ratings. This in turn is likely to exert pressure on sugar mills debt coverage metrics and also adversely affect liquidity indicators, including cane payments. Under these circumstances, government support will remain critical for the sugar industry, ICRA said. We expect the closing stocks to significantly increase to around 8.5-9 million tonnes in SY2018 (sugar year 2017-18), Majumdar stated. The reverse stock limits imposed by the government are valid up to March 31, 2018. Hence this upward revision in the sugar production estimate along with the liquidation of sugar stocks, especially by several cash-strapped sugar mills, post March 2018, is likely to result in pressure on sugar prices from the coming quarter, he said.Sugar mills profitability is likely to come under stress on account of the higher cane cost of production (higher SAP or state advised price and FRP or fair and remunerative price for the current season) along with the likely pressure on sugar realisations during Q1 FY2019 (first quarter of 2018-19), Majumdar said.However, most major UP-based mills have by and large seen significant deleveraging over the last couple of years, which will help them withstand cyclical downturns better, he said. Given the increase in production levels, the fall in prices could lead to an increase in the cane arrears, he stated."

We will be more focused on the ensuring that their demands are met under a time-bound programme.The government clarified that the suspension of the pre-condition under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that makes it mandatory to get approval from the gram sabha while acquiring land will remain. It, however, said there will be no land acquisition without the approval of the farmer who will be giving up land, and assured the farmers that there will be no forceful land acquisition for Mr. Fadnaviss pet Mumbai-Nagpur expressway project, or the bullet train.Loan waiver for allAmong the major demands accepted by the government is inclusion of farmers who didnt receive benefits under the farm loan waiver scheme in 2008 in the current loan waiver scheme, officially known as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana. The committee that will be set up to monitor its implementation will have farmer representatives and Ministers.Mr. Fadnavis said, A demand to consider each family member as an independent applicant for a farm loan waiver has been made. We can take a decision only after analysing the amounts oustanding. A committee will take a final decision within one-and-a-half months.The government has also asked Secretaries of concerned departments to individually probe isssues related to Public Distribution System shops.Kalidas Apet, executive president, Maharashtra Shetkari Sanghtana, This government has done little for the development of farmers and the landless. Farmers are struggling not only with milk prices, they arent getting their dues from the sugar mills.We have assured that appeals and claims under the FRA will be sorted out within six monthsDevendra FadnavisChief Minister"

From puranpolis to shrikhand puri and much more, Navi Mumbai residents, especially Maharashtrian households spend the day in preparing all these gastronomical goodies.While some take time out of their busy schedule and painstakingly induldge in making these sweets, there are a few who prefer buying these sweets from stores. After shopping, food is the next best thing about the festival.While we do not use too much of oil and sugar in our cooking, on festivals we splurge. The health conscious might not be so thrilled with the food that is served on the day, but most people do enjoy the spread, said Lakshmi Kurve, a Nerul resident.Many stores in Vashi and Koparkhairane that specialise in homemade food have already started selling the festival favourites. Puranpolis, flavoured shrikhand, bhakarwadi, kothimbir wadi and crisp puris are being sold like hot cakes. The sales of these delicacies have started picking up, said Hemang Patil, a store owner from Vashi. Home made sweets are better sellers than the commercially made ones, he added.Some of the markets were crowded as people are stocking up on ingredients, especially those who prefer food that is prepared at home.The taste and purity of ingredients is always the best when food is prepared at home. Most people prefer to finish most of their shopping as early as they can, said Varsha Deshpande, a Vashi resident."

This is mainly due to 43% higher sugarcane production across India.The prices are likely to drop further as there will be more supply of sugar against demand in the coming days.Chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Pankaj Patel told TOI, This year sugarcane yield is higher compared to last year. This year we alone have 56,000 acre of sugarcane crop that needs to be crushed.Last year, we were able to give farmers rate of Rs 3,954 per 100 kg. However, this year it would be lower by at least Rs 700-800 due to bumper harvest, he added.A local farmer from Surat district Ketan Patel said, We have huge quantity of sugar coming from neighbouring Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, which sells at Rs 3,000 per 100 kg. As a result, our cooperatives are compelled to cut the prices to compete with them in market.On the other side, sugar cooperatives have to make payment to farmers every 15 days. We need Rs 40-45 crore to pay the farmers. So we have to cut prices and sell the produce to pay the farmers, Patel said.Last year, government imposed 100% import duty on sugar as a result local farmers were able to get good price. However, this year with production up by 43% in the country, the demand would not be more than 250 lakh tonne against production of 300 lakh tonne, former chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Dilip Bhakta said."

However, farmers are not happy. They say the factories never buy sugarcane at the State-favoured fair at a remunerative price and that a substantial amount of the promised amount is withheld as arrears for years.The district has 37 sugar factories and two more are on the anvil. Of these, around 25 are functional. Some factories are in the cooperative sector and some are privately held. But most are controlled by leaders with political clout.In an average year, all factories together produce around 1.3 crore quintals of sugar by crushing around 15 crore tonnes of sugarcane. A third of the 10 lakh hectares of land is used for sugarcane cultivation.Bhalachandra Jarkiholi, MLA, and chairman of Ghataprabha Sugar Factory announced the price of Rs. 3,200 per tonne of sugarcane. This led to an assumption among sugarcane growers that other factories will have to match this amount.No factory pays the right price and pays on time, Appasaheb Desai, farmers leader, said. He added, We have been agitating for weeks for payment of arrears as old as three to five years. But what we have got are only assurances.He pointed out that some factories in Maharashtra were offering prices upto Rs. 3,600.In some other factories, even the cutting and transport charges are borne by the factories and farmers get lumpsum amounts. It is time factories in Belagavi followed this, Mr. Desai said. He said the factories here were controlled by politicians across parties."

Major sugar-producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have moved to the revenue-sharing formula based on the Dr Rangarajan Committees recommendations.The sugar industry is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to a range of factors like failure of monsoons, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills. In turn, it has affected timely payments to farmers.The new pricing mechanism will come into effect in the current season itself. To facilitate this transition, the government will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present state administered price (SAP) of Rs 2,750 per tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs 100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers. The sugar industries shall however continue to bear the transportation costs, said finance minister O Panneerselvam.Another major initiative is to increase production and go in for direct procurement of pulses through the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation. During 2017-18, the government promoted an intensive pulses production programme through village clusters and about 85,000 hectares of land was additionally brought under pulses cultivation.Combined with these, a string of food processing parks would come up in many districts to reduce wastage of farm produce like vegetables, fisheries, dairy, poultry and meat.While farmers organisations have welcomed the governments decision to procure pulses, they said unless the dues of Rs 1,460 crore that sugar mills owe to farmers were cleared, sugarcane farmers sufferings would not end."

Finance minister O Panneerselvam seems to believe in the axiom as he sees a tide in 20018-19, unmindful of the turbulence ahead that may capsize his yacht. The good news is Tamil Nadu will grow at 9% for the next year, much faster than India (7.3%), yet the benefits of this growth will not percolate to its people as the state coughs up large chunks of its revenue to fund interest payments and freebies.The best long-term investment seems to be the 25% increase in allocation for higher education that got Rs 4,620 crore; but spending on school education inched up just 1% to Rs 27,205 crore. Police got a 21% increase in allocation while health got a 14% increase. The freebies took up almost Rs 20,000 crore, the latest a provision of Rs 250 crore for scooters.With GST in place, the scope for increasing taxes or levies is virtually nil except with respect to petroleum products, liquor and property registrations.The budget presented on Thursday has a bit of everything yet a whole of nothing. With little or no fiscal leeway, Tamil Nadu continues to live beyond its means and, worse, it will do so at least until 2021with amounting revenue deficit.The sugar industry, which is witnessing its worst phase in 32 years, gets a reprieve in the form of a revenue sharing model between mills and cane growers, the third state to implement it after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.The state will also go in for direct procurement of cereals, include more services under its e-seva scheme and build an ultra modern food park across 450 acres in Tindivanam. With inbound project investments drying up, the states deputy chief minister hoped to reinvigorate the states traditional bastions by promising new textile and food processing policies, which he hopes will kick-start job creation. However, much depends on how soon these policies are rolled out. For long the state has been waiting for a new IT policy. The last one was announced eight years ago.Despite the temptation to splurge, the state has pulled back its spending and kept a tight leash on government finances. For one, the fiscal deficit -- the difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the government is termed as fiscal deficit -- for the current year will be sharply lower at 2.82% (against a budgetary provision of 4.14%) and for the next year, it will lower this deficit to 2.79%.But, the rising growth will not benefit the common man on street as the significant portion of tax revenues that will accrue will go towards interest, salary and pensions for government staff and funding freebies. The magnitude of this morass is such that 95% of revenue expenditure will go for fulfilling these three heads.The continued unabashed freebie culture will force the state to borrow more, especially when rates are rising, which in turn will result in higher interest payouts in coming years.The governments vulnerability will be exposed in the absence of sops to the farmers in the form of farm loan waiver, which is the national flavour. The state government missed the bus with no mention of cleaning up of its state owned units. Inefficient state PSUs are sucking away hard earned tax income. I expected some measures for cleaning up these entities, said M Ponnuswami , chairman, CII-TN. He said that slipping fiscal discipline was worrying.The governments decision to create additional land banks of 9,030 acres to allot to new investors is a welcome measure as it has become very difficult for investors to buy land in the state. We feared a steep fall in tax collection due to GST, but the collections are actually up, S Chandramohan, vice chairman, CII TN, said.Meanwhile, the government will replace 3,000 rickety old buses with new ones, with old sanctions for new buses, the state will replace its 4,593 buses during the next year. It will set up a bio park--Ticel Bio Park in Coimbatore, construct 1.30 lakh houses under hut-free village scheme. It will build 4.37 lakh new toilets allocating Rs 550 crore.It will spend Rs 20 crore to make Veda Nilayam, residence of former chief minister Jayalalithaa into a memorial and Rs 50.80 crore has been earmarked for Jaya's memorial in Marina."

(Source: Wikimedia Commons) Flower markets see large crowds ahead of the festival. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)AHEAD of Gudi Padwa on Sunday, which marks the beginning of the Hindu new year in Maharashtra, consumers thronged the markets in Dadar and Girgaum to purchase festive items including organic jaggery and the decorative Gudi, a silver or copper kalash propped up on a wooden stick and adorned with a new piece of cloth or a saree. Neem leaves and garlands of batashe (a hard, white sweet made of sugar syrup) also flew off the shelves across central Mumbai and the suburbs.Employee of a small jaggery shop in Dadar, Jagdish Singh (25), says there is greater demand for organic jaggery, even though its costly. Its not refined, and comes fresh from Kolhapur. People have newly developed a liking towards it, he said. While regular, refined jaggery is sold at roughly Rs 64-68 per kilo, the organic jaggery is sold at Rs 104 per kilo. Dnyaneshwar Shinde (50), owner of the store in Dadar, said the demand for jaggery went up dramatically during Holi, and before Gudi Padwa. The flower market in Dadar also saw large crowds as sale of marigold flowers spiked, the sign of a festival just around the corner.During this time around Gudi Padwa, we get a high demand for yellow and orange marigold flowers, said Ramesh Nawde (49), a flower vendor at Dadar market. I sold about 500 kg of orange or yellow marigold just today. Many buy them for temples or making torans (garlands) with mango leaves. On an average, the yellow and orange marigold varieties are priced about Rs. 20-40 per kilo. Some much larger marigold were going for Rs 60.Mangala Jantarwagh (50), a regular neem leaves seller, said she hiked prices ahead of Gudi Pada. As there is always a steady demand for neem, I sell it for Rs. 5-7, but during days before Gudi Padwa I sell it for Rs 10 per bundle to capitalise on the high demand. People use neem in their prasad, and add flowers too. The other items popular among regular buyers are chafa flowers (Rs 20 per pack) and dauna leaves (Rs 10 per bundle). Sunita and Bharti Manve, are a mother-daughter duo who travel to Ratnagiri to celebrate Gudi Padwa with their extended family.We make gudi using a red cloth, and even tie a string of neem leaves. We also make a sweet using grated coconut and tulsi leaves. After the pooja of the gudi, we feed the sweet and neem to each other. We visit Dadar market before the festival to purchase the material.Shrikhand and Basundi are traditional Gudi Padwa favourites. Neem leaves or their various forms like chutneys or juices are also part of the celebration. The new year is also the harbinger of spring. Neem is traditionally known to have medicinal properties like blood purification and protection against skin ailments. Sapna Gandhe (35) bought roughly 5-6 kg of yellow and orange marigolds. Its our New Year, so we as a family sit and collectively make torans to hang at our entrances. We also use them in pooja as offerings.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5b1c8e259855b74aba67c916,Indian doctors oppose new diabetes norms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/indian-docs-oppose-new-diabetes-normsnew-diabetes-norms-not-meant-for-indians/articleshow/63372962.cms,2018-03-19,"MUMBAI: A new set of global guidelines on managing diabetes that aim to replace those followed for over three decades has stirred up a row within the medical community.Doctors in India feel the norms , which recommend relaxing blood sugar targets, will not only lead to serious complications in diabetics but also confusion in treatment protocol. They advise that these should be ignored for Indians.The controversial norm relates to relaxing the long-term blood sugar target, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) which, via a blood test, gives an estimate of a persons blood sugar level average over the past few months. Generally, an HbA1c of 6.5% indicates diabetes.There were over 72 million cases of diabetes in India in 2017, according to International Diabetes Federation. American College of Physicians, an organisation of internal medicine physicians, has recommended recently in the medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, that clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes as against the traditional 6.5 to 7% which has been followed over decades. The recommendation is leading to a conflict in views amongst doctors, with certain associations opposing it. Doctors here say the guideline of lowering the blood sugar target cannot be binding and should be ignored as diabetes in India is more aggressive, and, hence, riddled with complications. They say these recommendations should not be applicable here as India has its own three advisory bodiesthe ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), RSDDI (Research Society For The Study of Diabetes in India) and API (Association of Physicians of India)which are more tuned in to Indian cases.Anoop Misra, chairman of Delhi-based Fortis-C-DOC (Centre of Excellence For Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology), said, In reality, Indian physicians continue to follow US-based guidelines, hence ACP guidelines may have substantial impact in India. If blood sugar control is loosened (as advised by ACP), more patients in India will suffer from complications, the burden of which is already high. We should ignore these, and stick to previous time-tested glycosylated hemoglobin limit of control of 7%.Others concur the guidelines cannot be standardized because of several differences in lifestyle, physiology and food habits. Dr Shashank Joshi, endocrinologist and diabetologist who consults at Mumbais Lilavati Hospital, said, Asian Indians who develop diabetes are insulin-resistant and have different phenotype (observable characteristics, physiological properties, or behavior) compared to those in the western world. None of the North American or European guidance are applicable for Indians, Chinese or Asian geographies. Also, since Asians consume more carbohydrates, their response to medicines and doses is different.Says Dr Rajeev Chawla, president-elect of RSSDI 2018 and senior consultant diabetologist, Pharmacotherapy using oral or injectable agents may be used in addition to lifestyle modification therapies to achieve a target glycosylated hemoglobin target of less than 7% for all diabetics as far as possible to prevent complications. The RSSDI is the largest organisation of doctors in Asia engaged in diabetes care with over 7,000 members. The guidelines were first released in 2015 and revised in January 2018 based on Indian evidence."

The mill owners have said that that despite record-breaking sugarcane production, the industry has been in crisis for three-four years.Sugarcane is one of the most politically sensitive crops in Maharashtra, with the cooperative mill lobby enjoying undisputed control over politics, and being at the centre of one of the most aggressive farmers agitations before 2014.This season, nearly 290 lakh tonne sugar has been produced in the country. The annual consumption in the country is about 255 lakh tonne. Together with the leftover 40 lakh tonne from before, the total unused stock of sugar is likely to be around 75 lakh tonne.This will have a negative impact on sugarcane prices given to farmers and local sugar rates. The balance sheets of sugar mills have completely collapsed, as the mills have to sell sugar at Rs. 6 to Rs. 7 less than production cost. This will impact the fair and remunerative price (FRP) given to farmers, said Dilip Walse-Patil, president of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited and NCP MLA.Mr. Walse-Patil said the dues of the mills have gone up to Rs. 2,500 crore in the State, and Rs. 15,000 crore at the national level. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has broached the issue with Mr. Modi too.The sugar lobby has urged Mr. Fadnavis and Mr. Modi to announce measures such as eliminating export duty; creating buffer stock of at least 50 lakh tonne as done in 2002-03 and 2007-08; initiating dialogue with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and China under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement, SAARC free trade agreement and for barter trade of sugar; and fixing price of sugar under the Essential Commodities Act.Interestingly, NCP will hold the next leg of its  halla bol  rally in its bastion of western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt."

According to her aide V.K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa had indicated she was unwell while she was in the bathroom situated on the first floor of her Poes Garden residence, after having brushed her teeth.In an affidavit filed before the Justice A. Arumughaswamy Commission (probing Jayalalithaas death), Sasikala provides an account of what transpired at Jayalalithaas residence before she was rushed to hospital. She says she helped the former Chief Minister to her bed, where she fainted.Shortly afterwards, K.S. Sivakumar, Sasikalas relative and a doctor, entered the room. Two personal security officers and a driver were called immediately.Ambulances despatchedAccording to sources privy to the 55-page, 99-paragraph affidavit filed on March 12, Dr. Sivakumar phoned Vijay Kumar Reddy, husband of Apollo Hospitals vice-chairperson Preetha Reddy. Two ambulances were despatched from Apollos Greames Road and Teynampet hospitals, which reached the residence in 10 or 15 minutes. The Apollo team brought an unconscious Jayalalithaa down from her bedroom on a stretcher. The police control room was informed and roads cleared of traffic.Sasikala has declared that Jayalalithaa regained consciousness in the ambulance and asked where they were taking her. She was told they were en route to the hospital. Earlier in the day, Dr. Sivakumar had examined Jayalalithaa twice. Significantly, Sasikala has said she suggested a visit to the hospital on that very day, but Jayalalithaa had refused to go.Her fever subsided later, the affidavit says. Sasikala claims that Jayalalithaas health issues were mainly due to the stress caused by her conviction (and imprisonment) in the disproportionate assets case in September 2014.The mental stress adversely affected her health, she says. Jayalalithaa had chosen to contest from the R.K. Nagar constituency in Chennai only because her mobility had been affected greatly due to high levels of blood sugar, the affidavit states.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas health deteriorated significantly in the first week of September 2016, partly because of fluctuating sugar levels.Two doctors, a diabetologist and a dermatologist, were consulted and they prescribed low dosage steroid tablets.She recovered but had a fever starting September 19.

Sasikala claims that Jayalalithaas health issues were mainly due to the stress caused by her conviction (and imprisonment) in the disproportionate assets case in September 2014.The mental stress adversely affected her health, she says. Jayalalithaa had chosen to contest from the R.K. Nagar constituency in Chennai only because her mobility had been affected greatly due to high levels of blood sugar, the affidavit states.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas health deteriorated significantly in the first week of September 2016, partly because of fluctuating sugar levels.Two doctors, a diabetologist and a dermatologist, were consulted and they prescribed low dosage steroid tablets.She recovered but had a fever starting September 19. She attended her last public event on September 21.Sasikala has given the Commission a list of 20 doctors who had treated Jayalalithaa between November 2014 and September 2016. They work in different private hospitals in Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata. A member of Sasikalas legal team told The Hindu that they wanted these doctors to testify before the Commission.Who saw the CM?In a possible response to allegations that no one was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa during her long hospitalisation between September 22 and December 5, Sasikala says the former Tamil Nadu Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao had met her on October 22, 2016. AIADMK leaders O. Panneerselvam and M. Thambi Durai and Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar saw her sometime during September 22-27, 2016. Akka (elder sister) was being taken from the MDCCU (Multi-Disciplinary Critical Care Unit) on the second floor to the ground floor on a day before September 27 for being scanned. At that time, Jayalalithaa saw Veeraperumal and Perumalsamy, her Personal Security Officers. Akka told them, I am fine now, do not worry. Doctor has asked me to stay for a few days. I can go home soon. The three AIADMK leaders mentioned above and other party functionaries saw her speak from a distance, according to the affidavit.On October 22, 2016, Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao saw Akka through a glass partition. Akka saw the Governor and raised her hand. The Governor has described this interaction in his book Those Eventful Days . After this, the Governor met me too, says Sasikalas affidavit.Sasikala has further said State Labour Minister Nilofer Kafeel and certain other ministers saw Jayalalithaa on November 19, 2016, when she was being moved to a private room.When contacted, Sasikalas counsel N. Raja Senthoor Pandian, said, Multiple senior bureaucrats have deposed before the Commission that they met the then CM from September 22, 2016 to December 3, 2016 at Apollo Hospitals. Various witnesses and evidence would prove that Jayalalithaa was conscious and interacted with multiple individuals during that period, he added.Video recordsSasikala says she has made videos of Jayalalithaa with her permission, of which four have been submitted to the Commission.The footage includes Jayalalithaa being treated in 2015 and 2016, before the Assembly election.Sasikala says this was part of Jayalalithaas efforts to document her health. Four video clips shot at Apollo Hospitals have also been submitted to the Commission.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas room at Veda Nilayam contains a note proving she was lucid in November, 2016. In it, Jayalalithaa had instructed AIADMKs parliamentarians on the partys strategy for the winter session of Parliament.Sasikala also provided a list of five officials, who attended a September 27, 2016, meeting on the Cauvery water sharing issue, and obtained instructions from Jayalalithaa directly. Then Chief Secretary P. Ramamohana Rao; Advocate General R. Muthukumarasamy, advisor to the government Sheela Balakrishnan; and CMs secretaries A. Ramalingam and K.N. Venkataramanan attended, according to Sasikalas affidavit."

Over 253 rivers and 259 waterbodies are being monitored under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme.Water bodiesKarnataka tops the list in critically polluted water bodies, followed by Telangana with 12 and Kerala with 6. While lakes in and around Bengaluru are polluted, it is hard to believe that lakes in other States are not as polluted or worse off. This is perhaps because other State Pollution Control Boards do not monitor or give reliable data, said an official of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, which is monitoring 120 lakes and tanks in the State.Even according to KSPCBs monitoring, all 51 lakes in the city or immediate outskirts are in the D or E category  that is, unsatisfactory water that can be used only for wildlife propagation or industrial cooling purposes.Bhima most pollutedInterestingly, in the list of 38 rivers, only Bhima from the State finds mention.This is surprising as Arkavathy and Vrishabhavathy carry the sewage and industrial effluents from industries in and around Bengaluru, said Sharachchandra Lele, researcher from Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).Research from the organisation had shown that Peenyas effluents had seen COD in Vrishabhavathy exceed 800 mg/l while Arkavathy often exceeded 500 mg/l. Even KSPCBs monitoring data shows that Arkavathy, followed by Bhadra river, is in the lowest category of water quality.However, for Panchappa Kalaburagi, president of the Bhima River Farmers' Committee, the listing of the 86-km-long river which passes through Vijayapura, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts, the extreme chemical pollution in the river is not a surprise. Sugar factories and cement factories along the stretch dump effluents directly into the river, while rampant sand mining in both Karnataka and Maharashtra has resulted in the disappearance of sand, which can naturally filter pollutants, he said, adding: Where is the river now? It is only stagnant pools of effluents."

The industries emit PM2.5 above the prescribed limit of 150 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/Nm3) from the smoke stacks. Most of the 29 industries belong to chemical and pharmaceutical sectors.Under the Maharashtra Star Rating Programme for industrial PM emissions, 19 industries scored one star, while 10 got two stars. Industries that emit less than 150mg/Nm3 are given four and five stars.Exposure to high levels of PM fine harmful solid and liquid particles floating in the air with a diameter of 10 or 2.5 microns  leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and premature death.The initiative to rate industries in Maharahtra began last year and makes it possible to access data from approximately 20,000 industrial stack samples over multiple years based on which ratings will be accorded.The 50 industries in MMR were added to the programme on Thursday, which is a joint collaboration between the state pollution control board and researchers from Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard University, and the Tata Centre for Development.Read more: 55 of 77 coal plants in Maharashtra flouting pollution normsThe programme has been running successfully in several areas of the state and so far, both the industries and the public have shown keen and active interest, said P Anbalagan, honorary member secretary, MPCB.

(Express Photo by Praveen Khanna) The decision has come at a time of sharp increase in sugarcane cultivation and decline in cereals, pulses and oilseeds. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)The Maharashtra government has decided to push a crop diversification model to create a better mechanism for demand and supply and higher renumeration for small and marginal farmers across state. The decision has come at a time of sharp increase in sugarcane cultivation and decline in cereals, pulses and oilseeds.Highly-placed sources in the state government said, The crop diversification model is region- wise taking into account the soil health and climate conditions that will evolve in a time-bound manner. This has become necessary along with the larger plans of providing minimum support price and better water management for sustainable agriculture.The increasing trend among farmers to revert to sugarcane cultivation with water availability, following the success of the Jalyukta Shivar, has the administration worried as it is likely to lead to a slump in sugar prices in the domestic market at a time when the international market is sugar sector is not upbeat.The Maharashtra Economic Survey, 2017, says that sugarcane production is expected to increase by 25 per cent over the previous year while the production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cotton is expected to decrease by four per cent, 46 per cent, 15 percent and 44 per cent, respectively. Kharif sowing was on 150.45 lakh hectares.An official in the department of the agriculture ministry said: Ideally, it is our effort to ensure that sugarcane production in the state should not exceed 9 lakh hectares. It is essentially a western Maharashtra crop where water is surplus. But its growth in Marathwada and parts of North Maharashtra is a reality. Government data says that in the last three years, 4.25 lakh water conservation works completed led to additional water storage of 16.82 lakh TMC.Sugar Federation Association president Dilip Walse Patil, while expressing concern over a possible slump in sugar prices, said: Farmers are drawn to sugarcane as it brings an assured price to the farmers. While seeking government intervention, including subsides, he warned: The mismatch between increased sugarcane production and decline in finished sugar product will make the sector economically unviable.An official in the government said: While there is a rising demand across sectors for higher subsidies in the agriculture sector, experts believe farmers cannot be left to volatile market conditions that is worsened by erratic climate changes. The crop diversification model is an attempt to bring credible alternative farming and assured production and income.Maharashtra Agriculture Price Committee chairman Pasha Patel said: In drought-hit Marathwada, if we have to tackle the small and marginal farmers, we have to push the cultivation of jowar and bajra (cereals). Now, low cost cereals with less water can become financially viable for farmers if we have industrial support.A secretary in agriculture department said: The farmers determine the crops based on the base price of the previous year. There is no stability market index in the agriculture sector. State Farmers Task Force chairman Kishore Tiwari said: The government will have to fix a financial model to ensure higher returns. Whether it relates to sugarcane cultivators or cotton, the government will have to step in to tackle the problems.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Currently, the company retails specific menu seasoning mix Hapima, which is available in fried rice mix-original, hot and spicy and masala.Declining to reveal figures, he said, the consumption of Hapima in India witnessed a 200 per cent increase last year.As part of diversifying the company's products apart from Aji-no-moto, he said, the company was also retailing Blendy-3-in-1 Masala Chai and Coffee for the Indian market.""Blendy can be consumed as an instant coffee by adding a cup of hot water,"" he said.The pre-mix powdered beverages market in India is estimated at 4,100 tonne and is growing at a rate of six per cent, every year, he said.Aji-no-moto currently has about 44,000 outlets in Tamil Nadu and plans to offer Blendy in 22,000 outlets by next year.He said Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has certified Aji-no-moto while US Food and Drug Administration has given MSG as ""generally recognised as safe"".Currently, MSG was widely used in China, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, African markets, he said."

This is the fourth highest in the country. The top three states are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, that are also major producers of sugarcane.States like Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, all of which have a much higher sugarcane production than Uttarakhand this year, have lower pending arrears.According to a written reply submitted by the central government in Parliament on Tuesday, Uttarakhand produced 2.72 lakh metric tonnes (MT) sugarcane in 2017-18, against 7.38 lakh MT in Gujarat, 4.82 lakh MT in Punjab, 4.38 lakh MT in Bihar and 4.24 lakh MT in Haryana.However, these states fare better in terms of paying their farmers. For instance, Andhra Pradesh which produced 26% more sugarcane has arrears worth 293 crore pending (80% less than Uttarakhand); Gujarat produced 7.38 lakh MT (171% more than Uttarakhand) but has arrears of 475 pending (11% less than Uttarakhand).The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, states that the payment of cane price should be made within 14 days of supply to the mill, failing which the amount will attract a 15% interest per annum on the amount due after 14 days.When asked about the high pendency, finance minister Prakash Pant said it was largely due to the delay by private mills.All arrears for 2016-17 have been cleared. Last year too, the government mills made the payments. In this season, most of the mills are still operating. Only the sugar mill in Bajpur has stopped processing. The payments have started. Let the mills first finish processing and make whatever payments they can. We will make necessary interventions if government mills are unable to pay farmers.He however made it clear that the government will not extend any financial aid to private mills. Our responsibility is to put pressure on them to make timely payments. We will allow them to operate only if they have cleared previous dues, he said.Anand Shrivastav, commissioner, sugarcane and sugar, said the department was regularly sending notices to defaulting private mills.There are three private mills in the state and two of them are very regular in their payments. Only the Iqbalpur sugar mill is in a poor financial condition. It wont be surprising if it defaults this year too. They somehow managed to make their full payment for last year only by the crushing season of this year.Meanwhile, owing to high production and low demand for sugar, mills across the country are expected to incur losses this year as the price of sugar is falling. The central government recently said in Parliament that it has enhanced the import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% to help mills in making payments to the farmers.In this background, clearing pending arrears is likely to be an uphill task for sugar mills in Uttarakhand.Agreeing on this, Pant said, The mills are likely to incur loss this year because the price of sugar is falling due to high production. We will make arrangements for the remaining amount.He however added that since the government has replaced around 60% sugarcane with a high-yielding variety, the recovery (quantity of sugar produced from raw cane) this year has been very good.Expressing hopes for a positive result, he said, Whenever the recovery is more than 10%, it is seen that mills are in profit. On an average, this year the recovery has been 10.7%. Our estimate is that private mills will be in a better position this year. The loss due incurred due to falling prices of sugar should be balanced out with the high recovery.Meanwhile, despite the governments assurance that it will help government mills in paying their dues, farmers are sceptical. They say that in absence of strict actions, sugar mills in the state have become habitual in making delayed payments.The crushing season started in November but farmers have received payments only till January 15. The condition of sugarcane farmers in the state is very bad, said Jagdish Thakur, vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Uttarakhand chapter.Asked about last seasons payments, he said that many mills made the payments only in the first month of this crushing season.Farmers cant rely on mills. The payments are untimely and uncertain. We are forced to avail loans from banks by mortgaging our property. The Sitarganj sugar mill would have benefited many farmers in the Terrai belt. But since it has been closed, farmers have been hard hit as they now have to transport their produce to far off mills, he said.BLURB: Despite being 10th in terms of sugarcane production, Uttarakhand ranks fourth when it comes to pending arrears for 2017-18"

Thombre, the president of WISMA, said on Monday.In the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest sugar producing region, output is forecast to rise to 10.8 million tonnes, said Thombre, up from 8.8 million the previous year.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the national industry association for the world's second-biggest sugar producer, in March forecast a surplus of 4.5 million tonnes following output of 29.5 million tonnes for the marketing season that started on Oct. 1.The higher-than-expected surplus could pressure local prices even lower even after they fell last week to their lowest since December 2015.Globally, prices are trading near their lowest in 2-1/2 years and an expected surge of Indian exports after the country revoked its export tax last month should mean prices may drop even further.WISMA is revising its production numbers as mills are still processing sugar cane in both Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra though the processing season typically ends in March.""Sugar cane yields are much better than last year. Still many mills are operational in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and they will continue crushing for a few more days,"" said Thombre.Last week, India mandated that mills must export 2 million tonnes of sugar to lower inventories and support local prices.On March 20, the country also scrapped its 20 percent sugar export tax as an added incentive for mills to export.Domestic sugar prices have fallen 16 percent in the past six months. In addition to the oversupply amid the rising production, mills were aggressively selling the sweetener to make payments to sugar cane farmers."

Of the 135 days of crushing season, the factory could work only 88 days producing about 57,000 quintals (57,00,000 kgs) of sugar.The 45th crushing season, that started on November 14, 2017, came to an end on March 28 this year. Actual production had started on December 6.The factory at Dayanandnagar, Dharbandora, gets sugarcane from farmers in Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This year, the factory crushed over 73,000 tonnes of cane.A proposal worth over Rs 29 crore for modernizing the factory was submitted to the Centre under the Rashtriya Krishi Yojana (National Agricultural Scheme), but was rejected as the factory is a cooperative enterprise and the scheme is available for units under the agricultural ministry.Factory agriculture officer Sadanand Sangodkar said there were several emergency shutdowns during the season which led to major losses. During the current season, the factory was shut down for 850 hours (about 35 days) on different occasions. The factory had developed snags in its turbine, condenser and jack well. A pipeline also burst thereby halting work.A sugar factory needs continuous water supply and an underground pipeline has been laid to fetch water from the Khandepar river basin. In mid-February, the dilapidated pipeline suffered cracks and the plant was shut for three days between February 14 and 16.When there are shutdowns for longer periods, cane juice gets spoiled. Though we use it to produce molasses, it is a waste as the juice could have been used to produce sugar. From extracting the juice, crushing the cane to producing the final crystalline sugar, it takes about 72 hours with the juice remaining inside the plant for 48 hours. If the plant stops during this time, the entire lot of juice goes into waste, Sangodkar said."

Officials say the state may even surpass UP this year. Sugar production in the state is 140% higher than in 2016-17 where production was impacted by the drought.The area under water-guzzling sugarcane has increased by 2.7 lakh hectares over the last year. The cane area grew from 6.3 lakh hectares in 2016-17 to 9 lakh hectares in 2017-18.Kolhapur and Solapur regions led in sugar production, though the latter is an arid area. Productivity also increased from 75 tons per hectare in 2016-17 to 100 tons in 2017-18. However, the rise in production has led to a dip in sugar prices from 3,600 per quintal last year to 2,900 now.As a result, sugar factories say they are finding it difficult to pay cane farmers the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) set by the Central government at 2,550 per quintal. The pending payments to farmers have ballooned to 2,227 crore.Over time, Maharashtra has lost its traditional markets in the North and the North-east to UP which has a locational advantage.For the full report, log on to www.timesofindia.comThe state's domestic consumption is only 24 lakh tons and it currently has pending stocks of 79 lakh tons.The Centre has stepped in with an increased import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% and also scrapped export duty on sugar which was earlier at 20%. The Centre has also set minimum indicative export quotas for mills in a bid to push sugar exports."

The CM said that the state government had also decided to give a financial assistance worth Rs. 50,000 each to landless labourers to bail them out of the current agrarian crisis.Amarinder also announced upgradation of cooperative sugar mill at Paniar in Gurdaspur district for making it economically viable. He added that so far debt relief to the tune of Rs 457 crore had been disbursed to nearly 1.02 lakh farmers in three different phases, covering 16 districts of Mansa, Bathinda, Faridkot, Muktsar, Moga, Fazilka, Ferozepur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Pathankot.After completing the debt relief scheme of cooperative loans, the state government will soon begin waiving off farm debts from commercial banks that will be completed by the end of the year, he said, adding that the government was doing loan waivers despite massive financial crisis.We are giving maximum financial assistance to the farmers in terms of debt waiver relief up to Rs 2 lakh, which is highest in country, he said, adding that in case of Uttar Pradesh it was Rs 1 lakh, while Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were writing off only Rs 50,000 each.Speaking on the occasion, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee ( PPCC ) chief Sunil Jakhar flayed the NDA government at the Centre over the issue of GST on langar items at the Golden Temple and for compensation to the Iraq victims families. He also accused the Union government of deliberately overlooking the interests and rights of Scheduled Castes.Jakhar also dared Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal to start a padyatra from Pathankot to Delhi over the farmers issues, including debt waiver. Among others who addressed the gathering were rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, education minister Aruna Chaudhary and MLAs from Dera Baba Nanak and Gurdaspur Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Barindermeet Singh Pahra.Medical college for GurdaspurThe Punjab government would open a medical college at Gurdaspur to provide best healthcare and diagnostic services to the people. While addressing a gathering here on Thursday chief minister Amarinder Singh asked PPCC president Sunil Jakhar to identify suitable land in consultation with the local MLAs for the proposed medical college. Earlier Jakhar had raised a demand with Amarinder for opening of a medical college."

He further declared that under the state governments policy of relief to farmers, farm labourers will also be covered and will get a relief of Rs 50,000 from bank loans.A government medical college and hospital was a long-pending demand of Gurdaspur residents because people from here have to travel to Amritsar in case of serious diseases. It is also part of the state budget this time. The announcement came when Punjab Congress chief and local MP Sunil Jakhar made a request during the function; at this, the CM asked Jakhar to find land for it.Nearly three decades ago, the local civil hospital was upgraded from 50 beds to 100 hoping that eventually it would be upgraded to a medical college. Former Gurdaspur Lok Sabha member and now Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa too made efforts to bring a government or even as private medical college to Gurdaspur, but to no avail. Gurdaspur has a government engineering college and an institute for hotel management.As for the sugar mill, the state government had set up a committee for improving the existing Batala cooperative sugar mill as it has dilapidated machinery. The CM said the committee has submitted its report that it will be of no use to renovate the existing mill as it will cost a lot, whereas setting up of a new sugar mill will be cheaper and more beneficial.As for the main agenda of the function, the loan waiver beneficiaries were 26,918 marginal farmers (owning up to 2.5 acres) from Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr who got cheques against loans of Rs 156.12 crore taken from co-operative societies and co-operative banks. The CM said that by now 1.02 lakh farmers have been covered under the waiver scheme that is meant for marginal and small farmers (owning up to 5) acres, at a cost of Rs 455 crore to the state. He underlined that this function was the third of its kind; the earlier ones were held at Mansa and Nakodar. He also reiterated that his government leads by offering farmers a waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh while Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra offered Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000, respectively.He noted that it is unfortunate that 10.25 lakh of Punjabs 17.5 lakh farmers are in debt. He promised a complete solution to the problem of farm loan in a phased manner as and when the state exchequer allows. He expressed concern over suicides being committed by the debt-ridden farmers. He held the 10-year misrule of SAD-BJP alliance  before Congress took power in March last year  responsible for the financial crisis in the farming sector. To make the assertion that he stands by the people in crises, he also mentioned the promise of a government job and financial help of Rs 5 lakh each to families of the men killed by terrorists in Mosul (Iraq).Later, he also took a dig at the opposition AAP and SAD MLAs boycotting parts of the recent Vidhan Sabha session over minor differences of opinion, and underlined that functioning of the state assembly costs Rs 70 lakh a day. Commenting on 23 days of non-functioning of the Lok Sabha, he said the functioning of the Lower House of Parliament costs Rs 9 crore a day and the MPs must discuss everything, instead of avoiding discussions. It mus here be underlined that Amarinder had particularly low attendance when he was most recently a member of the Lok Sabha (2014-16) before he quit and later became the CM.None of the six speakers made a mention of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who was conspicuous by his absence even as he is a local. Bajwas younger brother Fateh Jang was among the speakers. Amarinder centred his speech around farmers and did not talk at all about the problems of drug abuse and unemployment. He arrived by a chopper for which a helipad was made near the function ground.Six speakers, including the CM, addressed the gathering at the function that lasted an hour and a half, from 12.30 pm to 2 pm. Cabinet ministers Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Aruna Chaudhary, state Congress president and Gurdaspur MP Sunil Jakhar, and MLAs Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Fateh Jang Bajwa were the other speakers. Singer Pammi Bai and his troupe held the audiences attention from 10 am to 12.30 pm before the chief minister arrived.Others present on the occasion included MLAs Balwinder Singh Laadi, Arun Dogra, Sunder Sham Arora, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Rajnish Kumar Babbi, former ministers Ashwani Sekhri and Gurchet Singh Bhullar, and the district Congress unit presidents of Gurdaspur and Amritsar, Ashok Chaudhary and Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar."

5b1bc70f9855b76d5703b1e9,Two closed units figure in pollution board’s star ratings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-closed-units-figure-in-pollution-boards-star-ratings/articleshow/63633871.cms,2018-04-06,"Nagpur: Bringing various discrepancies to the fore, environmentalists have trashed the data on the basis of which industries all over the state were given star ratings. The latest data, which was reportedly provided by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), even gives rating to two Chandrapur-based industries which are non-functional.With the aim of making the data regarding industrial air pollution accessible to the common man, a star rating programme was jointly taken by the MPCB, Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India), the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard Kennedy School and Tata Centre for Development (TCD) in June last year.On April 1, TOI reported that thermal power plants of the region got a five-star rating in the programme. Also as per the data, the two most polluting industries were based in Chandrapur  Murli Cement and Vasant Sahakari Sakhar Kharkhana. The latter belongs to the sugar and distilling sector.After the data was made public, Chandrapurs environment activist Suresh Chopane pointed out that two industries in the list were shut down around 2014-15. Only industries having at least four recent stack samples (air quality samples taken from chimney of manufacturing units) are eligible to participate in the programme. The ratings are based on the median concentration of the latest stack samples for particulate matter.According to environment expert Debi Goenka, who has done an extensive study on thermal power plants of the country, the data provided by the board is not always reliable. When giving star ratings to industries, not just one but all the parameters like liquid effluents, oxides of sulphur and nitrate and other pollution sources should be taken into account. Besides, the monitoring done by MPCB is extremely poor and many times manipulated. The censors might not be calibrated well, the software is not functioning properly or in many cases actual samples are not collected from the stack, said Goenka.In April last year, TOI had exposed how the data regarding sulphur dioxide emissions from Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) was fudged. While MPCBs data showed SO2 emissions well within permissible limits, data provided by KTPS revealed that the SO2 levels at the stack were over five times the permissible limit set by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC).Chopane further pointed out that emissions from only one stack cant decide the pollution levels. You cant just take the emission data of new unit of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station and give it a rating. What about the old units which are highly polluting? This is sending across a wrong message and there is a chance that industries might misuse the ratings, he added.The biggest loophole is that the ratings do not reflect the time period, said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil. If closed industries are being rated, it clearly shows latest monitoring data is not being used. The ratings must reflect the time period when sampling was done, he added.EPIC-India and JPAL said it is only a curator of the data. We do not collect the data directly but work on what is submitted to us. Moreover, the purpose of programme is to highlight such discrepancies too so that the public is aware of polluting industries, said a spokesperson."

In 1867, he put forward the drain of wealth theory expostulating that Britain was economically draining Indiaan annual drain of 200-300 million pounds of revenue to Britain at the time he wrote the book in the 1870s. Ironically, the CAG of England in a 2013 audit was horrified that Britain could have raised more money from colonial India. Huge, huge notional loss! said the British CAG that estimated the total value of exploitation as Rs 1 trillion, that amount to around Rs 91 lakh crore at current rates over 300 years. After 70 years of Independence, India continues to be lootedthis time by Indians.Absence of credit discipline led to years of reckless lending among public sector banks (PSBs), which the government and regulator now want to contain.Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of all banks aggregated Rs 8.41 lakh crore as on December 2017; slated to rise to Rs 9 lakh crore this year. The State Bank of India (SBI) leads as the largest lender, topping the list with highest amount of gross NPAs at Rs 2 lakh crore, followed by Punjab National Bank (PNB), IDBI Bank, and Bank of India. But bank chiefs say they are scraping the bottom of the barrel to reduce the toxic pile.The SBI has a two-fold strategy to avoid fresh slippages and at the same time resolve existing NPAs. Apart from the RBIs (Reserve Bank of India) list of 12 large accounts last June for resolution, we have been consciously working on accounts internally identified. Several cases are being referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), says Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI.CaptionIn fact, all other 21 PSBs too are knocking on the doors of the NCLT, which has seen a sudden surge in cases. As many as 8,457 cases were pending in the NCLT as on December 2017 and 264 in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The idea is to recover dues as quickly as possible, adds Kumar, downplaying fears that chances of insolvency could be higher. In the absence of a resolution (which includes either roping in a new management, or finding new investors, or raising capital by selling non-core assets to repay existing debt), more accounts could become insolvent. Such a move will spell trouble for lenders, who manage to recover just about Rs 25 of every Rs 100 that turns sour.The newly issued Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework by the RBI brought Dena Bank, Central Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, UCO Bank, IDBI Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Indian Overseas Bank, Corporation Bank, Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, and United Bank of India under the framework. Collusion between bank officials, rampant nepotism and powerful political connections has allowed big business to loot Indias banking system.The RBI classifies bank frauds into three broad categories: deposits-related frauds, advances-related frauds and services-related frauds. The year 2018 opened the lid on a Pandoras box of bank scams. Indian banks reported a staggering 12,533 frauds, aggregating to Rs 18,170 crore in financial year 2017-18, largely due to weak internal controls. Data collated by Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a shareholder advisory service, Bank of Maharashtra reported the highest number of frauds at 3,893, followed by ICICI Bank (3,359) and HDFC Bank (2,319). In some banks, while the aggregate quantum is low, the average fraud size is high, indicating that the sector needs to urgently revisit and strengthen its internal financial controls.The Nirav Modi scam broke on February 14 when PNB informed the Bombay Stock Exchange of having detected around $1,771.69 million worth fraudulent and unauthorised transactions in a Mumbai branch. PNB also complained to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against billionaire diamantaire Modi cheating it of about Rs 11,400 crore after Diamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds together approached PNB on January 16 with import documents and requested for Buyers Credit to pay their overseas suppliers.Nirav, brother Nishal, Niravs wife Ami, and Gitanjali Gems owner Mehul Chinubhai Choksi are partners of the firms. The bank realised that the firms were availing of credit using fake documentation and started an investigation that revealed the makings of a Rs 1,140-crore scam. After further investigations, officials estimated the amount of the Nirav Modi fraud at Rs 12,686 crore in the first two FIRs for misusing legitimate loans and bank guarantees. This is when Modis personal fortune was around Rs 116 billion in 2017.Before Modi, PNB had lost Rs 28 billion thanks to various frauds in 2017 alone. Even before the bank launched the complaint, it seems Modi had got a whiff of what was in store for him after the scam was revealed. As the New Years dawn broke, he quietly escaped India with his family. Along with him were wife Ami, brother Nishal and relative Choksi, who would be wanted in connection with the fraud. Sources say he was tipped off by someone powerful in banking circles.There is no way he would have known unless he knew PNB would file a case and he would be arrested, says an Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer. This was confirmed by one of the CBI officers aware of the case. Modi has high-level contacts in the banking circles, he says. Modi had been getting investors to put money in his companies by promising to open 100 stores in major international cities by 2020. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal reportedly said that his client had assets worth Rs 5,000-6,000 crore in India alone.Unlike many other financial fugitives, Modis wherabaouts are unknown, and hence extradition proceedings cannot be launched against him. According to various reports, he has been sighted in Switzerland and New York. Modi blamed PNB for having acted in a premature fashion, inhibiting his repayment ability. Then why did he flee in January when the case was registered only in mid-February? asks the ED official. Choksis location is also unknown, though he issued a statement refusing to come back on the grounds of bad health. He alleged political conspiracy, media witch hunt and threats to his familys safety and animosity from employees, creditors and customers who have not been paid.Following the PNB incident, based on the government and regulators insistence, all PSBs have internally scanned their respective LoU/LoC-related transactions, besides assessing, genuine and accounted LoUs. Further, banks have also put in place controls including creating an additional layer of approvals for all outward SWIFT messages. Those banks where integration of SWIFT with CBS is not yet done are expected to do so by April, besides deploying time restrictions for such transactionsbetween 9 am and 8 pm only.Even as the PNB-Modi storm continued, Indias pre-eminent female banking icon Chanda Kochhars reputation began to face heat. The CBI registered a preliminary inquiry to probe an alleged deal between Kochhars husband, Deepak, and Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot, though she herself is not named. The CBI is investigating whether Deepak received crores from Dhoot for NuPower Renewables promoted by him, six months after Videocon received a Rs 3,250-crore loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. But on March 28, the ICICI Board issued a statement reposing its confidence in Kochhars governance and integrity. Dhoot said the allegations were unfounded. Personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts, he reportedly said.Another high-profile case is that of Vikram Kothari, chairman and MD of Kanpur-based Rotomac Global. Kothari is embroiled in a controversy for alleged loan default worth over Rs 3,695 crore taken from different state-owned banks. The CBI has registered an FIR against Kothari on the basis of a complaint by the Bank of Baroda.This decade alone has been a calendar of banking frauds. In 2011, CBI revealed that executives of Bank of Maharashtra, OBC and IDBI Bank created around 10,000 fictitious accounts in which loans worth Rs 1,500 crore were deposited. From massive scams to willful defaulters, the list is almost endless.* Mumbai Police filed nine FIRs against public sector firms for perpetrating Rs 600 crore fixed deposit fraud.* Electrotherm India defaulted on a payment of Rs 436 crore to the Central Bank of India.* Kolkata-based industrialist Bipin Vohra allegedly used forged documents to get `14 billion as a loan from the Central Bank of India.* Ex-chairman and MD of Syndicate Bank SK Jain was arrested for allegedly receiving bribes for sanctioning loans worth Rs 8,000 crore.* Vijay Mallya was declared a willful defaulter by Union Bank of India and SBI, and PNB followed suit in 2015.* As on September 30, 2017, Jatin Mehta-promoted Winsome Diamonds & Jewellery Ltd and Forever Precious Jewellery & Diamonds Ltd owed close to `6,712 crore to various banks.* Kolkata-based REI Agro, a company owned by Sandip Jhunjhunwala, owes Rs 3,871 crore* Reid & Taylor (India) Limited & S Kumars Nationwide Limited promoted by Nitin Kasliwal owe more than Rs 5,000 crore. In 2015, it was discovered that employees of Jain Infraprojects defrauded Central Bank of India for over Rs 2 billion. A foreign exchange scam in which Rs 60 billion was sent to a fake corporation in Hong Kong by bank employees surfaced. The year 2016 next topped the cake, when it was discovered that four people opened almost 380 accounts with Syndicate Bank and stole `10 billion using fake cheques, LoUs and insurance policies.In 2017, fugitive Mallyas debt rose Rs 9,500 crore to IDBI and other banks. The CBI had registered FIR against five PSBs and six chargesheets were filed against Deccan Chronicle Holdings for causing a loss of Rs 11.61 billion. The same year, CBI arrested Kolkata-based promoter of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, Nilesh Parekh, for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 22.23 billion to 20 banks by diverting money from loans through shell companies in Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE.The CBI also filed a case against the former zonal head of the Bank of Maharashtra and a director of a Surat-based private logistics company for being involved in a Rs 8.36-billion scam.This year, a director of the Andhra Bank was arrested by ED for participating in a Rs 5-billion bank fraud involving a pharmaceuticals company. In February, CBI registered a case against Indias biggest sugar producer, Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd, chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, deputy managing director Gurpal Singh and others on a complaint by the OBC over a loan fraud of Rs 97.85 croreGurpal Singh is Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singhs son-in-law.A few days before, a Rs 3.9-billion fraud was exposed in OBC, which has incurred losses to the tune of Rs 5 billion. An IIM Bangalore study found banking scams cost PSBs at least Rs 22,743 crore between 2012 and 2016. RBI data shows over 25,600 cases of banking fraud, worth Rs 1.79 billion up to December 21 last yeararound 455 such cases of Rs 1,00,000 or above were detected at ICICI Bank; 429 at SBI, 244 at Standard Chartered Bank and 237 at HDFC Bank. The Central Vigilance Commission is supervising the CBI investigation into 10 big bank fraud cases.Meanwhile, the countrys cooperative banks are most vulnerable to scamsters. Their primary objective is to assist the agriculture sector to economically empower rural India by giving financial assistance to small and medium farmers. The Uttarakhand State Cooperative Bank Ltd (USCB) is in the eye of a storm for violating norms by financing liquor contracts and sugar mills, and sanctioning loans to relatives of board members without collateral; its NPAs amount to Rs 165 crore in 2018. The bank reportedly has not filed any recovery case in 2016-17 with the total recovery being just Rs 3.11 lakh.The system suffers due to collusion between politicians and pliable managements, which give credit to the well-connected and later would waive the repayment. Rural development lender Nabard has accused a Mumbai politician of gross financial irregularities at the Mumbai District Central Cooperative Bank involving dozens of credit cooperative societies. NPAs, bad loans and loan waiver schemes are burdening the sector. According to the National Federation of State Cooperative Banks, absolute NPAs of district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) at the end of March 31, 2016 was Rs 22,406 crore, and state cooperative banks lost Rs 5,147 crore. As of March 31, 2016, only 62,050 primary agricultural credit societies were viable out of nearly 93,367.The tragedy is that bad loans from these banks are passed on to large nationalised banks which are reeling under huge amounts of bad business loans. A multitude of co-op banks have collapsed over the years, and depositors mostly get only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of their money deposited after the liquidation process that could last for nearly a decade, or just `1 lakh each through the Deposit Insurance Guarantee Corporation. Fake IDs, proxy deposits and fake gold guarantees form a common pattern in such scams.After demonetisation, vested interests used many cooperative banks to launder money. In 2016, ED started a probe into high-value transactions, some of which involved over a dozen cooperative banks in Mumbai that received deposits of Rs 1,596 crore in old notes and 205 new bank accounts opened in Allahabad into which scrapped notes were deposited. The directorate is completing investigation into a group of two dozen DCCBs in four states for money laundering. The taxpayers money is ultimately used for bailouts; the government will revive 23 district co-operative banks on the verge of closure with an infusion of Rs 2,375 crore.Frauds, big or small, have financial implications. For instance, in Bank of Maharashtra, the fraud amount as a percentage of total assets were 1.02, shows IiAS data. Added to a gross NPA of 19 per cent, this means that more than one-fifth of the asset size is at risk every year due to weak controls and lack of adequate due diligence.In November 2017, Nabard sanctioned a special limit of Rs 21,000 crore to DCCBs for agricultural credits. An RTI reply revealed in early 2017 that the RBI had no details of any irregularities or scams in the exchange of the demonetised currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 by the cooperative banks.However, IIM Bangalore data revealed that more than 95 per cent of fraud cases and amounts are in commercial banks, where public sector banks account for just about 18 per cent of total number of fraud cases. But the subtext is that the amount involved comes up to 83 per cent. Scams in private sector banks which record around 55 per cent of fraud cases are only worth about 13 per cent of the total amount involved.The IIM paper noted that the frauds may be primarily due to lack of adequate supervision of top management, faulty incentive mechanism in place for employees; collusion between the staff, corporate borrowers and third party agencies; weak regulatory system; lack of appropriate tools and technologies in place to detect early warning signals of a fraud; lack of awareness of bank employees and customers; and lack of coordination among different banks across India and abroad. The delays in legal procedures for reporting, and various loopholes in system have been considered some of the major reasons of frauds and NPAs. Moreover, there is a difference in the assessment of NPA value between banks and the RBI. There was a difference of around Rs 23,239 crore between SBIs NPA divergence and the RBI at the end of March 2017.After the Nirav Modi scam broke, the Finance Ministry asked PSBs to check all NPAs amounting to over Rs 50 crore for fraud, identify willful defaulters and refer the cases to the CBI while keeping the ED and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in the loop with a 15-day deadline.IDBI Bank has initiated a quality assurance audit (QAA) and roped in an external expert, to strengthen its internal audit. The scope of QAA includes review of the internal audit framework (policies, processes, procedures, reporting structures, formats etc) and integration thereof with risk-based supervision. Besides, it will also review branch risk rating framework to ensure that various business risk assessment parameters, criticality, risk weightages and audit observations reflect the risk severity of the branches, in terms of business performance, adherence to procedures and regulatory compliances.This is expected to be completed by April and we will implement the suggestions of QAA immediately to strengthen and reinforce the internal audit system with our business goals, observes Mahesh Kumar Jain, MD & CEO, IDBI Bank.Others such as Bank of Baroda and Bank of India too have drawn up action plans to strengthen the controls in the areas of trade finance, SWIFT, credit risk, operational risk besides cyber and IT risk. We will be submitting our action plan with the board for approvals, following which it will be rolled out, says a senior official of Bank of India.The RBI has set up a panel to study rising cases of bank frauds and create a blueprint to curb them. India ranks fifth in bad loans in the world. However, as long as collusion between big business and top bankers continues in a growth-at-any-cost-fuelled economy, financial frauds are likely to continue.While we expect the framework is positive in the long-run, banks will see a spike in NPAs over the next couple of quarters, notes Mitul Budhbhatti, associate director, Care Ratings.

The chemical analysis report that will solidify the diagnosis is likely to arrive in another one or two days.Mukerjea regained consciousness on Saturday afternoon, nearly 15 hours after she was found unconscious by guards at Byculla Womens Prison. Professor of medicine at JJ Dr Wiqar Shaikh on Sunday said she was responding to treatment. Its a case of drug overdose similar to what she suffered in 2015. She is presently conscious, responsive, cooperative, and obeying commands. Our only worry now is high fever and pneumonia that she has developed since Saturday evening, he said.A CT scan carried out on Sunday morning showed she had developed aspiration pneumonia, perhaps by swallowing her own saliva in a state of unconsciousness, said medical superintendent Dr Sanjay Surase. Dean Dr SD Nanandkar said she will continue to be in the critical care unit in case she needed oxygen support at any point.Mukerjea has been communicating with the doctors and nurses at the ward. But when I asked her what she consumed and how she got that, she didnt answer, said Dr Shaikh, who also visits the prison once a week as a consultant. He said Mukerjea consumes three pills every day: for blood pressure, depression, and vascular changes in the brain.I had asked jail authorities to administer the drugs under direct supervision. She is supposed to be called to the jail guards room for putting the pills in her mouth, the doctor said, adding that it is unlikely that she may have overdosed on the antiplatelet or the BP medicines. But, only the chemical report will rule out if the antidepressant had a role to play.Dr Shaikh also ended all ambiguity around her 2015 hospitalization to JJ hospital with similar symptoms. An investigation by the prison authorities at the time had attributed it to weakness caused by low blood pressure and sugar levels. This was despite a report from Hinduja Hospital establishing an overdose of anti-depressant benzodiazepines. Dr Nanandkar said they wouldnt be pushing Mukerjea for answers till she felt better.When TOI contacted prison officials on Sunday, they said an inquiry is likely to be initiated into the case."

As of now, we know he is safe and had gone to Madhya Pradesh on his own, senior police inspector Smita Jadhav from NRI police station said.A resident of Kharghar, Mr. Chaphekar had gone to a friends house at Seawoods Estate on Friday night for dinner. At 1 a.m., he called his driver to pick him up. After getting into the vehicle, he kept his mobile phone and all his other stuff in the car and told the driver that he will be right back, and left. After 20 minutes, when he did not return, the driver went to check on him at his friends house and found that he had not been there, Ms. Jadhav said.Mr. Chaphekar, in-charge of the Economic Offences Wing, had joined the unit in the last week of January.On Saturday morning, Mr. Chaphekars son Akash reached his work place. He thought that probably he was working even in the night, but he was not there. A missing complaint was lodged with us by Saturday evening, Ms. Jadhav said.The CCTV cameras at Seawoods Estate showed Mr. Chaphekar getting into an Ola cab. The family and his colleagues were worried as he is a BP patient with high sugar level, and he had left all his medicines in his car.We have no idea what made him take such a step. He has never done this before. It could be due to some work pressure, his daughter Neha said."

The farm is on the fringes of Koka Wildlife Sanctuary.The two cubs, a male and a female, are virtually fighting a battle for survival in the wild or lifelong captivity due to sheer carelessness on part of Hathzade.According to forest officials, the cubs and leopardess were first seen on March 22, when Hathzade partially burned bagasse residue left in the farm after cutting sugar cane. Incidentally, Bhandara honorary wildlife warden Rajkamal Job who was present there stopped Hathzade.Shockingly, after a break Hathzade continued cleaning operation of farm by burning the residue. According to Shahid Parvez Khan of Save Ecosystem And Tiger (SEAT), Bhandara, the cubs were with mother till April 4, when huge fire erupted in the farm.Bhandara deputy conservator (DyCF) Vivek Hoshing says, Fortunately, our men rescued the cubs and saved them from getting charred. Now all out efforts are being made to reunite them with the leopardess.A six-member team has been constituted to take all out efforts to reunite the cubs. We are taking instructions from Dr Ajay Deshmukh, who is wildlife vet in Western Maharashtra, and has reunited leopard cubs in 50 such operations, said Hoshing.However, its been 7 days that the leopardess has not taken the cubs despite visiting the spot. Dr Deshmukh says, It is a positive sign that the mother is at least coming near the cubs. There may be some varied reasons, may be presence of a male, why she did not take away the cubs.In Junnar, in 50-odd operations we carried out, the mother takes away cubs even after 8-10 days. We should not hurry and wait for even 15-20 days, Dr Deshmukh said.According to Khan, the cubs are being fed goat milk, lactogen and ORS. Their health is also being monitored daily by veterinarians. Camera trap pictures show the mother is visiting the place and a day before she was close to the cubs kept in plastic crates. Unfortunately, she did not take away the cubs, he said.As a matter of precaution, the forest department has replaced normal camera traps with infrared cameras (IR), which will not flash and distract the leopardess.Khan said a machan has been built near the spot from where monitoring is being done by volunteers. A natural environment is being given to the cubs.In the last two years, six sloth bears that had delivered cubs in dilapidated village homes were safely reunited in the wild in Bhandara."

AIKS workers plan to tour at least 24 districts affected by farm distress in the run up to June 1 protest during which they aim to spread awareness among farmers.Addressing a news conference here on Tuesday, AIKS general secretary Ajit Navale said, The farmers will gherao government offices in order to send a stern message to those who are at the helm of affairs in the state and at the Centre. The government has so far failed to act on its promises.The government had promised setting up of three separate committees to look into the issues of loan waiver, implementation of forest rights for tribal farmers and fair price for farm produce. But even after a month, no concrete step has been taken, he said.We aim to collect signatures of over 20 lakh farmers from 24 districts and also inform them about their rights and how government was not paying attention to their issues, Navale said.Asked whether AIKS has approached the government for discussion on these issues, Navale said, We didnt receive any positive response from minister Girish Mahajan whenever we approached him with our problems.Blaming the BJP-led central government, he said, the Union government too has failed miserably in resolving farmers issues. The government was supposed to form a sugar cane price regulatory committee. Also, a separate committee was to handle loan waiver matters of farmers. But nothing has been so far been done in this regard, Navale said."

(File)A DAY after Indrani Mukherjea was discharged from JJ Hospital, she was produced in the special CBI court conducting the Sheena Bora murder trial through a video-conferencing link from the Byculla womens jail. On Thursday, a key prosecution witness, Kajal Sharma, who was Indranis secretary, was expected to depose. Indranis advocates, Gunjan Mangla and Ayaz Khan, submitted before the court that Indrani should remain present in court for the recording of evidence and sought an adjournment.A medical officer from Byculla womens jail told the court that Indrani was inspected at 10.30 am on Thursday morning and that she is unable to walk. The officer added that Indrani was complaining of weakness and will need four-five days to recover completely.The court asked her advocates to ask Indrani, through the video-conferencing link, if she would want to be present during the deposition of the third witness, Sharma. Indrani responded saying: Yes, please. Indrani said she was not in a position to attend the court. Her advocates submitted an earlier order of the Bombay High Court on the required presence of an accused during recording of evidence. The court then directed that the trial be adjourned till she recovers and can come to court.CBI prosecutor Bharat Badami requested the court that since the witness had come to court twice, heavy cost should be imposed on Indrani to pay the witness expenses. Indranis advocate countered the CBI stating that since Indrani had taken ill while in custody, it is the states responsibility and, therefore, the cost cannot be incurred. No cost was imposed on Indrani by the court.Peters foodAfter the courts direction on Wednesday for Indranis co-accused, ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and husband, Peter Mukerjea, regarding not eating outside food in the court, Peter, Thursday, entered the witness box to seek permission from Special Judge JC Jagdale to eat before leaving for jail. The judge inquired about who had brought the food. On being told that it was brought by a friend, the court asked the person about his identity and the food he had brought. The man named JP Swami told the court that he had brought a burger and coffee. Peter told the court that if he did not eat at regular intervals, his sugar level drops.The judge said eating was a basic necessity and on humanitarian grounds, he would allow Peter to eat. The judge told Peter that since he and Indrani are witnesses in another case (one against Karti Chidambaram in the INX Media deal), there is apprehension about their safety and care should be taken. Peter then proceeded to eat. Constables from his police escort team, however, directed Peters friend to eat the food before Peter did to ensure it was safe for consumption. The friend then had the fries, burger and coffee before Peter was given the food.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5b14eb039855b72e9ad67698,Sugar mills seek production subsidy scheme from Centre,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sugar-mills-seek-production-subsidy-scheme-from-centre/article23544972.ece,2018-04-15,"Sugar mills have appealed to the Centre to credit production subsidy directly into the bank accounts of sugarcane farmers as lower ex-mill sugar prices, unviable exports and higher FRP (fair and remunerative price which was raised by Rs. 25 a quintal) to ease liquidity crunch.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) made the representation to the Centre in this regard recently to overcome liquidity pressure among the mills.Higher FRPThe Centre had raised FRP by more than 10% over last year viz to Rs. 25 a quintal of cane. Compared with last year, the domestic ex-mill sugar prices are lower by 20% . The Centre helped the mills in 2015-2016 sugar season by paying Rs. 4.5 for a quintal of cane directly to farmers as part of the FRP.This reduced the liability of the mills towards farmers. The Centre should announce a similar scheme with a production subsidy of Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a quintal in the current season which would cover a substantial part of the increase in FRP. The amount can be paid directly into the farmers bank accounts, ISMA said.Association sources said, the Centre announced MIEQ (minimum indicative export quota) of 20 lakh tonnes so that some surplus stock can be moved out. Exports are, however, not viable as globally there is excess production and the market is depressed. Prices are also low in domestic and international markets, the sources said.In the domestic market, the ex-mill price in Uttar Pradesh is Rs. 28.50 a kg of sugar whereas the cost of production is Rs. 35 a kg. The ex-mill price in Maharashtra is Rs. 27 a kg against production cost of Rs. 32 a kg. By the end of March, the all India sugar production for the current season (October 2017 to September 2018) stood at 281.82 lakh tonnes. This is 92.95 lakh tonnes higher than the preceeding season."

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5b1d2b519855b74aba67d154,Maharashtra: 696 farmer suicides in three months despite loan waiver,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/696-farmer-suicides-in-3-mths-despite-loan-waiver/articleshow/63792083.cms,2018-04-16,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra has recorded 696 farmer suicides in the first three months of 2018 between January and March, according to official data. The figure is higher than the 672 cases reported in the same period last year, despite a farm loan waiver declared last June.Of the 696 cases, only 206 or 29% have been declared eligible for compensation so far. These are cases which a state committee links to indebtedness.The data shows that farmer suicides have risen in the three regions of Marathwada (an arid belt), North Maharashtra (the epicentre of the farmers strike in 2017) and Western Maharashtra (the sugar belt ).The Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, continues to report the highest number of farmer suicides, but has seen a decline of 24 cases compared to the same period last year (see box). Both the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions are in the cotton-growing belt, where 80% of the crop was affected by the pink bollworm pest attack last year.The impact of the loan waiver has yet to kick in with payouts proceeding at a slow rate, say activists. Till March 7, Rs 13,782 crore had been credited into the accounts of 37 lakh farmers, when the final beneficiary list is meant to be 69 lakh farmers. This slow pace has affected crop loan disbursements as well with banks waiting for the waiver money to come in, said Ajit Navle from the Kisan Sabha.Farmer groups stress that the crucial issue of pricing of crops has yet to improve, without which farm incomes will not rise. Officials admit that procurement by the government of crops under the minimum support price has been slow owing to the lack of storage space.Cotton prices have additionally been impacted by the pink bollworm attack, says activist Vijay Jawandhia. Good quality cotton is selling at Rs 4,800 but poorer quality cotton is selling at around Rs 2,500. This is the price for 30-40% of cotton sold, he added."

He was under judicial custody when shifted to Sassoon Hospital on Sunday (April 15) after he had complained of chest pain.Ahmednagar SP Ranjankumar Sharma stated in a press release, Girwale died in the hospital around 10.50pm on Monday. The hospital has given a report that Girwale died due to a heart attack. The Bund Garden police have registered a case of accidental death. The case has been transferred to CID for a probe.Senior inspector M M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police confirmed registration of the case and said, We have transferred the case papers to the Kotwali police in Ahmednagar for further investigation.While a report by the hospital stated that Girwale died of a heart attack, his brother Babasaheb alleged, while speaking to TOI, that Girwale died of injuries he suffered because of excessive police torture in custody. We want a case of murder to be registered against the police officers responsible for my brothers death and their arrests, said Babasaheb. He also gave a complaint letter to this effect to the Bund Garden police.Girwales death had immediate repurcussions in the politically-sensitive Ahmednagar district where tension has been simmering ever since the twin murders. Scores of his followers started gathering at his residence in Maliwada area of Ahmednagar while many rushed to Pune. His family blamed the Ahmednagar police, especially the crime branch officers, for his death. Girwales relatives refused to perform his last rites till an offence was registered against the policemen responsible for his death. A heavy police deployment was made in Ahmednagar to avert any untoward fallout.A medical officer at the Sassoon General Hospital who did not wish to be identified, said, Girwale underwent a weight loss (bariatric) surgery a few years ago. After his death, we conducted a post-mortem. The cause of his death was coronary artery disease (CAD) with septicaemia. CAD causes impaired blood flow in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), it is the most common form of heart disease and a leading cause of death.According to the release issued by Sharma, Girwale was arrested on April 8 and was in police custody till April 10. Later, he was sent to the Nashik central prison after being remanded in judicial custody. On April 10, a separate case (involving sale and supply of illicit liquor) was registered against Girwale with the Kotwali police station under the Bombay Prohibition (Maharashtra) Act and he was taken into custody from the prison on April 13, Sharma stated. Girwale was produced before the court in Ahmednagar on April 14 and was remanded in police custody for a day.When Girwale started complaining of chest pain on Sunday (April 15), he was first taken to the civil hospital in Ahmednagar. He was then referred to the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune, Sharma stated. Girwale was taken to the Sassoon General Hospital with the courts permission. His relatives wanted to take him to a private hospital in Pune but the doctors at the Sassson General Hospital did not allow them to shift Girwale without the courts permission, he added. After the court granted permission, a team from the private hospital visited the Sassoon General Hospital on Monday afternoon and examined him. They told Girwales relatives that it would be risky to shift him, Sharma stated.The SP said that another medical practitioner from the private hospital went to the Sassoon General Hospital and examined Girwale again in the evening. He too had given a report that shifting Girwale was medically not advisable, Sharma stated. Later, he had to be put on a life support system and he passed away at 10.50pm on April 16.Girwales brother Babasaheb said, We had met him the day after he was arrested on April 8. He told me and his wife about the beating by the police. My brother had marks all over his body. He was a very strong person but he looked completely dejected when I met him. My brother did not have blood pressure or a sugar problem. He used to exercise daily. I cannot believe a heart attack could be the reason behind his death.Babasaheb said his brother was a firm person and was always in the lead on every issue. There is a political conspiracy behind my brothers death. We want a case of murder registered against the persons responsible for my brothers death, Babasaheb said.Hundreds of supporters of Kailash Girwale stopped the ambulance carrying his body at Supa in Ahmednagar, blaming police officers for his death and demanding their arrest. Girwales wife has lodged a complaint at Kotwali police station against inspector Dilip Pawar for her husbands death. Following the intervention of senior police officers, the complaint was accepted and the family was told that the case has been transferred to the CID.Around 5pm on Tuesday, the body was finally brought to Ahmednagar and a huge funeral procession was taken out amidst tight police bandobast.Additional forces were deployed in Ahmednagar city and Maliwada, the area to which Girawle belonged.Girwale was a two-time corporator and a key Maratha leader in Ahmednagar. He was also the district coordinator for the Maratha Kranti Morcha. In spite of being a leader of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , he was supported by the NCP to become co-opt member of the Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation."

Yet this year, Maharashtra has broken a record and touched the highest sugar production in its history at 105.58 lakh tonnes.By the end of the season in May, sugar output in the state is set to hit 107-108 lakh tonnes. The previous record was in 2014-15 at 105.14 lakh tonnes. Maharashtra is the countrys second highest sugar producer, after Uttar Pradesh. This is record production and crushing is not yet over. But the state is likely to finish second behind UP whose projections are higher, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.But the glut is worrying for sugar factories and cane farmers. Sugar prices have crashed by Rs1,000 per quintal from Rs3,600 to Rs2,600. This is making it hard for factories to pay cane farmers the price set by the Centre at Rs2,550 per tonne. Pending dues to the states cane farmers are at Rs2,277 crore.Nationally too, the picture is one of excess, with production 56% higher than last year. So far this year, sugar output has reached 304 lakh tonnes compared to 195 lakh tonnes last year, said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NSCSF). Nationally, payments due to farmers are worth Rs20,000 crore, he said.With factories making losses due to low prices, it is difficult for them to get new working capital in the form of loans, said NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, NSCFC chairman. Many will not be able to function when the crushing season begins in October, he said. The cultivation area of water-guzzling sugarcane in India is expected to grow from 46 lakh hectares this year to 51 lakh hectares next year.The industry is pushing for export of 4 mn tonnes of stock to stabilize prices, with NSCSF writing to PM Modi. So far, Centre has increased import duty from 50% to 100% and scrapped export duty (earlier it was 20%)."

His advocate has appealed to the court, saying Lalu needs three more months for treatment of various illness related heart and kidney in advanced medical centres. Lalu, who has been convicted in four fodder scam cases till date, is undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Delhi, under judicial custody.Lalu had filed petition for the provisional bail in all the three fodder scam cases in which special CBI courts have convicted him during the last four months. The cases are related to fraudulent withdrawal of money from the Dumka, Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries. In 2013, Lalu had been convicted in another fodder scam case related to the Chaibasa treasury.The hearing for the provisional bail for the cases related to Deoghar and Dumka treasuries came up for hearing before court of Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh on Friday.Lalus lawyer Chitttranjan Sinha said, We have appealed before the court stating that Lalu has ulcers in his rectum and could turn fatal if infected. He said Lalus kidney was also 60% damaged adding that his blood pressure and sugar level were not under control.We pointed out that AIIMS reports, too, have stated that Lalus blood pressure was fluctuating and the sugar level was also not under control. We argued that Lalu needed sometime for getting his blood pressure treated at the Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai, where he had undergone heart surgery. He also needed treatment for his kidney at Medanta hospital, Sinha said.The court has directed the CBI to file its reply on the AIIMS report and scheduled the next hearing on May 4. It also asked the defence lawyers to give in writing why it wants provisional bail for Lalu, Sinha said.Lalu was imprisoned at the Birsa Munda central jail since his conviction in the fodder scam case related to Dumka treasury on December 23, 2017. Lalu, however, developed several medical problems and was admitted to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, on March 17. After a few days, the RIIMS board recommended that Lalu be shifted to AIIMS for better treatment. Lalus lawyers, however, have now claimed that his condition has not improved significantly in AIIMS as well.HC stay on arrest warrant against RJD MLAThe Jharkhand high court on Friday stayed the arrest warrant against RJD MLA Bhola Yadav asking him to appear before the special CBI court within seven days and explain his stand. The special court had on Thursday issued a non-bailable warrant against Yadav after he failed to appear in court in a contempt notice. Prabhat Kumar, who filed petition on behalf of Yadav, said the contempt notice was issued after Yadav gave statements in media against the courts judgment on Lalu in the Dumka fodder scam case."

The sugar glut has brought the ex-mill price down to Rs 26-Rs 28/kg, against the cost of production of Rs 36/kg.Sources said after issuing a few warnings to the sugar mills for non-payment of cane arrears to the farmers, the government has realised the surplus production, falling global prices and huge losses being suffered by the mills need to be addressed. The meeting will deliberate on each issue. Until and unless there is price correction, there will be no improvement. The government has to take some bold decisions quickly, said an official, who did not wish to be named.The sugar production has crossed 30 million tonnes against the domestic consumption of about 25 million tonnes."

(Representational) Yoga and laughter therapy is seen as a common exercise among senior citizen clubs these days. (Representational)Written by FATIMA ALAMIt is 6.45 am. Gathered in a close circle on the Girgaum Chowpatty are over a dozen senior citizens. For the next two hours every morning, they do what the texting generation has limited to three letters  LOL. They laugh out loud. Started in 2008, their informal laughter club has become a popular morning visual for locals, who pass by in the South Mumbai neighbourhood.My day doesnt go well unless I come here, smiles Shakun Gabadia Karai, aged 68, who began yoga and laughter therapy five years ago. Karai lost her husband when she was 38, and struggled with depression and diabetes. My sugar levels were restored to normalcy, depression got cured after I started laughter yoga, she claims. The Sion resident works in a vegetable farm house in Panvel, where she handles the business. Former bank employee Kishore H Kuvavala, now chairman of Priyadarshini Laughter Club, explains, Laughter provides an alternative medicine to the mind, body and soul, in an age where stress is the root of 95 per cent of all diseases that have plagued the world. He conducts laughter therapy sessions free of cost for anyone who joins the group on Chowpatty beach every morning.Starting with the basic breathing exercises, the real laughter begins only after 7.30 am, when all the members are, as they like to call it, charged up and open. The first laughing exercise, called the mirror laughter, requires the members to hold a mirror in front of them to which they laugh and chant positive affirmations to themselves. In the second exercise, the bird laughter, they all enact a bird, by trailing both hands in mid-air like flapping of wings, or acting like a bird would feed.In another exercise, they distribute chocolates and feed each other to encourage interpersonal love and harmony among the community members.I work on the computer for eight hours a day. The shoulder exercises help in relieving stress in my joints. I remain cheerful the entire day after laughter yoga, said Sheetal Mehra, a Grant Road resident, who has been attending the club for three years. With the yoga routine consisting of multiple breathing and stretching exercises that focus on the acupressure points and relieving any joint pain, the members in the club claim their personal lives have improved.Manjula Ben Madhwani, 78, is one of the oldest members of the group. She joined the club on her doctors recommendation, following a bypass surgery. After my angiography, water intake had to be reduced. My health became challenging, she said. Seven years ago she started laughter yoga, and has continued ever since. Varsha Chopra, 64, has been doing laughter yoga for 10 years. She claims that the exercises incorporated in the laughter club are similar to the ones she was made to do in the hospital after a knee replacement surgery.Another 70-year-old member, Jayanthibai Harsova, came across the laughter yoga club while walking to Godrej Garden. I was impressed by the concept, she says. Harsova suffered from shoulder pain and claims laughter yoga and exercising eased her shoulder stiffness.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

A note presenting all the proposals will soon be prepared to present to the Cabinet, said the statement.The proposal is to reduce the GST from 18% to 5%, Mr. Paswan told The Hindu , adding that the GoM would hold another meeting to finalise the details of the proposals. He said the government was looking for ways to incentivise value-added products, including molasses and ethanol, which could utilise the surplus harvest of sugarcane, and which would reduce the burden on the mills.The GoM is headed by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, and includes Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, as well as Mr. Paswan.Last month, the Food Ministry told Parliament that sugar mills had pending dues worth Rs. 13, 899 crore as on March 21. Industry lobbyist Indian Sugar Mills Association estimates that figure has now crossed Rs. 20,000 crore.Record highSugar production has hit record highs this year, crossing domestic consumption estimates and resulting in a crash in prices. According to ISMA data, sugar production up to April 15 stood at 299.8 lakh tonnes. Thats already 50 lakh tonnes more than the governments estimated sugar consumption for the whole season, and 227 mills are still crushing cane.

(File Photo) The present production figure of 106.08 lakh tonnes has surpassed the previous record production in 2014-15, when the state had produced 105.14 lt of sugar. (File Photo)Maharashtra recorded the highest ever production of sugar at 106.08 lakh tonnes (lt) in the state this season. The record production this season, till April 22, however, has failed to cheer the industry, which is reeling under the curse of very low realisation. With sugar commissioner stepping up action against millers that have failed to pay farmers, distress sale by mills is likely to further reduce the prices.Of the 187 mills that had taken season this year, 169 have ended their operations as of April 22. The state has recorded 945.48 lt crushing of cane and the sugar production stands at 106.08 lt, as per the government figure. The present production figure has surpassed the previous record production in 2014-15, when the state had produced 105.14 lt of sugar. By the end of this season, which will be towards the end of May, the production figure in the state is likely to touch 107 lt.The record production has failed to lift the mood of the industry, which is facing the brunt of low prices of sugar. To add to their worries, the sugar commissioner, Sambhaji Kadu Patil, has started taking action, which includes issuance of orders under the Revenue Recovery Code to confiscate sugar stock of mills that have failed to clear their payment to farmers. Till Monday, seven such orders have been issued against mills that have failed to pay the farmers. Sources in the commissionerate say more such orders are in the pipeline. Cane dues in the state as of April 15 stood at Rs 2,277.35 crore with millers paying only Rs 18,120.88 crore as against the total due of Rs 20,088.29 crore.Meanwhile, mills in the state have started distress sale of their stock, which has added to the slide in the prices. Mukesh Kuvadia, general secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants said at present the ex-mill price of sugar in the state is around Rs 25.50-26 per kg. It might be recollected that the season had started with sugar prices ranging at Rs 38 per kg. The bumper production has slowed down purchase by commercial buyers. Even as summer kicks in, we are yet to see any significant increase in demand, he said. The trend of distress sales has picked up after the sugar commissioner strarted taking action, which has further subdued the prices. Many of the mills are short of space to stock sugar and so they are selling it at much lower prices, he said.Things are unlikely to get better next season as the state is expecting a bumper production of 115 lt.With just five-six months left before the next season, to start logistics is yet another reason for millers to press the panic button. Kuvadia said the 20-lt export quota issued by the central government seems unattainable. Even with subsidy the maximum export could be around 8-10 lt while without subsidy, its not at all feasible for millers to export sugar, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Of 43 mills in the state, seven did not crush any cane during the current season due to low cane availability or financial difficulties. Others have either completed crushing or are about to complete it.""I havent seen anything like this in my living memory,"" said Palani G Periyasamy, chairman of Dharani Sugars and South India Sugar Mills Association (SISMA). Mills operated for 300 days in a year a few decades ago. ""This year we will be lucky if we operate for 60 days,"" said a senior SISMA official.The impact has had a spiraling effect on sugarcane farmers, many of whom havent got their cane arrears from some mills. With an estimated cane availability of just 75 lakh tonnes, sugar mills are operating at just 20% to 25% of their rated capacity.The industry is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to factors like failure of monsoon, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills.The impact of the downturn faced by sugar mills is so severe that the state which consumes nearly 15 lakh tonnes of sugar a year will have to import 9 lakh tonnes this year. ""Sadly, for markets like Sankaran Koil (in southern TN), we are getting sugar from Maharashtra,"" the SISMA official said. As if adding insult to injury, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are projected to have a bumper crop which makes it viable to move sugar from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu The sugar season starts in October and ends in the following September. ""This year while some mills have finished their cane crushing in February some have done it in March,"" industry officials said.From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in 2011-2012, crushing fell to 119.04 lakh tonnes during sugar season 2016-2017. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes.Adding to the woes of the already stressed mill owners, sugar prices have crashed  prices hover around Rs32,000 per tonnes now.The TN sugar industry is burdened with massive debts which it finds difficult to service and repay. Some loans categorised as SEFASU 2014 and Soft Loan 2015 have been taken for payment of FRP (fair and remunerative price) during those seasons since sugar prices witnessed a massive fall and not for creating any asset, officials said.With piling cane dues, the Rs290 crore sugar industry in the state is hopeful that the budget announcements of an incentive package for the industry will help it tide over the crisis.The government has announced a revenue sharing formula for sugarcane growers in its budget. It will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present state administered price (SAP) of Rs2,750 per tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers, said finance minister O Panneerselvam while presenting the budget.A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the cost of sugar for the mill is Rs4,000 per tonne, (at 25% capacity utilisation) while the selling price is Rs3,200.Introduction of Revenue Sharing Formula for sugarcane pricing, assures fair and remunerative price for the farmers and also enables farmers to get additional revenue over and above FRP, when the realisations from sugar and by-products move up. ""It is a boon for the sugarcane farmers as they are guaranteed of a minimum price and would get their due share out of higher sugar price in market and there would be certainty of payment. This also brings stability to the sugar industry since cane prices will get linked to realisation from sugar and its byproducts,"" said Periyasami."

While Hebbalkar is accused of presenting her voters with cookers, stoves and other household articles, Jolle allegedly waived two loan instalments availed by self-help groups from her Beereshwara Cooperative Credit Society. Anjali Nimbalkar has been helping the poor get educational and health facilities.Hailing from a prominent political family in Maharashtra, Dr Anjali is trying her luck for the second time in Khanapur, dominated by Marathi-speaking people. She had secured 17,000 votes in 2013 as an independent. Now with the Congress giving her a ticket and also making her an AICC member, Anjali is high on confidence. I will create history by winning this time, says Anjali. Doing her bit to reach out to people through her Dr Anjalitai Foundation, she chose Khanapur as her workplace when her husband was SP of Belagavi for four years.However, people say she has an uphill task against sitting MES MLA Aravind Patil. JD(S) candidate Nasir Bagwan, who built two bridges for villagers, is also a strong contender, says a local political observer.Shashikala Jolle, BJP MLA from Nippani, is seeking a second term from Nippani, bordering Maharashtra. She is pitted against former MLA Kakasaheb Patil this time too.Jolle, a first-generation politician, her husband and other family members own Beereshwara Cooperative Society, which has a Rs 1,000-crore annual turnover and runs 151 branches and a chain of educational institutions, supermarkets and skill development training centres.The societys activities gave her a much-needed connect with voters and thats why she won the last election. This time too she stands a fair chance, says Parashuram, a government employee from Nippani and a resident of Bengaluru.Her husband Nanasaheb Jolle is BJP nominee from neighbouring Chikkodi-Sadalaga constituency.From being a nobody in the Congress to becoming KPCC womens wing president, Lakshmi Hebbalkar has come a long way in politics. Having tasted defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2013 assembly polls, Hebbalkar is leaving no stone unturned to win Belagavi Rural this time.She is facing twotime MLA Sanjay Patil, Manohar Kinekar of MES and Shivanagouda Patil of the JD(S).Active in the constituency for the past 3-4 years, she has managed to get some work done using her links in the government. Like her male counterparts in the district, Hebbalkar too started a sugar mill to build a network of supporters. She claims credit for helping the Congress wrest Belagavi taluk panchayat from the MES after a long time.But Congress insiders say Hebbalkars own party leaders pose a threat to her as they fear she will only grow if elected MLA, given her connections in AICC."

It started out donating grains and groceries to about 20 to 25 organisations catering to orphans, widows, the homeless and the poor.But over the years, this number of partner organisations grew. Today, we cater to around 170 social organisations across Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune district and Pune city. Since our start in 2000, we have been able to donate 5,00,000 kg of foodgrains including rice, wheat, jowar, bajra etc.,  Vijay Kumar Marlecha, the head of food banks city unit, said.The initiative was started by Marlecha along with a few likeminded individuals, who were inspired by the Ek Mutthi Anaaj Yojana popularised by social activist and educator Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Bhaurao used to visit homes in Satara with a bowl asking residents to donate a fistful of foodgrain. That inspired us to start the food bank, said Marlecha. Today, the organisation too visits homes with a container, requesting residents to donate grain.Mahavir Food Bank, which has its office in Bibvewadi, used to receive grains and groceries from 200 people on a regular basis. But storing such huge quantities of grains was a problem. Also, some of them used to be pilfered. So we started doorto-door collection, he said.On Mahavir Jayanti every year, those associated with the food bank organise a rally to collect donations in cash, food grains and other grocery items. With the money collected, we purchase grains and grocery items and distribute them. We also visit orphanages and destitute homes, which rely entirely on government funds  he said.This year, th tion collected lakh and 1,000 groceries on havir Jayant which was cele brated on March 24.We dont collect vegeta bles since the are perishable Rice, dal, jow wheat, bajra grocery items tea, sugar and are also collected. Once we have a sizeable quantity, we distribute them to NGOs and ashramshalas, Marlecha said.The food bank has also teamed with The Robin Hood Army and the city-based Jai Anand Group, which helps farmers sell their produce.This month, we are planning to a donate a relief kit comprising 5kg wheat, 5kg bajra, 5kg rice and tea powder to 100 Dalit families in the Kasurdi village near Bhor. Both the organisations will be a part of this initiative, he said.Two years ago, during the drought in Maharashtra, the organisation donated groceries to Naam Foundation , an NGO, which works to provide relief to farmers in the barren, droughtprone areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha.The foundation ran an anna chatra (a community kitchen) in Pimpri with the foodgrain.

We carried packets of chocolates and biscuits with us. The sense of joy among the students was unbelievable. If only all of us could come forward to help, Marlecha said.The food bank now wants to set up a medicine bank, using donations.We plan to collect unused medicines and donate them to the poor, he said."

In 2017-18 the figure plummeted to 47% of the Rs 54,221 crore target for that yeara drop of 35 percentage points shows data from the State Level Bankers Committee, a forum of banking institutions to coordinate on development programmes.It is true that a large number of farmers have not repaid their pending loans. Its because they are waiting to hear whether they have been declared eligible. In some cases, they are waiting to see if there is a relaxation in the cut-off date or eligibility norms, said farmer leader Ajit Nawale from the Kisan Sabha , among the groups that had agitated for the waiver.Farmer groups say the squeeze in fresh institutional credit has pushed more farmers towards money-lenders and dealers which is contrary to the intention of the waiver. The drop in fresh crops loans means farmers will have no choice but to turn to money-lenders and seeds and pesticide dealers who also extend credit in villages, said Nawale.However, some bankers argue that since farmers have not repaid the previous loan, they still have access to that money. The farmer can use the money that he would have used to repay the loan towards preparing for the kharif season, argued a senior banking official. However, the reason farmer groups were pushing for the waiver was that this sector was facing heavy losses and many did not make enough money to repay pending loans.Economist Madhura Swaminathan says even if the waiver was implemented fully, farm credit would still fall short. The availability of farm credit from the formal sector is woefully short of requirements. Even if the waiver was implemented fully, it does not address the problem of continued need of working capital for agriculture, said Swaminathan. She also pointed out that demonetisation has made things worse and is a major blow to liquidity among small farmers.The sugar belt of western Maharashtra was the biggest beneficiary of crop loans, accounting for Rs 15,773 crore or 62% of the loans extended in 2017-18.The data also showed that cooperative banks and private sector banks met the highest share of their targets by extending over 60% of their crop loan target. However, regional rural banks had extended only 24% of the target and public sector banks had released 38%."

With 130 sugar mills still operating, majorly in Uttar Pradesh, it is expected that sugar production during the current season might end up between 31.5-32 MT,"" Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said in a statement.Maharashtra mills have produced 10.65 MT sugar during October-April of 2017-18 marketing year. Out of 187 sugar mills in the state, only 15 are operating.In UP, sugar production has touched 11.2 MT till April and 80 out of 119 sugar mills are continuing their crushing. Some of these mills are closing fast, whereas few are expected to continue crushing till second week of May 2018.In Karnataka, all the sugar mills have stopped operations and have produced 3.63 MT sugar during the current season.Sugar production in Bihar, Punjab and Haryana has reached record levels at 0.71 MT, 0.8 MT and 0.72 MT, respectively. While all mills in Bihar have stopped crushing, few mills in Punjab and Haryana are still operating.The record production of sugar has resulted in sharp fall in prices of sweetener and huge losses to mills. Industry is currently at a loss of Rs 8-9 per kg as mills' average production cost is about Rs 35 per kg while ex-mill selling rate is Rs 26-27 per kg.To bail out the sugar industry, the government yesterday announced that it would pay Rs 1,540 crore to cane farmers directly on behalf of sugar mills. The total cane dues to farmers is about Rs 20,000 crore.Earlier, the Centre had doubled import duty to 100 per cent and scrapped export duty on sugar. It has also asked millers to compulsorily export 2 MT sugar. MJHMJH ANU ANU"

The NCP president and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Friday convened a meeting of sugar producers in Mumbai.A decision to constitute a committee of sugar experts to evolve a proposal seeking centres intervention along with workable measures to help both cane growing farmers, sugar mills and also protect the consumers interest were discussed at length.Amongst the three major recommendations made by Pawar were sugar export, use in ethanol and cogeneration. The surplus sugar production necessites exploring the market internationally. Giving a practical solution to the problem, Pawar said,  The government of India should initiate measures to facilitate export of sugar. The price difference between domestic market in India and International market which works to Rs 8 should be subsidies to the sugar producers. He advocated 30 -35 lakh tonne export of sugar to bring stability in the sugar prices and avoid its crashing down.The sugar production would be 308 lakh tonne. The sugar carried forward from previous year is 42 lakh tonne. The domestic sale would be 250 lakh tonne. The additional sugar would be 100 lakh tonne.The real concern is to find a solution to 100 lakh tonne. The NCP leader said the buffer stock of sugar was not the solution. As price mechanism works on the laws of demand and supply. When there is buffer stock, sugar cannot fetch good price as buyers psychology is not to shell higher rates.While sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 109, Maharashtra is 106.77 lakh tonne. This compared to previous year 40 lakh tonne is almost 2.54 times more. The requirement in state is 24 lakh tonne. As a result 94.77 lakh tonne sugar will have to be exported or routed for industrial use.Urging the sugar mills to equip themselves with cogeneration plant and ethanol plant to optimise the use of surplus sugar cane, Pawar said,  The farmers are going to cultivate sugar cane when ever there is good water. As sugar cane is the only cash crop which provides assured minimu support price unlike any other crops.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In March, HDFC MF had filed with Sebi for an IPO  which is estimated to raise about Rs 3,500 crore. With an average assets under management of about Rs 3 lakh crore as of March 31, HDFC MF is the second-largest fund house in India, behind ICICI Prudential MF.In its weekly disclosure on processing status of public offers as of April 27, Sebi said that HDFC MFs IPO has been kept on hold for examination of past violations. It, however, did not elaborate on the reasons. Offers by Srei Equipment Finance and Vishwaraj Sugar Industries have also been kept on hold due for similar reasons.In 2007, a Sebi inverstigation had found one of the HDFC MFs dealers front-running to make illegal profits. He, along with three of his accomplices, was barred from the market in 2014. They were also asked to return Rs 3.4 crore earned thorugh fraudulant means.Subsequently, HDFC MF, as advised by Sebi, had also compensated its investors for the loss they incurred because of the front-running by paying about Rs 7 crore. Through a consent order in 2011 and 2012, some of HDFC MFs employees and trustees  including its MD Milind Barve  had settled Sebis charges for Rs 55 lakh.HDFC MF is a joint venture between mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation and Standard Life Investments. According to its draft prospectus, about 2.54 crore equity shares will be sold, of which 86 lakh shares will be sold by HDFC, while Standard Life Investments will sell up to 1.68 crore shares through the proposed IPO."

(Express Photo Santosh Parab) NCP president Sharad Pawar at the meeting in Mumbai. (Express Photo Santosh Parab)Over 60 per cent of sugar mills in the state will find it difficult to raise working capital to commence operations in the next season. In a special meeting on the crisis, held in Mumbai on Friday and presided over by NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, millers from across the country spoke about the problems facing the industry. Mills have failed to pay the growers due to low prices of sugar, and the cane arrears in the country stand at Rs 19,000 crore. Mills in Maharashtra are facing arrears worth Rs 2,277 crore, with sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil issuing orders of confiscation of sugar against 10 mills.Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), said millers in Maharashtra are facing an unprecedented crisis over short margin  the difference between the advance released by the banks to the mills and the realisation of the latter. According to analysts, falling sugar prices and reduction in the valuation of sugar by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC) Bank has led to the financial crisis. The MSC Bank provides working capital to 40 sugar mills in the state and currently, almost all of them have gone into short margin. Mills are given a stipulated time period to clear the amount, failing which their accounts are declared as Non Performing Assets. Sugar production in the country has already crossed 300 lakh tonnes (lt) and estimates have put the production figures at 340 lt next year.During the course of the meeting, Pawar stressed on the need to export sugar to fulfil the 20 lt quota declared by the central government earlier. But exports at the current international prices of Rs 19-20 per kg would entail a loss of around Rs 8-10 per kg, as the cost of production is estimated to be Rs 30 per kg, said industry insiders.Another problem with exports is the shortage of international markets, with many traditional destinations such as the Philippines putting import restrictions in place. Meanwhile, a special study group has been formed to study the problems facing the industry. The group, which will have high-ranking officials from ISMA and the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories, will come up with a policy paper. Once we have finalised the document, Pawar saheb will be leading the delegation to meet the Prime Minister to apprise him about the situation, said Rohit Pawar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b1b44f79855b76d57038c5e,GST Council puts up sugar cess for review,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sugar-cess-put-up-for-review/articleshow/64036460.cms,2018-05-05,"NEW DELHI: Protest by some states, including Kerala, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh , prompted the GST Council to order a review of the plan to levy a cess on sugar to help sugarcane growers as they complained that the move would only benefit Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and poll-bound Karnataka, while discarding the basic principle of the new regime that focused on removing all additional levies. The cess would have helped government raise Rs 6,700 crore.During discussions on the cess, which stretched for over two hours, these states, with support from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Pondicherry, argued that imposition of a cess on sugar will also make other states such as Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab demand a similar benefit for rubber, jute and foodgrains. There will be no end and will defeat the very purpose of GST, said a source, adding that some of the finance ministry officials were also sympathetic to this argument. While introducing GST, the Centre and the states decided to abolish all cesses and surcharges other than compensation cess (covering luxury and sin goods) for a period of five years.FM Arun Jaitley said after the meeting that cane growers were in deep distress as the cost of sugar production is over Rs 35 per kg, while the market price of sugar is around Rs 26-28 a kg. The cess on sugar was proposed to raise money to compensate farmers for a loss due to surplus production.The states opposing the cess suggested that UP and Maharashtra, which are grappling with the problem, should provide budgetary support as the move is only going to benefit sugar mills in their jurisdictions, although the cess will be paid by consumers across the country to help farmers.A panel under Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma , along with ministers from UP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, will deal with issue of levy of cess on sugar and reduction of GST on ethanol and is expected to submit its report in a fortnight.Jaitley said that the discussions have thrown up several new aspects. How are such contingencies to be addressed in the GST regime, are they to be addressed by imposition of cess or are they to be addressed by temporarily increasing the tax or by some alternative method of revenue raising?The ministerial panel would make a recommendation to the council on the avenues to raise revenue to meet contingencies of this kind where the cost of commodity is much higher than its selling price."
5b17fbbd9855b75db2e7c1ff,GST’s complicated,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/gsts-complicated/article23797217.ece,2018-05-07,"With collections from the goods and services tax peaking at over Rs. 1 lakh crore in April, industry hoped the GST Council would make life simpler for an increasingly compliant tax-payer base. Indeed, at its meeting last week the Council decided to introduce a new compliance system under which a single monthly GST return will have to be submitted by firms, barring a few exceptions. However, this will only be done in a phased manner  with the first of three transition stages to begin six months from now. Discussions over simplifying GST returns have been under way for months and considered by the Council, a committee of officers and a Group of Ministers. Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Technologies, the firm in charge of the GST Networks IT system, has been consulted. Yet, the solution offered has gaps. For instance, in the second stage of the transition to simpler returns, buyers will get provisional input credit even if the seller doesnt upload the invoices. While this could lead to disputes, in the third stage input credits will only be granted after sellers upload invoices. If a seller defaults on depositing GST dues collected from a buyer and remains evasive, the authorities can reverse the credit availed by the buyer for such outstanding taxes.In any case, the timelines for the transition are long and bring fresh uncertainty for businesses still recovering from the initial jitters and confusion around the tax regime. Firms will again have to cope with significant changes in accounting software in the middle of the financial year. The Council, credited with swift and significant course correction in GST processes in its initial months, could have done more. The most troubling is the Centres push for the imposition of a cess on sugar over and above the 5% GST levied on it. A cess at the rate of Rs. 3 a kg is proposed to alleviate deep distress among sugarcane farmers. Not surprisingly, this faces opposition from several States. It has been rightly argued that this will burden consumers while favouring larger sugarcane-growing States like U.P. and Maharashtra. In addition, a special sugar cess will signal a looming breakdown of the basic tenet of GST: the abolition of such cesses and surcharges, barring the compensation cess for funding States revenue losses for five years. Along with a proposal to reward digital GST payments, this has been referred to new ministerial groups, which are to revert in a fortnight. Lastly, the decision to make the GSTN a 100% government-owned firm, instead of the present structure with 51% private ownership, explains neither how this will address data security concerns nor the impact on the Networks functional efficiency, which was the original stated intent for giving private players an upper hand in operations."

However, despite the dip in the wholesale prices, the retail prices of these commodities are still high. Taking cognisance of this, consumer activists demanded that the retail prices of milk and sugarcane also be slashed.We are closely watching the situation and are conducting a comparative study of the previous years market prices of milk and sugar. We will ask the government to intervene in bringing down the prices on the basis of the production cost, said Shirish Deshpande of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat.Milk producing farmers have been on a strike demanding that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government last year be implemented. Similarly, the per quintal ex-factory price of sugar dropped to 2,800 from 3,600, owing to unprecedented production of sugar in the state last season.This year, milk production has gone up to 132 lakh litre a day from 115 lakh litre a day last year. Sugar production in the state is expected to be 107 lakh tonnes as against 42.38 lakh tonnes in 2016-17, according to industry figures.Of 132 lakh litres, 94 lakh litres are sold in pouches by various brands. If the pouches are sold at the same MRP to the customers, why are farmers not getting the same procurement price as last year? This is exploitation of farmers and consumers, said Ajit Nawale, general secretary, Maharashtra State Kisan Sabha, who is leading the farmers strike. Milk cooperatives are sustaining huge losses owing to excessive production and rise in overhead expenses. Its not possible to reduce selling price, said Arun Narke, former president of Indian Dairy Association and director of the cooperative that sells milk with the brand Gokul."

The order to inquire into the irregularities, fix Chaudharys liability and recover the sum from him was issued in last January, under section 93 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961. In June 2016, the cooperative registrar had issued a show-cause notice to him in this regard.Chaudhary moved the high court, but a single-judge bench turned down his petition. He filed an appeal before a division bench, which has also refused him relief. The bench, however, stayed its order for a month so Chaudhary can move the Supreme Court.According to the registrar, a loss of Rs 41.83 crore was caused by three irregularities or misdeeds by Chaudhary as the chairman of Dudhsagar Dairy.A loss of Rs 22.50 crore was caused by providing 13,731 metric tonnes of cattle feed to the state of Maharashtra during a drought.Some 21.57 lakh kg of cattle feed was found to be missing on September 15, 2015. This was either not bought at all  its price being Rs 2.06 crore  or was siphoned off.The dairy bought sugar between April 2012 and January 2014 without following proper approval at higher-than-market rates, causing a loss of Rs 17.26 crore.The inquiry into the sending of cattle feed to Maharashtra revealed that Chaudhary was liable for the decision. Inquiries into the two other decisions will begin as the HC had earlier stayed them. Chaudhary was removed from the post of chairman by a court order. He was also barred from contesting elections for six years by the registrar, but the SC struck down that order."

In 2018-19, the state plans to optimise water efficiency by 20 per cent. The National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), in its annual report 2018-19, states, Currently, gross area under mirco-irrigation is around one million hectares with average area expansed by about 100,000 hectares in five years.While conceding the challenges ahead, the report adds, Considering that Maharashtras total area under agriculture is more than 20 million hectares and only 20 per cent of it is covered under the formal irrigation system, at present rate it would take decades before micro-irrigation systems can be installed in every farmers field.The government needs to ramp up coverage of the micro-irrigation systems by channelising more investments to bridge the gap.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed the Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Finance to revise the schemes to give more priority to micro-irrigation projects to achieve More Crop Per Drop. The states budget for irrigation projects and water conservation schemes is Rs 12,000 crore. According to estimates, the states overall expenditure after accounting for micro-irrigation will be Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore.In the last three-and-a-half years, the states priority was to make 25,000 villages drought-free. The state has made 11,247 villages drought-free (water neutral) and plans to make the rest drought-free by 2019 through jalyukt shivar projects. Micro-irrigation is a step initiated to bridge the gap between irrigation potential created and utilised.According to the Ministry of Water Resources, The irrigation potential in Maharashtra is 49.4 lakh hectares, whereas irrigated area was 24.47 lakh hectares. The irrigation potential created by local sectors (minor projects) is 17.32 lakh hectares and utilisation was only 2.07 lakh hectares.Among the two critical measures being undertaken to realise higher agriculture growth and income are increase in cropping intensity and diversification to higher value crops. A senior secretary in the water resources ministry said, Micro-irrigation is our priority. But we have to gradually make inroads and provide greater incentives to farmers to adopt changes. Among the incentives is urging financial institutions to provide agriculture loan to eligible farmers for micro-irrigation projects. Public-private partnership in the agriculture sector and contract farming are also high on the governments agenda.The state has also decided to bring all the land under sugar cultivation under drip irrigation. The kharif production for 2017 showed an increase in sugarcane crop from 6.33 lakh hectares in 2016 to 9.43 lakh hectares.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Why is this being done at the cost of our farmers?Patil claimed that the import policy of the Centre would affect domestic sugarcane producers to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. The losses for sugarcane cultivators in Maharashtra itself would be around Rs 3,000 crore. With low prices domestically, how will sugar mills pay farmers from whom they have procured sugarcane, Patil asked.State Congress chief Ashok Chavan asked the Union government for an explanation and alleged that these imports had resulted in sugar prices per tonne falling from Rs 36,000 to Rs 24,000.He ridiculed Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that while the latter claimed that he would get fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim from Pakistan, all his government was managing to do was bring in sugar from the neighbouring country.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

At the same time, the Shiv Sena, an ally of Mr. Modi, did not oppose the import policy when they oppose everything else the government does, the senior Congress leader said.The central government had recently reiterated its commitment to supporting a struggling sugar industry, which is faced with depressed market sentiments and a crash in prices.Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan had in Mumbai on May 5 reiterated his governments commitment to ensuring liquidity, financial assistance and support to sugar mills to offset the crunch resulting from the falling cost of cane. , the government needed to do more on the ground and walk the talk before it could win their trust."

The state government has ordered mills to continue taking sugarcane from farmers till the crop lasts. The sugar production this year is estimated to cross 120 lakh tonnes, highest ever in the state and in the country as well.With mills having to pay Rs 337 per quintal, highest price for cane in the country, to the farmers, the have risen to a high of over Rs 11,000 crore.We have been running from pillar to post to get some help and respite from this enveloping crisis.

It requires immediate government intervention to resolve the crisis, failing which the sugar industry might collapse, said a special secretary-rank officer in sugar department.The sugar mills, under the banner of UPSMA, are planning to submit a written memorandum to the government stating that they would have to shut down their units if the situation continues.Farmers in west UP have started protesting over delay in cane payments.All efforts to contact sugar minister Suresh Rana proved fruitless as he was in Kairana for the bypoll campaigning.Principal secretary, sugar, Sanjay Bhoosreddy , however, played down the claims of sugar millers and said that they were just trying to mount pressure on the government so that they could delaying payment to cane farmers which the government would not let happen.Bhoosreddy said that everyone knows that cane and sugar production has been high this year and that sugar prices would rise once the crushing season gets over."

""The entire sugar industry will collapse owing to import of sugar from Pakistan, in that event Modi will have to take the responsibility,'' he said.The Congress leader said it was expected that sugar production would touch the 250 metric tonne mark, but it crossed 320 metric tonnes. ""In the last year's season, a huge stock of sugar is lying in godowns, against the rate of 40 to 42 per kg, now the rates have fallen to 25 per kg.

Express Photo By Pavan Khengre,11.12.17,Pune.The sugar industry has come out strongly in favour of a release mechanism to stop the freefall in sugar prices. Under a release mechanism, the central government imposes a certain quota on the amount of a commodity that can be sold in the open market, in an effort to keep a balance between its supply and demand. Low prices have affected the economics of the sector, with sugar mills unable to pay farmers and running into cane arrears of over Rs 20,000 crore.The demand for a release mechanism was among those put forward by a delegation of the industry that met Prime Minister Narendra Modis principal secretary Nripendra Misra in Delhi on Tuesday.Recently, representatives of mills across the country had met under the leadership of former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to find a way out of the crisis. It was decided that Pawar would lead a delegation of millers to meet the Prime Minister and seek government intervention.During the meeting on Tuesday, millers discussed various issues pertaining to the sector and put forward some other demands that included deferment of loan installments and compulsory formation of a buffer stock. Meanwhile, as rumours circulated about the arrival of sugar from Pakistan at the Mumbai port, state Minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh ordered a thorough investigation into the issue. Reports about stacks of sugar from Pakistan landing in Mumbai godowns had spread panic among the sector, which is already struggling with the onslaught of low prices.Speaking to The Indian Express, Deshmukh said the 100 per cent import duty on sugar had made any import non-feasible since the last few months. Back in February, the central government had hiked the import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, in a bid to stop the entry of imported sugar, as India had seen a bumper production. The final sugar production is estimated to be more than 300 lakh tonnes, while Maharashtra will end up producing 107 lakh tonnes of sugar.Meanwhile, sources said the sugar in question was imported long before the import duty was hiked to 100 per cent. The quantity of the sugar is not much, said a senior miller on the condition of anonymity.For all the latest Thiruvananthapuram News, download Indian Express App"

The State government will initiate a crack down against traders indulging in malpractice by importing the commodity at cheaper rates, Mr. Deshmukh said.Earlier this week, opposition parties including the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), the Congress and Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) attacked the government over the issue.Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan hit out at the Central and State governments for importing sugar from Pakistan at a time when production in the State was at a record high, with stocks lying unsold and farmers having a tough time to sell their produce in the market.Acknowledging that a bumper harvest had brought about a host of problems brought on sugarcane farmers and other workers in the sugar sector, Mr. Deshmukh observed the inability of sugar mills to pay a decent FRP to farmers was due to the steep devaluation in sugar prices.This year, owing to record production and consequent supply glut, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) is going at barely Rs. 2,500 per tonne against a demand Rs. 3,500 per tonne, he said.He further stated that the Cabinets approval for a subsidy of Rs. 55 on every tonne of sugarcane sold to the mills was not enough for farmers."

(Express Photo By Pavan Khengre)Maharashtras sugar season is nearing its end and only four sugar mills are continuing their crushing operations. With production crossing 107 lakh tonnes, the 2017-18 season has seen the highest production of sugar in the state. Of the 187 mills functional this season, 183 have ceased crushing operations. Two mills in Ahmednagar and one each in Pune and Satara districts are continuing operations. They are expected to close by the end of this month. Till Tuesday, the state has seen crushing of 951.95 lt of cane. This years sugar production has crossed the earlier record, made in the 2014-15 season, when the state had seen production of 105.14 lt of sugar.But the record production has failed to cheer the sugar sector, which is reeling under severe financial crisis. The fall in sugar prices has affected the millers, who have failed to pay the minimal fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers. Till April 30, millers in Maharashtra were facing cane arrears worth a whopping Rs 2210.63 crore. While 57 mills have paid 100 per cent of their dues, the rest have only been able to pay parts of it.Sambhaji Kadu Patil, the state sugar commissioner, had even issued notices against 10 mills, under the Revenue Recovery Code, to confiscate their sugar stock. The international prices of sugar are also not conducive for exports, say millers. Millers are also waiting for the Rs 5.5 per quintal subsidy, announced by the central government to clear cane arrears.Meanwhile, mills are considering whether to start the next season in October, as the state is likely to see a bumper cane crop over 10.7 lakh hectares of land. For a few months, mills are planning to produce only raw sugar, which has better export potential than refined white sugar. Unless we are able to reduce production, the price of white sugar will not go up and the vicious cycle of cane arrears will start again, said a miller from Ahmednagar.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Cotton production fell by a steep 39% mainly due to pest attack by the pink bollworm, which devastated the crop across regions.One crop to thrive was the water-guzzling sugarcane, which saw a rise of 34% over the previous year and has contributed to a bumper nationwide production. Kharif is the main agricultural season in Maharashtra , in which three-quarters of farming is done. The states monsoon was 84% of normal last year, but in July 2017 dipped to 72% and in August to 77% of normal. But compared to five-year averages, production of kharif food grains and pulses saw a slight increase of 9% in 2017-18.Crop credit dips 40%, pushing farmers towards loan sharksThe decline in the production of food grains compared to 2016-17 was mainly because of a dry spell and uneven rainfall, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Bijay Kumar has said.In addition, the output of rice was affected by an attack of sucking pests and cotton was impacted by the pink bollworm pest, he said. Farm activists point out that its not just crop production which has declined, but also the prices of farm produce.Prices for most crops are lower than they were last year and farmers are facing larger debts. Crop loans from banks have declined by 40%, so, farmers have had no option but to turn to moneylenders, said activist Vijay Jawandhia . The production of kharif cereals declined by 4% compared to the previous year and oilseeds by 15%, estimates from the state agriculture department show.The production of rice declined by as much as 22% over the previous year.

Within kharif oilseeds, soya bean production dipped by 15% and groundnut by 11%. Sesamum (sesame is the best-known member of the genus) declined by 48%.In the rabi season (winter crop), cereal production saw a 30% decline in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, while the production of pulses dropped by 10%, estimates show. The state has seen a dramatic rise in sugarcane production, reaching a historic record of over 107 lakh tons.Nationally too, the country has seen a major rise in sugar production. But this has depressed prices and led to sugar mills not being able to clear farmers dues."

The 75-year-old had shaved half his head in protest and burned the money he failed to exchange. But, that was just one protest in a life filled with many such instances.Sanu Kummils documentary Oru Chaayakkadakkarante Mann ki Baat is a chronicle of that life, told engagingly, with caricatures of various moments from his life used to enliven the narration. The documentary begins from his early years of struggle in a family of 13 children. Not much thought was given to education, as each of them had to work to survive.Mookkupodi for guestsHis unconventional ways were evident in the earlier days too. When he got married to his neighbour Suhara, he offered just mookkupodi (snuff) to his guests, as the families did not have enough money for a feast. Soon, he went to Saudi Arabia. But what he had to go through there is reminiscent of Benyamins novel Aadujeevitham. For 18 years, he survived there in abject condition, looking after camels and goats. Using a forged passport, he landed in Mumbai, only to be caught and jailed.Buried savingsBack home, he opened an eatery in a push cart. Once he got slapped by a policeman, who thought Yahiya was disrespecting him by tying his lungi up. From that day, Yahiya has been wearing a maxi, to free himself from the expectation of tying it up in respect.He later set up a tea shop, which became popular for its local flavour and clean food. But ill luck followed him there too. Two men came for dinner late one night, beat him up and stole all his savings. Since then, he has been digging up the earth and storing his savings underground.The demonetisation in November 2016 came as a huge jolt for him. He queued up in front of the bank to exchange his savings, Rs. 23,000 in cash. On the second day, his sugar level dropped and he collapsed. After he was discharged from the hospital, he burned all the demonetised cash. The next trip was to the barber shop to shave half of his head.Yahiya lives according to his rules. He continues his protests even now, shaving half his moustache on the first anniversary of demonetisation. The documentary has got good response wherever it has been screened. Yahiya too liked it, says Sanu.Once he was slapped by a policeman who thought Yahiya was disrespecting him by tying his lungi up. From that day, Yahiya has been wearing a maxi."

Representatives from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra also participated in the day-long event held here on Tuesday.Regular interactionIn the document titled Hyderabad Declaration 2018, which was released at the end of the convention, it was decided to evolve river basin understanding individually and collectively, to repair and heal relationship of inter-dependence with the river and the river basin, to weave a comprehensive people-to-people basin-wide grassroots networking and to institutionalise regular interactions between civil society and governance institutions.Representatives of all the four basin States agreed to work against use of the river land for any purpose other than what the river needed, not to allow release of sewage into the course of the river and its tributaries, including streams supplementing them, and to ensure environmental flow in the basin. Waterman of India Rajender Singh suggested that the basin States form five groups each, with elected representatives, academia, civil society, diagnostic and treatment teams, to work for the rejuvenation of the river.Water-intensive cropsSeveral speakers from the basin States expressed concern over the way the river was facing the threat of death with indiscriminate use of water for water-intensive crops such as paddy and sugar cane, unabated sand mining, destroying the river ecology with release of domestic sewage and industrial pollutants. They suggested that rejuvenation of the river start from every stream in the basin with treatment of land and water.Earlier in the day, Minister for Irrigation T. Harish Rao explained how the Telangana government had taken up rejuvenation of the Godavari river with Kaleshwaram. He suggested that release of about 100 tmc ft water from the Koyna dam into the Arabian Sea every year after power generation be put to best use with its release into the Krishna river. It would increase the benefit five-fold with power generation and irrigation under Almatti, Narayanpur, Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar too.Chairman of the TWRDC V. Prakash Rao, Minister for Health C.

(Picture used for representational purpose) Sugar prices are hovering at Rs 25-26 per kg with mills running up to Rs 1,999 crore as arrears. (Picture used for representational purpose)Staring at a bumper crushing season next year, sugar mills plan to sign export contracts with neighbouring countries before the start of the next season. Mills are targeting 3-3.5 million tonnes (mt) exports of raw sugar to Bangladesh and China and another 2-2.5 mt of white sugar to Sri Lanka. Maharashtras current sugar season officially ended on Wednesday. The state has produced 10.7 mt of sugar, the highest in the last 10 years. Maharashtra produced just 4.2 mt of sugar last year and the more than doubling of sugar production has literally thrown the economics of the mills to the winds. Sugar prices are hovering at Rs 25-26 per kg with mills running up to Rs 1,999 crore as arrears. With a bumper crop expected next year, mills have expressed reservations about their ability to pay the growers as sugar prices remain subdued.In order to ensure economics of operations, mills have hinted at an early start to the crushing season. Instead of the customary post-Diwali start in November, mills are thinking of beginning crushing operations in October and producing just raw sugar for the first two months. Also, to avoid a glut in domestic markets, mills are in the process of signing contracts with Bangladesh and China for export of raw sugar and with Sri Lanka for export of white sugar.The total export of raw sugar is expected to be 5-6 mt, which mills hope will keep sugar prices under reasonable limits in the domestic market and enable them to pay growers. Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the apex body of private mills, said they have written to the government seeking help in terms of credit to enable exports.Earlier, the central government had fixed an export quota of 2 mt of sugar for each mill in the country. Mills meeting the quota would be eligible for a subsidy of Rs 55 per tonne of cane crushed. The scheme failed to enthuse millers, who had pointed to the low international prices of sugar prevailing then. However, with Brazils production figures being revised due to diversion of ethanol as well as the ongoing moisture stress, international prices of white sugar have firmed up to Rs 20-20.5 per kg, making exports viable if taken with the subsidy component.As mills get ready for exports, they are seeking a relaxation in one of the clauses they feel might hamper their move to claim subsidy. The clause mandates mills to have followed all necessary government orders for the 2017-18 season and many mills say they have not been able to follow the order for maintenance of minimum stock. Most mills had already sold their sugar to raise money for paying the fair and remunerative price to growers and have failed to maintain stock, said a miller from Pune. This clause should be reviewed, say most millers.Sugar analyst Vijay Autade said mills should proactively export sugar to reduce the glut in the domestic market. The quota was decided on the recommendations of the industry and mills should adhere to it, he saidFor all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The BJP fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana, while RLD nominated Tabassum Hasan, who was also supported by the BSP, SP and Congress.In Kairana, there are 12 candidates in the fray. The opposition was hoping that by consolidating the anti-BJP votes, they would be able to repeat the results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections, especially after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan pulled himself out of the bypoll fray and embraced the RLD (Rashtriya Lok Dal). The ruling BJP, on the other hand, would be making extra effort to retain both Kairana and Noorpur seats after todays polling.The major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers. The farmers in the constituency have been losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which include an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats.

(Source: ANI)The state election commission officer said in all the places where machine problems were reported, people were given more time to exercise their francise by extending the time beyond official 5 pm.The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena alleged that the breaking down of voting machines was a political ploy of the ruling BJP to swing the elections in their favour. They also raised questions as to why machines were procured from Gujarat.Senior NCP leader Praful Patel said, We have always warned EVM/VVPATs are being misused for the elections. If the EVMs/VVPAT are verified there should be no reason for its malfunctioning. He demanded provisions for alternative ballot papers along with EVMs/VVPATs.The NCP leader wondered why EVMs from Surat in Gujarat were used when machines were available in Maharashtra.The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Chavan expressed serious concerns over the developments in Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha by-polls.Almost 25 per cent EVM and VVPAT problems lead to hardships as voters had to stand in queue for long hours. We want repolling in all those places where machines broke down. Such instances make us suspect if ruling party was trying to manipulate the system. While dismissing the argument of the election commission about technical snag due to heat, Chavan said,  In the past elections have taken place during summer. Just a fortnight ago elections happended in Karnataka. In 2014, Lok Sabha polls were also held in peak of summer. If EVM cannot withstand summer heat, election commission should replace it with ballot paper.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said their fears of BJP using all means to win the elections have been proved correct.Meanwhile, the BJP questioned the Opposition over why similar allegations were not raised in Karnataka where Congress formed the government along with JD(S).BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, The opposition are raising questions on election commission which is an independent authority which is very unfortunate. They opposition should also explain if they have the same complains in Karnataka where they formed the government.The EVM/VVPAT failure is a pointer to ruling party trying to misuse the machinery to serve its own interest. The ruling party was going to polls keeping the remote and contril of EVMs/VVPAT in their hands, he observed. The Sena also demanded replacement of EVMs/VVPAT with ballot paper in elections.The bypoll in Palghar was necessitated following death of sitting BJP (MP) Chintaman Wanaga.

This would enable the Centre to act against sugar factories failing to meet their commitments, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday.Sources said Mr. Gadkari made it clear during a meeting in Mumbai with stakeholders and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis that though sugar prices have been falling and the industry is in crisis, millers cannot not make payments or part payments citing low sugar prices. Maharashtra has Rs. 2,228 crore pending as arrears in FRP payments.The State Sugar Commissioner has already served notices to 136 factories that failed to keep FRP commitments. Though the industry is in crisis and the government is committed to providing help, this cannot be an excuse to not make FRP payments.

Mr. Gandhi said, Political parties are under RTI as the law stands. Central Information Commission has given a clear decision which has not been challenged anywhere. Therefore the six political parties of this nation are flouting the law and defying the law.The remarks came after a member of the audience directed a question to former Maharashtra chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asking him when his party would get in line with the RTI. Mr. Chavan said, I think thats a very important question. It doesnt really pertain only to Congress, every political party should be brought into RTI. That will be one step to reduce corruption in the political process. There is a very strong case for bringing political parties under RTI.Mr. Chavan, who was part of a group of experts that formulated the first draft of the RTI, said the current government was trying to stifle RTI. Mr. Chavan said 32,000 appeals were pending, including questions on demonetisation, the Mumbai-Ahemdabad bullet train, and sugar imports. Whatever information I seek from the Centre or State government, nothing is being given out, he said.Information vs. privacyMadabhushi Acharyulu, the Central Information Commissioner, who launched his book RTI and misconduct of public servant: Is bribing a family affair? , criticised the Girish Deshpande case for being treated as a precedent.Mr. Acharyulu said, When you dismiss a special leave petition, you have rejected permission to take the issue in appeal. When it is not a full-fledged hearing and there is no judgement passed after it, then that order might bind those persons who are the parties to that litigation. But it can never operate as a binding precedent on the country.The Supreme Court had said that the copies of all memos, show-cause notices and orders of censure/punishment, assets, income tax returns, details of gifts received by a public servant are personal information, and hence exempted from the RTI. Mr. Acharyulu said, The information held by you is not your information, you have not generated it. It is in public domain and everybody should have access to it. Today the government questions citizens, against the CICs order, for having access to information.Advocate Jamshed Mistry, who delved on the dynamic nature of the law, said, There are Benches which pass contradictory orders every day. This is part of the system. All these issues are open to judicial review and the law is constantly changing. He said attempts were being made to ask the court to provide live broadcasts and legal transcripts of hearings.Anupam Saraph, activist and e-governance expert, said there is not much conflict between the need for privacy and information. He said, Any information with a public authority is for public consumption. We have created the public authority through a mechanism for our governance and therefore it is supposed to give us the information it has. So if it has any of our personal information which doesnt pertain to this governance, it should not be having it.Whatever info I seek from the Centre or State government, nothing is being given outPrithviraj ChavanCongress leader"

The quantum of the short margin problem is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore in the state.Sugar mills in Maharashtra are facing a financial crisis, which has stopped many of them from undertaking the necessary overhauling and maintenance work before the start of the next season. Almost all the mills have run into the problem of short margin, which has made them ineligible for preseasonal loan necessary for undertaking such work. This comes just months before the start of the next season, which has reported a bumper cane crop on an estimated over 11 lakh hectares.Short margin is a condition when sugar prices fail to cover the advances given to mills by banks. In such a scenario, mills are required to pay the shortfall to banks before sugar sale starts. Defaulting mills risk their accounts being termed NPA after 90 days following which they become ineligible for loans. At present, the quantum of the short margin problem is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore in the state.Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, vice-president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said mills had failed to pay labour contractors necessary to book labour for next year. Normally such contracts are finalised by the end of May but this year we have not been able to do so, he said. Similarly overhauling of the mills have stalled due to lack of capital. Many mills, Dandegaonkar added, had not paid their employees for several months. Mills in Maharashtra have run up cane dues over Rs 1,900 crore as of May 15.Last week, Union minister Nitin Gadkari, along with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Rural Development, Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde, met a delegation of mill owners. The millers urged the government to intervene to create a buffer stock of 50 lakh tonne, fix a minimum selling price for sugar, introduce a release mechanism for a year to regulate the sale of sugar and convert short margin into working capital loan. It has been done twice in the past and should be allowed again, he said.While mills have finalised export contracts, Dandegaonkar said because of the short margin problem they are not able to send out their shipments. Banks should be instructed to let the sugar for overseas markets leave without payment of margin money. Liquidity is a major problem for us now, he said. Over the past few days, sugar prices have seen a slight jump with ex-mill prices in Maharashtra being Rs 2,700 per tonne. Prices in UP are around Rs 3,000 per tonne.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

It was being seen as a battle between ganna (sugarcane) and Jinnah.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths repeated reference to Mohammed Ali Jinnahs portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University during the campaign was seen as an attempt to polarise voters on religious lines.The Opposition, however, campaigned against the Modi governments failure to get the sugarcane farmers their dues from the various sugar mills that stood at over Rs. 12,000 crore.The Palghar Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra brought cheer to the BJP as its candidate Rajendra Gavit defeated Shiv Senas Shrinivas Wanga by 29,572 votes.But the votes polled in favour of the BJP fell sharply from 5.33 lakh in 2014 to to 2.72 lakh in this election.

Agricultural prices are determined by the international market. For example, Brazil controls sugar (prices), Malaysia edible oil, and Argentina soybean prices.

5b2722759855b72a6d18b5fc,Farmers’ stir sign of rising distress,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/farmers-stir-sign-rising-distress-673207.html,2018-06-03,"The 10-day agitation launched by farmers in seven states on Friday has intensified and is set to be extended to more states. The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government. Effective policies and actions, and not promises and slogans, are needed to mitigate the rising distress."

(PTI Photo) Office-bearers of the Samiti said they had given a call for farmers strike on last June 1 over demands, including complete farm loan waiver, minimum support price for farm produce, among others. (PTI Photo)In a move thats likely to hit markets across Maharashtra, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) has asked farmers to stop sending milk and vegetables to urban areas from June 7 unless the government accepts its demands. The demands include a complete farm loan waiver, minimum support price for farm produce, implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and the Forest Rights Act, among others.Ashok Dhawale, president of the Kisan Sabha, said they have decided to stop the supply as the government has failed to respond to the crisis in the dairy and agricultural sector. The government has failed to act on our demands. So, we carried out the farmers long march from Nashik to Mumbai. But the government hasnt done anything in the last three months on our demands, said Dhawale.Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of AIKS, said despite the excess production of tur, sugar and milk, the state government was importing these commodities. So, we will present the tur imported from Mozambique, sugar imported from Pakistan and milk imported from Gujarat and Karnataka to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on June 5, said Nawale. He said if the government failed to act on their demands, then we will urge the farmers to take matters into their own hands.  If the government still doesnt act, then we will do rasta roko across the state on June 10, he added.AIKS members said they have urged the protesting dairy farmers not to spill milk on the road and, instead, to distribute it free-of-cost to underprivileged members of the society.On the strike by the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh from Friday, the leaders clarified that they have extended their support to the strike since it was also on farmers issues. While theirs is a strike, ours is a protest we are carrying out a separate protest, said Nawale.Meanwhile, on the second day of the nation-wide farmers strike, milk collection in Pune fell by 10 per cent. Vishnu Hinge, chairman of the Pune Dairy Union, said they have noticed declining supplies from the talukas of Daund, Indapur and Ambegaon.The situation in Kolhapur, however, seemed to be unaffected by the strike. Vishwas Patil, chairman of the Kolhapur Milk Union, said they have not faced any issues with procurement.The Directorate of Marketing has set up a special cell to monitor the arrival of vegetables in the wholesale markets. Officials of the directorate said arrival of fresh produce has been close to normal. Directions have also been issued to market committees to ensure that they remain open for trading.While supply of fresh produce remained largely normal on Friday, Rajendra Shelke, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Vashi market, said arrivals had dipped slightly on Saturday.Sandeep Gidde, one of the coordinators of the strike in Maharashtra, said it has received support from the Maratha Kranti Morcha, the Aam Aadmi Party and the NCP. The protest is gathering momentum many of the protesting farmer were taken into custody in Sangli, Sangamner and other parts of the state, he said.(With inputs from Mumbai ENS)For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The crushing operations will end in another week or so, further exacerbating the problem of dues. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Not many would have heard of Bakshi Ram. Currently director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) at Coimbatore, he isnt as well-known as Norman Borlaug or M S Swaminathan. Yet, the wonder sugarcane variety, Co-0238, bred by him has sparked no less a revolution, particularly in Uttar Pradeshs (UP) ganna heartland. It is probably also a reason for the present crisis in sugar  that of overproduction and India becoming permanently surplus in the sweetener.In the 2012-13 crushing season (October-September), UP farmers grew cane on 24.24 lakh hectares (lh) and its mills produced 74.85 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar. In the current 2017-18 season, the cane area is only 22.99 lh, but production of sugar by UP mills has already hit 119.22 lt as on June 1. It is likely to cross 120 lt when crushing operations end in another week or so.Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)The above 60 per cent increase in sugar output, despite area under cane shrinking, is largely due to Co-0238. Bakshi Rams variety, first planted in 2013-14, covers 12.08 lh or 52.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. It has led to average cane yields in the state rising from 61.63 tonnes per hectare in 2012-13 to around 77 tonnes in 2017-18. Thats not all. Co-0238 also gives more sugar from every tonne of cane crushed compared to other varieties. In 2012-13, the average sugar-to-cane recovery ratio for UP mills was 9.18 per cent. This season, it is close to 10.9 per cent.The production revolution from higher cane yields and improved sugar recoveries  thanks to unsung breeders like Bakshi Ram  is not an unmixed blessing, though.The sugar economy of India has traditionally been hostage to violent cyclical output oscillations. The typical sugar cycle is one of three years of high production followed by two years of sharp decline. Thus, 2000-01 to 2002-03 were good seasons in terms of output, while 2003-04 and 2004-05 were not. The same pattern was repeated over 2005-06 to 2007-08 (good) vis--vis 2008-09 and 2009-10 (bad).However, with advances in plant breeding  SBI and the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute are field-testing 20 drought-resistant clones in six locations of Maharashtra; these can save seven-eight out of the normal 34-35 irrigations over a 12-month crop duration (and even more through drip/sprinkler systems)  the old cycle of two-in-five bad production years is pass. Instead, we now have one-in-five or even one-in-seven bad, as seen from 2010-11 to 2016-17 (see chart below). Moreover, the recovery from declines is much sharper than before: Indias sugar output this season is projected at a record 322 lt, a 59 per cent jump over the 202.62 lt of 2016-17.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThe effects of moving to a permanently surplus situation are already being felt. Sugarcane is relatively profitable to grow. The average returns over cost of cultivation, estimated by The Sunday Express based on interactions with a cross-section of farmers in UPs Shamli district, work out to around Rs 7,500 per bigha or Rs 1.09 lakh per hectare. The green top leaves from cane take care of the entire fodder requirements of a farmers cattle during the crushing months from November to April. Also, it is a hardy crop that can withstand ola (hail), pala (frost), aag (fire), paani (waterlogging), nilgai (Asian antelope) and jungli suar (wild boar), to quote a Shamli farmer. Plus, there are no pricing and marketing uncertainties in cane. Mills are required, by law, to pay farmers a fair and remunerative price fixed by the Centre  UP has an even higher State Advised Price or SAP  within 14 days from the date of delivery.But these stable arrangements are bound to collapse in a regime of permanent surpluses. The 320 lt-plus sugar production for the country in 2017-18 will far exceed its annual domestic consumption of 250-260 lt. And with breeding breakthroughs and water-saving technologies practically rendering the sugar cycle redundant, surpluses are set to be recurrent  except in extreme drought years, when even irrigation from canals and groundwater is not possible.In such a scenario, sugar prices, far from rising, are more prone to falling. We have seen it this season, as ex-factory realisations in UP have collapsed from Rs 36-37 per kg in October to Rs 26-27 levels in May. That has, then, resulted in mills being unable to pay farmers the SAP. In UP alone, mills had bought sugarcane worth Rs 35,103.27 crore at the SAP during the 2017-18 season, as on June 1. Out of that, they were to pay Rs 34,549.28 crore within the stipulated 14-day period, but have so far disbursed just Rs 21,978.37 crore. It translates into arrears of Rs 12,570.91 crore.Read | Mounting molasses, and a scare in BeasThose dues may come down gradually, as crushing ends and mills sell sugar over the next few months. But the next season from October 2018  save in the unlikely event of a spectacular recovery in sugar prices  may start with Rs 7,500 crore of cane arrears in UP. Worse, the country as a whole would have opening sugar stocks of at least 100 lt (320 lt production, plus 40 lt carry-forward from 2016-17, minus 260 lt consumption). And going by reports of planting so far, there is every possibility of output in the 2018-19 season going up further to 340 lt.Simply put, India has too much of sugar today and the situation will only worsen in the coming season. For the Narendra Modi government  already smarting from a defeat in the recent by-polls in UPs Kairana parliamentary constituency, where ganna payment was the main issue  this could present a major challenge, ahead of the big national elections in April-May 2018. That is also the time when cane arrears usually peak. No ruling party would want that to happen.Next week, the Modi government is expected to take a few decisions in the hope of propping up sugar prices. On the agenda are the creation of a 30-lt buffer stock from sugar lying with mills (the government will bear the interest and storage costs on this sequestered quantity); the imposition of a minimum price of Rs 30-32 per kg; and fixing of factory-wise monthly sale quotas (what used to earlier be called the release order mechanism). Whether these can really address a problem of permanent surplus is, of course, a moot point.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

While ABKS has not lent support to the ongoing strike, they have planned an agitation from June 5 to June 10.The protests are likely to lead to a shortage of supplies of vegetables, fruits and milk to the city in the coming days. Though supplies in main whole sale markets are not yet hit, retailers have already started hiking prices of vegetables in the city. ABKS was part of the steering committee of farmers organisations that had held strike in June last year.The strike called by RKM is part of a nationwide protest across 130 cities to highlight the ongoing agrarian crisis and press for demands, including complete loan waiver and higher minimum support price. Apart from blocking supplies, our supporters also staged road blockades at several places. We have succeeded in affecting 40% supplies to the cities.

However, a decision was deferred as the GoM is awaiting a legal opinion from the Attorney General on the original proposal to levy a sugar cess.On Sunday, the five-member GoM, led by Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also explored a reduction in the GST on ethanol to 5% from the existing 18% levy and increasing the government subsidy for export of sugar.Kerala Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu that the possibility of a uniform 1% hike in GST across all slabs was discussed.Out of it, 0.5% can be kept with the Centre and rest with the State. That money can be used to fulfil the needs of all farmers, not only sugar cane, by respective States in the form of welfare fund and even the Centre can chip in when necessary. But imposing a cess would mean betraying the very principle of GST, Mr. Issac said. At present, the GST rate slabs are pegged at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, while certain goods are zero-rated.The fund would be to extend financial aid to farmers in case of situation that has arisen for sugar cane farmers and the States will have control over their share for disbursal .Sugar cess opposedKerala had already expressed dissent to the move to impose a sugar cess at the GST Councils meeting on May 4. Apart from Mr. Sarma and Mr. Isaac, the GoM includes Ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Maharashtra Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the GoM has decided to submit its report to the Council within a month, and is awaiting the Attorney Generals opinion on whether cess on GST can be imposed for welfare purposes, since it can only be imposed for compensation purposes.The Council will take a final call on the GoMs report."

But the glut both here and nationally is not good news for sugarcane farmers . As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues worth Rs 1,913 crore.Restive cane farmers have threatened an agitation. Why should farmers be punished for improving their production? asked Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Sanghatana. We will launch an agitation outside the sugar commissioners office in Pune if the dues are not cleared by mid-June.The sugar belt in Western Maharashtra , which has the highest concentration of sugarcane and factories, owes the most to farmers.Mills in Pune division owe around Rs 843 crore, while those in Kolhapur division owe Rs 506 crore.Sugar factories in the Aurangabad circle owe Rs 237 crore.Caught in a bind, claim sugar millsWe have issued notices to defaulting factories but will wait before taking further action since they are making an attempt to pay, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.Nationally too, the glut is a crisis. The estimated output this year is 320 lakh tonnes, 58% higher than last year, according to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF). Sugar prices have dropped from Rs 3,600 to Rs 2,750 per quintal. And pending cane dues to farmers are estimated at Rs 20,000 crore. More than half these dues are from Uttar Pradesh, Indias top sugar producer.The sugar mills say they are caught between the price crash, which has eaten into their funds, and the fee set by the Centre to be paid to cane farmers at Rs 2,550 per tonne. This is known as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP).We are making losses of Rs 825 per tonne. Besides FRP dues, we have to pay for harvesting and transport worth Rs 650 crore, which is not included in FRP calculation in Maharashtra, said a representative of Maharashtras Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. Also, 71 cooperative factories owe banks around Rs 650 crore. These have been converted into short margin and need to be repaid before factories can regain the sugar stock hypothecated to banks.The Centre has increased import duty to 100% and removed export duty. to boost exports and reduce stock. We are hoping government helps control prices by declaring a price under Essential Commodities Act and retains a 30 lakh tonne buffer stock, said Prakash Naiknavare, MD of NFCSF. The industry is also hoping for an increase in the Rs 55 per tonne cane incentive."

Currently the average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg, below cost of production, resulting in huge financial loss for sugar mills. As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues.

The fiscal maths are getting challenging on rising fuel prices, a weakening rupee and subdued investments.""This could be the worst year for us, as budget calculations are under stress,"" a senior finance ministry official, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding there was a worry of at least one more rate hike by December.""The rising crude oil prices are already giving sleepless nights as the government may have to cut tax on fuel products sooner rather than later,"" the official added.India's economy grew at 7.7 percent in the first three months of the year, the fastest pace in nearly two years. That would be an impressive clip for most countries, but more is needed to create enough new jobs for the 1 million young people entering the country's workforce each month.FEELING THE PRESSUREThe government's spending plans have already been threatened by setbacks to flagship reforms.An estimated $1.2 billion-$1.5 billion Air India privatisation plan flopped when the stake it was selling in the flag carrier failed to attract a single bid by last week's deadline, putting at risk its 800 billion rupees ($11.93 billion) divestment target.Meanwhile, the sovereign 10-year bond yield has risen by 60 basis points since start of the fiscal year in April, and is near a three-year high due to a lack of investors. Similarly top-rated corporates, including National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Small Industries Development Bank of India and National Housing Bank, have deferred their bond issuance plans due to a lack of buyers.To top this, foreign holders have sold a net $4.3 billion of Indian debt so far this year as investors have grown wary of emerging economies facing twin fiscal and current account deficits and higher inflation that could pose overheating risks.The stock market has held up so far, but some analysts caution that concerns over a loosening of fiscal discipline ahead of the election could trigger equity outflows as well.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its key repo rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent - the first change since a cut of the same size in August last year - as higher oil prices, a sharp fall in the rupee and potential stronger consumer spending threatened to spur inflation beyond its 4 percent medium term target.""The rate hike will push up the government's interest financing cost and add to the fiscal deficit pressure on one hand,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India. ""And on the other hand, the nascent recovery in growth on the back of consumption demand will also slow down as retail lending rates will go up sooner than later.""MODI'S ELECTION BUGLEAfter a setback at a by-election in India's most populous state last week showed Modi's waning popularity in the countryside, where most Indians still live, the government has stepped up its so-called populist spending to please the voters.Already the government has unveiled a support package for sugar farmers to put a floor under prices that could cost about 40 billion rupees ($597 million) outside the budget.Further measures, including loan waivers to farmers by regional governments, higher minimum purchase prices for grains, fuel subsidies to prevent pump prices from rising sharply and higher than budgeted rural wage payouts could blow a big hole in the fiscal deficit.That could set up the RBI for a face-off with the government and also prompt further rate increases after it warned in its monetary policy statement that moving away from the fiscal deficit roadmap could push up inflation risks.""India's combined fiscal deficit is already quite high and since this is an election year, both state and central governments are coming up with populist spending steps which will push up the fiscal deficit and add to inflation pressures,"" said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. ""This increases the probability of further rate hikes."""

Which is why, while the Oppositions celebrations after besting the BJP in another round of by-elections may be premature, Indias principal party cant any longer afford to take victory in the 2019 general elections for granted.This isnt just about a more united Opposition challenge: truth is, from Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh to Bhandara-Gondia in Maharashtra, the BJPs vote share is showing signs of decline, a first indication of creeping anti-incumbency. That the election setbacks have come in the north and west is also significant: it was, after all, a north-west India tidal wave that propelled the BJP to a famous win in 2014. Nor can the BJP claim that Narendra Modi did not campaign in the by-elections: a day before the polling in Kairana, the prime minister was in the neighbouring Baghpat district, flagging off a new expressway and promising achche din to the region. And the BJPs UP Hindutva mascot, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, was even more omnipresent, even raking up the communally-charged issue of removing a Jinnah portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University.As it turned out, May 2018 was not quite May 2014: then, against a backdrop of the Muzaffarnagar riots, the BJP succeeded in achieving an unprecedented communal polarisation and swept western UP. This time, the more prosaic issue of ganna  as exemplified by farmers demanding their sugarcane dues  defeated the divisive politics of Jinnah. So, are we seeing the revival of a fresh political narrative ahead of the 2019 general elections where local concerns trump the national issues that play out in TV studios? Well, yes and no.Local issues do matter at election time, especially when they play out through the prism of strategic alliances on the ground. This is exactly what happened in Kairana where the entire anti-BJP Opposition backed the Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate, giving them a strong arithmetical advantage that enabled them to play the ganna card with confidence. But amplifying the act local messaging over 543 constituencies spread across 29 states in a general election is a huge challenge: the competitive instincts of political parties mean that while they might be ready to cede space in a by-election, they are unlikely to be as generous in the ultimate parliamentary test.Moreover, the BJP will determinedly make the 2019 elections a made for TV presidential contest, posing the issue before the voter as Modi versus who? Besides, in a by-election, voter turnout tends to be low, but in a general election the sheer size and resources of the BJP-RSS election machine could give the momentum to the saffron brotherhood.And yet, as Karnataka and now Kairana have shown, the notion of political invincibility is also part of a myth-making factory. Modi and his lieutenant Amit Shah have built a larger than life image for themselves by convincing the Opposition that they are indestructible. But to draw a cricketing analogy, as Indias stunning 1983 World Cup win over the mighty West Indies and the magical turnaround in Kolkata against Australia in 2001 showed, even seemingly unbeatable rivals can be outplayed provided there is sufficient self-belief.From an Opposition that has been pummelled and outwitted at almost every stage for the last four years, we now at least have the emerging contours of a potential challenge. At the heart of it, is the ultimate political weapon: the netas survival instinct. Nothing else explains why the Congress has virtually surrendered to a HD Kumaraswamy while forming a government in Karnataka, or the fact that a Mayawati is ready to forget past animosities.Not that the dominant party is simply going to lie down and let the Opposition walk all over them. Within days of the by-poll setbacks, there are signs of the Modi-Shah duo getting into course correction mode. The massive aid package to the sugar industry is perhaps a belated recognition that post-Kairana the ganna farmer needs a break. Expect more such sops in the coming months as the NDA government prepares to dip into its petrol tax-rich coffers to share the booty with the aam aadmi. That Shah is now busily courting allies and even high-profile celebrities is another pointer to the future: in the run-up to 2019, the BJP will need to relearn the art of winning friends and influencing people. Ekla chalo re is a stirring song but it doesnt necessarily make for good politics.Post-script: A day after the Kairana results, a WhatsApp forward from a BJP supporters group was sent to me by a friend. It read: See what happened in Kairana: 35 per cent Muslims voted as a bloc while we Hindus are divided and fighting over petrol prices! In the months ahead, as the stakes get higher, expect the communal pitch to intensify further.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal"

These mills are mostly in the states of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh . In the case of Tamil Nadu, most of the private sugar mills have paid their FRP through borrowings, while cooperative and public sector mills have cleared the arrears with high interest cost through advance from the state government.Fixation of minimum sugar price of Rs 29 per kg for the domestic market may not ensure cost recovery for sugar mills in TN due to poor recovery and low capacity utilisation precipitated by drought. Further, the proposed financial assistance to ethanol projects will not provide any immediate relief to the sugar mills in the state due to low availability of sugarcane, Palaniswami pointed out, among other issues related to the sugar industry in the state."

5b2588f69855b722ac49b0f3,A not-so-sweet relief: Govt’s scheme for cane farmers benefits traders,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-not-so-sweet-relief-govts-scheme-for-cane-farmers-benefits-traders-5216375/,2018-06-14,"Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)How successful will the Narendra Modi governments recent package for cane farmers be, in helping clear payment dues to them by sugar mills, is open to question. Whats clear right now, though, is that it is neither mills nor farmers, but sugar traders who are laughing their way to the bank.Consider this: till May 19, ex-factory prices of S-30, the most-commonly traded grade of sugar in Maharashtra, averaged as low as Rs 2,515 per quintal. But precisely around that time, the sugar trade was abuzz with talk of the Union Cabinet considering four proposals, as part of a package to expedite payment of cane price arrears worth over Rs 22,000 crore to farmers during the current 2017-18 crushing season (October-September).The proposals included the creation of a 30 lakh tonnes (lt) buffer stock, imposition of a minimum ex-factory price, restoration of the earlier system of monthly mill-wise sugar sale quotas, and higher rates for ethanol procured by oil marketing companies under the 10% blending-with-petrol programme. The stories of the likely package, interestingly, came after a meeting that the former Union Agriculture Minister, Sharad Pawar, had with top officials at the Prime Ministers Office on May 15. The said proposals were reportedly discussed in that meeting the very day when counting for the Karnataka Assembly elections also took place.But as the news of an impending Cabinet decision gained currency  Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan himself confirmed the proposal to build a 30-lt sugar buffer on May 31  prices also began firming up. By the month-end, average ex-factory rates in Maharashtra had climbed to Rs 2,750 per quintal.On June 6, the day the Union Cabinet approved the package  which included the 30 lt buffer stock (to be held in mill godowns, but with the government bearing the interest, insurance and storage expenses), fixing of a minimum ex-factory price of Rs 29 per kg, and bringing back monthly sale quotas  the S-30 rates touched Rs 2,900 per quintal. They have since risen even further to Rs 3,175 per quintal (see chart).The above increase of about Rs 660 per quintal in just over three weeks  in Uttar Pradesh (UP), factories that had sold at Rs 2,500-2,520 are now realising Rs 3,300-3,350 per quintal  has, however, benefited neither mills nor farmers.The reason: The governments decision to fix artificially low sale quotas for mills, which has created a scarcity in the market and pushed up prices. But the high prices are of little use, as mills cannot sell more than the quotas allocated to them. Doing so will attract penal provisions under the Essential Commodities Act.On June 7, just a day after the Cabinet decision, the department of food & public distribution fixed the maximum quantity of sugar that mills could sell in the domestic market during June at 21.01 lt. By the time this was notified, many mills had already sold a lot of sugar and even exhausted a significant part of their quotas for the whole month. Today, you have a peculiar situation where prices have gone up and mills have sugar in their godowns, and yet they cannot sell, an industry source noted.According to him, the ones really making a killing now are traders, who had stocked up when rates were as low as Rs 2,400-2,450 per quintal in Maharashtra. They are benefiting hugely. Mills, on the other hand, can do nothing, except watch prices going up. And if they cannot sell sugar, it is not possible to pay farmers either, he added.A UP miller also questioned the manner in which the sale quota for June was distributed among individual factories. Out of the total 21.01 lt, as much as 8.14 lt has been allotted to mills in Maharashtra, followed by UP (6.25 lt), Karnataka (2.62 lt), Gujarat (0.87 lt), Punjab (0.53 lt), Bihar (0.50 lt), Haryana (0.47 lt), Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (0.41 lt each), Tamil Nadu (0.36 lt) and Uttarakhand (0.30 lt).Its not clear how Maharashtra has been given a higher quota, when we (UP) are producing 120 lt this season, as against their 107.08 lt. Also, while Maharashtra mills have to only pay the Centres FRP (fair and remunerative price) for cane, we are obliged to give the UP governments much higher SAP (state advised price). Our payment arrears, too, are more (at Rs 12,601.48 crore versus Maharashtras Rs 1,768.29 crore, as on end-May). So, we should have got a bigger sale quota, the miller argued.The industry source quoted earlier was also cynical regarding the sustainability of the current sugar prices. Artificially restricting sales through quotas cannot take care of the underlying surplus due to the total availability at 360 lt  from 320 lt production in 2017-18 and 40 lt opening stocks  far exceeding estimated domestic consumption of 250 lt. Even the 30 lt buffer stock created out of the surplus will eventually have to be released into the market, he noted.Farmer leader and Member of Parliament from Maharashtras Hatkanangle Lok Sabha constituency, Raju Shetti, alleged that the Centres sugarcane package has only enriched traders. The market is now with them. If there are sale quotas for mills, why shouldnt these apply for traders as well? In any case, how does high sugar prices help, if mills cannot sell at these rates?, he asked.The convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, said that the much-touted Rs 7,000-crore package for sugarcane growers was actually worth no more than Rs 1,175 crore. The so-called package includes Rs 4,440 crore of bank loans to mills for expanding their ethanol production capacities and Rs 1,500 crore as incentive for 20 lt of sugar exports. The first is subject to mills actually availing the loan facility (on which the Centre will provide interest subvention of Rs 1,332 crore over five years), and the second is conditional on mills exporting, which is not possible when global sugar prices are currently Rs 22-24/kg, compared to domestic ex-factory realisations of Rs 32-33, he stated.Singh claimed that the only substantial element in the package was the 30 lt buffer, on which the carrying cost of Rs 1,175 crore would be borne by the Centre. But even this money will provide additional liquidity of only Rs 2 crore per mill, as against their average cane dues of Rs 50 crore. Many mills in UP owe farmers more than Rs 200 crore each.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sandeep Belsare, president of the Pimpri Chinchwad Small and Medium Scale Industries Association, spoke to The Indian Express about the atmosphere in the industrial circles in the regionHow has the implementation of GST affected the small and medium scale industries in the region? Has the problem of filing returns been solved?In the initial days, filing of returns was a major issue for the micro and small industries. The portal was slow and even the tax consultants were not sure of what to do. Glitches in the system had become quite a pain for us while filing quarterly returns. A year since its implementation, most of the glitches have been eased out and we are able to file returns regularly.The One Nation One Tax policy has benefited players like us. Thanks to the single tax system, we are able to compete with players outside Maharashtra. Also, currently around 85 per cent of the industries come under the 18 per cent tax slab as against the 28 per cent we had to pay in the past. This has helped us better our bottom line.On the flip side, we want some changes in the present system, which, if they come into effect, will ease our business a lot. The present law holds the buyer responsible if the seller fails to file returns on time. This poses a big risk for us and we want this to be changed. Also, micro industries should be allowed to file quarterly returns.Have you seen a rise in the business of micro, small and medium scale industries? Where do you see business coming from?On an average, we have seen a rise of 25 per cent in our business. This year, most of the members have reported steady booking from April. The year has started on a positive note for us and we hope to see steady growth.The growth is mainly coming from the automobile, infrastructure and power sector. Earlier, the sugar industry had also given a lot of traction to us, but of late, it has slowed down a bit. Most of the automobile OEMs have launched newer variants, which has boosted our business. Similarly, increased investment in infrastructure and captive power plants has helped our members bag newer business. Most of us are looking for expansion, but are unable to do so due to land constraints.How chronic is the land constraint in the MIDC region? Is institutional finance easily available for the MSME sector?In Pimpri Chinchwad, there is hardly any area for expansion for us while Chakan and other regions have become non-viable. The land constraint is a major problem for us. We have sent a memorandum to the industry minister to clear the MIDC area of the unauthorised slums and rehabilitate all the slums in a separate land parcel. If that is done, then we will have enough area to expand.Historically, the MSME sector has a very good credit history as we know that without proper credit history we will not be able to increase our business. The NPA problem is mostly with the bigger players. At a time when our sector is witnessing growth, access to institutional finance is becoming a problem for us, with banks asking for extra collateral etc. We want the banks to lend to us, based on our good credit history.Another issue that we want to be looked into is the rising cost of raw material. There should be a regulatory body to keep a watch on the prices of raw material, which is rising exorbitantly.One of the complaints of the sector was the unavailability of skilled manpower. Has the Skill India initiative solved the problem?The problem of skilled manpower still persists. Traditionally, we like to recruit from the ITIs as they have credibility. However, in Pimpri Chinchwad, there are only two ITIs and thus they are not able to meet our growing demands. We want two more ITIs to be set up here . Also, the ITIs should upgrade their syllabus and introduce modern machinery for their students.While the skill centres have come up, we still feel they are not up to the mark. The government should be more stringent in who is allowed to set up these centres. There should be a quality check on them so that they produce quality resources.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational) Centre should announce MSP for dairy farmers: Fadnavis. (Representational)To ensure higher remuneration to dairy farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday urged the Centre to announce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for them under the Essential Commodities Act. Fadnavis raised the demand at the Niti Aayogs fourth governing council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Sunday.Highlighting the exploitation of dairy farmers by milk companies and cooperatives, he said, The Centre should announce an MSP for milk procured from dairy farmers by private players and cooperatives, which run the dairies across the country and Maharashtra, under the Essential Commodities Act.In Maharashtra, the state government has fixed a minimum Rs 27 per litre of milk. However, dairy farmers often complain of rampant exploitation by dairies, which refuse to pay more than Rs 17 to 20 per litre.To raise the milk demand and promote milk processing units for skimmed milk powder, the state government has announced a Rs 3 subsidy. To help the dairy farmers and make milk processing economically feasible and generate more demand in the market, the chief minister suggested the Centre should provide a 10 per cent subsidy.In the wake of surplus sugar production in the state and across the country, the chief minister demanded restructuring and extension of tenure for repayment of the soft loans availed by the mill owners. Of the total 31.7 million tonne sugar production, Maharashtra accounts for 10.7 million tonne.Fadnavis also pitched for higher Budget allocations to modernise 3,500 gramin haats (rural markets) across Maharashtra. For this, the Centre should make provisions from the Agro-Infra Fund, he said. Gramin haats are important centres for boosting the rural economy. It is a platform where farmers can market their farm produce. It would help in better remuneration to the farmers and villagers, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(File)Following a recent notice issued by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) office in Solapur, asking sugar factories to extend EPF benefits to labourers engaged in sugarcane cutting and transportation, the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation has written to the Union labour minister requesting him to direct EPF officials in Maharashtra to stop insistence of EPF for cane labourers and not to initiate any coercive action against the sugar factories.Last December, the regional EPF commissioner of Solapur had issued notices to 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur asking them to start remittance of EPF dues. In all, there are eight lakh sugarcane labourers across the state. The notices were issued under the provision of Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.According to sources in the federation, the issue was deliberated at the highest level by the Union government in 2003. However, it has reached an impasse and no action was taken by the EPF authorities then due to alleged pressure from the sugar factory lobby in the state, sources claim. The state has leaders across the political spectrum who are sugar barons and reign control over the federation.The bylaws of sugar factories under the Maharashtra State Cooperative Societies Act,1960 which was subsequently amended, clearly states that it is the responsibility of the sugarcane growers/suppliers/producers to supply the cane up to the factory gate, stated Shivajirao Nagavade, chairman of the federation, an apex body of sugar factories in the state, in his letter to the Union labour minister.He further writes that the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane paid to farmers is inclusive of harvesting and transportation cost. The sugar factories are mere nodal points facilitating the transaction between the farmers and sugarcane harvesting and transport contractor/labour by way of agreeing to request of the farmers to cut the cost of harvesting and transportation and release it to such contractors/labour on their behalf, wrote Nagavade.He has also mentioned that such contractors or labourers are never engaged in any work within factory premises of sugar factories. Their place of work is purely and exclusively in the fields of the farmers and roads culminating at the factory gate, he added.Any insistence of payment of PF for such contractors/labour is not only legally void but gives rise to other dimensions regarding additional burden upon the farmers to bear the cost of the same, timely operation of harvesting and transportation, consequential damage to farmers, he said.Nagavade was not available for comment while Hemant Tirpude, Regional Employees Provident Fund Commissioner in Solapur, refused to comment on the issue. However, EPF officials maintained that action initiated by the Solapur office is based on the directives issued by EPF Delhi office in 2002 that was communicated in 2003. The action is initiated based on letters sent by the EPF office in Delhi in 2003 directing that an employer and employee relationship exists between sugar factories and cane labourers, said an official, requesting anonymity.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It also granted soft loans worth 44.4 billion rupees to help millers expand ethanol output capacity.""These moves suddenly changed sentiments. Despite the government order, mills are now not interested in exporting their allocated quota,"" said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.SURPLUS SUGAR AHEAD?In March, India asked mills to export 2 million tonnes of sugar and fixed a mandatory export quota for each mill.With only a few mills signing new contracts, the country could export only 500,000 tonnes of sugar in the current marketing year ending on Sept. 30, two dealers said.That includes 175,000 tonnes that Indian traders have contracted to sell to Myanmar, Sri Lanka and African countries, said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.While the government measures are boosting local sugar prices, they could plunge again unless the national inventory drops, said a sugar miller based in Pune in the western Maharashtra state.India is likely to produce 32 million tonnes of sugar in the current year, compared to domestic consumption of around 25 million tonnes. Output is expected to rise further as farmers are spurred by the better returns.That could bring the South Asian country's stocks to around 10 million tonnes on Oct. 1, making exports much more necessary in the next season, said Verma of ISMA.""The major problem the industry is facing is surplus sugar. That could be addressed only by disposing stocks through exports,"" he said."

Before that, Prasad was lodged in Birsa Munda Central Jail since December 23 after a Special CBI Court convicted and sentenced him for three-and-half-year jail term in a fodder scam case RC64A/96.Subsequently, he was sentenced in three other cases related to fodder scam. The provisional bail was granted by the Jharkhand High Court for the purpose of medical treatment on the conditions of restraining himself from any political activity and had also been asked to submit medical reports before the Court.""The application for extension of interim bail has been granted by the Court of Acting Chief Justice DN Patel till July 3; meanwhile the case will be heard by the regular court on June 29,"" said Prasad's Counsel Prabhat Kumar.The application was allowed on the basis of submission made in the Court that the RJD Chief was currently undergoing treatment at Asian Heart Institute in Mumbai and will be surgery for fistula, he added.Kumar said that the RJD Cheif was admitted in the hospital earlier also for few days, but doctors refused to operate on him citing increased blood sugar level and advised him to come again after 15 days prescribing some medicines to control his sugar level.""He has been admitted again and will be operated probably on Saturday or Sunday if his blood sugar level was found to be normal,"" said the advocate. Besides that, he has been detected with some other ailments like stone in kidney and heart valve malfunctioning, he added. The period of interim bail of six weeks granted to RJD Chief was to end on June 26."

This, after several reports on lack of alternatives for packing products that are sold at kirana stores.Several shopkeeper associations had met the minister and complained about the situation.""The plastic ban has been relaxed for general and grocery stores, which sell loose products like oil, rice, sugar in retail packaging. This will be effective from June 28. Ban on the use of plastic by public continues,"" Maharashtra's environment minister Ramdas Kadam told NDTV.Activists who have pushed for the ban, however, feel that this relaxation will take things back to square one.""Why should the government or MCGM relax after imposing the plastic ban for which sufficient notice of over six months was given?"" activist Prakash Munshi, who has been working with actor Juhi Chawla to push for the plastic ban, told NDTV.""The ban has made vendors and other suppliers think out-of-the-box to do their business.

It will also provide incentive for those farmers whose recovery from sugarcane will be higher than 9.5 per cent.FRP for the current 2017-18 season is Rs 255 per quintal and the government's farm advisory body CACP has proposed Rs 20 per quintal hike for the next season.In the meeting, PM Modi apprised cane growers about the various decisions taken to clear sugarcane arrears.""In the last seven to ten days itself, more than Rs 4,000 crore of arrears have been given to the farmers as a result of new policy measures enforced,"" the Prime Minister said.He assured farmers that states have been asked to take effective measures for liquidation of cane arrears.Cane arrears stood at Rs 22,654 crore as on June 1 and now have come down to Rs 19,816 crore, as per official data.To boost farmers' income, PM Modi called for use of sprinkler and drip irrigation, latest farming techniques and solar pumps as well as solar panels in their farms.He emphasised on value addition of crops, judicious use of farm waste, and up to 10 per cent reduction in chemical fertilisers by 2022.Mentioning about his recent interactions with industries, the Prime Minister said corporates have been asked to invest more in value addition, warehousing, storage facilities, better quality seeds, and market linkages for improving income of farmers.PM Modi also highlighted the steps taken by his government during 2014-15 and 2015-16 season when cane arrears had crossed Rs 21,000 crore.Elaborating on the government's plan to ensure 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol, he said it would be a long-term solution for providing stability in the sugar industry.To help loss-making sugar mills pay sugarcane growers, the centre has taken various initiatives during the last five months. These include doubling of import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, scrapping of export duty and announcement of the Rs 8,500 crore package.The package includes creation of buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar, providing soft loan of Rs 4,500 crore with interest subsidy for expansion of ethanol capacity besides a production-linked subsidy worth Rs 1,500 crore to clear sugarcane arrears of the farmers.On Wednesday, the government hiked prices of ethanol extracted from final or C-molasses by Rs 2.85 per litre to Rs 43.70 per litre and also fixed for the first time the rate for ethanol produced from B-molasses (called intermediary molasses) at Rs 47.49 per litre for the 2018-19 season beginning December.This move will help boost production of ethanol, used in blending with petrol, and also enable mills to divert some of the sugarcane juice during the surplus crop year.Sugar production of India, the world's second largest producer but the biggest consumer, is estimated to touch a record 32 million tonnes in the 2017-18 marketing year (October-September), against 20.3 million tonnes output in the previous year.This year's expected production is much higher than the annual domestic demand of 25 million tonnes. The problem of plenty has led to crash in prices of sugar below the cost of production."

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

Mr. Deshmukh was the chairman of the society before becoming a cabinet minister.The documents show that all certificates submitted by Lokmangal were fake. These included a consent letter from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, an order describing the plant site as non-agricultural land, a letter for industrial security and those from the Health and Public Works departments, a licence from the Food and Drug Administration, and a certificate from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.They say the society does not have a single processing unit in Solapur, its centres at Karmala, Sangola and Mangalwedha are closed, and it does not even have a processing centre in Wadala in Mumbai as it has claimed.Being protectedOn October 4, Solapurs district dairy business development officer wrote to the regional dairy business development officer that every document submitted by Lokmangal society seeking sanction for the subsidy was either fake.Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam said, Despite this, no action has been taken. Complaints have been made to the Solapur police and the State Agriculture Department It seems he is being protected by the Chief Minister himself. He continues to be a minister despite all the cases and allegations against him.This is not the first controversy involving the minister. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India barred Mr. Deshmukhs Lokmangal Agro Industries Ltd., which runs a sugar mill in Solapur, from investing in the stock market until it repaid Rs. 74.82 crore to 4,751 farmers along with 15% interest as it illegally sold farmers shares.After demonetisation, cash worth Rs. 92 lakh was seized from Mr. Deshmukhs year, which he claimed was meant for payment to sugar factory workers. Also, the Solapur Municipal Corporation recently submitted a 26-page report to the Bombay High Court that the minister had constructed a bungalow illegally on a plot reserved for the fire brigade.Mr. Deshmukh could not be reached for comment till the time of going to press."

It has cited tests that found GM soy in Gujarat last year.The non-government Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, had said in July that it had found signatures linked to GM crops in 21 of 65 food products picked up from retail outlets. The food items included canola oil, corn-based products, and soy infant formula.Expectations that only GM-free material will be shipped to India are unrealistic, and the government lacks the machinery to test every import consignment, Rohit Parakh, a spokesperson for the coalition, said.The Union health ministry had told Parliament in February that food with GM ingredients would require approval from the Food Safety Standards Authority of India, and that no standards for GM foods had been notified yet. The FSSAI had in July said it had initiated work on framing rules for GM food.Several food items based on GM crops have been consumed across the US, Canada, China, Europe and Japan over the years, and biotechnology proponents assert that there is no evidence to justify concerns about GM crops.A 2016 report from Technavio, a market research analysis company, had estimated that GM seeds occupied more than half the global commercial seeds market and included corn, soybean, cotton, canola, sugar beat and wheat.Three US regulatory agencies  the department of agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environment Protection Agency  have deemed GM foods as safe to eat.But in some European and Asian countries, consumer and economic concerns have led to strict regulations on GM crops, including partial or full bans on cultivation.A study by Purdue University scientists two years ago had predicted that a global ban on GM crops would raise food prices and hit the poorest countries the hardest.But anti-GM activists have cited controversial studies on laboratory animals to argue that the long-term impacts of GM crops on human health remain unknown."

The TRS which promised to take over the company within 100 days of its coming to power ignored it later, he said in his whirlwind tour and day-long campaign in Khajapur, Salura, Mandarna and here.Mr. Sudarshan Reddy said that with the payment of one lakh loan waiver amount in four installments in four years, farmers did not get much benefit. If our party comes to power it will write off farm loan up to Rs. 2 lakh at a time and continue with the Rythu Bandhu Scheme. It will also ensure remunerative price for all crops, he said.New entrantsOn the occasion, some local youth and others joined Congress from TRS and BJP."

Data released in August last year had also revealed that sugar and distillery was the most polluting sector in the state.The Maharashtras star-rating programme, which is jointly run by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India) and few other institutes, has released the latest data of stack emissions for 140 industries across the state.To provide information on environmental performance of the industries to public, the programme gives star ratings to industries based on the median concentration of latest stack (chimney) samples for particulate matter.Among the 140, 26 industries got one-star rating which indicates that the particulate matter emitted by these units is 250 milligrams per normal metric cube (mg/NM3) or more, which is nearly twice the permissible standards. As per the standards laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the permissible limit for PM stack emissions is 150 mg/NM3.Apart from this, about 37 industries have got two-star rating, indicating that their emissions are between 150-250 mg/NM3.Data shows that majority of the one-star industries belong to the sugar and distilleries sector. Most sugar industries are known to use low quality solid fuel. The anti-pollution devices installed by them are also badly maintained, said Ishan Choudhary, the communications and outreach coordinator at EPIC-India.Apart from it, sectors including chemicals, textiles and pharmaceuticals have highly polluting units. This is a worrying factor and that is why we are counting on the public to be more interactive on the star-rating platform. If this happens, both the regulator and the industry will have to show more accountability, added Choudhary.Eighty-two new industries of the state have been added under the programme. Overall, emissions of more than 300 industries are being currently monitored. Industrial units of two recently added sectors  food processing, and glass and ceramics  have also been included.The programme monitors industrial air pollution in 10 clusters of the state: Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Nashik, Chandrapur, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and pockets of Gadchiroli.Apart from industries, the programme has also made the ambient air quality data of over 25 cities accessible to the public. As per the latest information, the level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) was highest at Bandra, Ulhasnagar and Thane."

The Congress recollected TRS poll promise of taking over the factory within 100 days of its coming to power, while the ruling party maintained that it was the Congress which was also behind its privatisation.Trading allegationsCongress said that the TRS regime failed to keep its promise despite repeated representations with an eye on taking over its valuable assets. TRS refuted the accusation saying that the Congress is aligning with the party (TDP) which sold away the factory at a throwaway price to private persons.Established in 1937 by the last ruler of Hyderabad State Mir Osman Ali Khan, the NSF was one of the biggest sugar factories in Asia in those days. Bodhan towns progress is associated with the factory as it has over 16,000 acres of its own land and a separate railway metre gauge line for transportation of sugar cane and sugar.The metre gauge line subsequently was made as broad gauge line for transporting both goods and passengers. A super speciality hospital and school, junior and degree colleges had also come up thanks to the company. Thousands of families depended on it directly or indirectly. The Shakkarnagar area, where the factory is located, and the town and district were economically vibrant when the factory was running.Hoping for takeoverWhen this correspondent interacted with the middle-aged women of the farming community in Mandarna, Salura, Salura camp, Hunsa and Khajapur where sugar cane is grown in large tracts, they said they would be happy if the factory is taken over by the government.We dont need pension of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000. We will be more happy if the NSF is opened, said one Gangavva, who owns two-acre land in Hunsa lying on the border of Maharashtra.DisillusionmentAs the factory remains closed for three years now they are transporting cane to the companies in the border State or to Gayatri Sugars Limited near Kamareddy. Farmers, who reduced the cane cultivation ever since the factory was in the red, are ready to undertake cultivation of sugar cane in larger area provided the government reopens it and ensures remunerative price.However, farmers after a long wait to see the past glory of the factory seem to be disillusioned over the promises of the political parties.

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityNASHIK: The Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) on Monday gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court that there wont be any further release of water from the dams upstream of the Jayakwadi dam till the court finally disposes of a petition filed by a sugar cooperative in Ahmednagar district.The Padmashree Dr Vitthalrao Vikhe-Patil Sahakari Sahakar Karkhana has filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on release of water from the dams in Ahmednagar and Nashik districts, which are located upstream of the Jayakwadi dam in Aurangabad district.The SLP came up for hearing before the SC bench of Justice Madan Lokur , Justice Abdul Nazeer and Justice Deepak Gupta. Following a brief hearing during which the counsel appearing for the GMIDC gave the undertaking, the court posted the matter for next hearing on October 31.Nashik district collector Radhakrishnan B said, In an email communication, the lawyers appearing for the GMIDC have conveyed to the irrigation corporation about the undertaking given by them to the SC. As such no water will be released for now.According to the communication, the apex court questioned the GMIDC counsel regarding the stay on release of water to which the counsel said no water would be released till further orders. The GMIDC, which is based in Aurangabad, has since communicated the same to the Nashik district collector. The plan for release of water  as decided by the district administration in the morning  have thus been postponed till further orders by the Supreme Court.Earlier, the GMIDC had ordered release of 590 million cubic feet (mcft) water from Palkhed dam to Nandurmadhmeshwar through Kadwa river, 590mcft from Gangapur dam and 2,020mcft from Darna dam  through the Godavari river  as per the clauses of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) for water sharing between Nashik, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad.While the Maharashtra water resources department (WRD) had announced its plans to release water from the dams from October 26 to October 31, the programme got delayed given the law and order situation in the upstream areas following agitations against releasing of water.Political parties, including Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , Congress, Nationalist Congress Party , Communist Party of India (M) and others, violently protested against the release of water. On the other hand, the villagers downstream of Nashik tried to block the water that would be released from the dams by use of needles in Kolhapur-Type weirs. While the WRD removed the needles, the villagers again put it back and that would slow down the pace of water flow towards Jayakwadi.Police, meanwhile, conducted recces of the dams and had sought Riot Control Police, Quick Response Teams as well as the State Reserve Police Force teams to be stationed at Palkhed, Gangapur and Darna dams and at the major villages downstream to deter the public from taking law into their hand and trying to obstruct flow of water."

I remember in our lane we had a buaji we were irritated with. In fact, she was the most irritating person in the colony and everyone disliked her. She lived in a white house and one day, a cow pooped outside her house and we put a rassi bomb on top of the gobar.

She got to know who it was and we had a Happy Diwali... we had to clean the cow dung the next day.Diwali plan: These are childhood memories but as I have grown up I have come to believe that people should stay away from crackers as they are not only unsafe but are also causing a lot of pollution.

Every day there would be new permutations or combinations, like Id need these many rockets, laris, anars or bombs. Itd change every day depending on my budget. That used to be really cool. I used to start making that budget two months in advance, thats how excited I used to be .I remember we used to go back to our hometown Udaipur or to Gujarat where my nana used to be and I used to really look forward to that. But as I grew up I started disliking firecrackers and realised we can completely do away with it. Those were some amazing occasions full of memories.

Jankee and I both love decorating our house during Diwali with a lot of lights. We also like to call our friends over; that would be an ideal Diwali, to have friends over a night before Diwali, sit and chat, sing songs. I dont really play cards, so singing, drinking and eating a lot of good food is what wed like to do. We also do a lunch with all the combined staff that we have  both of our parents and us. We like having a meal with them and give them their Diwali goodies. Its a ritual that weve started and something we like to do.

The factory also needs to repair boilers, condensers and centrifugal machine that separate molasses from raw sugar.The facility has four crushing mills each of which require a trash plate that have been procured from a UP-based company at a cost of around Rs 5 lakh. A source said, in the absence of government funds, the factory utilized money from share capital to pay for the plates, which arrived last Saturday, as the mills cannot be reassembled without them.With the assembly of the mills likely to take another ten days, factory officials are planning to commence the current crushing season from November 21.The start of the season had been delayed last year as well, owing to the failure of a Maharashtra-based contractor to supply the adequate number of labourers. Following the delay, the season officially started on November 14, 2017, but production began only on December 6, 2017. Once it started, it was again shut down for a total 850 hours on multiple occasions owing to mechanical faults.Snags had developed in its turbine, condenser, jackwell, and other machines, and a pipeline had also burst leading to the stoppage of work. Of the 135-day season lasting till March 28, the factory functioned for less than 90 days.Despite these odds, the factory had crushed a total of 73,568.55 tonnes of cane, leading to a yield of about 5,700 tonnes of sugar."

He further accused senior BJP leader Chandrakant Patil of attempting to crush the agitation by misusing his power.

Some people are bent upon tarnishing my reputation, he said.The SSS is demanding an additional Rs. 200 per tonne to the current fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs. 2,750 already set by sugar mill operators. In addition, we have further demanded that the FRP amount be paid in a single installment and that the pending dues of the last cane crushing season be immediately given to the farmers.

I told them that Maharashtra is the only state where tiger population has doubled and they have to take it as a matter of pride and try to protect forests and tigers.The tiger trackers of Maharashtra forest department found the pug marks of cubs of Avni in agriculture fields. Nawab Shafat Ali Khan said, ""The pugmarks of sub adults were found in agriculture fields. This indicates that they were hunting for hare in the fields. They are venturing two to three kilometres out. They are zero risks. They need not be tranquillised if they are living a normal life. The only worry is that the mother fed them in the last three human kills. As long as they dont turn man-eaters, it is ok. Even tranquilising causes much stress to the bit cag. Once you tranquilised you can't release them, and it is life imprisonment in a small cell. It is better to keep watch and take a decision."

According to information available with the sugar directorate, sugar mills owe Rs 58.5 crore to growers as on November 16.Of the Rs 9,800 crore they had to pay to farmers during 2017-18, as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre, sugar mills have already paid Rs 9,742 crore. Weve directed the factories to clear the remaining amount at the earliest, said an official.Farmers, however, claim the d ues are around Rs 480 crore. The sugar mill owners have been giving false information to the government and the sugar directorate and misleading people. Why will farmers protest for dues if they are already paid, asked Karuburu Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka State Farmers Association. Since most mills are run by ministers and MLAs, neither the government nor officials have the courage to tell the truth and this is the root cause of the problem, he added.Sidagouda Modagi, state president, Karnataka Krishika Samaja, said over 500 farmers have given a written com plaint to the Belagavi deputy commissioner, stating that they have not got full payment for cane they supplied to mills, including one owned by district minister Ramesh Jarakiholi. Are they all lying? he asked.Growers alleged that mills, mainly in Mumbai Karnatak region had promised to give Rs 100 to Rs 200 per tonne over and above the fair remunerative price in 2017 owing to the steep increase in sugar price in the open market but backtracked when it came to payment. However, an IAS officer said it would be difficult for the government to mediate in such issues when there are no documents to prove claims. Any agreement of payment over and above FRP must be agreed upon by both mill owners and growers and it should be a written agreement. Only then can the government intervene, he added."

The doctors at the hospital have also said that in last few days the RJD chiefs health has deteriorated because of an infection and wound behind his neck. He can neither sit not stand due to the wound.Lalu is also suffering from diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney failure. He underwent a heart valve replacement in Mumbai in 2014, and more recently was operated upon for fistula. At present, Lalus blood sugar levels are not under control and continuously fluctuating. Dr Umesh Prasad, who treating the RJD chief, said that spreading of infection in his body is a major concern and if the infection spreads to the replaced heart valve area there is danger to his life as well.Lalus sons, daughters and sons-in-law have met him at RIMS and they have demanded that he be shifted to some other place for better treatment. Rabri herself has never ever visited RIMS to meet Lalu. She has never gone to Ranchi with Lalu in jail.Doctors at RIMS have said that Lalus condition has worsened but not reached a situation that warrants shifting to some other hospital.Rabri also taunted chief minister Nitish Kumar for installing a high resolution closed circuit television (CCTV) camera on the boundary wall between Tejashwis bungalow and the chief ministers bungalow. Its good he has installed the CCTV camera on us but I must say that it is the people of Bihar who are guarding us and they are one who are keeping a close eye on the RJD, Rabri said."

(Shutterstock)China, the largest importer of soybean, is likely to open its door for the oilseeds from India following a tariff war with the US. Beijing had recently allowed India to export non-basmati rice, rapeseed and raw sugar to meet its growing demand.The modalities to allow the export of soybeans to China is being worked out and an announcement from Beijing could be made very soon, a senior commerce ministry official said.Soybean is one of the items on which China imposed retaliatory duties of 25 per cent against the US in response to similar levies imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese products.The trade war is providing a window to the countrys agricultural products to enter the Chinese markets which will help reduce the trade deficit. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling goods worth $250 billion, including bags, rice and textiles. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, mostly chemicals, meat, wheat and wine.China had already cut import tariffs on soybean meals from Bangladesh, Laos, South Korea and Sri Lanka to prepare for more imports from these countries following its reduced purchases from the US. It is buying huge quantities from Brazil to meet its demand.Officials said quality inspectors from China are soon expected to visit India to inspect facilities.Beijing had imposed a ban on the import of soybean meals from India in 2012 over sanitary issues. India produces 10-11 million tonnes (mt) of soybean annually. Indias total soybean meal exports jumped to 2mt for oil year 2016-17 (October-September) from 320,000 tonnes the previous year.Expanding agricultural exports such as soybeans and cotton to China by exploiting opportunities from a global trade war will help cut the deficit, economists at Crisil said.Closely following soybeans is cotton. It puts India in a position to step up and fill the gap left by the US, economists Dharmakirti Joshi and Pankhuri Tandon said in a report.Amid expectations of exports to China, prices of the oilseeds in the country have started to firm up with soybean selling at 3,350 per quintal (per 100 kg) in wholesale markets in Maharashtra, the largest producer of the oilseeds. In the year-ago period, prices were ruling in the range of Rs 2,850 per quintal around the corresponding period. The prices may soon touch and surpass the MSP of Rs 3,399 per quintal set by the government, traders said.Globally, the US produces 40 per cent of the total production and India 4 per cent. The remaining is shared by countries such as Argentina, Brazil and others."

Kumaraswamy after a meeting that lasted over six hours at the Vidhana Soudha here on Tuesday.He said that as most factories have old weighing scales, there were complaints by farmers that they were being short-changed. Modern equipment for weights and measures should be installed in all factories without delay, he said.13 issues raisedPointing out that the farmers had raised 13 issues at the tripartite negotiations between the government, sugar factories and farmers, the Chief Minister said he had directed the factories to start paying farmers the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs. 2,750 for the standing crop (2018-2019) within 15 days in one go. The Chief Minister said that as per the farmers request, the Cane Commissioner had been directed to consider ex-field fixation of cane price instead of ex-gate price.I have told the farmers that in future, if there are any issues or problems, their leaders can meet me directly without seeking an appointment.

They were lined up for over 5 km on the State highway. Though the Athani police had managed to get the vehicles lined up on one side of the road, commuters on the road suffered because of the congestion.Farmers said factories had not paid them their arrears and were now allegedly buying sugarcane from growers in Maharashtra. Their anger was mostly towards a private unit owned by Srimanth Patil, MLA. They also alleged that some followers of Mr. Patil had manhandled a few protesters.Superintendent of Police Sudheer Kumar Reddy said a breakthrough was achieved after a meeting chaired by the Chief Minister in Bengaluru on Tuesday gave a message of the government instructing factories to release all arrears.A team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Ramagonda Basaragi spoke to farmers and factory officials to allow the goods carriers to reach the factory and to start crushing sugarcane."

Kumaraswamy and State sugar commissionerate officials, that they were were upset with the factories going back on their word to pay more than the FRP. The factories had promised this to ensure a critical mass of sugarcane supply before crushing began. However, once the supply was assured, the factories did not keep their promise.The problem, however, is this was something of a gentlemens agreement at best and there is no law regulating such agreements, a senior officer of the sugar commissionerate, who participated in the Chief Ministers meeting here on Tuesday, told The Hindu .CMs promiseThe Chief Minister has now assured the farmers that the government would help them get whatever price the factories had promised them. Strictly speaking, neither the Karnataka Sugarcane (Regulation of Purchase and Supply) Act nor the Sugar Control Order enables the State government or the district administration to enforce any agreement for payment above the FRP. But following the Chief Ministers orders, we have asked the deputy commissioners in the affected districts to issue instructions to factories, a senior officer said.Similar opinion was expressed by Bagalkot Deputy Commissioner K.G. Shantaram.Prices higher than the FRP are part of the agreement between the factories and farmers. However, as per the CMs orders, we are taking a stand in favour of farmers and instructing factories to pay the arrears as per their promise, Mr. Shantaram said.The FRP for the sugarcane crushed in the present season is Rs. 2,500 a tonne. This would be higher for factories with higher output and lesser for factories that produced less than one quintal of sugar for every tonne of sugarcane crushed.Factories in the border districts sensed that they would face a scarcity of sugarcane and growers would sell their produce to Maharashtra, Goa, Telangana, and other States. So they promised farmers between Rs. 2,700 and Rs. 2,900 a tonne. This was paid to early harvesting growers for the first two weeks or so. But then, once crushing was set in order and factories had suagrcane-laden vehicles in front of their gates, they began paying only Rs. 2,500 a tonne. This not only made farmers feel betrayed, but also led to heartburn among late harvesters, commissionerate sources said.Farmers being cheatedMahadev Madiwal, farmers leader from Athani in Belagavi, said factories were cheating farmers and the government.They dont pay us our dues and lie to the government that they have no dues left to pay, he said.Farmers in Bagalkot said politicisation was the root cause of their troubles. Since majority of the factories are controlled by MPs or MLAs, and since they are policymakers at the government level, they exert pressure on the government to see to it that they always keep a higher share of profit, Vishwanath Udagatti, farmers leader told The Hindu .He alleged that the factories always show deflated data on the recovery. He demanded online monitoring of recovery rates to bring in transparency.While talks between the Chief Minister and factory owners are slated for Thursday, the general discontentment among farmers against sugar factories and the government continues in Belagavi and Bagalkot districts. Farmers continued their dharna outside the Belagavi Deputy Commissioners office on Wednesday and vowed to continue it till the winter session of the legislature."

Maximum dams have been constructed per hectare area, resulting in water imbalance and conflicts between different regions, talukas and districts,"" he said.""Our water policy has always remained flawed. Needs of the region were never considered while sanctioning irrigation projects. Political leaders only thought about regions of their influence,"" Lakhe Patil claimed.Giving an example, Lakhe Patil said the huge expenditure on Krishna Valley irrigation projects resulted in water disparity in western Maharashtra.While Baramati, Kolhapur, parts of Satara, Sangli and Pune benefited, other areas like Sangola, Maan, parts of Satara, Sangli, Pune, Solapur and Atpadi remained without water, he said.Lakhe Patil said the Tembhu-Takari irrigation project in Sangole in western Maharashtra, a perennially drought-prone area, is incomplete due to lack of funds.Similarly, additional water storage capacity dams were built in the upper catchment areas of Jayakwadi Dam which, he said, went against irrigation rules.""Additional storage capacity breaks the catchment water which is meant for Jayakwadi in Marathwada.The conflict started because Jayakwadi does not get enough water,"" he claimed.In 2016, the Bombay High Court passed a historical judgement regarding equitable distribution of water and held that water is owned by the state and not any particular district, region, person or personality, he said.The Mendhegiri Committee set up by the state government laid down a formula on distribution of water from the upper catchment area dams in Ahmednagar and Nashik districts as and when Jayakwadi Dam faced scarcity, he added.The Vithalrao Vikhe Patil Sugar Factory and Mula Sugar Factory moved the Supreme Court against the release of water from these dams to Jayakwadi Dam but their plea was rejected by the apex court, said Lakhe Patil.Following the SC order, Nashik authorities released water earlier this month into Jayakwadi Dam.Lakhe Patil added that 90 thousand million cubic feet of water from west-flowing rivers like Damanganga, Aurangiya, Ambika, Nar, Par goes into the Arabian Sea and no efforts had been made to store this water.He added that Mahrashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, with its chairperson being a retired Indian Administrative Officer with rank equivalent to the state Chief Secretary or a high court justice, had enough powers to tackle water conflicts.Ratnakar Mahajan, former vice chairman of the Maharashtra Planning Commission said the previous Congress-NCP government formulated a uniform water policy for the state through which it set up the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority.But, he said, the authority could not function independently while taking decisions on water distribution for drinking and agricultural purposes due to political interference.Apart from the water conflict related to Jayakwadi Dam, there are other ones too that are coming to the fore in the state.Farmers in Sangola, a perennially drought-prone taluka in Solapur district, are demanding that water be released from the Tembhu lift irrigation project on the Krishna river.They have alleged that water is not being released to them from upstream regions of Sangli and Satara due to political pressure.In Nashik district's Dindori taluka, farmers claim the quantity of their produce has declined as water from the east-flowing rivers in the district's western talukas is getting over before the crops gained strength.Farmers fromKalwan taluka in Nashik don't want water from the Chankapur dam, across the Girna river, to be released to Malegaon and Chandwad, the eastern talukas of Nashik and, further, to Marathwada.Officials said despite the general belief that there was plenty of water in the upper parts of the Godavari Basin, drinking water needs had grown tremendously due to rapid urbanisation among other aspects.There are 23 dams in the Godavari and Tapi basins, but put together, their capacity is less than 50 per cent of that of Jayakwadi, these officials noted.Economist H M Desarda attributed the present situation to what he claimed was a plunder of groundwater levels.""The groundwater bank is in negative balance and depleted due to excessive pumping. There is a needfor holistic programme for rainwater harvesting. Rainwater needs to be conserved and impounded immediately, and replenished in the soil and vegetation,"" he said. Desarda also called for water literacy among policy makers and society."

The state GST department has attached the property of the mill.Over the years, the mill has allegedly failed to clear tax dues to the GST department, which was earlier known as commercial taxes department.In a letter, the GST department has urged the state finance department to ensure that the mill clears the dues once it is paid for acquiring the land. The department has also requested that the dues of Nashik District Central Co-operative Bank too be cleared as the sugar factory has failed to repay the loan that it had taken from financial institute.The project is a positive one and would be a boon for the farmers of the region, the state GST officials said.Centre has planned a dry port project on 250 acres in Niphad. Of these, 108 acres belong to Niphad cooperative sugar mill. GST officials said that the factory owners are likely to get about Rs 105crore for acquiring the land.Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), the nodal agency for the implementation of the project, would have to acquire the land. It has already engaged Ernst & Young (EY) to prepare the detailed project report for its dry port project.We hope the implementing agencies will take a positive decision in this connection to enable the GST department to recover the amount, added GST department officials.The mill has been defunct for the past three years, with total dues of Rs 250 crore, including Rs 135 crore of NDCC bank, Rs 36.65 crore to GST department and about Rs 55 crores as pending salaries of workers.The dry port is to be connected by rail and containers will directly move to JNPT Mumbai. Facilities like custom clearance, value addition services like packaging, grading, loading & unloading, cold storages that are required for export of agricultural and industrial goods would be available at the dry port."

One boy in torn clothes intervened with a lethal one-liner: Jhooth bolta hai Modi (Modi lies).Asked to explain, he blushed and couldnt elaborate. But two other boys, Devi Singh Maurya and Ram Pasaya, recalled the lies, which werent about history or politics. They too talked about notebandi, minimum support price, jobs and housing.Their ire is focused on Aadhaar, especially the decision to link the card to government schemes and facilities. Most villagers spend several days taking care of the Aadhaar formalities. First they (officials) will say name is incorrect, surname not added, phone number not linked. Once you get everything corrected after running around, the network link wont be there or the fingerprints wont match. Students could not get admission in school because of Aadhaar. This idea was designed to torture the most vulnerable, Pasya said.The exodus of the young to Gujarat and Maharashtra in search of jobs is another concern.Such signs of anger in the tribal terrain of Dhar, Khargone, Jhabua spell trouble for the BJP because they suggest a rural unease more intense than that in urban stretches.Farmers recall how they rarely got the minimum support price for soyabean and chana (gram), and the crop insurance scheme was a fraud. The Congresss promises to waive loans within 10 days and Rs 5,1000 for wedding of girls appear to have struck a chord.Places like the ancient pilgrimage centre of Ujjain still demonstrates support for the BJP but that may not be enough for the ruling party to protect its overwhelming dominance in the Malwa-Nimar region in southwestern Madhya Pradesh.The BJP won 57 of the 66 Assembly constituencies in this region but even a conservative assessment suggests it may lose 25 to 30 seats this time. The Congress will need a substantial gain from this area to cover the huge gap between the two parties in the last elections.The BJP had won 165 out of the 230 seats in the state with a vote-share of 45.19 per cent while the Congress won only 58 with 36.79 per cent votes. This already comfortable situation metamorphosed into a dream run in the 2014 parliamentary election when the BJPs vote percentage reached 54 and the Congress partys slumped to 35. The difference was so wide that the BJP won many Lok Sabha seats by over 3 lakh votes.The BJP has managed to salvage some of its traditional support base by drastically whittling down electricity bills in urban areas and efficiently implementing a scheme that sold foodgrains at Re 1 a kilo in rural areas.Chandan, a middle-aged employee of a hotel in Indore said: I used to get electricity bills for Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,200 each month. I vowed not to vote the BJP. But now my bill is down to Rs 200. The entire colony where I live has returned to the BJP now.But a section of the BJPs diehard supporters refuse to change their mind. A rich business family, which has two of its members in the BJP, took a collective oath two months ago to not vote for the party. The reasons, apart from notebandi and the GST, cited by one of them: We realised Modi is all hollow words. Corruption has increased and doing business has become more difficult under his regime. My family usually switches off the TV when his speech comes. Most of us will vote for a new party for the first time.In Dhar, one Congress leader said: Ask a poor tribal woman in any village have you forgotten notebandi? She will explode with abuses. Aadhaar is another menace that is hurting the BJP.Toba Ram, a recipient of Rs 2.80 lakh under a housing scheme who praises the Chouhan government, said: That does not mean I will vote for the BJP. The BJP leaders filled their homes and created too many problems for us.Discontinuance of sugar and kerosene from public distribution system has also caused anger in villages.Another reason for the BJPs weakening grip over the Malwa-Nimar region is caste emerging as a factor powerful enough to override the Hindutva consolidation.The Congress has done better caste management and the anger of the upper castes against the Modi government for setting aside the Supreme Court order on SC-ST (Atrocities) Act is helping the party. Various upper caste bodies are mobilising people under Sapaks (Samanya Pichhra Alpsankhyak Kalyan Samaj) to teach the BJP a lesson.In places like Indore, Ujjain and Dewas, many upper caste youths expresses conditional support to the BJP. If they assure us a saner social policy and promise to scrap tge reservation system, they will get our support.Told even the Congress supports caste-based reservation, a youth said: They do.

Vinay Reddy, who walked out of the TRS, are in the fray in Balkonda and Armoor from BSP and BJP respectively.In Jukkal, Arunatara is contesting from the BJP as the Congress has denied her a ticket.Mixed verdictsThe district had given mixed results in 2009 with the BJP, Congress, TRS and PRP winning one seat each  Nizamabad, Bodhan, Yellareddy and Balkonda, while the TDP secured five  Armoor, Dichpally, Banswada, Jukkal and Kamareddy.In that election TRS and TDP were alliance partners. While the TDP contested five and won all, TRS contested in four, secured just Yellareddy where E. Ravinder Reddy won, a second hit.In 2004 the Congress and TRS were in alliance, and the former bagged six seats, and the latter won three.Culture factorsThe district has 17.17 lakh voters with more female voters at 8.94 lakh, while there are 8.25 lakh males. Youth voters aged between 20 and 40 years constitute a large chunk in all constituencies. Over 1.6 lakh new voters got enrolled in the list.As the district borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka, it has a mixed culture and traditions.

Muslim constitute at least 25%. The erstwhile undivided district basically is an agrarian economy with literally no industries worth the name.The TRS, which announced its candidates earlier than others is going all out to retain all the nine seats, while its opponents, the Congress-led Peoples Front is trying to catch up after announcing all candidates. The BJP has also pitted candidates in all constituencies. Though BLF (Bahujan Left Front) is also fielding its nominees, its campaign is low key.Points, counterpointsThe campaign will hot up with the arrival of star campaigners. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has already addressed meetings at three places and Congress star campaigner Rahul Gandhi spoke at Kamareddy. Union Ministers J. P. Nadda and Santosh Gangwar campaigned, while Prime Minister Modi, Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and others are expected to join the BJP campaign.The Opposition mainly targeted its attack on the TRS failures in not keeping its promises of double bedroom houses, three-acre land for Dalits, employment for youth, and takeover of the Nizam Sugar Factory (NSF). The latter trained its campaign on Kaleshwaram, SRSP restoration scheme, 24-hour free power, Rythu Bandhu scheme and insurance cover for bereaved families of farmers.Poll issuesReopening and takeover of NSF, exclusive rights for district on Singur and Nizam Sagar waters, setting up of a turmeric board, Lakkampally SEZ (mega food processing park), withdrawal of cases on farmers for demanding Godavari water for kharif, and beedi workers welfare are voters issues."

Many millet-themed stores, restaurants and cafes have sprung up in localities; close to 10 establishments serve anything from millet idlis , dosas and thalis to ice-creams and brownies.Even the menu at weddings, house-warming and birthday parties often feature a millet-based buffet, say proprietors. Areas such as Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Basavangudi and Brigade Road are on the radar of those trying to popularise the foodgrain.Jyothi Madinur, proprietor of Vaathsalya Millet Caf in JP Nagar, one of the first millet-themed cafs in the city, said 15 years ago, there were hardly any farmers cultivating millets in Karnataka and neighbouring states.The governments support for cultivation of wheat and rice could be a reason for farmers showing less interest to grow millets. They are naturally organic grains and do not require too much water to grow. I visited many farms in North Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to encourage and convince farmers to switch to millets. There was no demand from consumers and citing this as reason, farmers stuck to financial crops, said Madinur, who has set up a processing unit in Kanakapura.Now, people a re attracted to the high nutritional value of these raw grains, say restaurant owners who see a noticeable rise in the number of requests for millet-based dishes for children.A lot of consumers hav e realized that millets are not just for the health conscious. We aim to make them a staple in every home, as it used to be more than 50 years ago. We conduct millet-cooking workshops as well. The grains are an easy substitute for rice and wheat and also more filling. It has a high-fibre content, can stabilize blood sugar levels and requires little or no water for cultivation. The latter is the biggest reason why millets should be cultivated at a time when were facing effects of climate change, said Abhishek Beeraiah, founder of Millet Mama in Basavangudi, which now also caters to IT companies and directly sources produce from farmers in Tumakuru, Ramanagara and Tamil Nadu."

Sugar factory owners have insisted there are no dues and said so in their reply to notices served by the district administration, while farmers have disputed the claim and threatened to resume their agitation.Three weeks ago, sugarcane growers in Belagavi began a protest against delayed payments and stopped trucks carrying sugarcane to factories. They pitched tents outside the Deputy Commissioners office and held on for weeks.This prompted Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy to hold a meeting of farmers and factory representatives, following which he assured the farmers that he would make sure the factories paid them whatever they had promised in two weeks. Farmers were not convinced and resumed their protest till they were pacified by Minister for Water Resources D.K. Shivakumar.After two weeks, however, there is little progress. Neither have farmers got the arrears nor has the government announced the State Advised Price (SAP) higher than the mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Farmers have demanded a minimum SAP of Rs. 3,250 a tonne, against the FRP of Rs. 2,750 a tonne.Farmers organisation have vowed to take up a fortnight-long protest if the government fails to fulfil the demands. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the North Karnataka Development Forum have said they will join in. There has been no positive development. Hence, we are going back to the route of agitation. We will also seek support from other associations, said Sidagouda Motagi, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader who broke fast on the Ministers request a week ago.Meanwhile, the district administration says the factories have claimed that they have no dues. The government plans to convene a meeting of factory managements before the session, scheduled to start on December 10.Three factories namedAs per a report sent by the district administration to the government, three of the 24 factories in the district have not paid their dues. They are Soubhagyalakshmi Sugar Factory owned by Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Malaprabha Cooperative Sugar Factory, and Shivasagar Pvt. Ltd. The last two have now stopped functioning.Notices were issued to these factories, along with others, to submit details of the dues and cite reasons for non-payment. They have replied saying they have no dues to pay, as they have paid as per the FRP. As many as 10 of the factories had paid Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 more than the FRP to farmers who supplied sugarcane in the early days of the crushing season. This was because sugar price was high and the factories did not want farmers to sell sugarcane to units in Maharashtra. The rest of the 11 factories have told officials they had paid the same price to all farmers.Farmers, however, are contesting these claims and have said that most of the factories have dues. Jayashree Gurannanavar, farmers leader, said factories have neither paid the FRP nor any amount higher than that. We have submitted to the Deputy Commissioners office a list of 500 farmers who have not got dues from Soubhagyalakshmi factory alone since 2013. But there has been no action, she said.There has been no positive development. Hence, we are going back to the route of agitation.

Pandu and Gopi Kishan of Shiv Sena are also contesting. Pyramid party and BLF have also fielded their nominees.The constituency consisting of four mandals -- Navipet, Yedapally, Renjal and Bodhan -- has 1.96 lakh voters and women top the list with over one lakh, while the rest are men voters. Muslim minorities have 57,000 votes while Seemandhra settlers have 5,000 votes. Muslim minorities hold the key in deciding the result.Being located on the border of Maharashtra and also closer to Karnataka, it reflects a multi-cultural atmosphere. Mr. Sudarshan Reddy, who achieved hat trick wins in 1999, 2004, and 2009, unsuccessfully contested the last election as he was defeated by Shakeel by over 15,000 margin. The latter was defeated by the former in 2009.The Congress nominee has a fair image and contributed for the constituency development as Health, and also as Irrigation Minister. He played a key role in fulfilling the long cherished dream of Government Medical College in Nizamabad and the sanction of Government Nursing College in Bodhan. As the Minister, he was instrumental in sanction of some lift irrigation schemes on the Manjeera. Governments failure to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory is one big disadvantage to the TRS and people in villages though have been benefited with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos schemes, they are apparently not happy with Shakeel as he has a record of being not available to people most of the time. He is largely depending on the TRS governments welfare schemes and also minority votes. As he has a good team of party workers, he is aggressively darting ahead in his campaign. He is also said to have some cases against him.Reopening of NSF and also Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar Factory, roads, drinking and irrigation water, closure of Yamcha scheme, which supplies drinking water to 70 villages, non-completion of four-lane road from Jankampet to Basar are the major issues in the constituency. A lot of unemployment youth are also there in the constituency.Waking up early morning before the dawn, the 70-year-old Sudarshan Reddy is setting out for campaign in villages and is leaving no stone unturned for his victory. Congress workers are also following him with the same enthusiasm. The BJP is also trying its luck and hopes that voters would turn to it after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths meeting on Tuesday."

Sanjeev Mane, a Krishibhushan Award recipient from Maharashtra Government, is providing expert guidance to about 80 farmers on increasing sugar cane yield up to 100 metric tonne per acre in association with Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited.The project was started by Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited on 150 acre fields located in various villages of Valia taluka in 2017-18 under the guidance of Sanjeev Mane. About 100 farmers had joined the project. A majority of farms have yielded over 70 metric tonne and some 12 between 100 metric tonne to 114 metric tonne of sugar cane.Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandali Limited chairman Sandeepsinh Mangrola told TOI, After the success of the pilot project, we have decided to extend it to another 5,000 acres of land. The yearly requirement of the mill of sugar cane is about 7 lakh metric tonne. With increase in sugar cane yield, we will be able to process more cane from next season.Mangrola added, We had approached Sanjeev Mane and he readily agreed to provide expert guidance to our farmers. Soil testing of all the farms was done and fertilizers, quantity of water and crop medicines were suggested. The farmers followed a checklist and the results were amazing.According to Mangrola, the average yield of sugar cane per acre in Gujarat is 27 metric tonne, while the national average is 21 metric tonne. Valia has become the first taluka where farmers in a pilot project are producing sugar cane between 80 MT to 100 MT per acre.Kiransinh Chavada, a farmer from Borkhadi Netrang in Valia taluka, said, Earlier, I used to get an average of 25 MT per acre in my 30 acre farm. After joining the project last year, I crossed 80 metric tonne of sugar cane yield in the first season. The project implemented by our sugar mill will go a long way in increasing the cane yield in the farms.Sanjeev Mane told TOI, I have been growing sugar cane in my 3.5 hectare farm for the last 32 years and achieving 100 MT per acre. I had visited Israel and Egypt to study their agriculture pattern as well as drip irrigation. I am happy with the progress of 100 MT target in Valia taluka and hope more farmers join the project in near future."

If the horticulture department authorities are to be believed, this might be the very first in Western Uttar Pradesh.The farming of the dragon fruits is being practice here at Salava village of Noorpur area. The pink-coloured fruit, which is cultivated in Florida, Caribbean, Australia and South East Asia was grown by a farmer here in his 5-bigha land. He had started cultivation last year, but since the fruit appears after nearly 18 months, the fruit has finally started showing signs. The horticulture department authorities say that if cultivated properly, it can lead to an income of Rs 1 lakh in one year on a one-bigha land.Talking to TOI, Adesh Kumar who is a graduate and first dragon fruit grower, said, I had watched a video of dragon fruit farming on YouTube , last year. Later, I gathered knowledge about the crop, its market and profit. I contacted a Maharashtra-based NGO, which provided me dragon fruits plant for Rs 50 to Rs 80 per piece.I had carried it here from Maharashtra and developed infrastructure for the crop. First, I had installed cemented pillar in the fields and put a cemented wheel on the top of the pillar. The plant of the fruit develops in the shape of vine which climbs up the pillar. Around 400 plants were installed in the area of five-bigha land. I have spent around Rs 5 to 6 lakh to develop infrastructure and install plants in five bigha of agriculture land here, Adesh Kumar said.He further said. The plant starts bearing fruits after 18 months of installing plants. First year, it bears less fruits but later its numbers get increased. It is a season crop and bears fruits for 15 years. If all things go well, farmers can earn Rs 1 lakh in a year from one-bigha land by practicing farming of dragon fruits after deducting all expenses.Stating about the use of dragon fruits, he claims, Dragon fruit is beneficial for the consumers. It maintains cholesterol and sugar in the body and increases platelets in the blood. It costs between Rs 50 to 100 in the market. It is sold in metro cities of India and demand is increasing fast.Talking to TOI, district horticulture officer of Bijnor district Narpal Malik said, Adesh is the first dragon fruit grower in West UP. I have visited his fields. The crop is growing very well and started bearing some fruits. The climate of Bijnor seems to be conducive for dragon fruit crop. Our department will felicitated him for growing this crop successfully. Other farmers will also be motivated for adopting such type of technique and new crop. Kumar presented an example for the farmers who are doing only traditional farming such as sugarcane, wheat and paddy."

He said that an expert from Maharashtra has been called in to solve the issues.The factory had commenced crushing from Thursday after the revocation of closure directives laid by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in New Delhi. the factory that was practically started the sugarcane crushing from Thursday was expecting that the production could coincide with the formal function slated to be held on Saturday. However as the factory failed to take the pressure, the authorities have decided to cancel the scheduled programme.Morajkar said the next date of the formal function would be decided once the factory fits to take pressure and the cane crushing rate stabilizes.Rajendra Dessai, president of the Sugarcane Farmers Association of Goa has expressed unhappiness over the factory condition. He said that the technical stoppage of the factory would create worry among the canes cultivator as most of the farmers are directly dependent on the crop income.Goan local farmers cultivate about 45 to 60 thousand MT canes and the farmers are solely dependent on the factory to crush their canes.A source has revealed that the Sanjivani is the only hope to the Goan canes as the other state sugar factories does not prefer Goa canes as they are low in sugar content.

We need to change our thinking and shift to sustainable planning, said Chitale.Delivering the presidential address, Chitale said that places like Nasik, Shiroor and Lankani, by creating water consciousness in people, have managed to lessen their problems to a great extent. He also spoke about how despite receiving regular rainfall, Nagpur is unable to retain it due to the high evaporation rate.In the olden days to store water people used kalash which had a wide base. The advantage of kalash was that due to its narrow opening the rate of evaporation was fairly low.Delivering the keynote address, Satyajit Bhatkal, CEO of Paani Foundation, said, Dams have cost the country an exorbitant amount, displaced millions of people as well as reduced rivers to barely flowing water bodies. In fact, even after housing 40% of the countrys dams, only 25% cultivable land in Maharashtra get regular supply of water.He brought to the forefront the fact how Earth, also known as the Blue Planet, is the only life source in the wide galaxy due to two major factors  its atmosphere and flowing water. He also pointed out how dams, states, districts are also fighting each other for the same water, and many of them have even taken matters to the Supreme Court for the same.Bhatkal called social fracture as well as climate change as the two reasons why there are so many water problems and why the solutions do not spread faster.The chief guest of the programme was Pramod Yeole, pro-VC of Nagpur University. The programme aims to educate people about wide topics like the actions of Supreme Court on water pollution in India, water issues from a socio-economic aspect along with subjects closer to home like a comparative study on Ambazari Lake and Futala Lake."
