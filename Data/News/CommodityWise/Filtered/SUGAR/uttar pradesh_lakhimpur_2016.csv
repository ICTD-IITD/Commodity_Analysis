He was speaking after launching a project to widen National Highway 24.Modi, who was addressing a well-attended rally, did not name Congress but there were scarcely any doubt who he was referring to. The PM said the party that has ruled for 50-60 years and has given a dozen of PMs is expected to know better about governance, role of Parliament and its functioning. ""They have a greater responsibility to ensure that their own political reasons should not come in the way of the country's development,"" he said.Congress stopped the Rajya Sabha from functioning during the just-concluded winter session by launching protests over the summons issued by a Delhi court to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul and towards the end on other issues.Referring to his government's decision (which kicks in from Friday) to abolish interviews for class III and Class -IV jobs in government as ""gift to the youth"" as it would help eliminate corruption in recruitment, Modi said the priority of the government is to work for people who voted it to power. He appealed to the state governments to do this as well. He said BJP was not able to fulfill many of obligations because of resistance to its effort to pass major legislations such as the one related to Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Rajya Sabha where Congress has more members than BJP.""It is unfortunate in this country that our Parliament where laws are made is not being allowed to run...Those rejected by the people have held Parliament to ransom. They don't let it function. We may not be allowed to speak in Lok Sabha but I want to say this in a Jan Sabha that we have been sent to Parliament to debate and discuss and decide after discussion,"" the PM said.In his special appeal to Uttar Pradesh government, Modi appealed to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to abolish the practice of interviews for lower-level jobs because it will promote merit and eliminate corruption.The PM also said the government is taking steps for inter-linking of rivers so that farmers don't suffer for want of rain. Reaching out to the sugarcane growing farmers of Western UP, Modi appealed to the sugar manufacturers to shift to producing more ethanol since global prices of the sweetner had fallen."

They will not be required to do so if they develop indigenous technologies, Mr. Gadkari told PTI.The automakers should encourage indigenous technologies under Make in India drive, the minister said while stressing that nation is battling with the problem of pollution and this could be their contribution to check it.Citing example of Brazil, he said, Flex fuel is available for all major brands, whether Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota, Honda or Hyundai. Flex engine is there. In the same tank you can use petrol and ethanol.Why cant the automobile manufacturers here get indigenous technologies? he wondered, asserting that such an initiative would not only reduce pollution but would help in diversification of agriculture.Agriculture economy is facing lots of problems...thousands of our farmers are committing suicide. We will definitely encourage diversification of agriculture towards energy, power and bio-plastics which in turn would strengthen the hands of poor farmers, he said.He said ethanol could be manufactured from a wide variety of crop yields right from sugarcane to wheat and rice.Promotion to biofuel could cut on huge crude import bills which is to the tune of Rs 8 lakh crore per annum, he said and added this would curb pollution.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 31 had also appealed farmers of Uttar Pradesh to switch to ethanol production in case of surplus sugar production so that they not only earn profit but also contribute to minimise vehicular pollution.

58f11775a3d24b245e595c68,"UP highest producer of ethanol, beats Maharashtra",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/UP-highest-producer-of-ethanol-beats-Maharashtra/articleshow/50460418.cms,2016-01-06,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is here to 'drive' the country, quite literally. India's most populous state has pipped Maharashtra to become India's largest producer of ethanol for blending with petrol.According to a recent data of Union petroleum ministry, in 2015, UP produced 56 crore litres of ethanol against Maharashtra's 52 crores litres. The two states together accounted for nearly 67% of country's total ethanol production of around 161 crore litres a year. They are followed by Karanataka (25 cr litres), Andhra (8.5 cr litre), Gujarat (8 cr litres) and Tamil Nadu (7.6 cr litres).The surge in ethanol production in the state was driven largely by UP's sugar industry. Data shows distilleries in sugar mills, like the one in Saharanpur and Basti, contributed maximum by producing around 4 crore litres each. Likewise, the Muzaffarnagar sugar mill and Mawana sugar mill produced 3.6 crore litre and 2.8 crore litres, respectively.UP has 61 distilleries, out of which 36 are attached to sugar mills. Not surprisingly, all 36 mills chipped in for ethanol production.Of the total 56 crore litres of ethanol production, UP is expected to use 30 crore litre for its own consumption, leaving rest to be exported to Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Industry sources said an increase in ethanol production was largely a fallout of a sharp plunge in prices of raw sugar last year.Industry sources said millers gradually started diverting cane juice for production of the 'clean fuel' that fetched them relatively higher profit. Petroleum companies, which lift ethanol from distilleries, paid them at the rate of Rs 48.5 per litre . This was sufficiently higher than prices of sugar which kept falling following a glut.This got another boost earlier this year when Centre decided to waive off excise duty on ethanol for the financial year 2015-16. An excise duty of 14% is charged on per litre of ethanol.The industry, however, has been complaining of procedural difficulties and delays in obtaining permits/no-objection certificate from the excise department. ""This delays the movement of ethanol, which in turn results in depriving the state exchequer of its legitimate revenue,"" said a miller.When contacted, UP cane commissioner Ajay Kumar Singh said there has been a demand for more administrative convenience by the industry. ""The state government is looking into it,'' he said, while speaking to TOI. Singh said the ethanol was certainly a big sector that needs to be looked into.Centre in August had decided to boost ethanol production by making 10% blending with petrol mandatory in its efforts to resolve the sugar imbroglio. UP government too is reported to have been mulling to adopt a concept wherein part of cane juice may be diverted for production of ethanol."

At present, the godowns of Food Corporation of India (FCI) is done by the state governments, said the union minister. Talking about the bill to amend the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which is 30 year old, Food minister said that the union government is making sincere efforts to amend the bill which is at present with the standing committee after getting passed from the Lok Sabha. Once the standing committee clears the bill, it will go to the Raj Sabha for approval. On getting passed from the upper house, the bill will become an act.The minister said that the government looks forward to strengthen the infrastructure of the consumer court for which the judicial process should be simplified. This will ensure that the consumer will not have to run pillar to post.Paswan while highlighting the features of the bill to be cleared by the standing committee said that if a person makes purchases suppose in Delhi and is a resident of Kanpur, for lodging a complaint against the substandrad project, he will not have to go to Delhi to do the needful instead the same procedure could be done in the city of his residence. Also the consumer will not require to hire a lawyer to fight a case in the consumer court, instead he will be able to defend himself of his own.Further addressing the newspersons, Paswan said that his government is committed to put a ban on the astray advertisements. Praising NSI, Paswan said that efforts would be made to take NSI to an international height for which all required help would be given to the institute."

58f6b081a3d24b0b70c2e20c,Flex fuel policy of government to curb pollution worries automakers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/flex-fuel-policy-of-government-to-curb-pollution-worries-automakers/article8117715.ece,2016-01-18,"Prior to launching a policy on flexi-fuel cars, the government should consider carefully its many ramifications across industries and sectors.India can soon expect a policy on flexible-fuel cars, cars that can run on bio-ethanol and petrol, or a blend of both. The government is expected to make an announcement before January 26, according to Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.The move to flex-fuels will decrease pollution and encourage a diversion in the sugar industrys output away from sugar and towards ethanol, Mr. Gadkari said at the annual meeting of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) last month in New Delhi.Biofuel production would help farmers by supporting the diversification of agriculture into energy, power and bio-plastics, Mr. Gadkari said.Implications for auto industryA policy on flex-fuel vehicles is likely to affect the automotive industry in several ways. Flex-fuels are widely used in several countries, famously Brazil and the United States, where they are available at the pump; examples include E10, E15, E85, the number reflecting the proportion of ethanol.The technology for the engines that can take these fuels is certainly not new but making the engines available in India (Mr. Gadkari said he had asked Volkswagen to come up with a flex-fuel engine) will take the greater part of a year at least. It requires modifications along the supply chain and calibrating the engine for Indian conditions.Additionally, such a policy will give manufacturers who are already in flex-fuel markets an advantage over indigenous producers, according to industry expert V. Sumantran, Chairman of Celeris Technologies. Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Hyundai are among those who have a presence in Brazil and manufacture flex fuel cars.This begs the question: how viable is running existing petrol engines on blended fuels? While a regular vehicle not especially made for biofuels could run on these fuels for a few years, this is not a feasible strategy in the medium to long-term for several reasons.One of the reasons is that ethanol, unlike petrol, is prone to oxidation and this can cause gum-like sediments to accumulate in various engine parts. Ethanol also reacts with other materials in the car, such as rubber, and this causes degradation, according to Mr. Sumantran.Consequently, if flex fuels are to be rolled out, engines will have to be built for them  and this will mean an additional variant for manufacturers production plants.For companies [car manufacturers], it is the variety that kills them. Adding an additional line of engine variants is not cheap. All this accumulates as internal costs within the company and they do not like doing this unless they are forced or required to do it, Mr. Sumantran told The Hindu . Additional manufacturing costs are likely to be passed on in some measure to customers.Impacts on other industriesAt present, the most obvious and reliable source of bio-ethanol in India is sugarcane. The worlds second largest sugar market, India produces some Rs.800 billion of sugar and supports approximately 40 million people.Ethanol is produced from cane molasses, a by-product of the sugar production process. The governments current Ethanol Blending Policy mandates five per cent blending of ethanol with petrol, though in reality the average ethanol blending achieved has been just two per cent. The government wishes to achieve 10 per cent blending.A new flex-fuel policy will mean a diversion in the production process to support the production of ethanol rather than sugar. The government is keen to increase the ethanol component in this mix partly because the sugar industry has an excess supply problem and consequently sugar prices are depressed. Mills are mired in debt to cane farmers.An industry paper by McKinsey & Company suggests that 5 million MT (metric tonnes) of excess sugar could be exported or diverted to ethanol production.If a flex-fuel policy comes into effect, the additional ethanol demand will likely exceed what can be produced by diverting resources from sugar.However, according to Abinash Verma, Director General of ISMA, this demand does not necessarily have to be met via additional acreage under sugarcane. Some of it can come from sources other than molasses, such as cellulosic ethanol, made from bagasse or sugarcane tops, and some can come from improved farming practices or planting higher-yielding varieties of cane.Such differences in productivity are already evident across the country; Tamil Nadu yields 100 tonnes of sugar per hectare of cane, while Uttar Pradesh and Bihar yield 50-55 tonnes per hectare, Mr. Verma told The Hindu.Even if a ten per cent increase in sugarcane yield happens, this would produce 3 million tonnes extra of sugar or 2 billion litres of ethanol, Mr. Verma said, adding that this quantity of ethanol was equivalent to 7-8 per cent of Indias total petrol consumption. India imports more than 80 per cent of its crude oil so this will mean significant reductions in the oil bill.Social and environmental impactsFlex-fuel cars, and biofuels in general, are promoted because they are cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. However, their ability to generate more energy than is used in their production is in question.Additionally, an increase in bio-ethanol production has also raised concerns about food security, farmers livelihoods and the environment, including water usage.The National Policy on Biofuels (2009) , which directs the nations overall approach to biofuels, says these fuels will be produced using non-food feedstock (source materials) on wastelands, thereby allowing India to stay clear of the traditional food versus energy security debate that other countries have had to deal with.This claim is a hard-sell for some, such as P. Sainath, founder of the Peoples Archive of Rural India and an expert on famine and hunger. He does not believe these claims, saying there are no conclusive studies that can say categorically that food crop lands have not been encroached on in the past.Memories of Indias infamous and unsuccessful experiment with jatropha  a plant used to produce bio-diesel and promoted by the government across the country, are still fresh. The purported ability of the weed to grow on wastelands and its drought-resistant properties were not reflected in the ground realties of its commercial cultivation and the programme was not successful.Water shortages too are a problem, especially when it comes to sugarcane. Maharashtra for one just does not have enough water, with the Marathwada region already in the middle of a drought, Mr. Sainath said.Sugarcane is the largest water-guzzler we have, he said, adding that sugarcane farms constitute 6 per cent of land use but consume 70 per cent of the irrigation water in the State.Well-considered policy neededIt seems that a clear and well-considered policy, based on a considered approach that learns from past experience and does not lose sight of overarching objectives is needed, no matter where you stand on the flex-fuel debate.There is no sincerity in developing alternative fuels. This is just a magic bullet approach, Mr. Sainath says.Sugar mill operators would benefit from a clear and well-thought-out policy too. Considering whether oil marketing companies have enough storage capacity for ethanol, and reforming tax structures so transport of ethanol across State boundaries was not prohibitively expensive, are among the issues that needed to be considered, according to Mr. Verma.Investments have to be made to install special dispensing units at petrol pumps across the country and such investments should follow demand for the product, which comes after a clear policy has been articulated, Mr. Verma said.The policy ought to be carefully considered and aligned with the countrys overall objectives in the sector, according to Mr. Sumantran, who supports a larger scale shift towards biofuels as a national policy provided no food production is diverted.I think like a lot of our policy today, a serious matter like expansion of the use of bio-fuels as a national policy requires very careful consideration and planning to be successful, Mr. Sumantran said. For instance, he questions the utility of using more than 85 per cent ethanol in a blend, saying Brazil has stopped the practice for good reasons, and a technical and economic case study has to first be made. Automobile manufacturers also need to be given adequate lead time to comply with a new policy, Mr. Sumantran said, adding, In our hurry to appear to do things, we need to avoid hasty steps that will hurt the progress we wish to make.At present, themost obvious and reliable source ofbio-ethanol in Indiais sugarcane"

They accused the ruling Samajwadi Party government of cheating cane farmers in the State, the countrys second-largest sugar producer.The party, which claims to be farmer friendly, has cheated them by not hiking the cane price, said BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak, adding that the ruling Samajwadi Party government should have fixed the price at least Rs 350 per quintal.SP in its election manifesto had said that price of agriculture produce would be fixed according to the cost of production, Mr Pathak recalled.He further said that an increase in the SAP would have definitely motivated tillers to continue with cane farming.Meanwhile, the U.P. Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA) welcomed the governments decision.UPSMA welcomes the governments step of not increasing the SAP for cane purchase during sugar season 201516 keeping in view the depressed market conditions and losses suffered by the industry during last five seasons, its secretary Deepak Guptara said.Out of countrys total sugarcane area of 49.44 lakh hectares, Uttar Pradesh accounts for over 21.25 lakh hectares (about 43 per cent).However, as per official records, the States sugarcane productivity as well as sugar production is less than the national average.Sugar production in the State is estimated to be at last years level at 7.2 million tonnes in 2015-16.

Picture by Jai Prakash Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday shared the blueprint for implementation of country liquor ban from April 1 before complete prohibition is introduced in the state. Nitish announced that he would not step back from his commitment of total prohibition and would take every possible step for its implementation in a phase-wise manner. In the presence of thousands of women self-help group workers, Nitish said he did not speak anything just for the sake of saying. "" Main hawa mein baat nahin karta (I do not speak just for sake of saying). Many people say that I would not be able to implement the total prohibition but let me tell you that I would do it. It was my commitment and I want to say very clearly to all the district magistrates and superintendents of police that there should not be any laxity in the implementation of the new liquor policy from April 1,"" said Nitish on the occasion of Prohibition Awareness Campaign at SK Memorial Hall. During the prohibition day programme on November 26, 2015, Nitish had made the announcement to introduce prohibition in the state from April 1, 2016. He iterated that he would honour his promise made to the people of the state. Once again Nitish shared the programme of July 9, 2015, in which he had made the promise on public demand that if he be voted back to power, he would make Bihar a dry state. ""I remember, it was the same SK Memorial Hall, where I had made the promise,"" said Nitish. The chief minister said before taking the decision of making Bihar a dry state, he had taken every angle into consideration and the prohibition would be implemented in phase-wise manner. ""I have written to chief ministers of Jharkhand, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to check illegal smuggling of liquor as our state is moving towards total prohibition. Several rounds of meetings have taken place between chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh and Sugar Mill owners. The mill owners have been instructed not to make spirit and start making ethanol which would be used in mixing it with petrol and diesel,"" said Nitish. Accompanied by excise, prohibition and registration minister, Abdul Jalil Mastan, and education minister Ashok Choudhary, the chief minister pointed out that to implement the prohibition, the police and administration are not enough until women participate. He instructed women to destroy illegal liquor vends in their villages. Mastan had announced cash rewards of Rs 1 lakh to women self-help groups affiliated to Jeevika (a government initiative for poverty alleviation) and all organisations that contribute to the cause. Nitish said: ""When liquor is sold through Bihar State Beverages Corporation Limited, all retail shops would under closed-circuit television camera surveillance to ensure transparency in its sales."" He said a toll-free number would be introduced on which women can call to inform about illegal sale of liquor in their respective areas. ""If police fail to take immediate action, then action would be taken against the police,"" warned Nitish. Apart from this, Nitish said he had asked the health department to open a de-addiction centre in every district so that people addicted to liquor could be cured. Before Nitish, director-general of police (DGP) P.K.

The scheme must ensure that a plot is considered a unit to compensate the farmers for their loss, he said.Mr. Badal said that insuring the crop only if the entire village pays its premium was also an impractical assumption and therefore, the Centre should look into these shortcoming seriously and amend them.We are bringing all these points to the notice of the Central government and will urge it to amend the scheme so that farmers, especially from the original green revolution states like Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, benefit from it, he added.The new crop insurance scheme that was launched earlier this month has been perceived as Prime Minister Narendra Modis first significant move to address rural hardship and woo voters ahead of key elections after the government faced criticism for ignoring the concerns of the farmers.Refuting the allegation levelled by Congress that main accused in the Abohar murder case was associated with Shiromani Akali Dal, Mr. Badal said that this was baseless as the person concerned was not related to his party directly or indirectly.The Chief Minister said the State government was fully committed to nab those behind the killing.On probe being carried out by National Investigation Agency (NIA) into Pathankot terror attack, the Chief Minister said that the national agency was probing the incident very minutely and any one found guilty in this case would not be spared at any cost.He said the state government was adopting a zero tolerance towards the issues involving national security, law and order, peace and brotherhood.Anyone found indulging in such issues of grave national importance will not be spared at any cost, said Mr. Badal.The Chief Minister said Punjab was the only state in the country where the entire government goes to the doorsteps of the people to solve their problems through Sangat Darshans.Mr. Badal also refuted the allegations regarding discrimination in allocation of funds adding that opposition was criticizing this programme just for the sake of criticism.Earlier addressing the public gatherings in village Urapar and Wazidpur, the Chief Minister said he would continue to hold Sangat Darshans across the State.This is a growth oriented programme and nothing can deter me from carrying on this exercise, the Chief Minister said.Listing the major initiatives taken by his government, the Chief Minister said it has decided to double the pensions given to people under the social security schemes besides hiking the honorarium of NambardarsMr. Badal said in an initiative to provide better health care services to economically weaker sections of the society, the state government has decided to enhance the existing limit of free treatment in government and private hospitals to nearly 28.50 lakh blue card holders from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000 annually under Bhagat Puran Singh Sehat Beema YojnaHe also said Rs. 540 crore arrears has been already paid to sugarcane growers by government, besides arranging Rs. 200 crore loan to private sugar mills for sugarcane arrears.Mr. Badal said State government has also decided to give Rs. 295 per quintal for sugar cane against Rs. 220 fixed by the Centre.State government was providing free power to farmers of the state at a cost of Rs. 5000 crore every year, the Chief Minister. - PTIDeclaring a village as a unit for crop insurance would hardly fulfil the basic spirit of the scheme"

With no money for seeds and no water for irrigation, farmers have gone desperate, local Congress leaders alleged.With Opposition parties getting active in the region in run up to the 2017 Assembly polls, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said his government would make necessary efforts to address the issues.Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan recently visited the region to take stock of the developmental scheme and Yadav said he himself would visit Bundelkhand.""We have taken a decision on the works to be carried out under MNREGA... In coming times, I'll also visit Bundelkhand. My government will help the region in every possible way,"" the Chief Minister had said.Over a month back, Rahul Gandhi had visited the western UP to interact with sugarcane growers hit hard due to failure of sugar mills to give their dues.The Congress Vice President reffered to Modi becoming ""emotional"" yesterday while expressing grief over the suicide by a dalit scholar Rohith Vemula at Hyderabad University and said the PM should also show empathy for the farmers who are providing ""the food you eat"".Addressing villagers during his nearly seven-kilometre-long foot-march, he demanded that some of the money saved by the government due to decline in crude oil prices be diverted to the region.""Yesterday, we saw Modiji becoming emotional...he paused during his speech (at BBAU convocation) and had tears in his eyes...I want to say Modiji the food you eat, the pulse which is today selling at Rs 220 is provided to you by farmers,"" he said.""I would ask Modiji to think a little for the farmers, labourers and the poor because they too run the country and it is not only industrialists who do so. So, think about them as well,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader sought more funds for the development of the water-scarce region.""During the UPA regime, price of crude petroleum was USD 150 per barrel, whereas now it has fallen to just USD 28. A lot of money saved here can be used for development of such backward regions like Bundelkhand,"" he said.Rahul, at the same time, said the entire money saved need not be pumped into the region, but at least a portion of it can be utilised.Promising people of Bundelkhand that he would highlight their problems in Parliament, Rahul said he has been speaking on all these issues and voicing concern over farmers' plight during his padyatra in other parts of the country as well.Touching on the major issue of migration from this region, Rahul said had the BJP government at the Centre and SP government in Uttar Pradesh earnestly implemented UPA government's MNREGS programme, the exodus could have been checked.Rahul also congratulated partymen ""for standing alongside the farmers and labourers and fighting for them"".Meanwhile, Rahul, on his arrival at the Khajuraho airport from Delhi en route to Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh, assured party leaders that he will soon tour the Bundelkhand region lying in Madhya Pradesh, according to MP Congress Secretary Nitin Chaturvedi.The party vice president tried to understand the situation prevailing in the region, he said.Party workers briefed Rahul on condition of dalits and tribals in Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhattarpur and Damoh districts.Chaturvedi also said that Rahul has asked them to send a report on the state of affairs in the region to him."

Most sugar mills have not even paid sugarcane arrears to farmers from last year. This year, due to a nexus between the state government and mills, the SAP was set at Rs 280. The cost of inputs for a farmer, however, comes to around Rs 350 per quintal. For the last couple of years, farmers have been forced to sell sugarcane at this rate,"" said Agarwal in a statement.He added saying, ""In Meerut district alone, cane farmers are yet to receive their dues of around Rs 200 crore. Several farmers have killed themselves. The government of Uttar Pradesh, which is anti-farmer, remained unaffected. 75% of the state's population is dependent on agriculture, particularly on the cultivation of sugarcane. Their livelihoods depend on it. However, the state government does not want farmers to be happy. We want that the cane price be changed to Rs 350 per quintal.

The mill owners had not paid it despite agitations by growers and promises by the government. It had prompted farmers to commit suicide, Mr. Shanthkumar alleged. He criticised Minister for Cooperation H.S. Mahadev Prasad for delaying the fixing of sugarcane price, even though the Centre had announced the Fair and Remunerative Price.The Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh governments have announced Rs. 2,800 a tonne for sugarcane. Karnataka is not taking a decision only to protect the interests of sugar mills controlled by politicians belonging to the Congress and the BJP, Mr. Shanthkumar said.He said that if the government did not have funds, it should seize 20,000 tonnes of gold lying idle in temples across the country, which would fetch Rs. 50 billion crore. That could be invested for boosting agriculture and farmers income, Mr. Shanthkumar said.Earlier, he handed over a cheque for Rs. 2.53 lakh through Deputy Commissioner N. Jayaram to the bereaved family of Vitthal Arabhavi of Kankanwadi of Raibag taluk, a sugarcane grower who committed suicide at a protest site in front of the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha when the winter session of the legislature was being held in Belagavi on November 26, 2013. The amount, contributed by the farmers of Shivamogga district, was handed over to the widow and two sons of the deceased farmer."
58f1840ea3d24b245e59af5f,"Poor Indian women seeking jobs confront taboos, threats",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Poor-Indian-women-seeking-jobs-confront-taboos-threats/articleshow/50790882.cms,2016-01-31,"On a humid, sweaty, honking afternoon last summer, two women were making their way through the court complex in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut, searching for the office of the sub-divisional magistrate.They walked past the purveyors of stamp papers and affidavits, typists clickety-clacking on stools, lawyers in flapping gowns, pillars of wadded files bound in twine.It is fair to say that these two did not belong. They had the swaying walk of village women who have spent their lives balancing bundles of firewood on their heads. When they entered the office of a criminal defense lawyer, in the sweat-stained broom closet where he receives clients, they were at first so conscious of their low status that they tried to sit on the floor.They were engaging his services because they wanted to work. They lived 10 miles away, in a small settlement where, for generations, begging had been the main source of income. A few weeks earlier, the male elders of their caste had decreed that village women working at nearby meat-processing factories should leave their jobs. The reason they gave was that women at home would be better protected from the sexual advances of outside men. A bigger issue lay beneath the surface: The women's earnings had begun to undermine the old order.It came as a surprise when seven of the women, who had come to rely on the daily wage of Rs 200, refused to stop. The women would have to, the men said, blocking the lane with their bodies. They did not expect the women to go to the police.It would have been impossible  this appeal to the distant, abstract power of the state  if the women had not been so angry.Geeta, the younger of the two, was born angry. Even as a child, if her siblings took her portion of food, she was apt to throw everyone's dinner into the dirt.Her friend Premwati was a more cautious sort. In the tradition of their caste, the Nats, a person challenging a community punishment could offer a defense at trial by picking up a red-hot piece of iron and walking five steps toward the temple. If her hands burned, she was guilty, and would be placed in a hole in the ground until she confessed.They had wandered into dangerous territory, she and Geeta. She knew that. When evening fell in the village of Peepli Khera, Premwati would crouch over her clay stove, rolling chapatis in and out of the embers, and survey the forces arrayed against them. Too poor to afford a house with a door, she lay at night under a thatched roof, listening for the footsteps of people she could not see.Last summer, as they fought to remain in the workforce, Geeta and Premwati made up a small part of a big economic puzzle.In India, around 27 per cent of women participate in the labor force, a figure which is lower than any other country in the G-20, except for Saudi Arabia. Standard models suggest that a lucky confluence of factors  economic expansion, rising education levels and plummeting fertility  would draw women swiftly into India's economy.Instead, the opposite is happening: From 2005 to 2012, women's participation rates slid to 27 per cent from 37 per cent, largely because rural women were dropping out of the workforce. Of 189 countries studied by the International Labour Organization, India ranks 17th from the bottom.This is terrible news for India, as it strains to become a competitive producer for world markets. Economists have put forward two theories to explain the decline. The first is that India's boom has created jobs in segments that are generally not accessible to women, like construction. The second has to do with culture: Unless their choices are dictated by destitute poverty, Indian families seek the status that comes from keeping women at home.The Nat families were just crossing that threshold, and many things were changing. Premwati and Geeta could feel the grip of the local moneylenders loosening; the taste of independence made them bold. In this way, over five months last spring and summer, the unstoppable force of economic need met the immovable object of social control.The cost of remaining in the workforce, they discovered, was very high.At 10 o'clock on a morning in May, Geeta and Premwati set off on foot to the meat-processing factories. As they approached, they pulled their scarves over their faces against the smell, a stomach-turning odor that wafts off tallow-rendering vats and suggests rotting meat. Over the last five years, with the market for flash-frozen buffalo meat booming in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and China, India had quietly become the world's largest meat exporter. The factories outside Meerut were expanding.For this reason, about five years earlier, Geeta and her friends had been drawn into the labor force, supplementing their husbands' seasonal earnings as wedding-band musicians. Inside the boundary walls of the factories, they broke rocks into rubble and carried cement mix in shallow pans, balanced on the crowns of their heads, to stonemasons building interior walls. Some washed meat pans; some assembled cartons; some carried bricks.At night, returning home, they withdrew sweaty, folded bills from their blouses. A hollow-eyed woman named Pooja announced, with some surprise, that her husband and mother-in-law had stopped beating her. ""When you earn money,"" she said, ""you are of some use to them.""Premwati, whose husband spent most days stretched out drunk on his rope cot, felt, for the first time in years, that she was standing on solid ground. With her earnings she married off three children. One last son needed settling. Then she could exhale.Geeta's plans were wilder, more improbable. In the financial cooperative that the village women had formed, pooling their resources and extending loans, she proved to be an excellent, if frightening, debt-collector. She took advances on her salary, which were interest-free, rather than patronizing the local moneylenders. Then, last spring, she attracted attention by building a second house for herself, of rosy, freshly kilned brick, abutting the compound of Roshan, the village's most powerful man.When Roshan, the Nat chief in Peepli Khera, is ready to perform an exorcism, he starts out by asking a coy question: ""Do you want to see the real drama?""Then he trembles. His eyes roll back, he arches his tongue against his teeth like the goddess Kali, who communicates to him through a string of wooden beads that he holds up to his ear, as if it were a cellphone. Nat families come from miles away to see Roshan, who claims to be able to evict the jinns that have inhabited their bodies.In the half-light of evening, Roshan surveys the settlement, his chest thrown out. Villagers live in a few dozen houses arranged around a whitewashed temple. With the arrival of the factories, Roshan's village was being swallowed. He forbade the women in his own family to work at the factories. He looked back with nostalgia at the time when the Nats supported themselves by begging.""Life was much better 20 years back,"" he said. ""It was a nice society. Now women are going out and meeting strange men.""In the spring of last year, after Geeta built her new house, Roshan's son Dharmender began observing her with interest. He noted she wore new outfits. He scanned her friends' faces for traces of makeup. He shared his suspicion that they worked at an air-conditioned site.Their work, he said, had a whiff of immorality.""They have everything: Clothes to wear. Enough to eat,"" he said. ""Why would they need to work? They still have husbands. It's not just insulting to them, it's insulting to the whole village.""It was difficult to say where the rumor started. It concerned Geeta's neighbor Pinki, who had fair skin and a little girl's high, fluting voice. She was married with one child and worked at one of the new construction sites, breaking rocks with a hammer. Some reported that Pinki had been seen riding on a strange man's motorcycle, others that a man from the construction site had shown up at her family home.In May, Roshan vanished into the temple to present the matter to his most trusted authority: the goddess Kali. After a long conversation over the magic necklace, he emerged saying that the goddess had shared a piece of disturbing news. Women in the village, he said, were engaged in prostitution.""If Kali tells us this person is wrong,"" he said, ""this person is wrong.""It was decided: The village's women would stop working.Geeta gathered a war council on the floor of her house. They were a party of seven, including Premwati, Pinki and another neighbor, Rekha. Geeta's proposal was to ignore Roshan's ban. If their female neighbors were willing to quit their jobs, it was only out of fear. The fear would fade, maybe in a month, maybe in two. In the meantime, she told her friends, they had the full support of the Indian government.The government she had in mind was a Muslim politician named Jahiruddin Mewati, who had served as chief of the village of Peepli Khera until a few years earlier, and who was running again in the fall.Mewati's study of politics, especially the tactics of the British Raj, had persuaded him that there was much to be gained  specifically, votes  by inserting himself into local controversies. With all adult men and women counted, there are about 150 votes in the Nat community, nothing to sneeze at in a district where elections are won by a margin of 20 or 30. When Geeta appeared in his reception area, a collection of plastic chairs arranged under a tree, he smelled opportunity.""Nobody can stop them from going to work,"" he said staunchly. ""We don't have a Taliban here. It's a democracy.""Heartened, the women decided they would simply leave for work in the morning. Except, when they did, their neighbors were standing there, telling them to stop.""On 18.05.2015 at 9:00am, I was going for work,"" reads the report filed at the police station in Kharkhauda, signed with Pinki's thumbprint and written in the hand of their sponsor, Mewati.""These people started saying that we were told not to go to the factory, because bad things are happening at the factory. These people became angry and started abusing me and they threatened to kill me. I request you to lodge my report and take legal action.""When word got out that the women had gone to the police, Roshan's son Dharmender was the one sent to tell them how they would be punished. From this point forward all seven women would be outcasts.Geeta, Premwati and their friends tried to wrap their heads around it. As children they had heard of the rite of ostracism  it was used to frighten them into obedience  but they had never seen it imposed. At first they found ways to adjust, avoiding a confrontation with their neighbors by sticking to the lanes and handpumps that had been constructed with government money.A few days passed before the finger of the punishment touched them. Geeta's teenage niece greeted the girl next door and watched her glide by wordlessly, like a ghost. Rekha dialed the numbers of relatives, one after the other, and when she told them what had happened to her, they hung up.Dharmender was astounded that the seven women persisted in going to work. The whole thing was strange, Dharmender said. The women had been offered a deal, allowing them back in the community if they confessed to ""immoral acts"" and paid a fine, but they had refused it. Ostracism was such a severe punishment that dissenters usually relented within 24 hours, paying whatever fine the elders demanded. Geeta and her friends had already lived as outcasts for three months. ""Who,"" he wondered aloud, ""would be willing to suffer so much?""The women, too, were in uncharted territory. Every two weeks, they made a trip to the magistrate's court in Meerut to renew a restraining order that the police had recommended, which would impose a 50,000-rupee fine on anyone who resorted to violence.Their lawyer, Mohammed Yusuf Siddiqui, had rarely sat across his desk from such nervous clients. In his practice, it was not unusual to see state justice conflict with caste justice. One of his clients, who had appealed to court in order to obtain a divorce, had been assigned a punishment by his village council, to spit on the ground and then lick the spit.Still, there was something unusual about these women, who signed each document with a thumbprint. Siddiqui watched them curiously.""They know nothing about court procedure,"" he said. ""They never ask me questions. They just say one thing: 'We are not wrong. We are not wrong. We are not wrong.'""Around the hearths of the Nat women, the ones who had agreed to resign their jobs, pressure was building. They wanted to be loyal to the community elders, but by September, stripped of the Rs 200 a day that had been supporting their families, they were running out of money.Geeta's neighbor, an imposing woman known as Big Suman, surveyed the homesteads one by one with the experienced eye of a general. On one of her rounds, Big Suman spotted something peculiar: A widow with grown children was trudging back from the nearest town with a sack of flour balanced on her head. Big Suman did a double-take. She knew what begging looked like. This was an activity the Nats were trying to leave behind.That morning, Big Suman visited all the women who had resigned from the factories. They agreed that they would take their case to the one person who could clear the way for them to work again.When Mewati, the Muslim politician from down the road, saw the crowd of women enter his courtyard, he perked up. Local elections were two months away and he was feeling lively, like a bear coming out of hibernation. Several days later, at 7:30 one morning in September, he bumped down the road in his decrepit Maruti Gypsy jeep.He parked the Gypsy in front of Roshan's homestead, and a series of Mewati's male cousins unfolded themselves from the back seat, assuming positions in Roshan's yard. The two headmen sat down on a rope cot, exchanging compliments.Mewati assembled the villagers and informed them that the Indian Constitution guaranteed equality under the law. Women could not be prevented from working, and Geeta and her friends should be forgiven. Then he withdrew Rs 3,000 in folded bills from his pocket, enough to cover the fine for Geeta's disobedience, and handed it to Roshan.The machinery of compromise cranked into motion. Roshan's brother sprinkled sugar on the ground outside the temple, reversing the rite of ostracism.It was late at night, two nights later, that the police stationed at Kharkhauda received a report of violence from the village of Peepli Khera.The officer on duty was Subinspector Ankit Chauhan, a babyfaced 28-year-old. Striding down the center lane into the settlement, he noted that there were few men present, only a gaggle of women who had, he deduced, spent the last hours exchanging terms of abuse. He recalls examining ""scratches and bruises,"" nothing serious.Finally, because he saw the necessity for some kind of action, he detained a short, excitable man, one of several who had been named in a complaint from Geeta, a female resident of the village.Chauhan recorded this encounter as a constructive, civil one. Then, satisfied that he had performed his duty, he got back into his service vehicle and left the village.When the sound of the police car had become faint enough, Dharmender and his brothers and his cousins and uncles appeared. Premwati watched them advancing across the village square, some two dozen men closing in. When bricks began to fly, she and her friends ducked inside a house and braced their bodies against the door.Pinki, whose 4-year-old daughter was trapped outside with the crowd, had begun to sob.Geeta had already called the police, and Dharmender saw no further reason to avoid violence.Geeta's husband, Sanjay, was in his undershirt at a neighbor's house, watching a television serial, the children asleep under mosquito nets. When he looked up he saw that the door was blocked by bodies. He recalls the sight of his niece, slumped beside a drain, crying, and a heavy blow to the back of his head, and then nothing.Dharmender felt pity as he beat Geeta's husband: Sanjay was a poor boy, a decent boy. It was not his fault. But the beating was necessary, he said, with a heavy sigh. ""Until someone gets hurt, people don't learn.""Sanjay would spend five days in a hospital bed. On the day Sanjay was discharged, Roshan was lounging with his male relatives on a rope cot outside the temple. He had had to pay Rs 3,000 for Sanjay's medical care and an additional Rs 4,000 to ensure there would be no investigation. But it was worth it.Even Roshan's concession  allowing the women of the village to return to work in the factories  had turned out in his favor. Though the Nat women had headed out almost immediately, nearly all of the factories were now shuttered: China had closed its markets to Indian meat, and Brazil's currency had declined so sharply that its meat was now cheaper than Indian buffalo.So that was that. No one was hiring.Roshan could not help preening a little. ""See, in our community, a woman is a woman and a man is a man,"" he said. ""This is what it is here. Women have lower status and men have higher status."" If any more women propose to challenge that principle, he said, ""we will quietly, politely tell them this is not a good thing.""And that night, as the sun slipped down over the sugar cane, Roshan and the others laughed and laughed."

The contracts are all through Myanmar and from there its just being taken up country.The smuggling of agricultural products along Chinas borders with Vietnam and Myanmar has long been a problem.Chinas sugar industry has urged the government to tackle resurgence in smuggling across the countrys southern borders, after huge volumes of cheap sugar were estimated to have illegally entered the country in recent months.Mr Sawhney also said domestic sugar production would reach 26 million tonnes in the 2015/2016 season, which runs from October to September, and would probably see the same figure for the coming 2016/2017 season.India produced 28.3 million tonnes in the 2014/2015 season. It is too early to tell but most likely there will no decrease and no increase, Mr Sawhney said.Uttar Pradesh will most likely compensate for the drop in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The first back-to-back drought in nearly three decades has hit cane plantation in Indias key producing states Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.One Indian official previously estimated that the drop in plantings for the 2016/17 season means that acreage could fall by about a third after a faltering monsoon damaged thousands of hectares of cane in the worlds second-biggest producer.Mr Sawhney said India would meet its target of blending five per cent ethanol in all gasoline sold this sugar year for the first time and surpass it.We can cross five per cent ethanol blending.Oil companies have never met the current five per cent blending target as ethanol derived from molasses, the thick syrup produced by boiling down sugarcane juice in sugar refining, costs more than gasoline without including taxes.

58f91025a3d24b0b70c3cb5c,"Cane farmers slam Centre, State Governments",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cane-farmers-slam-centre-state-governments/article8250724.ece,2016-02-18,"Holding both the Central and State governments responsible for their plight, sugarcane farmers in the region have questioned the rationale behind the sugar mills refusing to heed to the Governments State Advised Price (SAP) over the last two years.According to representatives of farmers associations, the sugar mills in the state collectively owe Rs. 650 crore as dues on account of not implementing the SAP during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 crushing seasons.Tripartite meetingsThe revenue authorities, who hold tripartite meetings to prevail upon mills to settle dues, are able to ensure payment of the Fair and Remunerative Price fixed by the Central Government, but is helpless when it comes to settlement of SAP.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, Ministry of Agriculture, recommended FRP of Rs. 220 per quintal for the 2014-15 and Rs. 230 per quintal for 2015-16 crushing seasons. The SAP per tonne in Tamil Nadu was Rs. 650 during 2014-15 and was Rs. 550 during the current crushing season.There is a provision for the revenue authorities to issue notices and stall production of the mills if they fail to pay up the dues beyond permissible time, but there is no clarity as to whether the leverage could be exercised for failure on the part of the mills to settle SAP.This was due to an apparently contradictory stand on SAP taken by the Central Government. The Price Policy for Sugarcane released during 2014-15 by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) states that high SAP without commensurate increase in sugarcane productivity would make the Indian sugar sector globally uncompetitive.Stating that such a situation would lead to large excess stocks at home, and high cane arrears, bringing uncertainty and instability in sugar sector, and ultimately its fall, the CACP report advocated immediate adoption of the hybrid formula for pricing of sugarcane, which is composed of revenue sharing principle dovetailed with some Minimum FRP (MFRP).The revenue sharing principle will be to distribute the total revenue generated in the cane-sugar value chain from sugar and its first stage by-products (molasses, bagasse and press mud) produced from a quintal of sugarcane, between farmers and millers in the ratio of their relative costs (70:30) incurred in producing sugarcane and converting that sugarcane into sugar and by-products. If the value of by-products is loaded on the value of sugar, then this ratio comes to 75:25.UncertaintyGiven the uncertainty about future sugar prices, this revenue sharing principle needs to be combined with MFRP so that farmers are ensured of a minimum price. Adoption of this transparent and scientific hybrid formula as the basis of pricing of sugarcane will bring greater stability and rationality in the sugar sector. This, in turn, would attract fresh investments with new technology and take it to higher levels of efficiency and growth. Thus, the SAP needs to be phased out as it has lost its relevance,"" the report states.This being the case, farmers wonder why the SAP announcements are made if the State Government is not serious about securing the dues.ImpactThe impact of the downturn in sugar industry was perceptible in Tamil Nadu since the State accounts for one-tenth of sugar production in the country. Tamil Nadu ranks fourth in terms of sugarcane production with 10.8 per cent, after Uttar Pradesh (36.5 percent), Maharashtra 22 and Karnataka 10.9.Sugarcane farmers say a solution is possible to the present crisis if the mills are forthcoming about sharing revenue from the by-products."

Even though trade routes and harbours played a pivotal role in the beginning, when industrialisation was norm of the day, the Second World War really promoted industrial development supported by discriminating protection which flourished cotton textiles, sugar and iron and steel industries.As India also grew with the global industrial revolution, which already finished three phases, getting onto fourth wave, the country is gearing up to be a part of it by focussing on infrastructure-supported industrialisation, which is reflected in the emergence of industrial corridors, where various nodes and industrial hubs, and smart cities are planned. The UPA governments National Strategy for Manufacturing prepared in 2006 and the current NDA governments Make in India campaign support corridors. India started its journey on industrial corridors with the establishment of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) in 2005. It enhanced the industrialisation process between two cities, and various nodes were also established for further development of towns. Besides private city Lavasa near Pune and 24 new cities, the 1,500 km-long DMIC goes along with the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor.So what exactly is an industrial corridor? Besides allocating a package of infrastructure spending to a specific geographical area, industrial corridors help in flourishing industrial development by creating manufacturing clusters and ancillary industries. Besides smart cities, these corridors will be well-connected by road, rail, air or sea.Interacting with Deccan Herald, Grant Thornton India Partner Vikram Bapat said industrial corridors will help in the next wave of industrialisation, as they will ring-fence fertile agricultural land for industrial use, and thus benefit both sectors. By enabling the growth of ancillary units, these industrial corridors will reduce freight and transportation costs. Once GST is rolled out, it will rationalise the supply chain and bring in optimal tax structure, he said. Bapat also pointed out that the industrial corridors will help attract talent in large numbers and achieve 100 million job target easily.Manufacturing-led industrialisationManufacturing is the keg pin of industrialisation as the society is moving towards massive consumerism supported by growing disposable income. India imported $300 billion of capital and consumer goods last year, and if 80 per cent of it is produced from India, it will create massive job opportunities and investment. The corridors will become catalysts in this journey.Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said Indias manufacturing sectors contribution to GDP is only 17 per cent and the government plans to take it 25 per cent in the current year. Cisco India & SAARC Sales MD Purushottam Kaushik said, The industrial corridors planned by the government will not only link smart cities, but will also be the main driver of the pledge to Make In India by ensuring seamless connectivity for industrial growth.Chandan Mitra, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce, and entrusted with the task of preparing a report for expediting projects, told Deccan Herald that the industrial corridor will lure investment and accentuate industrialisation of India. The industrial corridors are coming up along with the freight corridors, which will also connect ports, and will help in the transportation of capital goods, he said. Besides land acquisition and infrastructure development, the panel will look into all issues concerning the corridors financial aspects.Policy frameworkIndias first industrial corridor DMIC got Rs 17,500 crore grant from the Centre and $4.5 billion from the Japanese government for the first phase, which started in 2011. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) holds a 26 per cent stake in DMICDC. But the institutional framework for the formation of node/city-level SPVs for corridors are yet to come up.According to Bapat, there is a need for a separate strategy to incentivise corridor projects to bring in more investment . One idea could be to institutionalise the corridors and create single-window agencies that can cut through inter-state issues and help businesses to set up seamlessly, he said. On the role of central and state governments, he said the model for administering corridors should be like that of National Highways.Rumours are rife that the government plans to approve a proposal to establish a National Industrial Corridor Authority (NICA) for implementing corridor projects in the current Budget.Corridors plannedBesides DMIC, the government plans the development of Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC), Bengaluru- Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC), Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC), Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and Chennai-Kolkata Industrial Corridor. DMIC is one of the worlds largest infrastructure projects and is expected to fetch $90 billion investment. Six states, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, have formed SPVs for the development of DMICs nodes.DMIC Chief Executive Alkesh K Sharma said that they are in the final stages of completing the pre-PPP process, which includes forming SPVs and creating the basic infrastructure like transportation, water treatment, sewage treatment, among others. This work will be completed in the next 4-5 months and by August, we feel we will be able to invite anchor investors to set up their businesses there, he said. In the North East, the government mulls a similar mega infrastructure project  requiring a basic investment of Rs 11,000 crore (not including land and power)  which will link the states of the region with each other and to multiple border points.Multilateral agencies like Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), JBIC (which are supporting DMIC and CBIC) and the Asian Development Bank (which has completed a conceptual development plan for VCIC) have evinced interest in investing these projects. On the CBIC, the nodal agency JICA has completed the master plan, and three nodes have been identified. ADB has completed a conceptual development plan report on VCIC and two nodes have been identified for master planning. The AKIC feasibility study is under progress.OpportunitiesCiscos Kaushik said the Make In India and industrial corridor projects hold tremendous value for the company. The latest report from Sustainability Outlook pegs the smart city market in India at $45-$50 billion over the next five years. We are working with the government on information and communication technology for the smart cities proposed under the DMIC. These include Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat, Shendra-Bidkin Mega Industrial Park in Maharashtra, Manesar Bawal Investment Region in Haryana and Khushkhera Bhiwadi Neemrana Investment Region in Rajasthan, he said.Indo-German Chamber of Commerce Director General Bernhard Steinruecke said that German companies are not looking at large investment in the corridor but only parts of that. We have been looking at Mumbai-Bengaluru corridor and looking at its feasibility study. I came to know that there is a competition between the UK and Germany in this project, he said.Scope for IndustrialisationIndia imported $300 billion of capital and consumer goods last year, and if 80 per cent of it is produced from India, it will create massive job opportunities and investment. The corridors will become catalyst in this journey.But to make the corridors successful, we have to be part of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which will be shaped by a fresh wave of innovation in areas such as smart robotics, materials that are lighter and tougher, and a manufacturing process built around 3D printing and analytics.Here we have to come up with new technologies, new products, new brands and enter new markets so that Make in India will become a grand success. Even though we have entrepreneurs who have performed well, we need strategic alliances with countries like the US, Britain, Germany, Japan, Korea and Taiwan to emulate and correct ourselves to go ahead.DIPP secretary Amitabh Kant said, Industrial corridors will help in many layers of manufacturing, from Industry 4.0 to labour intensive manufacturing, which will bring largescale investment, employment opportunity, productivity gains, said Kant.Massive investment in industrial corridor will pave the way for large human displacement and destruction of fertile agricultural land. According to economist Joseph Schumpeters Creative Destruction Theory, an entrepreneurs introduction of radical innovation into the system will bring in creative destruction of economic value and it will really force sustained long-term economic growth. Let us believe Schumpeter and industrial corridors will help Indias efforts to lead the world in the fourth wave of industrial revolution."

So, the same variety of crop is being cultivated in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha too.Switch to new varietyRam felt that in the case of Karnataka, barring minor variations due to climatic factors, there is not much change in the scenario. The reason being, no variety change ever since the existing variety (CO 62175) was introduced in the year 1962. The area of cultivation is more than 60 per cent and its time to switch over to a new variety to improve the yield and also sugar recovery, he said.Effective management of soil health and also measures to check pests are other factors that would help in better cultivation of sugar cane, Ram added.R B Khandagave from S Nijalingappa Sugar Institute, Belagavi advised to take a cue from Australia, where the thrust is on technology and adoption of minimal recommendations in managing fertility of the soil. Khandagave said, to ensure better margins in sugar cane farming, two priorities should be followed  judicious use of soil and water and bringing down the production cost. In the case of soil and water management, Australia would be a better model by incorporating technologies, while solar pumpsets would help reduce production cost.Director, Research, University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru, T Sheshadri blamed impartial adoption of technologies in the realm as the major reason for problems plaguing sugar cane farmers. The farmers have failed to fully explore the potential. As a result, there is no change in the extent of production in the last five years, that can be recorded at 450 tonnes per hectare.Sheshadri pointed out, usage of local seeds, deterioration in soil health, non-adoption of organic manure, green manure and inter-cropping system and also failure in management of trash and poor drainage system, especially in low-lying areas, are among the causes that have resulted in farmers incurring loss in sugar cane cultivation.MCC Commissioner C G Betsurmath released the compendium on sugar cane cultivation in the region."

(Arul Horizon) Maharashtra has been assigned the highest export quota of 14 lakh metric tonnes. (Arul Horizon)The central governments decision last year to impose a compulsory export quota for mills would have a double whammy effect on them, say millers.Apart from a loss of approximately Rs 400 per quintal of sugar exported that they could incur, mills in Maharashtra would also fail to benefit from a rise in sugar prices in the domestic market in the months to come.In order to sustain the price of sugar in the domestic market, the Centre had taken a decision to fix an export quota for mills across the country, based on the last three years average production. Maharashtra was assigned the highest such quota of 14 lakh metric tonnes, followed by mills in Uttar Pradesh and other states.Since Uttar Pradesh is a landlocked state where millers have to bear huge costs to transport their export consignment through ports in Mumbai and elsewhere, mills there were allowed a trade-off for sake of equalisation. As per this, UP mills could buy sugar equal to their export quota at existing domestic market prices from millers in Maharashtra, who in turn would export the same volume along with their own fixed quota.As international sugar prices have been lower than the domestic prices, it results in a loss of Rs 200-400 per quintal for exporting millers. But the bigger question, especially for millers in Marathwada and Solapur, is that due to the drought, production has been less this season as compared to last three years.The matter was raised before the chief minister last week by the millers, especially from the Solapur and Marathwada regions, who are expecting a decision from the government to lower their export quotas.Till the end of February this year, around 12 lakh tonnes of sugar has been exported out of the country, of which mills in Maharashtra have exported close to 6 lakh tonnes. Around3 lakh tonnes of the exported sugar was from their own quota while the rest was a result of the trade-off with mills in UP.However, industry insiders from Kolhapur pointed out how this scheme would affect millers in the state, both in the short and long term. The 2016-17 crushing season for Maharashtra is supposed to be bleak with a reduction in cane area. As the mills from Maharashtra are exporting both their own as well as the trade-off quota for UP mills, they would not be able to encash on the domestic market where prices are expected to rise well, said a prominent miller from Kolhapur. Data from the NCDEX index shows prices of sugar in July are expected to be above Rs 3,400 per quinital with October prices promising to touch Rs 3,500 per quintal.The recent report on sugar production prepared by the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) shows that barring Maharashtra, all other states have registered slight increase in their sugar production figures. As of February 29, Maharashtra produced 70.40 lakh tonnes of sugar while last year on the same day, ie February 28, 2015, the state had produced 74.74 lakh tonnes of sugar.Uttar Pradesh has seen production of 53.65 lakh tonnes of sugar till the end of February while last year, it had produced 49.59 lakh tonnes of sugar till February-end. While the cane outlook for Maharashtra for the season 2016-17 is bleak, the same for Uttar Pradesh is good, with the state expecting a good crop.B B Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA), said millers had been assured by the chief minister that they would be allowed to export based on the present days quota only. Export would help in keeping the domestic prices up, he said.However, the official notification about the reduction of the export quota is yet to be issued.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas in its report submitted to Lok Sabha recently observed that 5% ethanol blending and subsequently higher blending in the future can significantly lower crude import. It can also provide new opportunities to sugarcane farmers.The committee observed that even after the government making 5% ethanol blending mandatory and fixing its price in November, last year, only 2% blending level has been achieved so far.It expressed concern that the availability of ethanol is not uniform across the country. It also observed that in sugarcane rich states such as Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, higher quantities of ethanol have been offered in comparison with the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, where no offers have been received.It also said that sole dependence on molasses-based ethanol can limit the implementation of programme and suggested the government set up industry group to look into feasibility of producing ethanol from variety of feed stocks.The committee demanded that the government give priority to ethanol for blending purposes, observing that state governments do not give priority to blending as they get more revenue from liquor sector which too consumes ethanol.It further suggested the government adopt the Brazil model, where the ethanol production is allowed directly from sugarcane juice and the output there is 14 times more than India. Sugar mills from India too have been demanding that production of ethanol may be allowed directly from sugar cane juice during the period of surplus production but the government allows ethanol production from molasses only."

The survey showed the SP lagging behind the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party.While Mr. Yadav, speaking a few days ago, downplayed the significance of the survey, the Opposition parties have used it to target the ruling party. BSP chief Mayawati said the opinion poll reflected peoples sentiment.In his address at Azamgarh, Mr. Singh praised the SP government for fulfilling the promises made to voters and assured the people that the remaining work would also be completed soon. Terming Azamgarh auspicious for his party, Mr. Singh said whenever he had started the election campaign from the district, his party had emerged victorious.After winning the seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP chief made his first visit to Azamgarh in February last year, when he inaugurated development projects worth Rs. 1,987 crore. Carrying on from that, on Tuesday, the Chief Minister, in the presence of his father, inaugurated 38 projects and laid the foundation stone of 35 projects worth Rs. 665 crore. Important among them was the inauguration of the multi-facility Sathiaon sugar mill and co-generational plant worth Rs. 333 crore.The talking point of the Azamgarh trip was the display of bonhomie between Amar Singh and the SP chief. While the party has remained mum, speculation is rife that Mr. Amar Singh could play a key role in the SPs campaign in 2017. The two leaders flew together to Azamgarh from Lucknow.Amar Singhs presence has given rise to speculation he may play a key role in 2017 polls"

On October 8, he had written to the Chief Ministers of all States, including Maharashtra, specifying the immediate measures needed to be taken to alleviate the sufferings of the rural population.In his four-page letter, Mr Yadav had suggested that the Maharashtra government officially declare drought to prise open the funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund, take emergency measures to tackle the water crisis, implement the rural employment guarantee scheme and the State Employment Guarantee Scheme, restructure agri-loans, enhance ratio under the PDS, and compensate farmer for crop losses.On September 30, 2015, the monsoon ended, and it was clear on October 1 that Marathawada would face another drought. Had the government acted upon our suggestions, things would not have reached such severity, Mr. Yadva said, releasing his letter.In the letter, Mr. Yadav had suggested to the government to stop any diversion of water for non-essential purposes. He had suggested temporary ban on supply of water for water-intensive sugarcane crops, ban reopening of sugar factories, regulating drawing of water by bottling plants, stopping unauthorised diversion of water for industries.It is a crime against humanity to supply water to sugarcane crops when there is acute drinking water shortage. Activists have repeatedly pointed out how sugar factories are sucking out water in the Marathawada region, but yet in Latur, water was supplied to sugarcane farming, he said.I had suggested a temporary ban on water supply for sugarcane crop and sugar factories"

But I have seen people also make their own efforts. In several villages, an awareness has been seen with regard to the value of water and in such places, there is sensitivity and a will to do something to conserve,"" he said.He referred to the weather forecast which has predicted that the country will receive 106 per cent to 110 per cent rainfall during this Monsoon and said such good news always brings peace.""But this news brings new awareness also...While the news about good rainfall brings comfort, it also provides an opportunity and a challenge. Can we run a movement from village to village to preserve water?... To whatever extent possible, we must save water.""The rain water should be preserved. The water of a village should remain in the village. If we make a resolve to do this, it is possible through a mass campaign. So even though we have a water crisis now, we have one and a half month to prepare (before the onset of Monsoon),"" he said.While pitching for water conservation, the Prime Minister cited how in Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace Porbandar, tanks have been built beneath the houses which are even 200 years old.He also gave examples witnessed at various places, like changing of the crop pattern in view of scarce water and adoption of sprinklers, drip irrigation, water harvesting and water recharging methods.Modi said he has been told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Panchayat has been making efforts to build farm ponds, 27 of which have been constructed, resulting in rise in groundwater level.Such methods also lead to improvement in the quality of water and pure water becomes a reason for GDP growth as well, he said.He hailed the railways for the quickness it displayed in ferrying water to the water-starved areas but said the villagers deserve more praise for adopting various innovative methods to fight drought.""The government's good work sometimes comes to the fore but if we look around, we will see what kind of new methods people use to address the crisis,"" Modi said.Turning to efforts to clean Ganga, he said this process has been underway for about 30 years during which several governments came, a number of programmes were undertaken and ""huge costs"" incurred.""This task (of cleaning Ganga) can never succeed without people's participation and that is we all have to become an agent of change in this,"" he said.""From government's side, several efforts are being made. Efforts are being made to take utmost cooperation of states located on the banks of Ganga. Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organisations with this. Several steps have been taken for surface cleaning and stopping industrial pollution,"" he said.To clean the large quantity of filth draining into Ganga every day, 'trash skimmers' have been put into service at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna, the Prime Minister said.The 'trash skimmers', which clean the filth while floating, have been provided to all local bodies and they have been urged to keep using these machines.""In coming days, trash skimmers are planned to be put into service at more places and its benefits will be felt immediately by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna,"" Modi said.To stop industrial pollution caused by pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry, an action plan has been prepared, he said, adding it is being implemented to some extent and felt that it will also bear good results.He said officials have told him that there has been success in ensuring 'zero liquid discharge' from distillery in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and that discharge from pulp and paper industry or 'black liquor' has been almost stopped.The Prime Minister said there is public faith that Ganga will be cleaned which will definitely bring success.""For Ganga cleaning, people are even giving donations. This process is being done in a good way,"" he said.Modi also referred to the 'Gram Uday se Bharat Uday' campaign run by the government from April 14, the birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar, till today, the day celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day.In this context, he pitched for strengthening the democracy at grassroots level so that local bodies are empowered to tackle issues like infrastructure, school dropout and saving the girl child.During these 10 days, he said umpteen campaigns were run to create awareness at village level.After a caller said there should be focus on quality of education as standards of students are not good, Modi said the concern was natural.""So far, the mantra of 'enrolment, enrolment' has been ringing continuously. But now focus should be on providing good education, quality education to those children who reach the schools,"" the Prime Minister said.While contending that the government is laying thrust on providing good education, he acknowledged that ""it is a long journey ahead"" but said that if 125 crore people decide, this long journey will also be completed.He referred to the budget, saying it provides for giving freedom to universities to excel and compete at international level.""Skill is equally important as education. Similarly, technology also has a big role to placy. Long distance education, technology will make our education easy and in the near future, the results will show. I am confident,"" he said."

Whether in states or at the Centre, where there are different political parties, we must face the situation. We must rise above political lines and face the situation together,"" former Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said during a short debate on drought in the Upper House.Among 11 states, Uttar Pradesh is worst affected followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, he said and emphasised the need to provide immediate relief.While there is no shortage of foodgrains in the country this year, the drinking water crisis is ""serious"", he said.""We have to give full attention to drinking water. Why do we have this problem? We have to think of short and long term policy and serious solutions to address this issue,"" he said, and suggested that the government focus on water conservation and rainwater harvesting to boost groundwater level.He also asked the government to complete 312 pending irrigation projects in India, of which 240 projects are in five states including Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.Urging the Centre to be considerate towards the states facing drought, Pawar said ""every state expects the government at the centre to help them out. In 2015-16, the states made their demand for relief package. Was it met?""""The actual release was less than 50 per cent. I think there should be some improvement (in giving funds),"" he said, and asked the government to ensure that states use relief funds for water conservation.Against the demand of Rs 3,830 crore drought relief fund, Karnataka was sanctioned only Rs 1,540 crore for losses incurred due to drought during the 2015-16 kharif season. Similarly, Chhattisgarh was given Rs 855 crore against Rs 6,093 crore, while Madhya Pradesh was given Rs 1,875 crore against requirement of Rs 4,884 crore, he said.Narrating the severity of drinking water crisis at a village in Nashik, Pawar said people there get one water tanker in 30 days and have to wait 25 days for the next one. One tanker of water meets only 33 per cent of the requirement of this village.""The situation is such that people gherao the tankers and ... Section 144 is imposed to prohibit assembly of more people. People's efforts are just to collect and store water,"" the veteran NCP leader said.Pawar also attacked Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh for his statement yesterday that states like Maharasthra have irrigation to supply water to sugar mills.""I don't know how the Agriculture Minister has come to this conclusion. It is true that sugarcane requires lot of water. ...The minister has impression that all water was used for cane,"" he said while sharing a research report on cultivating sugarcane crop in tropical areas with less water.Stating that the drought situation was ""grave and very serious"", Pawar said, ""in my public life, I have made attempts to mitigate impact of drought when I worked in the state and also at the Centre for 10 years. But the situation that we are witnessing today is more serious, particularly looking at the media reports.""Before the debate commenced, Opposition members including those from Congress and JD(U) took strong objection to the absence of the Agriculture Minister and Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti.""Half of the country's population is facing water crisis. The drought issue is very serious. The concerned minister should be here. It is a very deep crisis,"" JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""We cannot have debate without the minister concerned. You adjourn the House. Let's start the debate when he is here.""Deputy Chairman P J Kurien tried to convince members that the subject was a serious one and the government ""works on a joint responsibility. Even if concerned minister is not here, we can continue the debate.""The debate, however, started after the arrival of the concerned ministers.Initiating the debate, A U Singh Deo (BJD) expressed concern over meagre allocation of funds and the delay in its release to drought-hit states, especially Odisha.He also said there was a huge difference in state's and the Centre's assessment of losses due to drought, because of which states do not get full relief funds.""Total allocation for State Disaster Relief Fund is Rs 61,000 crore for all states. Rs 20,000 crore was estimated loss for kharif season of 2015-16. Where will the money come from? Centre should provide more help,"" Singh Deo said, adding Odisha should not be ignored as it is the poorest state.Blaming the government for not taking serious note of the Met Department's monsoon forecast, he said a new department should be established to look into drought, floods and other natural calamities and take mitigation measures.Expressing concern over the serious drought situation in Maharasthra, Rajani Patil (Cong) said the NDA government should stop blaming the previous regimes for the water crisis.""You have been in the office for two years. It is not proper to shift the responsibility. You give up this attitude fast and show results,"" she said.Patil also demanded more work days under MGNREGA in drought-hit states.Observing how transporation of water tankers to Latur was being politicised, she said ""lotus adorns the tankers carrying water. There is politics in this also. Stop doing this.""To address the water crisis, she sought desilting operations in check-dams, lakes and ponds on an urgent basis and easing norms for speedy implementation of this work.Sharing severe drought crisis in Maharasthra, she said ""I come from Marathwada. We don't call Marathwada now, we call tankerwada."" She also narrated a story of a farmer who committed suicide recently due to lack of funds for his daughter's marriage scheduled today.""We collected funds for his daughter's marriage which happened today. In another taluk, a 10 year-old child who went to fetch water fell into the well and died. This is the plight of Marathwada,"" she said.Sharing the data of rising farmers' suicides in Maharashtra, Patil blamed the Centre and the state government for lack of sensitivity towards people's suffering, saying there were over 2500 farmers' suicides in the state in 2015 and such cases were being reported this year as well.Ajay Sancheti (BJP) said the Ministries of Water Resources, Agriculture, Rural Development should work together and make a long term policy to deal with the issues of drought and floods.Criticising successive governments, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said that India does not have an effective long term policy to deal with such natural calamities and added that the current drought across the country has led to drinking water problems both for the people and the livestock.Observing that the government's efforts in tackling drought were not enough, Sharad Yadav (JD-U) said that government should work on bringing water under the Union list so that disputes relating to rivers can be tackled and effective policies for water conservation evolved.""Water has become a big issue of dispute today and if we do not take adequate steps to check it, the time is not far that we will have a civil war inside the country over water,"" the senior JD(U) leader warned.Rajpal Singh Saini (BSP) said the Centre's work to mitigate drought relief in Bundelkhand was not enough. Farmers are distressed and are forced to commit suicide. In the last few years around 3,023 farmers have committed suicide in Bundelkhand, he added.Raising the controversy over IPL matches in Maharashtra, Saini said such issues bring to fore the stark differences between the lives of the people ""living in India and Bharat"".Tapan Kumar Sen (CPI-M) said the ""deep crisis"" due to drought has impacted around 33 crore people across 11 states in more that 33 districts. Delayed action has further exacerbated the situation of the people and the livestock in the affected areas.Attacking the government over the implementation of the MGNREGA, Sen suggested that the scheme should be properly utilised as it can help alleviate some difficulties of the people. He said urban areas were also severely impacted by the drought situation.Maintaining that the government should work to provide drinking water for the people and cattle, D Raja (CPI) attacked the Centre for failing to anticipate the severity of the drought situation in the country and its preparedness to mitigate the impact.He said the public sector banks have distanced themselves from giving loans to the farmers forcing them to turn towards private moneylenders, which is further affecting their living condition. Raja suggested steps to strengthen MGNREGA, PDS and Food Security scheme to tackle the drought situation.Rajiv Chandrasekhar (Ind) said ""We are a mute spectator to this annual tragedy. We need to move beyond the rhetoric and politics of drought.""He suggested developing short as well as medium to long term policies to tackle drought and create a National Water Management Strategy.Mohd Ali Khan (INC) drew the attention of the House towards the severe drought condition in Telangana, saying it has impacted 370 mandals in the state and attacked the Centre for not giving the full assistance amount as sought by the state government.Basawaraj Patil (BJP) referred to the rising heat wave conditions in the country and said the government should address the issue as heat wave will rise in May and June which may lead to loss of human life. He suggested schemes to save river water that goes into the sea.Chandrapal Singh Yadav (SP) said Bundelkhand was facing severe drought like situation and wanted de-silting of old ponds in the region for water conservation, provision of alternate livelihood for farmers in case of drought and flood and availability of good quality seeds.Bhupender Yadav (BJP) said policies need to be made for conservation of above ground water resources and rejuvenation of underground aquifers.He also suggested that the government make disaster relief norms based on different regions and not for the entire nation as a single entity.Vishambhar Prasad Nishad (SP) said that Bundelkhand has been severely impacted by the drought and the government needs to address the issue at the earliest.Ahmed Patel (Cong) compared the drought situation to cancer which spreads slowly but is fatal. He expressed concern at the prevailing situation and said ICUs were not getting water and fights could break out over water shortage.Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister for his 'Mann ki Baat' radio programme, he said there is need for his government to list the pain of the drought affected people.Emphasising on the need for government to be aware of the grave situation, Patel said the findings of Central Water Commission indicating water crisis were not paid attention to. This issue is something beyond party politics, he added.INLD member Ram Kumar Kashyap said that there were reports that drought had forced people in Maharashtra to marry twice, with one wife looking after family and other fetching water. He emphasised on the importance of planting more trees.Dr Sanjay Singh (Cong) spoke for creating a special ministry which could draw up long term plans and conduct research to deal with global warming and climate change.K C Tyagi (JD-U) sought that loans extended to farmers be waived and said that ""sensibilities have weakened"" as people had the urge to watch IPL at such a time.Balwinder Singh Bhunder (SAD) sought subsidy for farmers to install sprinklers and drip irrigation systems. Vijay Darda (Cong) and Sanjiv Kumar (JMM) also spoke about the problems being faced by people in Maharshtra and Jharkhand. A V Swamy (Ind) also spoke on the subject."

It is estimated that the drought destroyed at least 30% of sugarcane crops, leaving lakhs of farmers in a precarious position.As Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh face major drop in production due to drought, the Karnataka government has also revised its estimates to 30% less than 2015-16 harvest. However, Sugarcane Farmers' Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar says the dip in sugarcane production will be worse.""The drought has been severe this year; 50% of the crops have already been lost. There is no water for the crops to survive,"" he said. According to Shanthakumar, of the 25 lakh borewells drilled by sugarcane farmers, at least five lakh have dried up. And the operational ones are not yielding enough for the water intensive sugarcane crops.While the last three years saw a problem of plenty, with prices of sugar crashing, this year the sugar prices are likely to go up due to shortage. Farmers say sugar prices will touch Rs 45-50 per kg from the present Rs 30-35.""The production has come down by 18%. The next year's production, which is dependent upon this year's crop, will see a possible dip,"" sugar commissioner MK Aiyappa pointed out."

Twenty grams of brown sugar were seized from him.A case was registered against Ahmed at Dibrugarh police station under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.Police said Ahmed, who belongs to the Panchali area of Dibrugarh town, procured the drugs from a woman peddler called Renu Begum. Police are on the lookout for Renu, who is believed to be part of a close-knit network of woman peddlers working for drug lord Elahi Sheikh.A resident of the Kalibari area of Dibrugarh, Elahi runs a drug racket in upper Assam and parts of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. On March 16, 2012, police arrested him from his residence in Dibrugarh with one kilogram and 150 grams of brown sugar. Two accomplices, Bhutu Ali and Nazir Ali, were also arrested. He is currently on the run after jumping bail a few months ago.According to police records, Elahi began as a tailor in Kalibari in the early 1970s and went on to become the biggest drug lord of upper Assam. He amassed a huge fortune through his narcotics trade and is said to be a close partner of Pakhi Miyan, alias Hazi Samsul Haque, one of the biggest drug barons in the northeast.Elahi, now in his late fifties, runs his empire of cocaine, heroin and brown sugar from Panchali and Kalibari. His distribution network consists mainly of woman peddlers and school dropouts. He smuggles narcotics from Dimapur and certain districts of Uttar Pradesh and sells them in Dibrugarh and its outskirts.Dibrugarh SP Bir Bikram Gogoi said raids were carried out in several areas to weed out drug dealers and many more arrests were expected."

Telegraph picture Guwahati, May 8: Sleuths of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) today began operations at Gaya in Bihar and Rae Bareily in Uttar Pradesh on the basis of information provided by four drug dealers arrested here yesterday with over 54kg of opium and 2kg of morphine. Acting on specific information about a drug deal by an inter-state racket, the NCB team here raided a SUV (WB 58C2157) and arrested four persons - two from Manipur and one each from Gaya and Rai Bareily. The four have been identified as Abdul Kalam, Mujibur Rahman (Imphal East), Sohrab Khan (Gaya) and Ram Milan (Rai Bareily). ""Preliminary investigation revealed that the drugs were being taken from Manipur to the north Indian states via Guwahati. Kalam is the supplier while Khan is the buyer. This group seems to be conducting a big racket, with inter-state connections. Accordingly, we sought the help of our counterparts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and they have already swung into action,"" the zonal director of the NCB, Praveen Kumar Deshwal, said here today. The NCB sources said drugs such as heroin and brown sugar are prepared from the opium supplied from Manipur and supplied to various states. Those drugs are also used in parties in metros. ""The drugs were brought in trucks from Manipur. They had made secret chambers in the body of the SUV and concealed the consignment. The two buyers had come by air and were supposed to take the drugs by road from here,"" another source said. The seizure comes amid raids conducted by Assam police against drug peddlers in Guwahati, and Dibrugarh and Nagaon districts. The police seized drugs, ranging from heroine, ganja and psychotropic drugs (syrupablets) during the raid. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi yesterday expressed concern about the drug menace in the state. Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh are the two major sources of drugs and the inter-state drug smugglers supply them to various parts of the country. The enforcement agencies have been struggling to control the menace as opium and ganja is cultivated in interior places in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and in some parts of Assam (riverine areas), making it difficult for them to crack down on those involved. ""Ganja produced in Manipur, Tripura and Bhutan (supplied via Assam) has huge demand in states outside the Northeast. Being the gateway of the Northeast, Guwahati has been a transit route for the drug smugglers. Many carriers were arrested earlier in Guwahati but this time we managed to arrest the buyer and supplier,"" Deshwal said. Sources said the NCB decided to carry out operations in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to trace the buyers and those involved in the racket. ""We hope to stumble upon information to confirm whether the drug suppliers are financially supporting the opium cultivators in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh or not. We require some other information to crack down on the drug menace,"" another source in the bureau said."

According to recent guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for sugar industries, not more than 200 litres of waste water per tonne of cane crushed should be discharged from an individual sugar mill. However, a purification unit developed by NSI scientists can bring down the water usage to 160 litres per tonne of cane crushed.At present, sugar mills use fresh water for crushing cane and discharge the waste water. NSI experts have suggested two ways: to re-use waste water and save fresh water.NSI director Narendra Mohan said, ""Sugar mills do not monitor the intake and the water discharged. In order to be able to follow the CPCB guidelines, sugar mills will have to install instruments to measure the flow of water. There is water crisis in the country and the underground water table is also depleting. The need is, therefore, to save water. First step towards that would be water management and its recycling. The second step would be water purification and recycling for which we have developed a purification unit and the technique.""He said by doing so, sugar factories would not require fresh water all the time but purify and use recycled water.Talking about Uttar Pradesh which, along with Maharashtra and Karnataka, produces two-thirds of the total sugar produced in the country, Mohan said, ""In UP, 700 lakh tonnes of cane is crushed per annum and using the purification unit and techniques, 49 lakh tonnes of water could be saved which is enough for meeting the water needs of five lakh people for an entire year.""He concluded that sugar factories will incur an expenditure of 35 to 40 paise per litre to purify and recyle waste water otherwise discharged in the drains."

FILE PHOTOThe government is considering banning futures trading in chana dal (brown chickpeas) and reducing import duty on sugar as part of its efforts to rein in inflation, according to a top official.Higher food prices, led by pulses and sugar, pushed wholesale price inflation into positive territory in April after 17 months of decline while consumer price inflation crossed 5 per cent in the same month.The ban in futures trading in chana dal would be discussed at a committee of secretaries meeting on Monday but a final call would be taken by the finance ministry, the food ministry official said. Urad and tur are not part of the futures trading market while chana dal is and its prices have been rising. We will take a decision on putting curbs in futures trading after inter-ministerial consultations.The finance ministry would have to decide on this, the official said.VAT exemptionSeparately, to curb the surging prices of pulses, Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan requested state governments to exempt them from VAT (value added tax) and other local levies as it could help bring down prices by five to seven per cent. States have also been asked to rationalise stock limits for millers, producers and importers based on a logical formula linked to the consumption pattern.Prices of food items like pulses, sugar, edible oil seeds shoot up abnormally due to hoarding, profiteering and carteling by traders and middlemen  without any benefit to the farmers.Traders hoard the stock of a commodity in a bordering state where stock limits are not imposed, the minister pointed out, urging all states to impose stock limits in such commodities.Sugar pricesMr.Paswan warned sugar producers and hoarders of a crackdown if prices dont correct soon and reminded them that the government had helped the sugar industry when it was in distress and now that the sector is profitable, prices need not be as high as the Rs.49 per kg prevailing now.According to our needs, there is enough sugar but attempts to initiate hoarding have begun and sugar prices are being pushed up. We will think about reducing the import duty on sugar if this trend continues. The sugar price shouldnt be higher than around Rs.33 per kg, Mr. Paswan said after a meeting with state food ministers.State watchThe minister has written to the chief ministers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, asking them to keep a close watch on sugar mills stock position to ensure availability in the domestic market.Responding positively to states suggestion that the Centre must also monitor the stock position of pulses importers, Mr.Paswan said, We dont want to bring in an inspector raj for this but the government must know the actual position.Higher food prices pushed wholesale price inflation into positive territory in the month of April"

This led to millers running up arrears of up to Rs 21,000 crore.Paswan said that with rise in sugar prices and steps taken by the government, outstanding dues by millers to farmers has declined to Rs 800 crore.Paswan also said that he has written to governments of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu to keep a close watch on sugar stocks held by millers to ensure availability in the domestic market."

No poor man wants to bequeath poverty to his children. I have always tried to work for the common man,"" he said.Development, he said, was the solution to all problems and all other talk was meant to win elections and cater to vote bank politics.With the NDA dispensation facing criticism over alleged intolerance, Modi said his government's ""conscience was clear"" and it wanted to develop all sections of society.Citing Swachh Bharat initiative, Mudra loan scheme, Prime Minister crop insurance scheme, free LPG connections to poor and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, he said these programmes were meant to serve everybody, irrespective of caste and religion, while schemes launched earlier were made keeping in mind castes and vote banks.Without naming the UPA government, he attacked it over alleged corruption and flagged his government's ""honest"" credentials.""How much money was looted. Now I am in government and I am shocked over it as whether people are given chair to loot public money. I had pledged to stop this.""I want to ask you have you ever heard any news that the Modi government had pocketed money? Have even our rivals levelled such allegations? Two years ago nobody had the courage to give their report card to lakhs of people like this,"" he said.That is why, Modi said, his government was observing 'vikas parv' (festival of development) and all his ministers would travel across the country to give to the people an account of their work.Asserting that India was growing at the fastest rate, Modi said only two years ago many thought the country had ""sunk"".""They would say India has sunk and things cannot change. There was a mood of hopelessness while there is enthusiasm today. Earlier there was a mood of unease, now it is about moving forward,"" he said.Speaking about the ongoing electrification of over 18000 villages, Modi said media highlights any gap in the claims made by his government and added he welcomed criticism. Over 7000 villages have received power and UP had the largest share, he said.Attacking previous governments for making LPG connections a thing for the rich, Modi said his government had distributed it among the 3 crore poor families and 5 crore more will be covered in the next three years. The Prime Minister noted over 1 crore families had given up LPG subsidy at his call.""In the last 60 years, the work for women's empowerment like this has never happened,"" he said noting that health of poor women suffered due to burning of wood as fuel.Claiming his government had shown how the poor can be empowered, Modi said over Rs 1.25 lakh crore was distributed among 3.25 crore such families under the Mudra loan scheme.He told the gathering that being an MP from UP he was a 'UP-walla' and wanted to seek their blessings as he recalled it was around this time two years ago that his government had taken oath.As the 'Pradhan Sewak', a term he has often used for himself, Modi said he is giving an account of his work to people.Modi said the ratio of divisible resources between Centre and the states earlier was 65:35 which his government changed and now 65 per cent of the share was going to the states. Over Rs 2 lakh crore was given to panchayats, Modi said, underlining his government's ""commitment"" to development of states and villages.When he had taken over the reins, the dues of sugarcane farmers ran up to Rs 14000 crore, which had come down to about Rs 700-800 crore now due to measures taken by his government, Modi said and ""warned"" the sugar mill owners against treating the farmers the way they did in the past.""We have taken a pledge that when the country celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022, we will double the income of farmers through implementation of various policies,"" he said and listed a host of schemes launched for their benefit like soil health card and crop insurance.Modi also called for judicious use of water, saying adequate amount of it will help farmers against all odds. ""I request you to save as much water as you can,"" he said. Modi is expected to address three more rallies in different parts of the country in the coming days."
58fefe317be9e0420db2af57,Campaign kick-off at anniversary rally,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160527/jsp/nation/story_87901.jsp,2016-05-27,"Saharanpur, May 26: Narendra Modi had celebrated his first year in office under a withering sun, addressing a public meeting in Nagla Chandrabhan near Mathura. That was on May 25 last year. Modi had then spotlighted his government's ""achievements"", using a stock-in-trade in his campaign repertory of engaging the crowd in a Q&A session. This year, in equally blistering heat, he chose a town in western Uttar Pradesh to mark the NDA government's second anniversary and virtually converted the rally into a launch pad for the state elections, scheduled in early 2017. If Assam was a tonic to rev up the BJP after a drought induced by electoral losses in 2015, Saharanpur gave an added fillip to Modi. The people who packed the capacious ground of the Cosmos Green Society on the Saharanpur-Delhi road needed no prompting from Modi to answer his queries, unlike last year's largely apathetic listeners. The Prime Minister had barely said ""Is there a taint of corruption against my government"", when the audience shouted ""No, no."" The purported absence of scams against his dispensation - that he contrasted with the UPA regime ""when corruption cases tumbled out one after another"" - was touted as a big ""hit"". However, Modi's address focused largely on issues exercising western Uttar Pradesh, like the indebtedness suffered by sugarcane growers because of non-payment of dues over several years by sugar mills, including cooperatives and private mills. ""Nothing was done to resolve the issue. My government has cleared Rs 14,000 crore of the Rs 22,000 crore of outstandings. We hope to clear the rest soon. I appeal to the state governments and I warn the sugar mill owners not to repeat what they have been doing all these years,"" Modi said. Home minister Rajnath Singh, who also spoke, noted that several cane growers in Uttar Pradesh had switched over to raising poplar trees. ""I assure you if our government comes, many sugarcane farmers will go back to growing their original crop,"" the BJP veteran, a Rajput from the state and a former chief minister, said. Modi reminded the crowd of a promise he had made when he was elected Prime Minister. ""Prime ministership is an institution created to run a system of governance. My duty is to be your prime 'sevak' (servant). Governments come and go, elections happen all the time. But to me a government is there to fulfil people's dreams, aspirations,"" Modi, whose Lok Sabha constituency is Varanasi, said. ""I have tried to express my conviction in my government's work over the last two years,"" he added. ""In my first speech (as Prime Minister) I said I have dedicated my government to the poor. One step after another we have taken is intended to empower the poor to fight poverty and win the battle. Because no poor parent wants to bequeath a legacy of impoverishment to his or her progenies."" Among the other ""achievements"" Modi spotlighted was reversing fund-sharing between the Centre and the states in order to make the states more financially robust. As Modi and Rajnath emphasised that their Uttar Pradesh discourse would be dominated by development, the congregation signalled its priority, repeatedly chanting "" Jai Shri Ram"" and ""Bharat Mata ki Jai""."

(Source: Reuters/File) The latest data shows that mills have made payments of only Rs 12,201.73 crore. (Source: Reuters/File)At a show of strength in Saharanpur Thursday to mark two years of his government  and also virtually launch the BJPs campaign for next years Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the dues to sugarcane growers had reduced, under his governments watch, from Rs 14,000 crore to hardly Rs 700-800 crore.When I took charge (as PM), cane farmers were owed Rs 14,000 crore. We made efforts to ensure they got paid in time. I can say that these dues have to a great extent been cleared, through different schemes of ours. About Rs 700-800 crore of payments are still pending. I am requesting the state government and warning the sugar mills that whatever you have done to farmers for all these years, now you will not be allowed to do, he said at the Vikas Parva rally.Data from the Cane Commissioners Office in Lucknow, however, tells a very different story.Records as of May 26  the day Modi made his speech  show that cane dues of UP mills come to Rs 5,795 crore, which is almost eight times the Rs 700-800 crore amount mentioned by Modi.Records show that during the current 2015-16 sugar season since October, for which crushing is virtually complete, mills in UP have bought cane worth Rs 17,996.73 crore from farmers at the state governments advised price (SAP) of Rs 280 per quintal.Given the low realisations of Rs 2,600-2,700 per quintal for sugar at the start of the season, the Samajwadi Party administration had allowed mills to pay the SAP in two instalments. The first Rs 230/quintal installment was to be paid within 14 days of the cane being delivered to the factory, with the balance Rs 50 payable within three months after completion of crushing operations.The latest data shows that mills have made payments of only Rs 12,201.73 crore. This is below even the Rs 14,815.89 crore that farmers should have got at Rs 230/quintal rate within 14 days of supply.The big defaulters, accounting for the bulk of the Rs 2,614.16 crore first-installment arrears, include Bajaj Hindusthan (Rs 883.48 crore), Mawana Sugars (Rs 409.58 crore), U.K. Modi Group (Rs 319.20 crore), Simbhaoli Sugars (Rs 288.82 crore), Rana Group (Rs 212.50 crore), Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises (Rs 116.72 crore) and Uttam Sugar (Rs 101.55 crore).On the other hand, the likes of Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering, Dhampur Sugar, K.K. Birla Group, DCM Shriram, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Wave have made the Rs 230/quintal first-installment payments. They still need to pay the remaining Rs 50/quintal, though.So, the cane dues of UP mills against the full SAP of Rs 280 per quintal comes to Rs 5,795 crore, not the Rs 700-800 crore amount mentioned by Modi.The ex-factory realisations of Rs 3,400-3,450 per quintal for sugar will just about allow us to pay the Rs 280/quintal cane SAP. But then, our average realisation for the season (from October) is only around Rs 2,900 per quintal, said a miller, who has made the Rs 230/quintal first-installment payment.Many mills, he added, were keen to pay even the balance Rs 50/quintal: We need some support from the state government from that. They should at least make the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) pay us for the co-generation power that we have supplied.The industry estimates the dues owed by UPPCL against supplies by mills at an average rate of Rs 4.96 per unit at roughly Rs 1,000 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: May 28, 2016 5:10 am"

If arrears to be calculated based on cane price fixed by the UP government which is Rs 280 per quintal, then dues would be Rs 5,795 crore.""The state of UP has allowed a two stage payment of FRP. Till end June, mills are expected to pay cane dues based on FRP (Rs 230/quintal), according to which arrears are presently Rs 2,855 crore. However, July onwards the mills will have to pay dues based on State Advised Prices (at Rs 280/quintal) on the basis of which the dues come to Rs 5,795 crore,"" Paswan said.Giving data of cane arrears for other states, the Minister said millers owed Rs 1,819 crore in Maharashtra and Rs 1,625 crore in Karnataka till early this month.Total cane price payable to farmers across all cane producing states is Rs 60,000-65,000 crore a year.Highlighting measures taken in the last two years to help the sugar sector, Paswan said the government had provided soft loan to millers to clear cane arrears.It also increased import duty to 40 per cent, offered export subsidy on raw sugar and a production subsidy to sugar mills to offset cost of cane price, promoted Ethanol Blending Program (EBP, he said, adding that these measures have helped the sector to bounce back.India's sugar production is estimated to be 25 million tonnes in 2015-16 season, as against 28.3 million tonnes in the previous year."

There is a need of new industrial incentive policy from June 30 onwards,"" CM said and asked the industries department officials to incorporate the feedback received from entrepreneurs in the forthcoming policy.He said, the new policy was being prepared in such a way that it would enhance industrial activities in Bihar. Nitish also urged entrepreneurs not to do anything which could bring a bad name to the state.CM also announced that henceforth the 'Udyami Panchayat' would be held on a regular basis on fifth Monday of a month. ""Earlier, we organized altogether eight such panchayats for listening to grievances and suggestions of entrepreneurs,"" he said. Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and several other ministers were also present at the Panchayat.Reacting to PM Narendra Modi's announcement about boosting ethanol production in the country, Nitish said, ""We had earlier sought permission from the Centre for production of ethanol in the state's sugar mills. But the Centre then didn't give permission on the ground of security. Had Bihar government earlier got permission from the Centre for ethanol production, the state's sugar industry would have in profit.""Speaking at the BJP's 'Vikas Parva' rally at Davangere (Karnataka), Modi on Sunday declared that he would not hesitate to take on the powerful petrol-diesel lobby to boost ethanol production and reduce the dependence of farmers on sugar production in the country.

""We have removed this process for group C and D posts to rescue job seekers from middlemen. They are getting jobs based on merit as the entire process now is technology driven,'' he said addressing his second rally as part of Vikas Parv in Karnataka.To curb the menace of middlemen in the farm sector, he said the e-Mandi platform launched for farmers ensures farmers get their due price for their produce.Modi also said that more than three crore families have got LPG connections in the past one year without the assistance of middlemen. ""We aim to provide LPG connections to five crore more BPL households without accepting any security deposit in the next three years,"" he added. He said the scheme would improve health of women as they won't have to inhale smoke from hearth as studies have shown these fumes were equivalent to smoke from about 400 cigarettes.Modi said the overwhelming response to his call to give up LPG subsidy indicated that the country is not only developing but transforming as well. ""The attitude of reserving another seat in buses just to keep it vacant for their comfort seems to have gone now. It's not the question of money, but the trust between the government and public,"" he said. ""You don't even get a cup of tea for Re 1 today. But people can get life insurance schemes at Re 1 now,'' he added.Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka - the sugar bowls of India - have benefited after the government directed sugar factories to produce ethanol to enhance their profit.

590474457be9e04154df71dc,Nothing Gandhian about prohibition in Gujarat; it’s a British legacy,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/true-lies/nothing-gandhian-about-prohibition-in-gujarat-its-a-british-legacy/,2016-05-31,"I lived in Moscow for seven long years from 1986 to 1993 as Patriot correspondent, and travelled almost all corners of the ex-Soviet Union  from its Far-Eastern cities to its northern most port Arkhangelsk, many of the Central Asian towns which were later ravaged by internecine ethnic clashes and, of course, the cultural capital, St Petersburg. Yet, what surprises many of my acquaintances and friends is, how couldnt I learn to give up my essentially teetotal characteristic?Even the doyen of Indian diplomats, TN Kaul, couldnt change me during his ambassadorship in Moscow. At embassy parties, not once, but several times over he would approach me, saying, This is bad, Rajiv! You must at least hold a glass of wine! I would obey, hold the glass till the toast was over, and abandon it immediately thereafter.Not that I havent ever sipped alcohol. During informal gatherings in Moscow, I did indeed taste home-made wine, as also Georgian and Moldavian wine, rated pretty high. I have also tasted koniak, scotch whisky, rum, and of course vodka However, strangely, I couldnt ever develop a liking for any of them. Id rather prefer fruit juice. And there wasnt anything moral about it either. For, I didnt disdain those who would drink.Once I tried discussing this with a Russian scholar, political scientist and Indologist, known for his non-conformist views, Prof Eric Komarov. And he gave me an interesting explanation. He said, drinking in Russia is part of ones cultural habit, a way of life. I still cant forget what he told me once when I visited his house, situated on way to the Sheremetyevo International Airport: Voda in Russian means water We affectionately call daughter (devushka in Russian) as dochka, similarly mother mamuchka, and father papuchka. So, when we call it vodka, we are just giving a special word for voda or water Its just an expression of our sheer love to drink.I am reminded of this view of Komarov, who became an excellent source of information of Soviet affairs during those turbulent days, as and when someone talks of prohibition in Gujarat. Ever since he told this to me, I have, ironically, tried explaining my refusal to drink liquor as a matter of habit, something which I got from my Gandhian parents. But with the fever of prohibition now traveling far and wide from Gujarat to Kerala, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, I am left wondering if this explanation has received a setback.Yet I have, willy nilly clung to the view that habit is part of culture, a way of life. Imposing prohibition cannot erase it; it would remain in ones subconscious. This is as much true of beef, sought to be banned under religious pretext.Recently, when I was talking about this to a well-known Gujarat-based sociologist, Prof Vidyut Joshi, I recalled two studies which, I was told by a senior official in Gandhinagar, were authored by him in 1978. These studies are on the impact of prohibition in Surats rural and urban areas. The studies, I was told, were classified, possibly because it pointed towards why going tipsy in the South Gujarat region was historically more a way of life, a part of culture, which shouldnt have been abandoned.Refusing to part with the studies, what Prof Joshi, however, told me was revealing: Prohibition, he told me, was not imposed by Gujarat rulers, even though they may claim it to be a Gandhian legacy initiated after the state became independent of the Bombay State in 1960. It is a legacy we have received from the British rulers since 1888, he said, adding, More as a desire to control the liquor market, the British allowed only that liquor to be sold which was manufactured by the government. It gave license to sell liquor to those whom it trusted, many of whom happened to be Parsis. Descendants of those who had these licenses have surnames like Batliwala, Daruwala, Tadiwala.He further said, Before this happened, the tribals in South Gujarat were used to drinking mahua, extracted from flowers of mahua trees, found aplenty in eastern hilly region of Gujarat. They would mix mahua in chapati and sweets. Mahua flowers would be used to incense water. Tribals formed 50 per cent of the South Gujarat population.Similarly, he said, Tadi was extracted from palm trees along the sea shore, where 15 to 20 per cent of of the South Gujarat population lived. They are mainly fisherfolk  Khervas, Machchis, Tandels, Naviks and Kolis. Fishermen would have to remain in the sea for several days, often weeks, and tadi used to be their only pastime during the highly unorganized life they lived. Other communities which had a strong tendency to drink, as part of their way of life, were Ranas, Kshatriyas, Ghanchis and Parsis.Pointing out that the problem illicit liquor replaced as an affordable means to release tension after the British banned mahua and tadi, Prof Joshi said, Slurry would arrive from sugar mills in far off Uttar Pradesh in railway wagons. It was needed for quick fermentation. Similarly, the denatured spirit used in dyes in cotton mills began being used to make hooch.Highly dangerous for health, Prof Joshi said, I asked a worker in Surat city why did he drink such liquor which would shorten his life span. And his reply was: Even otherwise we live in a hell It is better to die in five years by enjoying this drink.While Prof Joshi didnt elaborate on the studies he had carried out on prohibition in South Gujarat, saying these remain classified, I vividly remember what the government official, who saw it as part of his effort to understand how liquor would or would not affect peoples life, had told me. The studies are based on more than 200 interviews of the poorer sections in six villages of Surat district and Surat city.Carried out during Prof Joshis stint at the South Gujarat University, the studies  titled Benefits of Prohibition  A Comparative Study of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers in Rural South Gujarat and Benefits of Prohibition  A Comparative Study of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers in Surat City, sponsored by the Department of Prohibition and Excise, Government of Gujarat  found no significant difference in the economic life between drinkers and non-drinkers in both rural and urban areas, and recommended temperance  lifting of the ban on mahua and tadi.While this was the first attempt to recommend lifting prohibition, albeit partially, during my nearly 14 years interaction with Gujarat government officials in Gandhinagar, I havent come across even one bureaucrat, including some of those who serve in the Prime Ministers Office today, who favour prohibition. Taking an elitist view of prohibition, the thinking has been strong that it has been a major hurdle in developed Gujarats movement towards cosmopolitanism. Frequent attempts were made, albeit unsuccessful, to have a tourism policy, which allowed liquor to be allowed at sea resorts.There was even a recommendation of a casino near the Harappan site of Dholavira in Kutch district in the state-sponsored Blueprint for Infrastructure in Gujarat: Vision 2020, as part of the effort to develop entertainment industry in Gujarat. The entire portion was withdrawn soon after I wrote a story on it. A senior Modi aide explained to me, The chief minister is aware of the need to lift prohibition. But he is helpless. He cannot lift prohibition, even partially, otherwise there would be political backlash.Strange though it may seem, no policy maker in Gujarat has sought to find out what could the social reasons behind poor people consuming spurious liquor, which has become a norm, whether it is semi-urban areas off Ahmedabad or Gandhis birthplace Porbandar. It has led to major hooch tragedies, such as the one in Ahmedabad in 2009, in which 139 people died. Prof Joshis studies are not the only ones which suggest need to allow drinking as a matter of choice. A similar study was carried out, with almost the same conclusions, by the Sardar Patel Institute for Social and Economic Research, Ahmedabad, which once was a major seat of learning, founded by top academic Prof TD Lakdawala in 1965.Studies in US on prohibition imposed in 1920s replicate whats true of Gujarat today. Pointing towards negative impact of prohibition, they point towards how alcohol became more dangerous to consume; organized crime blossomed; courts and prisons systems became overloaded; and endemic corruption of police and public officials occurred.However, who cares for such studies, even if these may help one arrive at a reasonable solution?"

59284fa57be9e0137c77cc1c,The rise and fall of Ram Briksh Yadav,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/551813/rise-fall-ram-briksh-yadav.html,2016-06-12,"Sagar Kulkarni, June 12, 2016 0:17 ISTOn a cold winter morning in January 2014, a lanky, bearded man with a band of supporters knocked on the doors of a monastery set up by his late mentor Baba Jai Gurudev off NH-2 near Mathura.Ram Briksh Yadav, who ranked among Babas favourite disciples, was keen to have his fair share in the monasteryJai Gurudev Ashramthat had properties to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore spread across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Ram Brikshs spiritual master passed away in May 2012 after handing over the keys of the empire to his driver Pankaj Yadav. Another claimant to the Babas legacy, Umakant Tiwari, too, had fallen out of favour and parted ways a couple of months before the Babas death. Tiwari set up his own Ashram in Madhya Pradesh.Left with nothing, Ram Briksh was trying his luck on the January morning to get a toe hold in the ashrams sprawling campus near Mathura. After a standoff with the inmates, the district administration directed them to Jawahar Bagh, which was then the designated spot for protests, given its proximity to the collectorate. Little did the administration know that Ram Briksh, who had around 30 supporters then, would gain thousands of followers and convert the 280-acre Jawahar Bagh as his fiefdom with blessings from the powers that be.The unsuspecting public, mostly from his native eastern Uttar Pradesh, were lured by the propaganda of establishing a Azad Hind Sarkar that would ensure a square meal for every citizen and make available essential commodities at very low rates. To entice the locals, Ram Briksh even sold sugar at a highly-subsidised rate of Rs 20 per kg and vegetables at Rs 5 per kg. The stunt worked as people from neighbouring coloniesmostly comprising government servantsthronged Jawahar Bagh.Invoking the legacy of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Ram Briksh gathered a sizable following over the next few months. He formed the Azad Bharat Vidhik Vaicharik Kranti Satyagrahi, an organisation whose followers called themselves the Swadhin Bharat Subhas Sena. Their major goals were establishing the Azad Hind Sarkar with Netaji as the first citizen and a Azad Hind currency, instead of the rupee. Initially, there were a few huts, but as the followers increased, Ram Briksh established his own parallel administration complete with arms training camps and a justice delivery system, said Vijay Singh, an engineering student in the Jail Colony next to Jawahar Bagh.Luring debt-riddenAccording to the police, most of the inmatesthere were nearly 3,000 of them at the time of eviction on June 2were from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Many of them were in deep debts due to a bad harvest and the assurance of food and other essentials lured them to Jawahar Bagh. But they soon realised the going was not easy. Once inside Jawahar Bagh, the inmates could go out depending on the wishes of Ram Briksh and only after leaving behind a family member as ransom.For the residents of the surrounding colonies, the daily sermons by Ram Briksh over the public address system became a headache. The allurement of cheap sugar and vegetables was soon replaced with regular argument with the inmates, their leader often charging at the locals menacingly surrounded by lathi-wielding followers. Soon, they had the sprawling 280-acre orchard under their control and the favourite morning walk destination of the locals saw children of inmates being trained in warfare and parades by arms-wielding men on roads leading to the settlement.Surprisingly, these poor people had very affluent friends. We saw people coming in fancy cars and SUVs to meet Ram Briksh, said Vijay Sharma, a government employee residing in one of the colonies surrounding Jawahar Bagh. But as friction with the locals increased, the former president of the Mathura Bar Association, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, got an eviction order from the Allahabad High Court.The local intelligence unit sent reports to Lucknow about arms training inside Jawahar Bagh and the possibility of links with the Maoists. But the administration was not particularly tough against the squatters, prompting accusations against the Samajwadi Party government of shielding them. The proverbial last straw was the attack on the Horticulture Department employees residing inside Jawahar Bagh in the middle of March. Their strong protests spurred the district administration into action. Already under pressure from the Allahabad High Court, the state government also fell in line.The end, however, was ugly. After adequate warnings to Ram Briksh, the district administration finalised June 3 for forcible eviction. A day earlier, SP (City) Mukul Dwivedi, along with Station Officer Santosh Yadav, visited the area to carry out a rehearsal of the action planned for the next day. As they approached Jawahar Bagh, Ram Brikshs followers showered bullets and stones at the police. Dwivedi, who was injured in the stone throwing, was lynched by Ram Brikshs followers, while Santosh Yadav suffered a fatal bullet injury. In the police firing that followed, 27 people were killed, including Ram Briksh."
59284ac77be9e0137c77c8ad,'Unholy' nexus rears its ugly head again,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/551815/unholy-nexus-rears-its-ugly.html,2016-06-12,"Manoj Dixit, June 12, 2016 0:19 ISTThere is a strong perception that the Uttar Pradesh government deliberately allowed self-styled godman Ram Briksh Yadav to stay on in Mathura, but things went out of its hands leading violence and loss of lives.When the Centrally-appointed N N Vohra committee submitted its report in 1993 on the purported nexus among politicians, bureaucrats and criminals in which he made several observations on the criminal network which was virtually running a parallel government, he had no idea that this report will never see the floor of Parliament. The report also discussed criminal gangs who enjoyed the patronage of politicians of all parties and the protection by government functionaries. It revealed that political leaders had become the leaders of gangs. Over the years, criminals had been elected to local bodies, Assemblies and Parliament.Vohra was actually referring to gangs of criminals which were becoming important to politicians of all shades and colourssome openly and others covertly. Over the last two decades, criminals have jumped into the fray and started getting into law-making bodies. They have started taking all routes to organise and create gangs and also senas in the name of protecting the gang leader.One of the latest routes, and the safest now, was to organise in the name of religion. The emergence of electronic media gave them even more strength than it would have been otherwise. Several gangsters own channels today to propagate their ideas and increase following and of course money. The emergence of Asaram Bapu is one such example. But the emergence of a boy from a Haryana village who played dholaks at weddings to being Baba Rampal was the turning point. Rampals rise was not because of his religious or spiritual greatness, but because of his ability to impress and affect local politics. All politicians were making a beeline before his ashram for support. This emboldened him to become a law unto himself.Ram Briksh Yadav joined Baba Jai Gurudev, the founder-leader of a cult, in 1972 and had even gone to jail with him during Emergency. Yadav was involved in an internecine conflict with two other groups of Babas followers over the control of the cults property valued more than Rs 10,000 crore. The Samajwadi Party (SP) saw an opportunity in him and started giving him socio-political support. Its startling that Ram Briksh was drawing Loktantra Senani Pension of Rs 15,000 from the state government. This is an SP government scheme for those who were jailed during the Emergency.Details regarding the strange beliefs and demands of the encroachers involved in the violent confrontation with the police in Mathura emerged even as the bodies were being counted. Their demands included the cancellation of elections of the President and prime minister. They also wanted the Indian currency to be replaced by the Azad Hind Fauj Currency, and that 60 litres of petrol and 40 litres of diesel be priced at Rs 1 each. One of their demands said that all documents related to law and order and the documents of citizenship must be made public as it would reveal who we really are.Powerful supportersAccording to reports, Ram Brikshs book Vidhik Satyagrah describes a financial freedom struggle and details the same strange demands such as banning the Indian currency. The township that emerged in Jawahar Bagh was shielded from action by local authorities by a powerful state minister, reports said. For over two years, Ram Brikshs followers camped at Jawahar Bagh and were provided three meals a day. This, along with subsidised sugar (Rs 25 per kg) and grapes (Rs 20 per kg as opposed to the market price of Rs 60 per kg), could not have been possible without a strong financier.It is obvious that like many other senas operating in India, there is a mixture of religion, politics and criminality. This ensures their weightage in the political system and opportunity to bargain, influence and blackmail. This dangerous cocktail is now becoming a phenomenon.The Akhilesh Yadav government is in a precarious situation. It is in full election mode and wishes to come back to power making history. The government has failed to control criminal elements, for this is their main constituency. This has led to their downfall every time they came to power. While the famed MY (Muslim-Yadav) combination is its main support base, the SP enjoys or seeks the support of even dreaded mafia gangs like those of D P Yadav, Atiq Ahmad and others.Akhileshs inability to take any action against them is a fact. They will not act, as the main cadre will be disappointed. They did the same in the Muzaffarnagar incident, blaming lower-level policemen and saving politicians. In the bargain, the top bureaucrats also saved themselves. The dye is being cast for elections 2017 and many such incidents are likely to recur.There are too many bosses in the state government and Akhilesh is probably the last. Akhileshs father Mulayam Singh Yadav, uncles Shivpal and Ramgopal, besides minister Azam Khan, all act independently. Mulayam has a difference of opinion with regard to winning the elections. Akhilesh wishes development to be the main agenda whereas Mulayam wants caste and Muslims as the mainstay. This gives bureaucrats a free hand in confusing all and sundry, and Akhilesh will not be able to control this phenomenon and will eventually surrender.(The writer is Professor and Head, Department of Public Administration, Lucknow University)"

The issue echoed in the national executive meeting of the BJP held in Allahabad last week and national president of BJP Amit Shah described it as a serious communal matter that endangered the identity of Hindus in the region. The BJP has threatened to take up this issue in the 2017 assembly elections.State government has already described the BJP claims as baseless and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav warned the BJP against spreading canard and communal passions. The GOI report underlining the fact could be one of the reasons behind the U-turn by BJP leadership on the issue.The decade-long survey exposed that rise in migration has been mainly because of economic backwardness and awareness of education and jobs in other parts. The Census of India conducts the surveys on migration patterns too along with reasons and it has found that compared to the 1991 census, migration of rural population in western UP to urban areas increased in the 2001 census while the latest data of 2011 have yet to be released.Compared to western UP, rural-to-urban migration has either been static or decreased marginally in the central region, Bundelkhand and the eastern region of the state too during the same period.The report mentions that most of the western UP districts including Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Saharanpur, Aligarh and parts of the NCR have registered economic boom in the last 20 years so people from rural areas shifted to cities leading to an increase in the migration of the rural population to urban areas."" Prices of land in Gurgaon and Noida are no less than in Delhi and Mumbai and a good number of people have sold their lands in Kairana, Shamli, Saharanpur and shifted to other and better destinations, said a senior officer in the Census department in Lucknow, adding that migration has taken place in Bihar, Rajasthan , Punjab and Kerala and Andhra Pradesh too, so why the fuss over western UP.""The BJP is playing a dangerous game. Its ministers and government authorities are well aware of the fact that migration is a natural phenomenon world over in the wake of economic reforms and transformation. It has increased in the western UP also because the land holdings are getting smaller there like elsewhere and escalating farmland crisis is forcing farmers to opt for non-farm sector options to earn livelihood. Where is the apsect of communalism in this,"" said former director of Giri Institute of Social Studies , speaking to the ToI. A former principal secretary in planning department shared with the ToI that recent decline in sugar prices and khandsari prices, tax holiday in adjoining Uttarakhand and closure of a number of steel units has led to migration of the people ."

I met Akhilesh during oath taking ceremony of West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee, where he mentioned issues of sugarcane farmers and sugar mills.""Nitish began his anti-liquor campaign in UP by holding a rally in Pindra (Varanasi) on May 12. After it, on May 25 during his Bhadohi visit Akhilesh had informed reporters that liquor is a complicated issue due to which no government can take any decision like banning it in the state in a haste. Produces of sugarcane farmers are consumed by sugar mills, which sell the waste to distilleries. At a time when clearing dues of sugarcane farmers is proving difficult, how the decision to ban liquor can be taken, he said.The molasses and other waste of sugar mills, should be utilized for ethanol production. Ethanol is sold on higher price to mix in petrol. In case of excess production of ethanol, it can be exported to other countries. He asked Akhilesh to show courage and ban liquor in the state in order to increase productivity of the state's population, improve social life and minimize the social security issues."

According to state government records, a total of Rs 1,684 crore has still not been paid to farmers by sugar millers, most of them in private sector.The promise of payment is also expected to impact farmer families in West UP's Shamli district and its neighbouring regions, where the BJP made a failed attempt to inflame passions by claiming large scale exodus of families due to communal tensions. While the district administration disproved the BJP's claims of exodus on religious lines, local leaders confirmed that families have migrated from Shamli in general, and Kairana in particular, for economic reasons. The bulk of the population in the district depends for its livelihood on agriculture and allied activities.Akhilesh's promise to get cane dues settled impacts Shamli because three private sugar mills -- among the highest defaulters in making payments to sugar cane farmers -- are located in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar districts.A senior official in the UP Cane Commissioner's office confirmed that while private mills owe farmers a total of Rs 1554 crore in the current fiscal, the state-backed cooperative sector needs to settle dues of Rs 130 crore. Five private mills have also not settled payments worth Rs 67 crore for the sugarcane they purchased from farmers in 2014-2015.According to the Cane Commissioner's office, the Samajwadi Party government has, so far, settled outstanding payments of Rs 13,140 core to sugar cane farmers this year. The UP government has also made budgetary grants in order to maintain the prices of sugarcane when sugar prices crashed across the country. This year alone, UP government set aside a grant of Rs 1336 crore for settlement of cane dues.Welcoming the government's decision to ensure payment of arrears to cane farmers, Shamli resident and member, Planning Commission , Sudhir Panwar said, ""The migration of both Hindu and Muslim families in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar is largely triggered by economic causes. With agriculture income decreasing steadily, most people left home in search of better incomes outside of their home districts. This announcement by the CM is a welcome decision that will not only stabilise the economic conditions of farmers, but also curb migration."""

Shamli sugar mill. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna) Jagmer Nirwal, a farmer from Shamli who holds the record of harvesting UPs highest cane yield of 1,989.5 quintals/hectare. Shamli sugar mill. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna)It used to be one of Indias most prosperous agricultural tracts, irrigated by the Eastern Yamuna and Upper Ganges canal systems built way back in the 1850s. In August-September 2013, one of its districts was the site of a communal conflagration. More recently  this time, barely a year before Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh  another one has been in the news for the alleged palayan or mass exodus of Hindu families from Muslim-dominated areas.But UPs Upper Doab belt the fertile alluvial plains between the Yamuna and the Ganga stretching from Saharanpur through Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Meerut to Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bulandshahr  is today gripped by an unprecedented agricultural crisis centered around sugarcane and bhugtan (payments) to growers by mills. This issue, more than palayan or Hindu-Muslim polarisation, could be the real game-changer, at least in the regions 30-plus Assembly seats out of the states total 403.UP has some 30 lakh farming families who supplied a total 6,428.49 lakh quintals of sugarcane to mills during the recent 2015-16 crushing season. This cane was worth Rs 17,999.37 crore at the UP governments state advised price (SAP) of Rs 280 per quintal.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe SAP has not just been unchanged since 2012-13; for the current season, the Samajwadi Party administration even allowed it to be paid in two instalments. The first instalment of Rs 230 was payable within 14 days of the cane being delivered to the factory and the balance Rs 50 within three months after completion of crushing (mills normally start operations in November and close by April-end).Data from the Cane Commissioners Office in Lucknow, however, reveals mills to have, as on June 21, made payments of only Rs 13,193.60 crore. It means they still owe growers over Rs 4,800 crore. Worse, there are dues of Rs 1,631.08 crore even against the first instalment of Rs 230/quintal payable within 14 days after cane purchase.Shamli sugar mill. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna) Shamli sugar mill. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna)Its like not having a salary raise for three years and even this not getting paid, says Jitender Singh Hooda. This 45-bigha (7.6 acres) farmer from Kheri Bairagi, a village in Shamli tehsil/district, has received onlyRs 1.44 lakh for his 1,200 quintals supplied to the sugar mill of Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Ltd, as against its SAP value of Rs 3.36 lakh.The cane payment crisis is, indeed, most acute in the Upper Doab region, also referred to as Jat belt after the community that is seen to make up roughly a tenth of its population and a third of those engaged in farming. The Upper Doab districts, as the accompanying table shows, currently account for more than 47 per cent of the overall cane dues and 80 per cent of first-instalment arrears owed by mills in UP.Many assume we are a rich and powerful farming community. They should come here and see the reality. We may have once produced big leaders like Chaudhary Charan Singh and Mahendra Singh Tikait, but the fact is that our voice matters little today. Why else is the cane arrears position the worst here? points out Rajvir Singh Mundet, a Shamli-based social worker and convenor of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Sanyukta Morcha.The average Upper Doab farmer, according to him, owns 15 bigha (nearly one hectare or 2.5 acres) and not even 10 per cent has more than 30 bigha (five acres). Sugarcane cultivation was, in the past, remunerative for even small farmers, as they had access to irrigation and mills made regular payments.This is no longer the case with further fragmentation of holdings and cane payment arrears becoming a serious problem, especially since around 2013-14. Sugarcane alone can no longer support ones family. So, you see many Jat farmers taking to sale of milk and even working in factories, which they never used to do until a couple of decades ago, explains Mundet.The small farmers have been impacted the most. Many sent their children to private schools, realising the need of diversifying career options.Towns like Shamli saw a mushrooming of such schools catering to farmers children  especially during the period from 2007-08 and 2012-13, when the cane SAP also rose from Rs 125 to Rs 280 per quintal. But with stagnant SAPs and delayed payments over the last three years, there is a growing trend of school fee defaults.Jagmer Singh Nirwal, who farms 300 bighas (50.5 acres) in Shamlis outskirts, reckons his average cane cultivation cost at Rs 8,000 per bigha. At 60 quintals yield per bigha (i.e. 880 quintals/hectare) and the SAP of Rs 280 per quintal, the gross return works out to Rs 16,800 per bigha. Deducting costs of Rs 11,000  including Rs 35/quintal towards harvesting and Rs 15/quintal for transporting the cane to the mill  leaves a net return of Rs 5,800 per bigha. This is decent, provided the money comes on time though.Nirwal is a relatively big farmer, who also holds the state record of harvesting 1,989.5 quintals per hectare in 2014-15 (the average cane yield for UP was 651.48 quintals, while 788.44 quintals for Shamli district).But he, too, has so far been paid only Rs 4 lakh for 8,000 quintals that should have been worth some Rs 22.4 lakh at the SAP: I am surviving only because of the profits from earlier years. Ordinary farmers do not have this luxury.Most farmers understand that a major factor for delayed payments has to do with sugar prices, with average ex-factory realisations in UP plunging from Rs 31.90 to Rs 25.64 per kg between 2012-13 and 2014-15.But they should at least pay us now, when prices have gone up, notes Hooda. From a low of Rs 22.54/kg in July 2015, average realisations have, in fact, recovered to Rs 33.70 in May. This has led to some companies  notably DCM Shriram, Balrampur Chini, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Dalmia Bharat Sugar  paying 85 per cent or more of their SAP value of cane.Central and eastern UP mills are seemingly keen to pay, unlike the ones here. The state government is least bothered about western UP farmers, while politicians are only interested in raising palayan and other issues to divert attention, alleges Mundet.Cane growers fear that if sugar prices keep rising, the Centre will next open the door for duty-free imports. We suffer when prices fall from over-production. We will also suffer if prices go up and imports take place, complains Hooda.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express photo by Praveen Khanna Sugarcane fields in Shamli. Express photo by Praveen KhannaFor many, there may be no apparent connection between crop prices and private school enrolments, but for those in this primarily sugarcane-growing district of western Uttar Pradesh, the link is obvious.Shamli saw a mushrooming of private English-medium schools with Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliation during the period from 2007-08 to 2012-13, when the Uttar Pradesh government raised its State Advised Price (SAP) for sugarcane from Rs 125 to Rs 280 per quintal. The number of such schools trebled from eight to 24, out of which 12 were in Shamli itself and the rest in smaller towns of the district, like Thanabhawan, Jhinjhana, Unn, Jalalabad, Kairana and Kandhla.These schools are now facing a financial crisis, with the cane SAP remaining unchanged since the 2012-13 sugar season and mills unable to pay even this to farmers. Suryavir Singh, the chairman of the co-educational CBSE-affiliated B.S.M School in Shamli, claims that every private school in the district is saddled with outstanding fee dues, ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.Watch Video: Whats making newsThis is largely a rural belt whose economy is based on sugarcane. At least 70 per cent of the students are from villages in and around Shamli. When farmers dont get paid, we are also affected, says Singh, whose own school has fees-cum-transport charge arrears of Rs 42.5 lakh.According to him, during the boom period when farmers had money and were willing to spend on education for their children, each school was adding 100-200 students every year. But in the last three years, around 50-100 children have been dropping out annually and going back to studying in the government school at their villages.Shamli has 76,500-odd farming families who supplied 193.11 lakh quintals of cane to the districts three sugar mills during the recent 2015-16 season. While this cane was worth Rs 538.46 crore at the SAP of Rs 280/quintal, farmers have so far got only Rs 247.02 crore. Not receiving timely payments, which has been a common feature all through the last three years, has severely hit their spending power.We cannot force farmers to pay, as their financial condition has really deteriorated, says Yogendra Malik, manager of Maharaja Surajmal Public School, which is 6 km from Shamli town and has around 700 students, from nursery to Class XII.This school, run by the Delhi-based Surajmal Memorial Education Society and catering largely to the Jat community, currently has fee arrears of Rs 26.5 lakh, pending since April. We also incur annual loss of Rs 8-9 lakh towards transport, as most of our students come from interior areas who cannot afford to pay full charge, Malik adds.Private schools in Shamli charge monthly fees ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, apart from Rs 500-600 as conveyance charge. Most schools have between 500 and 2,500 students, though in some the numbers are now falling below the minimum 500 or so for them to remain viable.Mohkam Singh from Kheri Bairagi village, who owns 3-acres of land, supplied 400 quintals of cane to the local sugar mill at Shamli in 2015-16. While this cane should have fetched Rs 1.12 lakh at the SAP, all he has got so far is Rs 44,000. His two grandchildren study at Devi Umra Kaur Vedic School, which is 5 km from the village. Their combined monthly fee of Rs 3,000, inclusive of bus charges, has not been paid after March and Singh isnt sure how long the school will keep them.But why are farmers keen to send their children to private schools? The government schools teach neither English nor any computer courses. Even the quality of teachers has come down and the schools dont have proper furniture or electricity most of the time. How will our children compete without the minimum facilities and standards that private schools are offering? says Kaliram Chauhan, who farms 6 acres at Rasoolpur Gujran in Kandhla tehsil.He, too, is awaiting full payment for his 900 quintals of cane delivered to the Shamli mill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We, four friends, are heading towards the western Uttar Pradesh town, about 60 kms from the capital, as food explorers.Meerut has an impressive resume. We know it was the raging heart of the great 1857 revolt that shook British raj. The small town was once the centre of a multi-million rupee Hindi pulp fiction industry and still manufactures the finest cricket bats in the country. But many may not know that Meerut is a gastronomic delight too.Our first stop is the famous Jain Ki Shikanji shop at Modinagar. There are dozens of shikanji sellers in this town once famous for Modi suiting and shirtings. But Jains small cubicle-size shop, located by the police station, is the real McCoy. Shikanji was created to beat the summer heat. And at Jains, you know how. The drinks preparation is a short seven-step to heaven. First, a measured portion of sugar syrup is poured into a glass; followed by a strong squeeze of lemon.The glass is stuffed with crushed ice. Then a bottle of soda is emptied over it. This is followed by a spoonful of the special shikanji masala. The glass is then capped and shaken. Your drink is ready. Unlike Coke, the ingredients is no state secret. You can buy them separately too.The drink fortifies us for the lunch ahead. Asking passers by every 50 metres, we arrive at Papa Ji Daal Wale (sic), a dhaba near the old Baghpat More bus stand. Daal is to any meal what Laxman is to Ramayan: vital and self-effacing. At Papaji, it commands centre stage. The shop, owned by a genial sardarji, specialises in urad-chane ki daal which is slow cooked over low fire overnight. We want to pack some for dinner.But sardarji hasnt come in yet and without him, the staff refuses to serve. We leave with a heavy, hungry heart.Delhi Durbar, next to Imliyan Masjid, is on Hapur Road. Far more accommodating, they usher us into the new air-conditioned section where a young man is feeding what looks like fruit-cream to a woman in burqa. Our order is simple: chicken kali mirch and tandoori roti. One of us orders a chicken biryani too. The biryani is a crushing disappointment, it feels more like chicken in fried rice minus the finesse. But the chicken kali mirch is just right; its thick curry blended in cashew and cream. Flavour and taste blend to create a dish that is pure bliss. It is worth a hundred trips from Delhi. Anytime.Thats the unanimous view.On the way back, we pick up the dal. But before that we stumble upon the culinary treasure of the day. We spot a hotel whose name reminds me of an old Bollywood song. Its called, Char Yaar, and it was set up in 1950. Its basically a sweet shop that specialises in halwa-parantha. The deep-friend paranthas are the size of a large pizza and its crisp and flaky, much like a patty. The halwa, topped with cherries, is equally oily. You can say, its a dish to die for.Rather literally. But as food explorers, this is our discovery of the day. We taste some and pack the rest. It has been a week since that afternoon but the taste of the chicken kali mirch lingers on."

We will show phase I of Ganga cleaning in October 2016, while the second phase will be completed two years later,"" Bharti told reporters here.She said tomorrow the government will also launch an application to monitor level of pollution in the river.Gadkari and newly-appointed Ministers of State for Water Resources, Vijay Goel and Sanjeev Balyan, were also present during the briefing.Transport Minister Gadkari said it is ""satisfactory"" that the government is going to begin the work tomorrow. He asserted the projects are being launched after conducting detailed scientific study and will involve use of ""best of the world"" technologies to ensure river pollution is averted.Referring to 'Moksha Dham' works, which relate to construction/repair of crematoria located along the river, Gadkari said the projects will be implemented without hurting public sentiments attached to the holy river even as air and water pollution is kept under check.He also rejected claims that the programme works are taking off late, saying he was ""rather surprised"" the projects are being launched ""within such a short span"" notwithstanding complexity involved in it.Meanwhile, on asked about Balyan and Goel joining the Water Resources Ministry following expansion of Union Ministerial Council yesterday, Bharti said she was ""waiting for the appointments to happen for many days"".She hoped their joining the ministry will ""increase pace of work"" in the Ministry which handles crucial subjects of river-linking and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichayee Yojana (PMKYS) besides the Namami Gange programme and ""alleviate the burden"".""We were waiting for MoS for many days. Sanjeev Balyan is an expert of agriculture. We are implementing PMKYS (irrigation scheme), river-linking and Ganga mission which are big projects.""These can't be achieved without these MoS.

The schemes have been worked out with co-operation of states, taking them into confidence,"" he said.Gadkari also made a strong pitch for recycling waste water from industries located along Ganga to ensure pollution is curbed and cited example of how drainage water is treated and used again in his hometown Nagpur.He said that DPR for STPs is ready and tenders in this regard will be floated ""soon"".About his ministry envisaging waterways projects in Ganga, Gadkari said the work is on in the river's 1620-km stretch between Varanasi and Haldia where adequate water flow is available to transport ships.He informed the government will construct 45 water ports with RoRo (roll-on roll-off) services at five places including Patna and Sahibganj.To another question, both Gadkari and Bharti said the government has been executing the projects with co-operation of five basin states - four of which are ruled by parties other than BJP.""The programme is funded entirely by Centre, but we are working with co-operation with states concerned,"" Bharti said.The new Ganga Act too, she added, will be drafted with consultations with state.Bharti also said the government is for embracing Punjab's Seechewal model of waste water management to make villages located along Ganga open defecation free.The Ministers also insisted on community participation in cleaning the river."

This is about 1.8-1.9 million tonnes less than the current 2015-16 production of around 25.1 million tonnes.DroughtThis is in line with the governments estimate of 23-23.5 million tonnes for the next year. ISMA attributed the likely fall in sugar output to 5.5 per cent decline in sugarcane acreage to 4.99 million hectare in 2016-17 as against 5.28 million hectare in the previous year.This would result in lower cane output.According to ISMA data, sugar production in Maharasthra  the biggest producing State  is estimated to decline to around 6.15 million tonnes in 2016-17 from 8.40 million tonnes in the current year.Maharashtras cane area has declined in 2016-17, which is mainly due to drought-like situation last year, poor rainfall and lesser water availability for irrigation, ISMA said in a statement.The cane area in the state is down at 7,80,000 hectare as against of 1.05 million hectare in 2015-16, it added.Sugar production in Uttar Pradesh  the second largest sugar producing state  is estimated to rise to 7.54 million tonnes in 2016-17 marketing year from 6.82 million tonnes in the current year.

This variety is increasingly gaining popularity in the state.Ram, who had come to premier National Sugar Institute (NSI) in the city to take part in an international symposium, said ""Though Co0238 was developed for sub-tropical regions of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, it has shown results better than the older variety -- Co86032 -- which is prominent in tropical regions of Karnataka and Mahrashtra."" He added that with the introduction of the new variety in 2012-13, the average yield of sugarcane in UP increased from 60 tonnes per hectare to 66.5 tonnes per hectare in 2015-16.""In UP there is a persisting problem of low sugarcane productivity as indicated by lower yields as well as lower sugar content in sugarcane. Here, this variety can work wonders,"" he claimed.Besides Ram, a number of experts in sugar industry from the US, UK and Australia also took part in the symposium 'Opportunities and challenges from the emerging bio-economy for the sugar sector', held here on Saturday.

The court of the chief judicial magistrate sent him to 14 days of judicial remand after a two-hour hearing.Lucknow police had registered a case against Singh on the complaint of Mewalal Gautam, national secretary of the BSP. A non-bailable warrant was issued against him yesterday and the case was transferred to Mau.The expelled leader was on his way from Deoghar in Jharkhand to Uttar Pradesh when the STF intercepted his Internet connection through his mobile phone and found that he was in Buxar.His brother Dharmendra Singh was present in court during the hearing.There was tension at the court gates as a large number of lawyers assembled there in Singh's support.Reacting to the arrest, Mayawati said the Samajwadi Party government was left with little option after Allahabad High Court rejected Singh's plea for a stay on his arrest.""Hand in glove with the BJP, the SP government was not willing to arrest Singh. But they were under pressure after the high court denied a stay on his arrest,"" she said.Singh's remarks against Mayawati had triggered outrage, with Opposition parties in Parliament uniting in condemnation and the BJP moving swiftly to contain the damage by expelling him for six years.Dalits constitute an important votebank in Uttar Pradesh, where elections are due early next year."

According to Registrar of Companies (RoC) records, he resigned from the firm on July 5, three days before being inducted into the council of ministers. The company filed his resignation with the RoC only on July 26.Yerawar, earlier, had a 14.28 per cent stake in Chintamani Agrotech, which he later diluted to 1.9 per cent, according to the companys latest available annual report of March 2015.Gadkari was also with the company since its inception and resigned as a director on August 31, 2011, while Fadnavis joined the firm on October 23, 2009, and resigned on May 21, 2012, as per RoC records.Unlike Yerawar, neither Fadnavis nor Gadkari had any shareholding with the company, an analysis of its financial statements shows.Chintamani Agrotech  with zero turnover for the first several years, low income from sales, high reserves and substantial landholding without any operations  is a subsidiary of Jinbhuvish Powertech Pvt Ltd.Gadkari did not respond to text messages and questionnaires emailed to his office.Fadnavis said: I was associated very briefly, but I resigned and opted out because I couldnt contribute any value or time to the project. I dont know the status of the project.He added that the government had recently passed an Act that enables original landowners to secure their land back as per current rates if the property was acquired for a specific project that failed to take off within a stipulated period.The retrospective applicability needs to be checked, he said.Minister of State Yerawar said the power project could not take off due to a financial crunch and is not likely to start soon. The situation on the ground is still the same and I plan to resign as director of Chintamani Agrotech now I am a minister of state, he said when The Indian Express spoke to him on July 16.The plan was to have an integrated power plant with sugar and ethanol production. But then, policies changed and the government stopped giving loans for the sugar component. It was difficult to raise finances for the project and ultimately it could not take off. The company only has the land, purchased privately with proper permissions, he said.But Uttam Ingale, another director of Chintamani Agrotech and a former BJP legislator from Yavatmal, claimed the project was set to begin. The background work is going on. It is in the final stages. Some NOCs are awaited and finances need to be put in place, Ingale said.The company proposed to set up a sugar plant with a capacity of 3,500 tonnes of cane per day and a 30-mw co-generation power plant along with a 45 kilo litres per day ethanol plant at Mahagaon in Yavatmal.Watch Video: Whats making news[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8After its incorporation in 2001, Chintamani Agrotech acquired 127 acres in Bijora village of Mahagaon taluka in Yavatmal to set up the plant in 2002-03, Yerawar said.Devidas Mohakar, a resident of Mahagaon and a former member of the local zilla parishad, said, At the time of buying the land, the company members convinced farmers that they would set up a power plant and give jobs to members of their families. But nothing happened. Then the other company, Jinbhuvish, bought another 300-350 acres of adjacent land for the power project. But nothing has moved.Jinbhuvish Powertech, Chintamani Agrotechs holding company, owns 89.37 per cent of the firm. The company was incorporated in September 2006 originally as Aarya Financial Services Pvt Lt to provide consultancy services related to securities and deal in financial instruments, according to RoC documents.The company was started by a Nagpur-based entrepreneur, Manish Mehta, who was also a founder member of Chintamani Agrotech.Following the long wait for the plant to take off, a group of original land owners approached the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court in 2011, seeking the cancellation of sale deeds. The court disposed of the case, saying that registered documents of sale deeds could not be challenged through a writ petition.The landowners also wrote letters to the Collectors office in Yavatmal and to the state revenue department, saying the land in question was tribal land, which the company purchased after promising jobs to the owners. They said that the government should now reverse the sale deeds and restore the land back to its original tribal owners.Mohakar said, There has been no action on these letters. Some farmers have also started cultivating on what used to be their land at Bijora.As per land records, Chintamani Agrotech currently owns at least 64 acres at Bijora, which the company converted to non-agricultural land in 2009. The land is worth Rs 13.62 crore, according to the company auditors report as of March 2015. This newspaper was able to trace the purchase of 37.04 acres of Chintamani Agrotechs current landholding at Bijora to May 2002, when the company paid a total Rs 9.86 lakh for the land parcels.Besides, Jinbhuvish Power Generations, another subsidiary of Jinbhuvish Powertech, owns 356.5 acres in Bijora and the neighbouring village of Dhanmukh, according to records. As per the governments annual statement of rates, the land is worth nearly Rs 52 crore.Some of these land parcels were acquired from Chintamani Agrotech. For instance, on August 26, 2011, Chintamani Agrotech sold nearly 47.5 acres to Jinbhuvish Power Generations for Rs 9.01 crore in Dhanmukh.Similarly, there are also records of transactions between August and October 2011 of Chintamani Agrotech selling land to Amarupa Engineering & Mining, in which Manish Mehtas brother Nilesh is a director, with the land ultimately being in the name of Jinbhuvish Power Generations.Chintamani Agrotech, which changed its registered address at least four times in 15 years , from Yavatmal to Mumbai to Nagpur and then to Uttar Pradesh, had no revenue to report until 2010 when it for the first time posted a turnover of Rs 4.39 lakh. The companys annual report of March 2015 says that the firm derives hundred per cent of its turnover from the manufacture of sugar, and puts the revenue from sales and other income at Rs 4.47 crore.Besides Yerawar and Ingale, the firms current crop of directors includes Nagpur-based Ravindra Yerawar and Avinash Agrawal, and Jinbhuvish Powertech directors Nilesh Chanandrikapure and Pankaj Kaushal.Like Chintamani Agrotech, Jinbhuvish Powertech, the holding company has also reported a zero turnover since inception as against a large amount of loans and investments. According to the companys latest available profit and lost statement, it had no revenue from operations, but Rs 14,853 from other income. At the same time, it had reserves of Rs 237.9 crore and long-term investments of Rs 284.2 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This is next only to Uttar Pradesh where sugar mills owe 3,046 crore to farmers. The dues to farmers in TN amounted to 1,030 crore in the last fiscal. Farmers are gearing up to protest against the government and mills in various parts of the state on August 11.Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution C R Chaudhary told Parliament recently that due to surplus production during the last four sugar seasons and depressed sugar prices, the liquidity of the sugar mills has been adversely affected, leading to accumulation of cane price arrears to the farmers. ""The Centre has extended soft loans of 4,305 crore to improve the liquidity position of sugar mills across the country, enabling them to clear cane price arrears,"" the minister said.But farmers say their plight has not been addressed either by mill owners or the state government. ""Lack of legal binding to the state-advised price (SAP) has led to the mills not paying our dues. The acreage and production have fallen drastically in the last three years. We fear the state too has given up our cause,"" said Swamimalai Vimalnathan, general secretary, Thanjavur District Farmers' Protection Association. Sugarcane is one of the top crops after paddy across the state, especially in Villupuram, Perambalur, Erode, and Cauvery delta districts. Sugarcane production, according to the agriculture department, has fallen from 340 lakh tonne in 2012 to 264 lakh tonne this year, and the area of cultivation is down from 3.48 lakh hectares to 2.57 lakh hectares.The state government is vested with powers to enforce the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, for timely payment of cane price to farmers, said Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers' Association general secretary D Ravindran. ""The state-advised price is fixed by the state. If the mills don't budge, the state must take over these defaulting mills,"" he said."

Earlier the court had sought status report from the government.Armed bandits had waylaid the family near Dostpur village in the district while they were on the way to Shahjahanpur to attend a function on the night of July 29.The bandits then overpowered the occupants and took them a few metres away from the highway into a muddy sugar cane field, where they tied the three male members and gang-raped the minor and her 35-year-old mother.The police had claimed to have cracked the case and arrested six people, including the main accused Saleem Bawaria, member of the Bawaria gang, a notorious criminal nomadic tribe.As the incident triggered a massive outrage, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav suspended seven police personnel, including the then district police chief."

Our freedom reminds us of the sacrifice of our freedom fighters and their devotion to the cause of freedom through struggle and sacrifice. On this occasion, we remember those young people who went willingly to gallows. We are breathing today in free India, thanks to Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Pandit Nehru and many other great leaders and people who struggled and worked consistently towards freedom of the country.India is an ancient nation. We have a history and cultural heritage of thousands of years. From Vedas to Vivekananda, from Upnishads to satellites, from Lord Krishna to Mahatma Gandhi, and from Bhima of Mahabharata to Bhim Rao; we have had a long historic journey and heritage. This land has seen many ups and downs, and struggle through several generations. Many of them dedicated themselves to make a better human life.India is not 70 years old, but it is a journey of 70 years post-colonial rule. After Independence, we made efforts to take the country forward under a new system. Sardar Vallbhai Patel unified the country and now it is our duty to make this country as the best nation. We have to make continuous efforts to realise our dream to make India Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.My fellow brothers and sisters, freedom has not come without a price. There were endless atrocities but the resolve was unwavering. Every Indian was a soldier of the freedom movement. Everyone wanted freedom of the country. It is possible that someone might not have been imprisoned, someone might not have been able to make sacrifice but even then, every Indian had a resolve for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi was the leader.It was the motivation of the sacrifice of armed revolutionaries which led to Swaraj. But now, to change the self governance into good governance is the resolve of 125 crore citizens. If the Swaraj was achieved through sacrifice, attainment of Suraj (good governance ) is also not possible without sacrifice, valor, dedication and discipline. So to further the Good-Governance resolve of 125 crore people, all have to move ahead with their respective responsibilities and dedication.In order to attain Good Governance, everyone has to fulfill its responsibilities, be it a Panchayat or Parliament, be it a Gram Pradhan or a Prime Minister, to strengthen every democratic institution. Only then, India will not take too much time in realizing the dream of Good-Governance.It is true that our country is confronted with a number of problems but we must not forget that if there are problems, the country also has capabilities and when we move ahead with such capabilities, the paths of solutions also become available. So, my brothers and sisters, if India have millions of problems, we have 125 crore brains also which are capable of solving the problems.Brothers and sisters, there was a time when Governments in our country were mired in allegations, but time has changed now. Today, the Government is not surrounded by charges and allegations, but by expectations. And when there are expectations around, it is an indication that when there is hope, when there is trust, then only expectations arise from their womb, and expectations speed up the journey towards good governance, and fulfill expectations on a continuous basis. So my brothers and sisters, for us this journey of Surajya  today when I am speaking to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is but natural that there will be discussion as to what the Government is doing and what is happening in the country, what should be done for the country. I can also present a detailed account of what the Governments has done and can underline many things.A large number of initiatives have been taken in two years tenure, numerous actions taken, but if I start elaborating, then maybe I will have to speak from the rampart of Red Fort for one week. So instead of that, today I want to draw your attention towards the work culture of this Government, not the work only. Sometimes it is easy to account for the work but it is not easy for a layman to know, grasp, understand and identify the work culture until you go into depth.So my brothers and sisters, today I am not talking only of the policy but also of the intent and the decisions. Brothers and sisters, it is not an issue of direction only but a matter of wider attitude.This is not only an outline. It is a commitment for transformation. This is confluence of peoples expectations, democracy and peoples support. This is a desire and also consent, this is a momentum and also expression of progress.Therefore my beloved countrymen, today when I speak of good governance, my straight forward meaning is  to make a difference in the life of the common man. Good governance means that administration should be sensitive, should be responsible and should be dedicated to the common man. And then we need to emphasize on good governance, keep on exploring the responsibility of everyone, responsibility and accountability should be at the root of good governance and it should get sustenance from there. Therefore, administration should be sensitive.Just remember the times, when if we had to go to any big hospital, we had to wait for many days. When people used to come to AIIMS, they had to wait for two to three days to just know when they will have to undergo the tests. Today we have been able to change the entire system. There is an online registration, online appointment of doctors, and when the patient comes at the time given to him, his treatment starts. Not only this, his medical records are available online. And in the area of health, we want to develop this culture throughout the country. Today, the government has brought this system in more than 40 big hospitals but the bottom line is that administration should be sensitive. Brothers and sisters, the administration should be accountable. If the administration is not accountable, the problems of the common man remain unattended. How does change happen- we have technology but there was a time when rail tickets .common man of India is linked to rail tickets, the poor man is linked to it. Earlier, through technology, only 2000 tickets were issued in one minute. There was a time  people waited for the website to open. Today I can say with satisfaction that in one minute, 15,000 rail tickets can be issued.The government should be accountable as to how a responsible Government should take steps on the basis of the needs and aspirations of the common man.There is a class in the country, especially the middle class, the upper middle class, who is more troubled with income- tax officials than the police. I have to change this situation, I am trying and I will change it. But there was a time when an honest Taxpayer would pay his income-tax, even pay extra two rupees so that he does not face any problem. But, once the tax was deposited, he would face difficulties in getting refund. He even had to go to the extent of canvassing and wait endlessly for the refund. Now, we have introduced a system of online refund. Now refund is done within a time frame of 1 to 3 weeks. Those who are watching this telecast on television will also agree that their refund reached them directly, without any application for it. This became possible only due to efforts in making government accountable.You know, for good governance, transparency is important. Our society is now gradually becoming connected with the world. Earlier, only 40-50 lakhs people used to apply for passport in a year. Now a days, 2 crore people apply for it. Earlier 4 to 6 months were wasted only in inquiries if someone had no recommendation. But now the situation has changed. I can say with pride that now citizens can get a passport in 1 to 2 weeks, without any recommendation/canvassing. It is due to transparency in governance. No delay, no need of recommendation. Today I can say that, in a short time during 2015-16 itself, we have issued 1.75 crore passports to our citizens.Efficiency is the hallmark of Good governance. Earlier if anyone wanted to start a company or business, they had to even struggle for its registration for a minimum of at least 6 months. But this situation has now changed. Due to efficiency in governance now, the same employees under the same rule complete the process of company registration within 24 hours. In last July itself, 900 of such registrations materialised.My fellow brothers and sisters, for good rule, good governance is necessary. We have taken many steps for good governance. Last year, I announced that there will be no interview for group C and group D posts. They will get jobs on the basis of merit. We have identified almost 9000 such posts. Now these 9000 posts will not be put for the process of interview. Our young aspirants will not have to spend any money for appearing for interviews nor they will have to search for someone for canvassing or recommendation. Doors for corruptions and middle men have been shut and this system is now in place.My fellow brothers and sisters, there was a time when government used to announce the scheme and spell out what will be done under the said scheme. It was the practice to keep the people satisfied. People used to hope that something will happen now. Then they started inquiring about plans. Subsequently, the people demanded to know about budget. Over the past 70 years, the mindset of country has changed. People are not satisfied with the launch of schemes, the plan details, and the budget provisions. The common man is satisfied only when something appears on the ground. We cant make things work on ground at a slow pace. We will have to accelerate our speed, move at faster pace.Rural Roads in our country- Every person in a village expects permanent concrete road. A very big task- Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji started it with special attention. And the later Governments continued it, promoted it. We have tried to give it speed. Earlier it was 70-75 Kilometers per day of Rural Road construction. Today we have increased it to 100 Km a day. This speed will meet the expectations of common man in the coming days.We are laying emphasis on power in our country, and in particular on the Renewable Energy. There was a time  after many years of Independence, work on Wind Energy started. In the last one year, we have increased it nearly by 40 percent. This is the meaning of speed. Solar Energy now the entire world is paying attention to it. We have increased it by 116 percent. This is not an incremental change, it is a very big high jump. We want to increase things as per its quantum. If there is production of energy in our country, we need transmission lines and a proper system of transmission lines. Two years before the formation of our government, 30-35 thousand kms of transmission lines were being laid every year. With satisfaction, I can say that today, we have made it up to 50,000 Kilometers. This is a task of speeding up. If we talk about Rail line commissioning, and commissioning means track ready to run trains, completion of all trials. In the previous 10 years, it was 1500 kms, and today we are able to make it up to 3500 kms in two years. We are furthering this speed.My Brothers and sisters, today we are stressing on direct benefit by linking the Aadhar Card with the government schemes, thereby stopping the leakages. In the earlier regime, nearly 4 crore people could be added to government schemes with Aadhar Card. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that compared to the number of 4 crore, we have completed the task of linking 70 crore citizens with the Aadhar and Government schemes. Whatever is left, is also being completed.In our country, a middle class man or woman takes prestige in having a car in their home. There was a time that a gas stove in a house was taken as a standard and a status in the society. During a span of 60 years after independence, LPG could be provided to about 14 crore people. I am satisfied that on one side there were 14 crore LPG connection in 60 years and on the other we have given 4 crore new connections in just 60 weeks. Where does 14 crore in 60 years stand against 4 crore in 60 weeks. This is a speed with which the change in the quality of life of the common man has been brought about.We have started the cleaning the web of laws. Burden of multiplicity of laws is creating trouble for the government, judiciary and the citizens. We have identified 1700 such laws. The Parliament has already abolished about 1175 laws and we want to abolish the remaining such laws.It had become the nature in the country to believe that somethings can be done, but other things cannot be done. It cannot be done now, and nobody is sure whether it can be done in the future. Pessimism had started to become our nature. It was important to break this tendency, give energy to administration. And when we see some success we get encouraged, our energy increases, our resolve get sharpened and the results start looking closer.When we started Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana, it seemed to be an almost impossible task. For so many years, there were banks, there was Government, bank nationalization had already happened, but the common man was not part of countrys economic mainstream. By linking 21 crore families, 21 crore citizens with Jan Dhan Yojana, a seemingly impossible task has been done. This is not a matter of credit for the government- it has been done by 125 crore of countrymen and therefore I salute my countrymen.Honouring the women in the villages of India is another aspect of this initiative. Open defecation should be stopped  there should be toilets in villages. When I had the privilege to meet you from the ramparts of Red Fort the first time, I had expressed my feelings about how this can happen in our country. Today I can tell you that within this short period, more than 2 crore toilets have been built. More than 70 thousand villages have been freed from open defecation. We are working to make changes in the normal life of the people.Last year from the ramparts of Red Fort, I had said that within next thousand days, we will bring electricity to those 18,000 villages where even after 70 years of independence there was no electricity. They were compelled to live in the 18th century. We resolved to convert the impossible to possible. With great happiness, I can say that not even the half of the 1000 days have past, we are far away from the half way mark, and yet 10,000 villages out of 18,000 have received electricity. And I have been told that out of these, there are many villages where people will be sitting before the TV for the first time today to see the festival of independence of India. I send my special greetings to those villages from here.Brothers and sisters, you will be surprised, that at a distance of 3 hours travel from Delhi there is a village in Hathras called Nagla-Fatela. It takes 3 hours to reach Nangla-Fatela. But it took 70 years for electricity to reach there.And therefore, I am bringing to your notice the work being done by us, the work culture being adopted by us. My fellow brothers and sisters, those working on the LED technology research invented a bulb for the benefit of common man. LED bulb was expensive and used to sell at rupees 350 per bulb. Who would buy these costly bulbs? Government thought over it. If LED bulb can change lives in India, change environment in India, improve the economy, then it was necessary to make some efforts towards this direction. In government system of functioning, there are things when government should not interfere, but it does. And where intervention is required, it doesnt. We are trying to change this work culture and due to the Government intervention, the LED bulb, which was selling for Rupees 350, is now being distributed for Rupees 50. You can see the difference now. I want to ask where this all money was going. We have so far distributed 13 crore LED bulbs. Our politics has become populist and populism has become hallmark of economic policies. If we had given rupees 300 per bulb to people, I would have earned praise that he is a good Prime Minister who has filled peoples pocket with Rupees 300.Buy by distributing LED bulb at Rupees 50, we have helped people save thousands in the long run. 13 crore LED bulbs have so far been distributed. We have resolved to distribute 77 crore bulbs. And today I want to appeal to fellow countrymen please use LED bulb. You will save money annually and Save energy and save climate of the country. When we have 77 crore LED bulbs, India will save electricity worth 20000 MW. When we save 20000 MW electricity, the country will save 1.25 lakh crore rupees. My fellow brothers and sisters, if you use one LED bulb in your home, country can save 1.25 lakh crore rupees. By saving 20000 MW electricity, we can fight against global warming. We can contribute immensely to save our environment with the help of common man and that is why we have taken steps in that direction.You know how to convert impossible into the possible. For energy and petroleum products, we are dependent on other nations. For a long time, we signed agreements so that we get things at fixed price for a longer duration. We have gas agreement with Qatar till 2024. However the gas price was such that it is proving costly for the Indian economy. Our good relations with Qatar made renegotiations possible on the said agreement. Today I can say with satisfaction that renegotiations made the impossible become possible and we could save 20000 crore rupees for the exchequer of India. Qatar was entitled to get this 20000 crore rupees but due to our good relations and character of foreign policy, we could achieve this.Chabahar port is an essential link between India and Central Asia. Previous governments continuously talked and made efforts to implement this project. Today, this impossible task has been made possible, to my satisfaction. Iran, Afghanistan and India are jointly working to construct the Chabahar port to make this impossible task possible.My fellow brothers and sisters, one thing that I would like to say now is connected with common man- it is price rise. It is true that during the rule of previous government, the Inflation rate crossed 10 percent mark. With our continued efforts, we have not allowed Inflation Rate to go beyond 6 percent. Not only it, currently we have come with an agreement with the Reserve Bank that it should take steps to control the inflation to 4 percent plus-minus 2 percent. Amidst the talks of the balance between Inflation and Growth, the Reserve Bank should also work further for moving ahead. There were two years drought in the country. The price of vegetables are affected instantly by the drought, shortage has its effect. Due to it, there were some problems. The two years drought also became a cause of concern due to decline in the pulses production. But brothers and sisters, had the price rise increased in the same way as it was heading earlier, I dont know what could have happened to the poor man of my country. We have tried our best to contain it. Still this government is followed with expectations My countrymans expectations are natural and I will leave no stone unturned in trying to achieve the goal. I will do my best efforts and will not let the food plate of poor person get costlier.My dear brothers and sisters, the country is preparing for the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji. How this country can forget the Saga of sacrifice, a tradition of Sikh Gurus and that too when it is celebrating the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji. Guru Govind Singh Ji said one thing very aptly. He used to say how can I consider a hand sacred if that has not served ever, not ever done any work , the hand which has not become strong by toiling hard and there are no knots upon it. This was the saying of Guru Govind Singh Ji. Today, when we are celebrating the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji, then I remember my farmer, who is the person who has more pious hands than of a farmer. Who could have a more pious heart than that of a farmer? Without it, what purpose can be more sacred than it. I salute my farmer brothers who have despite two years of drought made relentless efforts to fill the grain stores of this country.Drought situation has changed. This time, there is a good rainfall at many places. There were troubles also at some places due to excessive rain. Government of India is with those states and citizens who are in trouble. But I want to especially facilitate our farmers for increasing the sowing of pulses by one and half times at a time when the country is facing problem due to availability of pulses. The farmers had earlier shifted to other crops at a time when the demand for pulses from the common man had increased. We have fixed the MSP for pulses. We have announced bonus for pulses. We have put in place a better system for procurement of pulses. And therefore, we are encouraging farmers to grow pulses for getting big profit.When I had spoken about work culture, it is clear that we do not see things in compartments. We see things in a unified, integrated manner. Take the example of agriculture, where we have developed a work culture in a way that the entire chain can give big results.Initially we paid attention to the health of mother earth, health of the soil. We brought Soil Health Card, macro-nutrition, micro- nutrition and explained to the farmers the shortcomings and strengths of their farm lands and told them which crops can and which cannot be sown in their fields. Slowly the farmers started to plan according to the soil health cards and many told me that their expenses have come down by almost 25% and the production has increased by 30%. This is a small amount but with the spread of this information, things will move ahead. The farmers have land, if they get water they can create miracles. This is the strength the farmers of this country have and therefore we have stressed on water management, irrigation and water conservation. How to use each and every drop of water, how to increase utilization of water, per drop-more crop, Micro-irrigation- we are emphasizing on it. More than 90 irrigation schemes were lying incomplete. We have resolved to first complete these projects and lakhs of people will benefit. To reduce the input cost of the farmers, we have taken a big step towards solar pumps. Farmers need electricity, for water also they need electricity and electricity is costly. Because of solar pumps, input cost of farmers will be reduced, recurring expenses will reduce. He will now own not only his farmland but also have free electricity through solar power. My farmer will be self reliant and happy. So far, we have been successful in distributing 77 thousand solar pumps.I want to congratulate my scientists also. Along with farmland, water and solar pumps, we need good seeds also. Our scientists have developed more than 131 new variety of seeds suitable to Indias environment. These will increase per hectare yield. The quality is also increasing. I congratulate these scientists.Farmers need Urea, fertilizers. There was a time when there was black marketing of fertilizers. One had to face police lathicharge to get fertilizers. There was a time when people had to see their harvest getting ruined due to lack of fertilizers. Now, shortage of fertilizers has become an issue of past. We have succeeded in increasing the production of fertilizers. Because of this production, the possibility of farmers getting fertilizers in time has increased.Similarly, we have announced the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana  to protect the land owned by the farmer upto the produce of the farm. My fellow brothers and sisters, we have provided the maximum guarantee to the farmers at the lowest premium. We have built additional godowns to protect the 15 lakh tonnes produce.Our farmers would be benefited when we do value addition and in this direction, the government is stressing on food processing and 100 per cent foreign direct investment is being encouraged. This will benefit the agro- based industry and help fulfil my dream of doubling the farmers income by 2022.My fellow brothers and sisters, it has become a tradition in our country that successive governments have taken recourse to populist announcements and measures, emptied the state coffers to polish their image. I have tried to do away with this practise and emphasized on total transformation, transformation with transparency. Reform, perform, transform is the mantra which has been applied in all fields of work and range.My fellow brothers and sisters, my government is only emphasizing the need to build an image of the country and not of any party. Only when the countrys image is carved out, it will benefit the future generations. This is why, we have stressed on creating an image of the country and not that of the government.You would have also noticed the wide ranging work done by us in all fields. In the railways, at one level, we are talking about installing the Bio-toilets in trains and on the other hand, we also dream of running the Bullet train in the country. At one level, we are talking about the soil health card and on the other hand, we are taking strides in satellite and space technology. We not only talk about Stand-Up India but also taking steps to implement Start-Up India. We stress upon substance over symbolism. We stress upon integrated development rather than the isolated development. We stress empowerment and not entitlement.My fellow brothers and sisters, the government is identified by the new policies announced towards this end. The government ensures continuity and if the earlier government has announced a scheme which has drawbacks, then the new government should rectify the same and take it further without being egoist as arrogance has no place in democracy. In this context, our government in all humility, has given importance to the schemes and policies of the previous governments and carried them forward as part of our work culture to develop the country and improve economy towards all round development. I personally monitor the programmes through Pragati and review them. You would be surprised to know that 118 projects announced by governments costing over 7.5 lakhs crore rupees are pending at various stages of implementation. I have revived such projects and directed that they should be completed and now the government is doing so.We made a project monitoring group to which I specifically instructed to find out what were the projects that were started in the past- Some 20 years ago, some 25 years ago, some 30 years ago, 15 years ago, those which were stranded. People who are living in those areas are aware of it. We identified such 270 projects, estimated at nearly 10 Lakh crore rupees for which foundation stones were laid by any government, 1000-2000 crore rupees may have been invested in some of them but it was going waste. My brothers and sisters, hindering of plans, delays in projects and wastage of money is a criminal negligence. We have again tried to make these projects workable and viable. Brothers and sisters, clearance to Railway projects used to take 2 years. Any rail line is going and we have to make overhead bridge, there were good roads constructed on both sides but the clearance was taking more than two years. Brothers and sisters, today we are doing that in three-four months, maximum six months to give the project clearance, that speed we have attained.Brothers and sisters, whatever work we do, whatever we may plan, but we have to think on one aspect that the government is for good governance, for the delivery to the last man, how a person standing at the end of line is getting benefitted. Brothers and sisters, it is only when there is clear policy, clear intent, clean intent, then only you get the spirit for taking the decision and only then there could be decisions without any restrictions.Only due to clear policies and clear intent and clear decisions, our government is moving ahead and stressing upon delivery to the last man.We have seen, if you go through Uttar Pradesh Newspapers every year, sugarcane farmers due was a topic of discussion every time. The sugar mills do not do this, the state government does not do this, it is the farmers problem. The due was of thousands of crores, thousands of crores. We made plan for it, followed it. The target was that money should reach the last man delivery farmer. Whatever was the old due of thousands of crores, my brothers and sisters, I say with satisfaction that 99.5% old dues have been cleared. It has happened after many years for the first time. This time whatever amount of sugarcane came in the market and purchased, I can say with satisfaction that so far, 95% of the farmers have been paid for their crop and the rest 5% if remaining will be paid in the days to come.Brothers and sisters, we have taken the task of providing LPG connections to poor families. Under the Ujjawala Scheme, we have vigorously launched a campaign of making my mothers free from the smoke of kitchen. Five crore poor family will get gas stoves in three years and work is going on this project. We have reached the figure of nearly 50 Lakh families and that too in just 100 days. You can assume, that it may be possible that we could complete this work well before three years. We want to stress upon the last man delivery.Due to information technology, whatsapp, messages, online, e-mail, our post-offices were becoming irrelevant slowly. Post Office is an example of our identity. We have revived and rejuvenated our post offices. It is now linked with poor and small persons. If any government representative gets the affection of a common man in India, it is the postman. Everyone loves postman and postman also loves everybody, but we never paid attention towards them. We have taken a step to convert our post offices into payment banks. Starting of this payment bank will spread the chain of banks in the villages across the country in one go. The benefit of JAN-DHAN Account will also be available and now the MNREGA money through Aadhar Card is also getting transferred in the account of a common man leading to reduction in corruption.Brothers and Sisters, in our country, the PSUs are formed to fall in a pit, to fail, to get locked or to be sold out. That has been the history. We have tried to bring in a new culture. And today for the first time, I can say with satisfaction that Air India which had a bad image, has succeeded in registering an operational profit last year. At a time when telecom companies all over the world were earning, BSNL was falling in a pit. For the first time, BSNL has succeeded in earning operational profit. Nobody knew whether Shipping Corporation of India would ever be in profit. Today Shipping Corporation of India is making profit. There was a time when nobody knew that a powerhouse will be operational next week or not, coal will reach there or not. A number of powerhouses were being shut down due to shortage of coal used to be the news. Today, coal is available at the door step of powerhouses. They have stock available for as many months as required. Brothers and sisters, we have done this. You have seen this.At times, there are discussions about big corruption in our country. I have seen the common man at the lowest level suffers most due to corruption and it leads to wastage of money. We have linked Aadhaar Card and Aadhaar number with Government schemes. Brothers and Sisters, there was a time when we saw whether it was the widow pension, scholarship, schemes for divyangs, or for minorities, money used to go from Government coffers and beneficiaries list also used to come. But when we enquired in depth, we found there were persons in the list which were not even born. They were getting benefits of the schemes. Middle men used to siphon out millions of rupees and nobody could notice that. We drove out such middle men from the system. We transferred the money directly to the beneficiaries. We noticed that there were millions of people who never got the money. Millions of rupees used to be transferred. Now it has stopped, money has been saved, but we have said that those needy who have been left out, should be identified and the saved money should go to their accounts, to those who want to fight for their rights. We have worked in the direction of last man delivery, and we have achieved this.Everyone knows of the power of transparency, and corruption in coal sector. There are no allegations today in the auction of coal. In the days to come, as more coal will be mined by the States, more income will come.There was a time when there were allegations regarding auction of spectrum. We auctioned online and today the coffers of our country are getting filled. It led to a healthy competition and country benefitted from this.Brothers and Sisters, today the world is moving in an era of global economy. Ever nation is inter-connected and inter-dependent. The entire world is connected through economic issues in some way or the other. However, much we progress, we have to keep in mind the global economy, and global arena and we have to successfully meet the global standards and match them. Then we will be relevant, then we will be able to contribute and a time will come when we will be able to lead the global economy. Therefore, we will have to be ready at all times and align ourselves with global standards. You would have seen that in recent time, World Bank, IMF, World Economic Forum, Credit Rating Agencies and all such agencies of the world have praised Indias progress. Successive decisions of India in the field of legal reforms, systematic reforms and change in approach- are being watched by the world. In ease of doing business, we have improved our ranking very fast. India has become the most favoured nation for Foreign Direct Investment. In Growth rate and GDP, we have left behind the big economies of the world.My fellow brothers and sisters, a United Nations organization has just given a forecast about Indias future in next 2 years. According to its assessment, India, which is currently 10th in global economy will reach the 3rd position within next 2 years. My fellow brothers and sisters, global standards take into account logistical support and infrastructure while rating a country. They also compare countrys performance with developed and prosperous countries. The World Economic Forum has analyzed logistical support and infrastructure in context of India and said that India is progressing rapidly and moved up 19 steps in the rating index.My fellow brothers and sisters, in global context, Indian economy is dynamic and moving forward on predictable lines. Approval of GST law by parliament has further strengthened our economy and all political parties are worthy of praise for making it possible.My fellow brothers and sisters, from the ramparts of the Red Fort only, I talked about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. We dont work in piecemeal basis. We have an integrated approach towards implementation of our policies. I need co-operation from society to make Beti Bachao Beti Padhao a success. Each and every parent must remain alert on this front we must respect our daughters, provide them security and ensure that they get benefits of government policies. We have brought together crores of families with Sukanaya Samridhi Yojna. The scheme takes care of our daughters when they achieve adulthood. We have ensured that our insurance policies give maximum benefit to women. The Indradhanush vaccination program empowers our mothers and sisters, both on economic and health fronts. If we empower women on these two fronts and also educate them, then it will be real empowerment of women. If woman is educated, healthy and economically independent then she shall be capable of fighting poverty. That is why we are working towards women empowerment on health and economic prosperity. We have introduced Mudra Yojana and I am happy to know that more than 3.5 crore families have taken benefit of this scheme. Most of the people were the first timers to reach the doors of the bank and out of them 80% belong to SC/ST and OBC. Under Mudra Yojana, 80% loans were taken by women and how these women will contribute in economic development, this would be worth paying attention.Brothers and sisters, last week we decided that our mothers and sisters who are now partners in the development journey, need leave after delivery. Earlier, they were getting maternity leave for lesser number of days. Now, we have enhanced it it to 26 weeks so that a mother could take better care of her child.The weavers, persons working in textiles who make thread and bunch of threads, were earlier getting 100 rupees. We have enhanced this amount to 190 rupees so that, my mothers-sisters who are weaving thread, will be empowered. Those mothers and sisters and weavers who are doing silk work, for them we have increased the price of their produce by 50 rupees/meter and have decided that this amount will not go to the businessman or the broker. Instead this will go in the account of that weaver who has worked upon that silk, the fifty rupee per meter will be credited in her account through Aadhar, making my weaver empowered. We have started this scheme in that direction and its impact is visible.My dear countrymen, when we see train, post office, we also see the unity of India there. More and more efforts we make to unite India and bring change in our system, it strengthens the unity and integrity of our country. For this, we have launched a scheme Mandi e-NAM for the farmers. Today, a farmer can sell his produce in any of the market online across the country. Today, he is not compelled to sell his produce in a market 10 kms away from his fields, at cheaper rates without any income for his hard labour. Now, in the country, through e-NAM, a Network of its own kind, Mandi Network is getting established.Taxation through GST is also bound to bring equality and a common system that will also unite the country.You will be surprised that earlier there was plenty of electricity without any taker and scarcity of electricity was forcing people to live in dark, factories were closing. To bring in the change in electricity supply, we have started One Nation- One Grid- One Price system with success and that too in a very short time. Earlier, one had to pay ten rupees per unit electricity in summer season. Now, when I visited Telangana, the price of electricity on that day was one rupee ten paise/unit which used to be ten rupee. This one price results in joining the country.The worker in our country works at a place and changes his job after one-two years. His money is deducted in EPF but it was non-transferrable. You will be surprised that when I took charge of this government, 27 thousands crore rupees of my workers was stacked in the EPF, without any taker because there was no system for it.We gave a Universal Account Number to our workers for solving this problem. Now, wherever he goes, his EPF fund will also be transferred. Whenever, a labourer retires, he will get his money and it will not remain stacked in any government coffer. We have done this.Be it Bharatmala or Setu Bharatam or Bharat Net, we have strengthened such initiatives. The initiatives should be in the direction of uniting India, economic development of India and we are working in this direction.Brothers and sisters, this year is important in many ways. The country is celebrating the 1000th Anniversary of Shriman Ramanujacharya Ji, the saint from South India, the country is celebrating the 150th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhis Guru Shrimad Rajchandra Ji and the country is also celebrating the 350th Anniversary of Sh. Guru Govind Singh Ji. The nation is observing the centenary year of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay. Today, when I am remembering Ramanujacharya Ji then I want to say one thing. Thousands of years ago, and now today, when we see social tension then Ramanujacharya ji, the saint, what message he gave to the country. Ramanujacharya Ji, used to say that all the devotees of God, should serve without having a thought of discrimination and feeling of low and high. Respect everybody and dont humiliate anyone due to age or caste. What Gandhiji said, what Ambedkarji said what Ramanujacharyaji said what Bhagwan Buddha said, what our scriptures and our Acharyas, teachers, saints said, is of social unity. If society breaks, a country disintegrates, get divided in lows and highs, divided by untouchability, then my brothers and sisters, that society cannot sustain. They are evils, centuries old evils but more old evils call for rigorous treatment with enhanced sensitivity. It happens, it can go on- the problem cannot be solved by taking this line. This is the responsibility of 125 crores countrymen, the government and the society. All will have to join hands to come out of the situation of confrontation.Brothers and Sisters, we have to fight against the social evils. We have to rise above social evils. Every citizen will have to rise and only then we will able to make strong India. We cannot make a strong India without making a strong society. Only economic progress cannot guarantee a strong India- strong society is a guarantee for a strong India and a strong society is made by ensuring social justice. Strong society is built on the foundation of social justice and therefore it is our responsibility that we give emphasis on social justice. Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, villager or city dweller, educated, literate, small or big  all 125 crore countrymen are our family. And all of us will have to get together to take our country forward and we have to work in that direction only.Brothers and Sisters, today the attention of the world goes towards the fact that India is a young nation. A country which has 800 million people less than 35 years of age, which is 65% of population  what can that country not do with its youth power. And therefore, Brothers and Sisters, the youth should get opportunities, youth should get employment, this is the demand of our times.Today, when we are moving towards the birth centenary of Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay, we remember his idea about welfare of the last man. This was the idea of Mahatma Gandhi also. Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay adopted the idea of Antyoday. The welfare of the last man was the central point of the political philosophy of Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay. Under this he used to say every youth should get education, every youth should have skills and every youth should have opportunity to give shape to his dreams. To fulfil the dreams of Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay, we have taken a number of initiatives to meet the aspirations of 800 million youths of our country. In the way that new roads are being built, the country is making more vehicles, more software is being exported, more than 50 new mobile making factories have been set up, all this provides opportunity to the youth. If we have made 2 crore toilets, somebody must have got employment. Cement and iron would have come from somewhere and wood work would have been done somewhere. As the scale of work increases, job opportunities will increase and we have worked in this direction only.In order to provide skills to crores of youth of this country, we have put Skill Development in Mission mode. We have amended the law. Though a visibly small step, but will give benefit to small shopkeepers. Model Shops and Establishment Act has been approved and now we have issued advisory to states to give an opportunity to small shopkeepers so that their shops are open till midnight 365 days on the same lines as big shopping malls. Why should a small shopkeepers close his shop after evening? We should provide for that small and poor shopkeepers open their shops till midnight all 365 days. Why we should we not provide opportunity to our sisters to work at night? We have made legal provisions so that our sisters can work during the night. We must ensure their safety and security but provide them an opportunity to work. These are the measures which will generate employment and we are working towards this direction.My fellow brothers and sisters, we dont believe and my government doesnt believe in avoiding the problems. We dont delay but confront the challenges. For doing something, problem should be faced head on. When we are celebrating Independence Day, our soldiers are on the borders to face the bullets. Some are sitting in bunkers, some dont meet their sisters even on Raksha Bandhan because they are at the borders. Lot of soldiers are working in defence forces. Our 33000 policemen have sacrificed their lives post-Independence. Shall we forget them? How can we forget them as these are the people because of whom we are leading a peaceful life. That is why we must salute them on this occasion. One-Rank One-Pension was pending for a long time. We took up this challenge and resolved this issue. Every Indian solider felt happy after the One-Rank One-Pension was resolved and announced.Our people desired that we must make public the files related to Netaji Subhas Babu. With all humility, I want to say that my government took up this issue which was being ignored and avoided for a long time. We disclosed the contents of these files. Netaji Subhass family was invited and files were made public and the process is still continuing. I have also urged other countries to make public the files related to Netaji. India has a right to know about Subhas Babu and the countrys history. We have worked in that direction.Since the days of partition, there were border disputes with Bangladesh. These disputes remained unresolved for many decades. Now, with the help and cooperation of all political parties, we have resolved the border dispute with Bangladesh. The constitutional gave us the strength.My fellow brothers and sisters, middle class persons dream of constructing a house, buy a flat. Builders show nicely printed booklet to buyers to lure them. The middle class do not have technical knowledge but keep giving builders money and yet the builders dont build the houses on time. Middle class invests their life long savings and capital in this one time investment. To protect the interests of buyers, we brought forward Real Estate Bill to regulate the builders. This measure will help the middle class home buyers.My fellow brothers and sisters, as I mentioned earlier, Shrimad Rajchandrajis 150th anniversary is now on. Mahatma Gandhi used to treat Shrimad Rajchandraji as his guru. When he was in South Africa, Gandhiji was in touch with Rajchandraji through correspondence. In one of the letters, Shrimad Rajchandraji discussed violence and non-violence with Gandhiji. Rajchandraji said that due to the existence of violence, the concept of Non-violence came into existence. The important thing is to understand, which principle is important for you or which can be utilized for welfare of mankind.Dear brothers and sisters, in our country the discussion on violence and non-violence is very natural. Humanism is ingrained in our veins. We are the people of a great cultural heritage. This country is full of diversity. This bouquet of Mother India is blessed with different fragrances, different colours, and different dreams. Brothers and Sisters, unity in diversity is our greatest strength. The mantra of unity is linked to our roots. Brothers and Sisters, in a country where there are more than 100 languages, hundreds of dialects, countless ways of dressing, countless life styles, despite that this country has remained one for centuries and the main reason for this is our cultural legacy. We know how to respect others, how to become a good host and how to take all on the path of progress. We have always followed this great tradition and therefore there is no place for violence and oppression in our country. If we have to strengthen Indias Democracy and to fulfill its dreams, the path of violence can never succeed.Today in the name of Maoism in the jungles, in the name of extremism in the border areas, in the name of terrorism on the mountains, innocent people are being killed. Mother India was continuously soaked in blood, but those following the path of terrorism achieved nothing. I want to tell these youths that this country will never tolerate terrorism and will never bow to terrorism or Maoism. I want to appeal to these youths that there is still time, shun the path of violence and try to fulfill the dream of your parents. Join the mainstream and lead a life of comfort and happiness, as the path of violence has never helped anyone.Brothers and Sisters, when we talk about foreign policy, I dont want to present before you a detailed account. The day this Government took the oath of office, we had invited SAARC leaders. Our message was clear that all our neighboring countries have a common problem and that common challenge is poverty. So all we should come together to fight poverty. By fighting with each other, we all had suffered but if we all are determined to fight poverty, we will be able to come out of the sufferings and march towards prosperity. Therefore, I invite all the neighboring countries to join their efforts to fight poverty. There cannot be greater freedom than to free the people of India from poverty and to free the people of all countries from poverty. India will feel happy when the citizens of the neighboring countries come out of poverty.Dear brothers and sisters, I want to present before the world two pictures (examples) that show the difference between those people who were brought up under the influence of humanism and those who reward terrorism. I want to tell the world and those who believe in humanity by narrating the two incidents that please weigh the incident at Peshawar, where the terrorists had gunned down innocent school children. The incident happened at Peshawar, it was a terror attack. Innocent boys and girls were killed, the temple of learning was soaked in blood by killing innocent children. There were tears in the eyes of Parliamentarians. Indian schools children were crying. Every child in India felt the shock of the death of children of Peshwar. They could not stop crying. The children of Peshwar who were killed by terrorists gave us immense pain and agony. This is our culture, borne out of humanism. On the other hand, terrorism is being glorified. When innocent people are killed in terrorist attacks, there are celebrations. What kind of life is this which is inspired by terrorism? How governments are formed through inspiration of terrorism. The world will understand this difference clearly. That is enough for me.Today from the ramparts of Red Fort, I want to greet and express my thanks to some people. In the last few days, people of Balochistan, Gilgit, Pakistan Occupied Kashmir have thanked me, have expressed gratitude, and expressed good wishes for me. The people who are living far away, whom I have never seen, never met  such people have expressed appreciation for Prime Minister of India, for 125 crore countrymen. This is an honour for our countrymen.Brothers and Sisters, today when we are celebrating 70 years of Independence, we remember the contribution of our freedom fighters. Today, for the respected family members of these freedom fighters, the Government has decided to increase the pension by 20%. So the freedom fighter who used to get Rs. 25,000 earlier will get Rs. 30,000 now. This is a small offering from my side to the sacrifices made by these freedom fighters.Brothers and Sisters, when we talk about the history of our freedom struggle, a lot is spoken about a few people. In fact, in some cases, it is more than necessary. But in our freedom struggle, the contribution of our tribals living in the forests was incomparable. They lived in jungles. We may have heard about Birsa Munda but there is hardly any tribal district which did not make sacrifices since 1857 till we got freedom. What is freedom? What is struggle against slavery? They have taught us with their sacrifices. But our coming generations are not fully aware of this history. The Government desires and is planning permanent museums in the States where these tribals lived, struggled against the Britishers and refused to be bowed down. The Government will work to make such museums in different states so that the coming generations may know how our tribals were far ahead in making sacrifices.Brothers and sisters, in issues relating to price rise, some things are much talked about but our experience is that even if a person in a poor household gets sick, his entire economy is shattered. Even the marriage of daughter gets stalled, the education of children suffers. Sometimes, no food can be arranged. The health care services are getting costlier and hence today from the rampart of Red Fort, our government is announcing an important step for the health care of such families which are below the poverty line. We have brought a scheme that in future, for such poor families the government of India will incur an expenditure of upto 1 Lakh rupee so that my poor brothers are not deprived of health services and their dreams are not shattered.So, my dear brothers and sisters, lets move ahead with a new resolve, new energy, new vigor and new hope on the occasion of this pious occasion of Independence Day. Let us be inspired by the persons who sacrificed their lives for the country, live for our country, work for the country, fulfill our responsibilities and inspire others to fulfill their responsibilities. We should move ahead for the realization of one society, one dream, one resolve, one direction for achieving our goals. With this thought, once again I pay homage to the great persons, the soldiers who put in their lives in danger to protect us, remember the sacrifice of 33,000 persons, and dream of the future of the country and dedicating myself today, I call upon all of you from the ramparts of Red fort to say Bharat Mata Ki Jai.This sound must reach every corner of the worldBharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Ki jaiVande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande MataramJai Hind, Jai Hind,Jai Hind,Many Many thanksFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The reason is not just the prospect of a bumper crop on the back of a great monsoon so far, resulting in increased plantings in the current kharif season.After two torrid years of their incomes taking a hit from drought as well as poor produce realisations, Indian farmers finally seem set for better times.The reason is not just the prospect of a bumper crop on the back of a great monsoon so far, resulting in increased plantings in the current kharif season. No less important is a second factor  a gradual recovery of farm commodity prices from the lows of the past couple of years.Between January and July, the Food and Agricultural Organisations Food Price Index (FPI) has risen 8.4 per cent, from 149.3 to 161.9. This is also reflected in the global prices of most agri-commodities currently ruling higher than their levels from a year ago. Although nowhere close to their peaks  the FPI scaled an all-time-high of 237.7 in February 2011  the underlying trend suggests that farm prices may have bottomed out.A correction was inevitable after a prolonged phase of low prices. We are probably seeing that happening, though a clearer picture will emerge from the next few auctions at Global Dairy Trade (an online marketplace of New Zealands milk products giant Fonterra), said R G Chandramogan, chairman of Hatsun Agro Product Ltd, Indias largest private dairy company.In the latest fortnightly auction on August 2, skim milk powder prices averaged $1,965 per tonne, having traded at their lowest of $1,419 one year ago. The drop in prices, from a high of $5,142 per tonne in early April 2013, had led to Indias powder exports falling from Rs 2,717.56 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 292.57 crore in 2015-16. As dairies slashed procurement, farmers in states like Maharashtra were forced to sell cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre  against Rs 25-26 when exports were booming  even amidst drought-induced fodder and water shortages.But while milk powder prices may be just looking up, there is no such ambiguity with regard to sugar and cotton. Global sugar prices have almost doubled in the last one year. With ex-factory rates in Uttar Pradesh, too, firming up from under Rs 23 to about Rs 36 per kg, the pressure for hiking cane prices for growers ahead of next years Assembly elections would be obvious.The outlook for cotton prices has similarly brightened after a global slump, reducing Indias exports of the nature fibre from $3.64 billion in 2013-14 to $1.94 billion in 2015-16. The accompanying decline in domestic realisations for kapas (raw, un-ginned cotton), from Rs 5,000-5,500 to Rs 4,000-4,200 per quintal, apparently had some role in the setbacks to the ruling BJP in Gujarats district and taluka panchayat polls last November.But that has changed significantly. In the past three months alone, international cotton prices have surged from around 69 cents to over 81 cents per pound. The US Department of Agriculture on Friday forecast global ending stocks for 2016-17 at 89.61 million bales, the lowest since 2011-12 when prices were really on fire.We can expect kapas realisations to be better than last year, said Dhiren N Sheth, president, Cotton Association of India. That would be great news, especially for Maharashtras farmers who have sown more area under cotton this time. Having endured back-to-back droughts, a combination of increased production, courtesy copious monsoon rains, and higher prices couldnt have come at a better time.Neelkanth Mishra, India equity strategist for the Swiss investment banker Credit Suisse, estimates that the countrys gross value of crops and livestock production  farm incomes, in other words  registered an average annual growth of 13.9 per cent from 2004-05 and 2013-14. The contribution of global prices to this can be seen from overall agricultural exports, which soared from $7.53 billion in 2003-04 to $43.25 billion in 2013-14.The subsequent two years, however, witnessed the end of the global commodity boom. As prices collapsed, so did the value of Indias agri-exports to $32.53 billion in 2015-16. Farm income growth also slid to 4.8 per cent in 2014-15 and 2.8 per cent in 2015-16, according to Mishra.An example of what global prices can do is provided by rubber. In 2011-12, average prices of benchmark RSS-4 grade sheets were Rs 208.50 per kg in Kottayam, Kerala. On a production of 903,700 tonnes, the value of this rubber would have been roughly Rs 18,842 crore. But in 2015-16, the average price was Rs 113.06/kg, a level uneconomical for many growers. As they discontinued tapping, production fell to 562,000 tonnes and that was worth just Rs 6,354 crore  a third of what growers grossed in 2011-12.But like in other farm commodities, a mild revival of fortunes is now visible even in rubber. RSS-4 prices in Kottayam have climbed to Rs 142/kg, up from Rs 117.50 at this time last year. If replicated across other crops in a good monsoon year, there can be nothing better for the economy and, perhaps, for the NDA government as the next election season approaches.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It comprises, especially in East UP, small and marginal farmers, who are also among the poorest in the state. Gorakhpur based farmer, environmentalist and researcher, Sampoornanad Mal , said, ""About 85% of the population of Purvanchal is dependent on agriculture. The region, once known as the sugar bowl of the East, now has 14 defunct sugar mills, farmers who have abandoned sugarcane farming, and whose paddy fields have dried up for the fourth consecutive season. It is a region plagued by extreme poverty.""In his bid to provide succour, when Rahul begins the first leg of his month-long UP Kisan Yatra from Pachladi Kritpura village in Rudrapur assembly constituency of Deoria on Tuesday, he will engage with a group of flood-hit farmers who are struggling to stay afloat, many literally and most, figuratively. Also - and this is the subtext - Pachladi Kritpura and its neighbouring villages are home to the Sainthwar community, an OBC pocket that has traditionally voted for the BJP. While Rahul will stick to the farmer discourse, his team has carefully picked a BJP stronghold the Congress is keen to invade.A senior Congress leader said, ""The main aim of this yatra is to highlight the condition of the farm community. The Modi government is amassing unprecedented amounts of wealth through the taxes they are collecting through increased fuel prices. But none of this additional revenue is being passed along to the poorest in the country. Corporate loans are being written off, but the farmers who need the loan waiver are being ignored. Rahul Gandhi is fighting for these farmers.""To regain its lost ground in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Rahul's month-long UP Kisan Yatra will meander through various districts of East UP and Bundelkhand before breaking journey in Lucknow, on September 20. In a tweet he put out earlier this week, Rahul said, ""My yatra begins on September 6 from Deoria. It aims to help the poor, farmers and labourers get their rights under the government systems.""As a part of UP Kisan Yatra, Congress will also launch a door-to-door campaign to collect the 'Kisan Maang patra' - a declaration by farmers pledging their support to Congress demand for a farm loan waiver package for them - and hold a series of 'Khaat Sabhas', were Rahul is expected to engage with farmers to seek their feedback on problems and the steps the party will take to provide succour."

Mr. Gandhi said the campaign would pressure Mr. Modi and his government to address the problems of farmers.These governments [the Centre and the State] have forgotten farmers and labourers. They have not done anything to address your problems, but we will. We share the sorrow of farmers and labourers, he said. I told Mr. Modi to protect farmers because they give food to the country. To protect them, there are three ways. The first is to waive their loans. Our government had waived Rs. 70,000 crore in farm loans. But the Modi government waived Rs. 50,000 crore owed by big industrialists last year.The second step, according to Mr. Gandhi was to halve the power tariff.

The Modi government has stopped raising the MSP.""We have started this yatra to put pressure on Narendra Modji and Government of India and take farmers' problems, apathy and their fears to Modiji's ears. There will be more such sabhas across Uttar Pradesh. We will talk to farmers, hear and understand their sorrow and will make Modiji hear their plight,"" he told the farmers.The Congress leader also lamented that Deoria, once known as the ""sugar bowl"" of Uttar Pradesh with 17 sugar mills, was suffering now as all of them are now shut due to the indifference of Centre and the state government.Interestingly, soon after the congregation of farmers ended, many of them were seen jostling with each other for cots that were laid for the farmers attending the sabha.Many of them were seen taking away the cots that the Congress party had bought to lay for the ""khaat sabha""."

The price of sugar was between Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg in the retail market last year and has been steadily increasing for the past few months.According to sources, the price of sugar is skyrocketing due to fall in production which in turn is due to the closure of sugar units like Deccan Sugars Limited last year and cane farmers switching to other crops due to non-payment of arrears to them by the factory managements. Besides, the expected rise in demand has led to some traders illegally hoarding stocks and creating an artificial shortage at the commencement of the festival season.""Sugar production has come down from 3.2 lakh metric tonnes last year to 2.5 lakh metric tonnes this year. This because the sugarcane cultivation area has come down to 32,000 hectares from 45,000 hectares during the previous years. In this kharif, sugar plantation so far is just 19,000 hectares in Telangana,"" sugar commissioner Bhadru Maloth told TOI on Tuesday. Interestingly, there was about 1.2 lakh metric tonnes surplus sugar supplies last year. In view of this, the Telangana government considered imposing entry tax on sugar imports from neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as these states were dumping the sugar stocks here as they too faced a surplus.Officials recall that farmers were given Rs 2,600 per tonne including the Fair and Renumerative Price (FRP) of Rs 2,300 per quintal last year announced by the Centre. Now, the price has gone up to Rs 3,700 per quintal. ""The crop area has not only come down in Telangana, but also in other states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka due to continuous drought,"" Maloth said.Farmers blame the state government for this current crisis and rise in sugar prices. There had been uncertainty over the fate of Nizam Deccan Sugars Limited (NDSL) for the past few years. The state government had appointed a committee that is still to come out with any concrete decisions. Three units of NDSL located at Bodhan in Nizamabad, Metpally in Karimnagar and Mombojipally in Medak district had stopped the sugarcane crushing and the units were closed last year.""Of about 40,000 farmers, who cultivate sugarcane and supply the produce to NDSL, 12,000 farmers switched to other crops while another 5,000 to 6,000 moved to other crops due to drought,"" industries department officials said."

58ff24567be9e0420db2d70b,BJP to woo UP as Santa Claus,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160914/jsp/nation/story_108113.jsp,2016-09-14,"New Delhi, Sept. 13: The BJP is set to trumpet the Centre's handouts to Uttar Pradesh in the run-up to the Assembly polls but party sources said the projection would be less brassy than in Bihar. In Bihar the BJP was convinced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Rs 1.25-lakh package, announced on August 18 last year in Arrah, would be the defining moment. But not only did his opponents dub the ""gift"" a ""charity auction"" after Modi unwrapped the amount in tranches, the results made it clear it had no impact on voters. ""This time, we will nuance the Centre's contributions and link them to a macro picture of the economy,"" a Union minister said, citing the revival of a urea plant in Gorakhpur as an example. Defunct since 1990, the resurrection of the unit owned by Fertiliser Corporation could be the centrepiece of an ""alternative narrative"" being crafted by Modi and the BJP to try and mitigate the adverse fallout of the Dalit unrest against the party. ""Once the work is completed, the factory is expected to produce 13 lakh tonnes of urea annually and reduce the problem of fertiliser shortage in Uttar Pradesh besides opening up job opportunities and scaling down migration from the eastern districts,"" a BJP office-bearer from the state said. The other big element in the Centre's portrayal of itself as Santa Claus to Uttar Pradesh is the ""bounty"" purportedly showered on sugarcane growers of the western region. According to the Union minister involved in fine-tuning the sugar package, first the sugar mill owners, notorious for defaulting on payments for years on end, were compelled to give the names of the farmers owed dues. ""They could not have fudged their registers beyond a point,"" the minister said. Once it got the names, the Centre got the bank account details of the farmers and transferred the amounts it had decided to underwrite directly to them instead of routing through the mills. The minister said sugarcane farmers were being given incentives to use part of their produce to make white sugar and divert portions to manufacturing ethanol and raw sugar. Among the schemes announced by Modi since 2014, the BJP will highlight Mudra (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency) because it believes that a chunk of Uttar Pradesh's unorganised sector, which includes people from the Other Backward Classes and Dalits, has been a big beneficiary. Close to 44 lakh people have enrolled under the scheme and over Rs 15,000 crore has gone to Uttar Pradesh so far. Asked why the BJP thought the Centre's ""munificence"" would click with the Uttar Pradesh electorate when it did not with Bihar's, a party source argued: ""Bihar had made up its mind before the polls to have a certain leadership. But Bihar is a salutary reminder to the voters of Uttar Pradesh not to fall for that kind of leadership because of the problems it has brought from the crackdown after prohibition, jungle rule and Lalu Prasad's remote control."""
58f64bc67be9e031f13b1f6e,"Sugar prices cross 36k a tonne on low yield, stocks",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Sugar-prices-cross-36k-a-tonne-on-low-yield-stocks/articleshow/54372983.cms,2016-09-17,"CHENNAI: Sugar prices have crossed the 36,000 per tonne mark on the back of a drop in sugar stocks in the 2015-16 season (October-September) and an expected decline in production during the 2016-17 season.Prices have increased 14.3% since March this year. Sugar prices have been on an uptrend since hitting a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne last July. A global sugar deficit drove up prices in the international market as well. Sugar production is estimated to have declined 11% to 25.2 million tonnes in 2015-16 season.Ratings agency ICRA expects domestic sugar production to decline by about 8% to 23.2 million tonnes during the 2016-17 season. This is largely on account of lower cane availability in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to poor monsoon rainfall last year. Although the monsoons are better this year, the impact on the cane output would be seen only in the 2017-18 season as sugarcane is a long gestation crop.Domestic sugar prices are likely to remain firm in the next 3-4 quarters, given the tight domestic stock situation, analysts tracking the sector said.However, the extent of cane price increase, especially in SAP (state advised price) following states like Uttar Pradesh , is likely to have a significant bearing on the (profit) margins of sugar mills in these states, they said. While the government has imposed 20% export duty in June and also implemented stock holding limits in September, these measures haven't acted as a deterrent to the increasing trend in domestic sugar prices, said Sabyasachi Majumdar , senior vice president, ICRA. ""Sugar prices are expected to remain firm in the near term in spite of these measures, given the tight stock position. However, these measures may dampen prospects of a further significant price rise,"" he stated.""Domestic production falling short of domestic consumption is likely to continue in 2016-17, for the second straight year a shortage of around 2.6-2.8 million tonnes,"" ICRA estimated.While sugar production is expected to decline in 2016-17, an opening stock of 7.6 million tonnes is likely to result in an overall sugar availability of 30.5-31 million tonnes, which is expected to meet the domestic consumption of around 26 million tonnes.But the closing stocks are likely to be lower than the normal sugar stock level of around 6.4 million tonnes or the equivalent of domestic consumption of about three months. While mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka are likely to benefit from the rising sugar prices and the stagnant cane costs, cane pricing in UP, which is yet to be fixed for 2016-17, will be crucial for the sustainability of the profitability for Uttar Pradesh-based sugar mills, ICRA said. ""With the FRP (fair and remunerative price) of cane for 2016-17 fixed at the same level as of the previous year and sugar prices on the higher side, the profitability of sugar mills based in Maharashtra and Karnataka is likely to improve,"" Majumdar said.""However, the extent of increase in profitability could be moderated with the decline in cane availability in these regions,"" he said."

There are 177 sugar mills in Maharashtra. The sugar stock limit (37 per cent) allowed under this quota would not include exports. There are 177 sugar mills in Maharashtra.Sugar mills in Maharashtra are miffed with the Centres directive to reduce their sugar stocks to 37 per cent by this month-end, a measure aimed at keeping retail sugar prices under control.The Union government, in a letter dated September 8, has asked every sugar mill in the state to keep only 37 per cent of its stock, thus pushing them to offload the rest by September 30.The sugar stock limit (37 per cent) allowed under this quota would not include exports. There are 177 sugar mills in Maharashtra.The sugar sale in the state, on an average is 6-7 lakh tonnes. Going by the Union governments directives, mills will have to (over) sell up to 10-12 lakh tonnes of sugar before September 30 (to meet quota obligations). It means sugar will be sold at lower rates and mills would incur losses, Managing Director of Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd (Sakhar Sangh) Sanjeev Babar told PTI.When asked about the likelihood of other states facing a similar situation, Babar said, Some states neigbouring Uttar Pradesh  the largest in terms of sugar mills  do not produce sugar. Hence UP (sugar) mills get better rates (even during heavy selling). However, the neighbouring states of Maharashtra such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are major sugar producers. Thus, the state would not fetch better rates like UP.Besides, he said, the Centre has already withdrawn its export subsidy to mills, which has come as a setback to them. Now, the government is forcing mills to sell their sugar at lower rates compounding their problems.Also, the fresh directive has brought down wholesale sugar prices by Rs 150-200 per quintal. At present, sugar is traded in the wholesale market at Rs 3,200 per quintal, he said.The sugar rates were around Rs 3,400 a quintal a couple of months back, but downfall began with various restrictions introduced by the Union government, Babar claimed.Sugar mills in Maharashtra have already exported 10 lakh tonne sugar so far.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Addressing a khaat sabha in Shamli district, he said: Farmers are sitting on hunger strike in UP, but your government sold off sugarcane mills and those that remained did not make timely payments I will raisethe issue of sugarcane farmers and their pain in the Parliament.WATCH VIDEO: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At PM Modi, Says He Is Doing Dalali Of Their SacrificesOn October 3, while waiving off the interest to be paid by mill owners, the government had claimed this was being done to ensure that mills continued to function, and long term interest of farmers are protected. It had cited Section 17 of the Uttar Pradesh Sugarcane (regulation of supply and purchase) Act-1953, which states that a defaulter, exceeding 15 days from the date of deliver, would have to pay interest to farmers.But the cane commissioner may direct with the approval of the state government that no interest shall be paid or be paid at such reduced rate as he may fix, it adds.When contacted, Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said, Though there is such a provision, it is unethical. Year after year, how can the state waive off the interest due to farmers? Just for 2014-15 crushing season, the interest due is about Rs 700 crore.WATCH VIDEO: Surgical Strikes: Eyewitnesses Accounts Validate Indias Claim Of A Lethal StrikeA farmer leader from Pilibhit, V M Singh, said he will move court. There is no logic behind the government saying that this is being done for good of the farmers. Farmers are paying interest on loans they had taken from the cooperatives, but the government has waived off interest to be paid by sugarmill owners, who are just 35 to 40 in number, he added.When asked, Additional Commissioner (Sugarcane) V K Shukla said: The decision has been taken as per the Act. Payment to farmers is a continuous process if more sugar mills stop operation, it would affect future payments too.Thus, when the dues became very high due to a downfall in the market a few years ago, the interest was waived off to ensure the continuity of the mills as well as the payments to farmers.The interest on the dues, which have been waived off for 2014-15, will amount to around Rs 680 crore, he added.Source said while around Rs 1,500-crore dues have to be paid to farmers by the mills for the previous crushing season, Rs 54 crore has to be paid for the year before.Deepak Guptara, secretary of Uttar Pradesh Millers Association, said: During 2014-15, there was an unprecedented drop in sugar prices Grants were given by the state and Centre, but still, it was not enough to meet the losses. We had no other option but to urge the government to waive off the interest.He added that in the last few years, around 12 to 13 mills have been shut down, and bigger units are on way to close their businesses.Sugar is one of the biggest industries of UP. We contribute 11 per cent to the state GDP. To maintain the relationship between the farmers and mills, mills should at least remain alive, and this would ensure that, said Guptara. According to official records, around 44 lakh families are dependent on the sugarcane crop in UP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This year too, cane cultivation area is less because of water scarcity. The ripple effects of this will be seen next year also. It is natural that when production is limited, cost escalates.As per the CCDDS data, in 2014-15, sugar production in Karnataka was 49 lakh metric tonnes (MT) and in 2015-16, it was 40.05 lakh MT. This year, so far 30 lakh MT sugar has been produced. The total cane production in 2015-16 was 376 lakh MT against 300 lakh MT this year.Not encouragingPavan Kumar, SISMA president, said nationally there is a 20% reduction in cane production and 30% deficit in Karnataka.Maharashtra which meets 40% of the total needs of sugar is the largest producer, followed by Uttar Pradesh (30%) and Karnataka (25%). Tamil Nadu is gradually registering an increase in production, with a share of 6%.Though cane is an annual crop, its maturity time is October and November. If there are good rains, standing crops absorb water, which will increase the thickness of the stem, making it sweeter and profitable for the cane industry. But if that does not happen, there is further decline in sugar production, Kumar said."

Sugar has a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices.Inflation worries have clearly receded in most food items  barring sugar, potatoes and chana. Even for the last two, the current high prices may be a temporary phenomenon, as the improved soil and sub-soil moisture conditions from a good monsoon is likely to spur plantings in the ensuing rabi season.That leaves only sugar, where there is a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices. This is unlike in wheat, for which the governments own precarious stocks position is more than offset by low global prices. At about $205 per tonne, the landed cost of imported wheat in India works out to Rs 1,365 a quintal  below even the minimum support price of Rs 1,525/quintal that was payable to farmers for last years crop.In sugar, on the other hand, the 2016-17 season (October-September) has started with estimated carryover stocks of 75 lakh tonnes (lt). With output projections for the new season ranging from 220 lt to 235 lt, and expected consumption of 260 lt, the closing stocks for September 2017 would be anywhere between 35 lt and 50 lt  not very comfortable.Moreover, white sugar if imported today will cost well above Rs 40 per kg. That is more than the Rs 35-36 per kg that mills are currently realising. A clear picture  of the actual sugarcane available for mills to crush, especially in the wake of successive droughts in Maharashtra and Karnataka  will emerge by January.Either way, sugar is the commodity to watch in the New Year, when we also have the countrys largest cane producer Uttar Pradesh going for Assembly polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities that are unique to that origin. Two organisations - Lotus Progressive Centre, Nalbari, and Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Guwahati - recently submitted additional documents to the Intellectual Property India (IPI) office in Chennai to get a GI tag for boka saul, a soft variety of rice. The two organisations had applied for the GI tag last year. Tapan Baishya, secretary of Lotus Progressive Centre, said they recently submitted additional information on the paddy's historical background, area were it is grown and logo, among others, with the assistance of Assam Science, Technology and Environment Council (ASTEC). Baishya said his centre was a registered society working for the conservation and preservation of native rice varieties and that they represented the interests of farmers growing boka saul. In response to a query from the IPI office, the organisations said boka saul was a special class of quality rice famous for its value-addition properties like instant preparation of Continental delicacies and regular dishes and zero-fuel cooking requirement. The rice can be eaten after soaking it in water for 45 minutes or in lukewarm water for 15 minutes. "" Boka saul is different from other parboiled varieties of rice since there is no need of fuel for cooking. It can be made even more delicious with the addition of curd or milk, jaggery, sugar or bananas,"" Baishya said. There are two varieties of boka saul - Santi Boka and Ronga Boka. These are sown in the third to fourth week of June and harvested in November-December. Regarding the historical background, the applicants gave detailed literature dating back to Mughal era when it was recorded how Ahom soldiers subsisted on a variety of rice which was soaked in water and eaten without cooking. Other accounts included records by British officials in The Agriculture Ledger 1910 No. 1, Literature on the Races of Rices in India, Office of the Reporter on Economic Products in Government of India, Agrarian System of Medieval Assam by Jahnabi Gogoi Nath and A Statistical Account of Assam by W.W. Hunters and other literature, including poems. On the area of growth, the organisations submitted a map and details of the places after accessing data from the Assam Remote Sensing Centre. It was certified by the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Shillongani in Nagaon district. The RARS comes under Jorhat-based Assam Agricultural University. The paddy, which is sali or winter crop, is grown in Nalbari, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Goalpara, Dhubri and Barpeta in lower Assam, Sivasagar in Upper Assam and Darrang and Lakhimpur in central Assam. The information was submitted to P.K.S. Bhairapannavar, examiner of trademark and geographical indications, in Chennai. The organisations said a logo had been created for boka saul and a committee would be formed to act as an internal watchdog to ensure that the quality of the product was retained. The committee members will include a senior scientist from RARS, Shillongani, programme coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nalbari, an official of Patent Information Centre, ASTEC, regional coordinator, CEE, and project director, Lotus Progressive Centre."

The High Court issued the order on Monday while hearing the ongoing case filed by sugar millers against the stock limit. In September, the Central government issued a circular directing sugar millers to not hold more than 37 per cent stock of sugar by the end of September.

The High Court has fixed November 17 as the next date for hearing, he added.Earlier, the HC had refused to put a blanket stay on the ceiling.While no action was taken against the mills who had failed to adhere to the ceiling, around 28 mills were issued notices by the department of civil supplies. Due to its higher production, mills in Maharashtra had a higher stock of sugar as compared to those in Uttar Pradesh or Karnataka.Good price realisation in the domestic market has made millers cautious about releasing their stock. Besides, a lean upcoming season had bouyed their hopes of better price realisation in the future. Currently, around 32-40 mills in the state have more stock than the allowed limit. Sanjiv Babar, managing director of the federation, said millers might have to sell eight to nine lakh tonnes of sugar to meet the limits set by the government which may soon ease out sugar prices in the retail market.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Munnilal Ahirwar says he watched helplessly last evening as over 100 villagers, many of them women, looted bags of wheat, rice and sugar from his store at Bardua in Chhattarpur district. Ahirwar was allegedly roughed up each time he raised his voice or tried to physically stop the looters. ""I recognised most of the faces, but will the police act?"" he asked today. Police from the nearest outpost, 6km away, arrived this morning and registered a case of looting against unknown people. Long queues were seen at bank branches for the third consecutive day throughout Madhya Pradesh, while most ATMs remained non-functional for the fourth day, adding to the popular frustration. For the past three days, most rural areas have received no cash from big cities like Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which are battling their own cash problems.

He was carrying Rs 4,000 in large currency in his pocket that he had wanted to exchange. Customers ran wild when a bank at Sujdu Chungi in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, delayed the exchange of the demonetised currency yesterday saying it lacked 100 and 50-rupee notes. Some people damaged the cash counter and stoned the police when they arrived. The mob also damaged a government bus and two private cars on the street outside. Later, the police carried out a baton-charge that left Khatiza Begum, 30, and Ayesha, a two-year-old girl, injured. Some people claimed the police had also fired in the air outside the bank. During the vandalism, a few customers chanted "" Mera desh bigad raha hai (My country is deteriorating)"" - a take-off of the slogan ""Mera desh badal raha hai (My country is changing)"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted after completing two years in office in May. Eyewitnesses said the problem began at 11am when an iron net attached to the teller's window, which some customers had grabbed as they jostled to get closer to the counter, came off under their collective weight. Someone then smashed the glass pane at the counter, prompting nervous bank officials to call the police. ""The bus driver and the bank manager have lodgedcases against unidentified people,"" circle police officer Tejveer Singh said. ""We are trying to identify and arrest them."" He said the bank received cash after an hour. Some 200 angry customers waiting outside a State Bank of Travancore branch in Kerala's Kollam district allegedly broke a glass door today after the bank decided to down shutters because of the heavy rush. The police are questioning several people. Long queues formed outside bank branches across Kerala for the third day, amid complaints that the ATMs were running out of cash. An elderly man had collapsed and died while queuing to deposit cash yesterday at Haripad in Alappuzha district, while another man fell to his death from a building housing a bank branch in Kannur. People clashed with bank officials at several places in Gujarat, prompting police baton-charges and detention. Customers complained that several ATMs were closed and that banks were exchanging the demonetised notes with coins and very small-denomination currencies. ""Even hospitals are refusing to accept the larger notes,"" Ramesh Agarwal said. ""Bank officials said they had run out of the new 2,000-rupee notes and only had coins,"" said Bipin Patel. ""They have given me coins for Rs 4,000, which is very difficult to carry."" Rajesh Shah, a senior citizen, said: ""We stood in queues for two days.... We have Rs 3 lakh in our bank account but can't buy essentials. Modi should have made proper arrangements for cash."" The police caned customers who had clashed with bank officials when they refused to dispense money at a branch at Shihori in Banaskantha district. A similar incident was reported from Abdasa in Kutch. A senior assistant of the Kolhapur zilla parishad in Maharashtra was arrested on the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs 35,000 that contained 17 newly introduced Rs 2,000 currency notes, officials said. Chandrakant Sawardekar, 45, had allegedly promised to help the complainant secure a promotion as a principal in a zilla parishad-run school."

Office-bearers of Paschimi UP Transport Association (PUPTA) said that most commodities were supplied through trucks instead of trains, and if the problem was not sorted out soon, it could cause a shortage of essential commodities, including pulses and perishables like vegetables and fruits.Association members will soon conduct a meeting to get the trucks moving and send their suggestions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi State general secretary of PUPTA, Amarjeet Singh Bakshi, told TOI , ""Nearly 40% of trucks have been stranded in western UP since November 10. If the problem continues for a week, a condition of unofficial strike will prevail.""The main reason behind the trucks being stranded is that their drivers need low-denomination notes to meet expenses. ""Truck drivers need money to meet expenses on the road and we do not have enough cash in lower denominations. Even if we give them a, it will be of no use as dhaba owners and mechanics may not have enough change to give them while the drivers are on their way to deliver a consignment,"" said Bakshi.""As over 80% of the commodities are supplied in the country by trucks rather than trains, it may cause shortage of commodities, including vegetables and pulses. It can lead to spiralling prices, causing panic among citizens. To resolve the issue, we will conduct a meeting soon to suggest ways for ensuring movement of trucks. The suggestions will be sent to the PM,"" Bakshi added.Saras Wadhwa, a transporter from Bareilly, said, ""Another problem is that traders need labourers to load and unload consignments. However, if the traders too lack sufficient money in low denominations to pay wages of labourers, the latter refuse to do it, forcing loaded trucks to be stranded.""""Eatables, including rice, sugar and mustard oil are transported from Bareilly to Gujarat and other states, which send onion and refined oil here. If the problem is not sorted soon, it can create scarcity of commodities across the country,"" Wadhwa added.Virendra Gupta, managing committee member of All India Motor Transport Congress said, ""The situation in Agra is critical. It will worsen in the coming days if the government does not allow transport service operators to withdraw at least Rs 35,000 every day, as in addition to fuel and toll, we have to pay for a driver's food, his salary, vehicle maintenance expenses ."""

From east UP to the western region and when rabi (winter crop) season has set in, limited availability of cash is threatening to hit sowing of wheat, the key rabi crop. While actual sowing figures will only be available by the end of November, experts are already anticipating a sharp decline.Sampoornanand Mal, environmentalist and farmer in Gorakhpur, said, ""Government paddy purchase centres are closed in these parts and small farmers are hit badly because they have not been able to sell their Kharif harvest. There is only one paddy purchase centre among 10 to 20 villages and they are busy beyond capacity.""Farmers' inability to reap the previous harvest is also taking a toll on future purchase. Agriculturalist and member of Planning Commission, Government of UP, Professor Sudhir Panwar said, ""In UP, there is a short three-week window to sow the Rabi crop till mid-December. This varies from east to west. With farmers unable to buy seeds, farm equipment and fertilisers, sowing and farm productivity will take a hit.""Sugarcane farmers in West UP are equally concerned. Unpaid cane dues are set to rise this year, with sugar mills expressing their inability to pay for sugarcane bought last year. Shamli-based farmer Dinesh Goel said, ""Last year's sugarcane dues have not been settled yet. The mill I sold to owes me a payment of Rs 53 crore from last year's sale, and there is no clarity on what will happen this year.""While the stand off between the sugarcane farmers and sugar mills may be an old one, smaller businesses, and ancillary units are hit. Following the centre's demonetisation move, farm sales have dropped to nearly 10-15% of the annual levels, and in West UP alone, about 60% of the total jaggery units have downed their shutters. Panwar added, ""in addition to the immediate impact, the rural economy will also be impacted by the sharp decline, in the long run, of the real estate sector where a large number of rural labourers work as construction labourers, for example, at brick kilns."""
58e5415d7be9e05a951f6954,"Have old notes, will splurge",http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161120/jsp/frontpage/story_120282.jsp,2016-11-20,"Groceries being loaded into a car outside a Kendriya Bhandar store in New Delhi. Picture by Prem Singh New Delhi, Nov. 19: A bald customer placing 10 bottles of coconut hair oil in a shopping cart, a woman stacking up 15 packets of sanitary napkins, another lugging 40kg atta and 20kg of sugar and one with 20 bottles of shampoo.... It is possible that the hair oil customer has several long-haired relatives at home but the patrons of Kendriya Bhandar outlets in the capital have been getting rid of their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes like there is no tomorrow. Parked outside these government-run subsidised retail stores - where old notes are accepted like at government hospitals, milk booths and petrol pumps - are rows and rows of sedans and SUVs. People with trolleys piled with goods - perishable and non-perishable - can be seen racing to unload them all into the boots or on the back seats of their cars. The consumer is smart but the government is smarter. Today, the finance ministry slapped a daily limit. Using the old high-value notes, purchases in these stores cannot be made beyond Rs 10,000 a day, according to a notification that has surfaced in the Kendriya Bhandar outlets. Transactions above the limit can be done using valid notes or cards. Before November 8, when the Prime Minister announced the demonetisation drive, most purchases per person were below Rs 1,500. The network of Kendriya Bhandar stores was set up primarily for central government and allied employees. But there is no bar on anyone else from shopping at these stores. The profile of the clientele and the volume of business per person have undergone a transformation since November 8. ""We have had people buying groceries for Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 in the last few days. It has been mayhem. We have had to re-stock every hour,"" said an official at the Kendriya Bhandar outlet on Mahadev Road in central Delhi. ""Once people get in, we cannot stop them from buying as much as they want. We have been abused and harassed by customers waiting for their turn, but what could we have done? With today's notification, more people will get a chance to take care of their daily needs."" Taxi driver Sukhjinder Singh, who had come all the way from Mehrauli in south Delhi to the Mahadev Road outlet, vented his frustration. ""My wife has been waiting in the line since 9am today. Five hours later, she is still waiting,"" he said, as his three kids sat patiently in the car. ""People are just buying stuff as if an emergency has been declared in the country. Their trolleys are laden with stuff which will suffice for months. We, the poor, who can at the most buy Rs 1,000 worth of groceries, are left with empty shelves and old notes."" Delhi has 101 Kendriya Bhandar outlets, many of which are not accessible to the general public as they are in high-security areas. There are a few stores in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Assam. At the Kali Bari Road store in central Delhi too, the scene is much the same - people in sedans making sure their old notes are disposed of before the demonetisation rules change again while the less privileged await their turn. ""I have a huge family,"" said Rahul Desai, as he and his daughter unloaded stuff on to the back seat of their sedan with three full trolleys waiting in the queue. ""We need these things, Madam,"" he said, asked why he had bought so many bottles of glass cleaner. A group of six middle-aged women, who wheeled seven loaded trolleys out of the Mahadev Road store after a three-hour shopping spree, turned belligerent when asked for how many months they had stocked up. ""Why do you ask these questions? We are spending our own money. It is for my family,"" one of them said angrily, as another told someone over the phone to send two more cars to ferry the goods home. Rimpy Gupta, who has an export business, was open about why she had come to a government store for the first time ever to buy groceries. ""I have bought stuff that I don't need. But what to do? If I go to a bank, I will be able to exchange only Rs 2,000. But here I have spent Rs 8,500 and I am relieved that these old notes are off my chest. ""I was planning to spend much more, but couldn't because of the restrictions,"" said Gupta, who still has Rs 40,000 in old notes to dispose of. Asked what she would do with 20 cartons of fruit juices that have a shelf life, she stared. ""Oh, I will buy new ones."" At the other end of the spectrum is Amarjeet Singh, a contractor who is tired of waiting. In a fit of frustration, he said the cash limit at Kendriya Bhandar outlets should be cut to Rs 2,000 per bill. ""This has become routine for us. Stand in the line outside the bank in the morning and do the same in the afternoon at grocery stores. While you can exchange only Rs 2,000 at banks, here you can easily exchange Rs 10,000. ""So here too, the rich who can buy Rs 10,000 worth of groceries at one go are benefited and the poor whose salaries are just that much are the losers. This government has ensured that the poor suffer everywhere."""

He has tuberculosis and is too ill to continue working as a labourer.As his wife Ramkumari, 35, now supports the family by going to the forest to forage for fruits, roots and honey to sell, Banbaris job is to stay home with his five other children and newborn grandchild. When her mother died, there was no one to feed her.In desperation, Banbari even considered giving away the little baby to another family, but then she fell ill. I tried, but I did not know how to look after the baby, he says. Admitting the baby to the SNCU (special new born care unit) at the district hospital in Shivpuri could not save her life.Jasoda and her daughter arent the only ones. Each year, 55,000 women die in India from preventable pregnancy-related causes. In most cases, infections and disease are compounded by chronic hunger and malnutrition  and a lack of access to affordable pre-birth healthcare services because of corruption or caste bias.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaThe maternal mortality rate (MMR) -- deaths per 100,000 live births -- fell from 212 in 2007 to 167 in 2013 but too many women are dying still.And as the maternal death rates remain the highest in the populous states of Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the total number of women dying is also high.To tackle this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan two weeks ago to provide free antenatal  before childbirth - care to pregnant women on the 9th of every month at government health centres and hospitals across Indias 687 districts.Building on the National Health Missions flagship Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), all pregnant women must be given a physical and abdominal examination, a tetanus shot and 100 iron-folic acid tablets.They must also be tested for anaemia, high blood pressure, high blood sugar (gestational diabetes) and other problems linked with pregnancy to lower Indias MMR and infant mortality rate (deaths of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births).Motherless childWomen in the lowest socio-economic sections in India are two-and-a-half times more likely to die of childbirth, largely because they dont get the medical support they need to deliver a healthy baby. Jasodas death is a case in point.Maternal deaths are not just about a woman dying, it also adversely affects the health of newborn and surviving children, who get trapped in a vicious cycle of malnutrition, stunting and wasting, says Ajay Yadav, founder of the NGO Badlav (Change), who has been working on health and nutrition in Madhya Pradesh.Incomplete antental care also lowers the chances of the mothers and childs survival. Malti Adivasi, 19, wife of Ram Lakhan, 25, lost her nine-month-old daughter Lakshmi to malnutrition earlier this year. She had delivered in a hospital but was not given iron-and-folic acid tablets or advice on feeding her baby after delivery. Lakshmi was given the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis and polio vaccine at birth, after which she got no vaccinations.Malnutrition begins after six months when the baby needs additional nutrition, which the mother is not able to provide. Thats when weight drops and wasting sets in, making the baby susceptible to infections such as pneumonia and diarrhoea, said Pramod Tiwari from the Manav Foundation, Sheopur.State of careFrequent infections aggravate chronic hunger with most severe acute malnutrition deaths taking place between nine months and five years.Apart from saving mothers, antenatal care and institutional deliveries boost chances of newborn survival. The mother gets a tetanus toxoid shot to lower risk of infection during delivery, iron and folic acid to boost blood haemoglobin levels, and nutritional advice on feeding the newborn within the first hour of birth.Breast milk contains all the nutrients a baby needs in the first six months of life and nursing a newborn within one hour of birth delivers highly nutritious colostrum (first milk) that protects against common childhood infections such as diarrhoea and pneumonia and boosts mental and physical development.Under the JSY, all services for the mother and her newborn are free and incentives are given to families to opt for institutional deliveries, yet corruption and apathy in the public health system make the poor hesitant in accepting services.Hospital staff sometimes demand a bribe up to Rs 500 for a delivery because they know mothers get Rs 1,400 for an institutional delivery. But since that money is transferred directly to the parents bank account, villagers have no money to give hospital and clinic and so they opt for home deliveries, says Yadav.Caste plays a role in the exclusion from health services, with marginalised tribes like the Saharias losing out both nutritionally, socially and economically, says Yadav. Unless delivery becomes inclusive, children will continue to be orphaned.Case study: Halki Adivasi, 25Halki Adivasi delivered a baby boy last month and grieved for her 18-month-old baby girl Parvati three weeks later.Three of her six children died between the ages of six months and one year over the past five years and now she lives in her one-room mud and thatch hut with her newborn, her husband Vishnu, 30, and two surviving children, son Radhay Shyam,8, and daughter Anjani, 7.Halkis baby boy Anand was born at home at 2 am but the umbilical cord was cut eight hours later because her husband Vishnu Adivasi, 30, could not get a midwife.

He said the government was anti-farmer and he hadnt seen such a government in the past. Protesting the arrest of the farmers, the BJP members rushed into the well of the House and demanded immediate release of all the arrested farmers.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said farmers were arrested to ensure that they do not block the national highway and, the police have been directed to release them. Instructions were issued to the police around 9.30 am to release the farmers.Documents in MarathiMaharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES)-backed MLAs Aravind Patil and Sambhaji Patil demanded that the government provide official documents in Marathi. However, after members cutting across party lines opposed them, the two MLAs who were sporting saffron-turbans walked out of the House.After the Question Hour, the two MLAs stood up and demanded that the documents be presented in Marathi instead of Kannada. Aravind Patil who was making the demand was opposed by other members. Speaker K B Koliwad asked to members take their seats as he had not permitted them to speak.Members from the treasury and Opposition benches opposed the demand and asked the two MLAs to speak in Kannada as they know the language very well. With their demand not met, Aravind Patil and Sambhaji Patil staged a walkout.Revenue Minister Kagodu Thimmappa told the Assembly that the process has begun to simplify the administration of Revenue department and make its offices across the state paperless.Replying to Balakrishna C N during the Question Hour, Thimmappa said that as the process was on to make offices paperless, incorporating corrections in record of rights of properties has become difficult and the same would be done later.Earlier, Koliwad moved obituary references to condole the death of former legislators G Basavanneppa and S K Dasappa, senior journalist Girish Nikam and the victims of the Sundays Indore-Patna Express train accident in Uttar Pradesh."

They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesnt extend credit any longer. Chitra cant pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so, Ms. Bag told this reporter. We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit, Ms Bag said.Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer  a middle-aged man  said he could not extend any more credit as customers were paying in old bank notes.Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land  second only to Uttar Pradesh  was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the States total area. Since Bengals industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato.Ms. Bag  who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May  had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes.He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was a time-consuming affair in the potato sowing season.The potato seeds  which are tubers of the previous year  are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.Crisis timeSince stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes, Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds, warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.We are helplessThe officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur  Sethia Cold Storage  accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. We are instructed not to accept old currency notes, an official of Sethia Cold Storage said .Former president of Cold Storage Owners Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be difficult for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government should intervene.Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants federation and Bengals Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday.The problem, however, remains unresolved, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected, he warned.They are distressed as they do not have new currency to withdraw seeds from cold storage facilities"

5903f7757be9e02646bda341,New look to PDS changes lives of shopkeepers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584664/look-pds-changes-lives-shopkeepers.html,2016-12-03,"New look to PDS changes lives of shopkeepersTabeenah Anjum in Jaipur, Dec 04, 2016 0:06 ISTOm Prakash Chaudhry, a physically challenged man from Jaipur rural, has a reason to smile. Despite afflicted by polio, he is now fully occupied at his shop. His low-profile fair price shop (FPS) has received a colourful facelift and has been converted into an Annapurna Bhandaar.Like Om Prakash's shop, 5,050 FPSs have been rebranded as Annapurna Bhandaars, new supermarkets in villages in Rajasthan.Seen as a pioneering initiative in the public distribution system (PDS) to provide quality products in remote areas at cheaper prices, Om Prakash has a monthly turnover of Rs 1.5 lakh and his earnings have more than tripled from Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000.An agreement signed between Rajasthan State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation and Future Consumer Enterprise Ltd has made this possible.With thisagreement,a new era of PPP (private-public participation) model has started in the history of Indias PDS. Annapurna Bhandaar Yojna would strengthen government's effort in bringing about a positive change and bettering the daily lives of the people of Rajasthan, said Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje after the pact was signed.It is believed thatthe biggest entrepreneurship drive would make 5,000 fair price shopkeepers become entrepreneurs with Annapurna Bhandaars. The inspiration for the scheme was a model from a store at Tamatia village in Dungarpur district. During her visit to the shop, she was surprised and impressed to find a ration shop, mini ATM,selling seeds, fertilisers and grocery productsunder a single roof.The agreement aims at providing multi-brand consumer goods at competitive prices to the people. The districts topping the charts are Jalore, Jaisalmer, Dholpur, Jhunjhunu and Pali.According toPrincipal Secretary (food and civil supplies) Subodh Agarwal, theunique model will not only benefit the PDS but also improve supply chain to benefit people in cities, towns and villages. After successfully converting 5,000 ration outlets into modern shops, we are all set to convert the remaining 20,000 shops, he said.Under thescheme, only FPSs with road connectivity and at least 200 sqft space would be converted into Bhandaars. The shops will be provided with an e-mitra and mini ATM in the second phase. Two machines have been installed in Pali and Sumerpur.Did the department have a smooth sail in implementing the Bhandaar scheme. The secretary says no. He called ita willingness-based scheme. The department had to engage shopkeepers in a dialogue and convince them on the benefits that would accrue to them with the changeover. Since socio-economic conditions vary from place to place in Rajasthan, it was hard to convince fair price shopkeepers. Once they agreed, we trained them in modern practices. It has brought about a major change in the lives of shopkeepers. Earlier, they were called dealers but now they have become traders.The PDS was sellingonly a few items. But now these Bhandaars deal in edible oil, ghee, pulses, jaggery, spices, different types of attas such as maida, besan and rava, and pickles, sauces and even personal care products like talcum powder, hair oil, shampoo, creams and other consumer products.Besides supplying quality consumer goods at affordable prices to the FPS, the selling partner Future Group is training dealers in modern techniques and best management retail practices.The idea is to empower rural areas and to generate more employment. Earlier, the FPS would sell only kerosene, sugar and wheat, but Annapurna Bhandaars have over 150 products on their shelves.In the first phase we converted almost 20% of the existing FPS into supermarkets. Rebates are offered on products sold at these shops. The shopkeeper can avail a loan to start his venture under the Prime Minister Mudra scheme for which tie-up has been made with banks,saidPreeti, General Manager, Marketing and Administration, Food and Supplies Corporation, Rajasthan.Earlier,teenagers and youth were reluctant to visit the shop and help their parents because of its profile. But nowthe scene is different.Upgradingmy old shop into Annapurna Bhandaar has brought a new life. Earlier, I used to work for just 5-7 days in a month for public distribution centre and earn Rs 6,000. Now, I open the shop throughout the month and earn Rs 25,000, said Suresh Kumar Sharma, Annapurna Bhandaar owner at Bhambori village on theoutskirtsof Jaipur.His wife Bimla Bai, who helps him, added, Earlier my husband used to sit idle at home after the completion of distribution of items under the PDS. Now he opens his shop 8 am and closes late in the night. He has become active and healthy, she said with a chuckle.Interestingly, a few retail shops had closed down after Bhandaars commenced. The scheme has certainly proved to be a success as many shops selling non-branded and inferior quality products had to down the shutters within months of Bhandaars began working. Most consumers shifted their preferences and started buying packed and branded items which are available at a cheaper rate, Lokesh Chandra, District Coordinator for Annapurna Bhandaar Yojna, said.The Future Group takes back unsold items within the expiry period.According to the Future Group's head for this scheme,Satish Sharma, this is the world's first entrepreneur model which has created a record by giving employment to thousands of people, quality food to consumers in just a few months.We started the scheme with the Rajasthan government by conducting a pilot by testing multi-brand consumer items provided at five shops in Jaipur and one in Udaipur in 2015. After getting positive response, the work started and we achieved the target before time. The group alone has given employment to 2,000 people, including 13 district coordinators, 1,000 employees on payroll and 1,000 others who work as transporters, loaders etc. A total of 13 warehouses store the goods, he said.At least12 states, including Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have visited the districts to study the module and have shown interest in replicating it in their states. The success report has also been sent to Harvard University by the Future Group."

Deve Gowda, former Union Agriculture Minister and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and senior Janata Dal-United leaders Sharad Yadav and K.C. Tyagi.With its Jat following defecting almost en masse to the BJP on a tidal Hindutva wave in the general elections of 2014, the RLD has since been working hard to reclaim its base.Milling mass of flagsOn Monday afternoon, the Jats of western Uttar Pradesh turned a generous stretch of Parliament Street, from close to Parliament House to Patel Chowk, into a milling mass of green and white party flags, sugar cane sticks and white party caps, cheering their leaders.Indeed, if the gathered Opposition leaders strongly delivered their message on the negative impact of demonetisation  the disruption in the sowing and marriage season, the long lines at banks, the return of migrant labour to the villages with their employers unable to pay them any longer because of the cash crunch etc., the RLD had a special interest  the impending assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.A woman leader who addressed the rally said: The money our mothers and sisters saved for a rainy day has now been tagged as black money.Not surprisingly, the RLD chief Ajit Singh received the biggest cheers.If outlawing Rs. 1,000 notes was to end black money, why has the government introduced Rs. 2,000? Was it to make it easier to accumulate black money? he asked.Peoples painTaking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, If speeches could fill stomachs, he would be the greatest leader. It is time he started understanding peoples pain, the fact that of the nine crore farmers in the country, over 50 per cent are in debt.

When the 45-year-old finally reached the bank at 11 a.m., 40 other farmers were already in queue.Tempers run highIn fact, some of them had been waiting long before the bank opened for the day. By the time the clock struck 2, tempers were running high and patience low. A fight broke out when someone tried to jump the queue. When Jasbeers turn came, he was given just Rs.5,000 instead of the Rs.24,000 he was expecting. This infuriated the sugarcane farmer, who recently got lakhs of rupees as purchase price for his crop. The money was transferred directly to his account by the mill.It has been a month since the Narendra Modi government announced demonetisation and limited withdrawal of cash. Going by what the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have to say, the situation looked distressing, to say the least.How do I survive on just Rs.5,000? How is Rs.5,000 enough for a farmer to run his family and do farming, asked Jasbeer, who has a wife and three sons, while on the way back to his village. He added that his tractor alone drank fuel worth several thousands when used for ploughing. He went on to list the various problems faced by farmers due to demonetisation.Extremely frustratingThis is extremely frustrating. There is simply no cash in the bank. Every time we complain, the bank manager asks us to approach Modi ji . How are the farmers supposed to work when it is getting extremely difficult to run the house itself?Rambeer Singh, another farmer from his village, said sugarcane farmers needed to access the money transferred to their account by the sugar mills as soon as possible.The money is crucial for the next season, but farmers are unable to access it right now. Because we are unable to withdraw our money, which we got after selling the sugarcane to the local mill, it will adversely affect our ability to sow the next crop. This will affect the production of sugarcane as well, said Rambeer.Rambeer sold 600 quintal of sugarcane as per the State Advised Price of Rs.315 per quintal and got Rs.1.89 lakh in his account. Though unable to withdraw the money for the next seasons crop, he is still able to manage thanks to his sons, who work in the National Capital Region.My sons gave me some money, which I used to sow the next seasons crop after cutting sugarcane from the field. But not every farmer is as lucky as me, he asserted, adding that there is no ATM in his village.One of the worststeps for farmersThousands of villages in western Uttar Pradesh dont have an ATM and people are forced to travel one to five km just to access their money. Even then, there is no guarantee that they will get the money, says a visibly agitated Rambeer, who called demonetisation one of the worst steps for the farmers.Far away from Satla, serpentine queues running into several kilometres can be seen outside a sugarcane mill in Baghpat.Sugarcane farmers have been waiting to get the crop weighed and sell it to the mill. The crushing season started in November. The money was transferred to their account last month itself. However, they have been unable to withdraw the money.Farmers weredying anywayDemonetisation couldnt have come at a worst time. Farmers were dying anyway. They cant even get whatever little cash they had at their disposal, which has made their plight worse, said 52-year-old Satveer Singh, who was waiting with a tractor full of sugarcane outside the mill.A farmer needs cash at every stage of farming. It is a tragedy if he cant access the meagre amount he has at his disposal, said Satveer, who is yet to start sowing the next seasons crop.Boon for middlemenThe delay in sowing the next seasons crop even by a day affects the final productivity. We have to do it by November 15. If we delay the sowing by a week, it decreases productivity by as much as 30 per cent. So you can understand how the cash crunch will affect the productivity of the next seasons crop, he explained.Adding to the farmers woes is the fact that cash crunch has come as a boon for middlemen and brokers, who have been doing their best to exploit sugarcane farmers and buy their crop at a much cheaper rate in cash.The cash crunch has made middlemen extremely prosperous, while the farmers are more vulnerable. The brokers have been offering a rate as low as Rs.225 per quintal in cash. Farmers who dont want to stand in line and need money urgently had no choice but to sell their produce to the brokers, he said."

He also lashed out at the previous government for lapses in initiating measures to curb the black money menace.Under the PDS, the government supplies fuel (kerosene), foodgrain and other essential commodities like sugar to poor families at subsidised rates. In rural areas, it is a major source for lower middle class families. The government is also planning to provide biometric ration cards to weed out fake cards that are used for black marketing foodgrains and fuel meant for PDS.Further, POS will be made available at 30,000 citizen facilitation centres in villages for farmers. Fadnavis added that all state government initiatives will gradually go cashless. The government plans to train 1,000 college students as volunteers to educate citizens about cashless transactions.Fadnavis dismissed allegations that foreign-linked payment gateways, such as PaytTM, were controlled by China or the Alibaba group. He said that there was no question of any apprehension of foreign country involvement.Responding to the Oppositions concern that the rural economy in Maharashtra is getting affected due to the Centres decision to not allow rural cooperative banks to conduct transactions in demonetised currency, Fadnavis said he would be leading a delegation of all party leaders on Thursday to meet Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and request for restrictions on cooperative banks to be lifted.Earlier, launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led government at centre over demonetisation, the opposition in both the Houses of the state legislature accused the government of making lives difficult for the rural population by banning acceptance of high-value notes in cooperative banks.Initiating the debate in the state assembly under rule 101, former chief minister and senior Congress member Prithviraj Chavan pointed out that by banning the transactions by cooperative banks, the Union government was destroying the rural economy.He alleged that the decision was taken with an eye on the Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Can the BJP and Fadnavis say under oath that the black money was not used in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014? Did they use debit and credit cards for electioneering? Chavan quipped. Attacking the ruling party, Chavan said that surprisingly, the government was promoting foreign linked payment gateways like Paytm.Ridiculing the cashless economy, Chavan said nowhere in the world had the cashless economy been fully implemented.Countering Chavan ,Fadnavis said the previous government had failed to ratify a United Nations treaty on black money which was waiting since 2004.Between 2004 to 2011, BJP led government at the Centre signed the treaty, thereby allowing access to accounts of all Indians in foreign banks.The opposition also came down heavily on the government over the issue in the upper house of the legislature.READ MOREMaharashtra guv asks universities to go cashless, accept fees through online bankingDemonetisation: Fee payments in Maharashtra may soon go cashless"

Just because people have been forced to return cash into the low cost current accounts and saving accounts (CASA), leading to a huge pile of deposits in the banks, does not mean the RBI can go around slashing interest rates even though its own estimates of lower Gross Domestic Product or Gross Value Addition, as it is now called, might have justified a rate cut. But then, as was pointed out in the latest credit policy statement, several key factors which could lead to inflation rising again, weighed on the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to apply brakes on lowering the lending rates. The principal factors, as enumerated in the policy document, relate to risks emanating from the US interest rates trajectory and base advantage on inflation disappearing in the next few months.The RBI document has conceded that upturn in the prices of several items has been masked by the easing of inflation on base effects. In any case, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up, something the government can ill-afford ahead of Assembly elections in important states, including the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. Insofar as a cautious stance on the rate cut is concerned, the RBI cannot be faulted; after all, it is a question of assessment and it is better for a central bank to be conservative despite conflicting pressures, even at times from the government.But one had wished the same sort of conservative approach and steadfastness was shown by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, who seems to have toed the line for scrapping the notes of high value from November 9. Both the RBI governor and the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley cannot just get away by saying the disruption to the economy and pain to people was factored in before announcement of demonetisation. Even if they had factored in the disruptions, the government and the RBI have gone terribly wrong in assessing the gravity of the situation which is evident in the lives of ordinary citizens. Central banks are not meant to be cheer leaders of the government in all cases; they must be watchdogs instead!"

(Express Photo: Subham Dutta) Farmers at a sugarcane plantation in Murshidabad. (Express Photo: Subham Dutta)What should have been a sweet season for cane growers in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh (UP) is turning out to be a bitter one, with prices of both sugar and gur falling thanks to demonetisation. It has meant reduced bargaining power for farmers, even with Indias total sugar production slated to dip from 252 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2015-16 to 225 lt this season and UP being the sole state seen to record an increase from 68.55 lt to 75 lt-plus.Since demonetisation happened on November 8, ex-factory sugar prices in UP have eased from around Rs 3,600 to Rs 3,450 per quintal. The drop has been even more for gur, where prices at Hapur have plunged from Rs 2,800 to Rs 2,400 per quintal.Watch What Else Is making NewsDemand is subdued, as there is little cash available in the market. Traders are buying sugar only for day-to-day requirements and not for stocking up. This time, we expected them to purchase more at the seasons start (mills began crushing last month), given the overall tight supply position. Instead, they are waiting and watch. Without liquidity improving, we dont see prices going up, said a UP miller.Its worse with gur, where the business is entirely cash-based. The kolhus  which typically crush 10 tonnes per day of cane, as against the 5,000-tonnes or more capacity of sugar mills  were offering farmers rates of Rs 280-300 per quintal in the period immediately preceding demonetisation. But now, they are paying Rs 220-240/quintal.Many of them have shut down because they dont have the cash to run. Although the UP government has announced a state advised price (SAP) of Rs 305/quintal for this season, mills will be under no pressure to pay because there is no competition from kolhus to purchase our cane, noted Jitender Singh Hooda, a farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district.UP mills  basically those belonging to the UK Modi group, Simbhaoli Sugars, Mawana Sugars, Rana Sugars and Bajaj Hindusthan  are still to pay Rs 1,028.75 crore out of the Rs 18,003.21 crore worth of cane that they bought from farmers in the 2015-16 season at the SAP of Rs 280 per quintal. While the Akhilesh Yadav government has increased the SAP for the current season, keeping in view Assembly elections early next year, falling sugar prices can make it difficult for mills to pay.This has come at a bad time. We were looking for a good season because low sugar output in drought-hit states like Maharashtra and Karnataka should have benefited us. But with sugar and gur prices coming down, our hopes are dashed. Even if prices increase later with cash and demand returning, it will not matter, as we would already have supplied our cane by then, added Hooda.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58e512bda3d24b4437c4ad6b,Cash crunch a bitter pill for sugarcane farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/Cash-crunch-a-bitter-pill-for-sugarcane-farmers/article16781893.ece,2016-12-09,"At 3 p.m. on Tuesday, the queue outside the small building that houses the Punjab National Bank at Satla village on the outskirts of Meerut only got longer with each passing minute.Jasbeer Singh hopped on to his tractor in the hope of finally getting his hands on some cash from the nearest bank, located a kilometre away from his home at Bahadurpur village. When the 45-year-old finally reached the bank at 11 a.m., 40 other farmers were already in queue.Tempers run highIn fact, some of them had been waiting long before the bank opened for the day. By the time the clock struck 2, tempers were running high and patience low. A fight broke out when someone tried to jump the queue. When Jasbeers turn came, he was given just Rs.5,000 instead of the Rs.24,000 he was expecting. This infuriated the sugarcane farmer, who recently got lakhs of rupees as purchase price for his crop. The money was transferred directly to his account by the mill.It has been a month since the Narendra Modi government announced demonetisation and limited withdrawal of cash. Going by what the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have to say, the situation looked distressing, to say the least.How do I surviveon just Rs.5,000?How do I survive on just Rs.5,000? How is Rs.5,000 enough for a farmer to run his family and do farming, asked Jasbeer, who has a wife and three sons, while on the way back to his village.He added that his tractor alone drank fuel worth several thousands when used for ploughing. He went on to list the various problems faced by farmers due to demonetisation.Extremely frustratingThis is extremely frustrating. There is simply no cash in the bank. Every time we complain, the bank manager asks us to approach Modi ji . How are the farmers supposed to work when it is getting extremely difficult to run the house itself?Rambeer Singh, another farmer from his village, said sugarcane farmers needed to access the money transferred to their account by the sugar mills as soon as possible.The money is crucial for the next season, but farmers are unable to access it right now. Because we are unable to withdraw our money, which we got after selling the sugarcane to the local mill, it will adversely affect our ability to sow the next crop. This will affect the production of sugarcane as well, said Rambeer.Rambeer sold 600 quintal of sugarcane as per the State Advised Price of Rs.315 per quintal and got Rs.1.89 lakh in his account. Though unable to withdraw the money for the next seasons crop, he is still able to manage thanks to his sons, who work in the National Capital Region.My sons gave me some money, which I used to sow the next seasons crop after cutting sugarcane from the field. But not every farmer is as lucky as me, he asserted, adding that there is no ATM in his village.One of the worststeps for farmersThousands of villages in western Uttar Pradesh dont have an ATM and people are forced to travel one to five km just to access their money. Even then, there is no guarantee that they will get the money, says a visibly agitated Rambeer, who called demonetisation one of the worst steps for the farmers.Far away from Satla, serpentine queues running into several kilometres can be seen outside a sugarcane mill in Baghpat.Sugarcane farmers have been waiting to get the crop weighed and sell it to the mill. The crushing season started in November. The money was transferred to their account last month itself. However, they have been unable to withdraw the money.Farmers weredying anywayDemonetisation couldnt have come at a worst time. Farmers were dying anyway. They cant even get whatever little cash they had at their disposal, which has made their plight worse, said 52-year-old Satveer Singh, who was waiting with a tractor full of sugarcane outside the mill.A farmer needs cash at every stage of farming. It is a tragedy if he cant access the meagre amount he has at his disposal, said Satveer, who is yet to start sowing the next seasons crop.Boon for middlemenThe delay in sowing the next seasons crop even by a day affects the final productivity. We have to do it by November 15. If we delay the sowing by a week, it decreases productivity by as much as 30 per cent. So you can understand how the cash crunch will affect the productivity of the next seasons crop, he explained.Adding to the farmers woes is the fact that cash crunch has come as a boon for middlemen and brokers, who have been doing their best to exploit sugarcane farmers and buy their crop at a much cheaper rate in cash.The cash crunch has made middlemen extremely prosperous, while the farmers are more vulnerable. The brokers have been offering a rate as low as Rs.225 per quintal in cash. Farmers who dont want to stand in line and need money urgently had no choice but to sell their produce to the brokers, he said."
58e53acba3d24b500504a850,A leap into the digital world,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-leap-into-the-digital-world/article16787197.ece,2016-12-10,"all things for all people:Common Services Centres are an organic response to the growth in demand for digitised government services that a static state machinery cannot keep up with and the free market has seemingly ignored. A Common Services Centre in Malegaon. (Below) Another in Uruli Kanchan near Pune, Maharashtra.PHOTOs: AJAJ SHAIKH & arunangsu roy chowdhuryThe first floor office in Malegaon, in Maharashtras Nashik district, raises its shutters. The only remarkable things about it are its address  it sits at Tension Chowk, perhaps named as counterweight for a nearby road, optimistically called Aman (peace) Chowk  and the board outside advertising it as an Aadhaar enrolment centre.By midday, on December 2, there is the usual bustle of small commerce and this office, which many people think is a government outlet of some kind, sees its usual group of 10 or 15 people gathered around. Inside, a rate board on the far wall informs people that this is not just a place where you can get an Aadhaar card. There are a range of services listed, from providing caste, nationality and domicile certificates, to facilities such as online railway ticket bookings and electricity bill payments. The other clue that it is more than a sleepy Aadhaar enrolment centre is a small board next to that one, with a Bank of Baroda logo.Behind a single desk with two computers, a young woman accepts withdrawal slips, asks customers to place their thumbs on a small fingerprint-reader, and dispenses cash from a small drawer beneath the desk once they are verified. In effect, this office is an informal mini bank. And since November 15  when the government increased the holding limit of cash that such centres can stock per day to Rs.50,000 so that money can be easily available  it has been a lifeline to a cash-starved populace. That is, to those of the citizenry who know its exists.The Tension Chowk Aadhaar Enrolment Centre, run by an entrepreneur, Sajid Shaikh, is just one of a vast network of Common Services Centres (CSCs) that you are likely to see in virtually every small town and thousands of villages across the country. The CSCs help people apply online for a range of services  passport registration, PAN cards and Aadhaar cards, and a whole host of other certificates  without them having to visit a government office. CSC operators scan documents and upload them through a portal to the relevant government office that will then send back a completed certificate or card. They are like cybercafes, except they connect only to Digital India.Over the past two or three years, a huge number of these centres have added services like banking and insurance to their offerings. In a sense, they are an organic response to the growth in demand for digitised government services that a static state machinery cannot keep up with and the free market has seemingly ignored.When this correspondent visited the offices of other CSCs who were banking correspondents, it became clear that awareness of their existence  leave alone that they had cash to dispense  was low. This while at the Bank of Barodas main branch in Malegaon, a sign in Marathi has been out at midday, informing people that the bank has run out of cash. There are hundreds of restive people waiting in line outside each formal bank. It was only yesterday that the bank manager put out a sign with the numbers of some Common Services Centres, who are also banking correspondents, asking people to come to us instead, Shaikh says. Since then, a few more people have turned up to open Jan Dhan accounts. In Malegaon alone, there are four centres like his affliliated with the Bank of Baroda while a few others are tied to either the State Bank of India or the Bank of India, he says.Bridging the gapThe concept of CSCs was approved in 2006 as part of the National e - Governance Plan. CSCs are set up in a public-private partnership mode, with a designated state agency being a franchisor of sorts for village level entrepreneurs (VLEs) to set up centres. While VLEs come from various backgrounds  Shaikh used to run a business selling stamp paper before he started his centre in 2014; another CSC operator in Malegaon, Deepali Lad, says she used to run a business providing BSNL connections  they must meet a set of minimum requirements. They must have passed a matriculation-level examination by a recognised board, be fluent in reading and writing the local language, and make arrangements for infrastructure (a room of minimum 100-150 sq ft with two personal computers and two printers).According to Union Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad, when he became Minister there were only about 80,000 CSCs and now there are close to 2,00,000 CSCs across India. The National Democratic Alliance government renamed the project CSC 2.0 and announced plans to scale up to the point that there is at least one centre in each of the 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in the country. At current growth rates, the number of CSCs could be over 3,00,000 by the close of 2017.A thriving ecosystemFrom conversations with CSCs across the country, the average cost of setting up a small centre, land and building costs included, ranges from Rs.2.5-3 lakh. VLEs usually record 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per month. While the geo-locator tool on the projects website has been under maintenance for the past week, other sites like apna.csc.gov.in list centres in virtually every district in every State, suggesting that this is a business growing very quickly.The world of CSCs and VLEs is now a separate ecosystem in itself, perhaps best captured by a monthly magazine called CSC Tarang: A Silent Revolution in Rural Entrepreneurship that was started in October 2015 by CSC e-governance services, the nodal agency in Delhi that administrates the project. The magazine is an excellent window to the profession, featuring profiles of successful VLEs from across India and stories of those who have successfully set up centres in villages that fall under the Maoist belt in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, or in remote areas in the Northeast. It even has a monthly counter for the top five VLEs of the month, based on the number of transactions recorded on the CSC portal. VLEs usually record 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per month. On a consistent basis, VLEs from Gujarat and Chhattisgarh feature in these lists.In the November 2015 edition of the magazine, Dr. Dinesh Tyagi, the CEO of CSC e-services (whose notes usually start each issue), writes that despite agreements being signed with all public sector banks and a few private sector banks for CSCs to become banking correspondents, only 30,000 across the country had done so. He encourages more to get on board so that they can create the largest network of banking outlets in the world.For this years December edition, a month after demonetisation, Tyagi says that CSCs have been assigned to participate in the digital financial literacy programme of the government by going out and training at least 10 merchants and 40 citizens each in the use of digital financial tools for transactions. He says the State team and district manager would soon get in touch with each CSC to explain more about the programme. Work on the whole project should be completed by the end of December, he adds.Intent versus realityOn the afternoon of December 6, in the small town of Uruli Kanchan near Pune, Baba Rao Sawant is having a conversation with the district manager about CSCs. Its not about the digital literacy programme but about a fresh rigmarole involving banking services for his CSC. The district manager is telling me that the banks are finding it really difficult after demonetisation and it would really help if some of the crowds can be diverted to centres like mine, he says. There is some confusion about who has to send the appropriate letter to whom and the process for now has been stalled.Eight years ago, Sawant helped his wife Ujjwala register for one of the first CSCs in Maharashtra. They started with the basic range of certificates and services before moving on to offering banking and insurance services. Ujjwala managed to recruit several other women to help out and they formed a self-help group, all of them operating as VLEs. From a collection of small centres, Sawant then opened a larger space in 2013. It was like a mini Mantralaya [the Maharashtra state secretariat] in a large space, with 13 different counters for various services, he says.Three years later, Sawant says that the government system is not evolving quite as fast as he would have liked his business to, and that he had perhaps tried too soon to be all things to all people: We tried to scale up but the problem now is that despite the government saying that all these services are online, much of the work had to be done offline. Even though we got documents uploaded and scanned copies back, they still had to be taken to a corporation in Pune to get an official stamp. The other problems, he says, are that there is little done to educate the public about what CSCs can do and that he feels that he is often in competition with the local government. Rather than organising, say, an Aadhaar camp on their own, if the local officials just informed people about centres like ours we could get every single person in our area registered for Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts in no time.As numerous as the VLE success stories are, there are many who believe they are on the threshold of something big but havent quite made it yet. The networks obvious potential to bridge policy and people is hampered by inconsistency in government mechanisms and the legal framework that it needs to rest on. The system works well at the moment because of a combination of good entrepreneurial skill and luck.In Chhattisgarh for instance, Krishna Kumar Sharma, who runs a centre in Dhamtari, says he is able to offer 34 types of certificates to his customers seamlessly. All the documents come with the digital signature of the officer and there is only a delay if he has been transferred or something, he says. Besides certificates and passport and PAN card registrations, his centre offers banking and insurance as well as a small cybercafe space where people are trained in digital literacy. Sharma, a former software engineer, says that since he started the centre in 2013, more than 15 members from his family have joined him in the venture.On the other hand, in an urban centre like Surat, Jagdish Baldania, a VLE who consistently tops the Tarang charts, says that he has consciously chosen to limit his offerings. People come to my centre mainly for PAN card registrations, mobile and D2H recharge, and election-related work like checking if their name is in the rolls, etc. If I started offering more services, there would be delays and people might stop coming. He says already four other CSCs in his area have closed down and his is the only one operating, a stroke of luck.One of the main reasons that Baldania doesnt print certificates is because of the possibility of having to do offline work. Here he alludes to an issue of privacy and regulation: People think of me as a government employee so I dont want to do services that require a process that is outside the online system. What if they have some difficulty a few years later and they come back to me?In Uruli, Sawant also expressed a similar concern, mentioning that though he was registered as a VLE through an Aadhaar registration, he hadnt actually signed a formal agreement with anybody, which left a niggling doubt about his legitimacy.A collection of CSC operators that this correspondent spoke to from other States expressed other concerns. Many say that they have applied to become banking correspondents but there has been a delay in getting permissions while others in States like Odisha and Uttar Pradesh mirror Sawants concern that there is not enough awareness and consequently not enough potential for growth.Reaching the ignoredThe CSC network remains an idea  and a network  with huge potential, but it needs work. To get a clear idea of how much difference a CSC run by a VLE with ties to the community can make, one has to look at the remoter villages.Take Hingangaon, a village about 15 km from Uruli. While it doesnt have a CSC, there is one a few kilometres away, at a junction called Pimpri, where two petrol pumps and a few shops line the road. One of these shops, the only one doing business by late afternoon, is an e-service kendra. There is an orderly queue of about six or seven persons inside, three of whom have come for Aadhaar registration.Two staff members sit behind a counter. In an inside office, Sameer Sawant, a wiry 25-year-old who runs this establishment, is tallying up some numbers. Three years ago, Sawant thought of starting this centre because it was a great business opportunity. While working as a computer teacher in Uruli Kanchan, he had seen hundreds of people come to register for Aadhaar cards at CSCs and thought of starting his own. He chose Pimpri since it was close to his village and could also service four other villages in the area.Sawant shows us a small flyer that he has made for his centre that he distributes in the villages. It is a rate card that lists about seven or eight digital services, banking facilities for the Bank of India, and a few other small services like printing visiting cards that he does outside of the CSC roster. Through all this, Sawant says his centre manages to make a monthly income of about Rs.25,000-30,000 a month. Its not much, but he is optimistic. Many of the services have to be done offline so we have stopped that. But if I was able to offer more services, my business would grow. If someone comes for Aadhaar, I would like to also get him registered for a PAN card. There is a school close by here and during admission time students may need domicile or caste certificates, he says.On a phone, we show him a letter from the Ministry of Information and Technology explaining how VLEs like him should educate people on digital financial transactions. As he goes through the letter, his eyes light up. This is what I have been talking about, he says. I met an old man this morning for whom I had enabled e-banking. He was going to go all the way to Uruli to see whether a cheque he had deposited had been credited to his account but I explained to him that he could check this on his phone.He continues: There are also some workers from U.P. and Bihar who work in the sugar factory close by and I have been talking to them about how they can transfer money back to their families without incurring bank transfer cost. That amount makes a difference to them so things like e-wallet should be an option.CSCs, it is clear, could have a much larger role to play in moving forward in the coming weeks and months. For now, theyre scratching the surface.Rather than organising an Aadhaar camp on their own, if local officials informed people about centres like ours we could get every single person in our area registered for Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts in no time -Baba Rao Sawant,VLE"

58d6d98da3d24b1894a6bf88,Producers pushing centre to mandate higher ethanol percentage in petrol,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Producers-pushing-centre-to-mandate-higher-ethanol-percentage-in-petrol/articleshow/56072347.cms,2016-12-20,"NAGPUR: The central government's plan to increase ethanol blending percentage in petrol from 10% to 22.50% is going to affect citizens in the state the most. The move is being pushed by the strong ethanol producers' lobby in the state, which will benefit the most from producing more ethanol to meet the increased target.TOI had earlier highlighted the issue of ethanol in petrol getting converted into water, and even the Vidarbha Petroleum Dealers Association (VPDA) had taken it up with the district administration after their complaints were ignored by the public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).MP and union minister Nitin Gadkari had then spoken of centre's plan to take the blending proportion up to 22.5% in the near future.The data available with VPDA shows that total ethanol blending percentage in petrol across the nation is less than 3%, even though the mandatory norm is 10%. This is attributed to the less availability of ethanol.""Around 10% ethanol is being blended in petrol throughout the state. Uttar Pradesh leads in sugar cane production. But Maharashtra leads in ethanol production. There are 61 ethanol producing units in the state and only 34 in UP. Some 96.37 crore litres of ethanol is produced in the state while the figure is 91.85 crore litres in UP. The ethanol producers, who had earlier pushed for raising blending percentage from 5 to 10%, are now pressing for increase up to 22.50%,"" VPDA office bearers told TOI.Selling ethanol to OMCs is very profitable since they are bound to purchase it at Rs 49.50/litre against a production cost of Rs 36.20/litre. Ethanol producers do not sell their production to chemical industries, which are clamouring for supply, because they pay a lower rate.In a question hour reply in Lok Sabha during the March budget session, OMC ethanol procurement was said to be 39.81 crore litres per year in the state. This is far less than the production in the state, which is 96.37 crore litres. Even if the blending percentage is increased to 22.50%, the requirement will rise to around 48.76 crore litres, which can be easily met from the state's production.Petroleum dealers, however, see this as a setback. The ethanol in petrol in underground tanks at petrol pumps is bound to convert into water due to various reasons, which will result in higher financial loss for dealers and consumers alike, they say.""After the blending percentage was upped from 5% to 10%, we received several complaints from consumers. As such, 22.50% blending of ethanol during rains can pose a major problem,"" said a dealer on condition of anonymity.VPDA has taken up the issue with the OMCs, and a meeting is scheduled on this issue in December-end."

The sale proceeds will be used to repay its existing debt.Total indebtedness of the Uttar Pradesh-registered sugar manufacturer stood at Rs 7,074.87 crore in 2015-16. The scrip today surged 2.02 per cent to Rs 13.64 on the BSE.The company's board today ""considered approval of the sale and transfer of its co-generation power business of an aggregating capacity of 449 megawatt at 14 locations to Lalitpur Power Generation Company for a lumpsum consideration in cash of about Rs 1,800 crore, as a going concern on a slump sale basis in accordance with the business transfer agreement"".The proposed deal is subject to approval of members, lenders and the statutory or regulatory authorities.Bajaj Hindusthan has 14 sugar mills with a cane crushing capacity of 1.36 lakh tonnes per day and alcohol distillation capacity of 800 kilo litres per day.It has suffered a standalone net loss of Rs 137.71 crore during the second quarter of this fiscal because of high finance costs compared with a loss of Rs 282.72 crore a year ago.The decision to divest the power plants and pare debt comes at a time the sugar industry is impacted by a currency shortage.The Indian Sugar Mills Association has estimated a decline in prices as dispatches from the mills got affected on account of a fall in demand from bulk consumers, including sweet makers, after demonetisation.The industry body has lowered its estimate of sugar sales in the 2016-17 season at around 245-250 lakh tonnes against 255 lakh tonnes forecast previously, resulting in a closing stock of around 60 lakh tonnes, equivalent to three months of domestic consumption.The Bajaj group also has interests in ethanol, real estate, personal care products and infrastructure."

The production and transportation cost of sugarcane has also increased. But, the state government has fixed a lower purchase price, Rs 1,700, this year. It has not kept its words of announcing the FRP at Rs 2,300. In Uttar Pradesh, the government has fixed FRP of Rs 3,150 for 8.5 sugar recovery rate, the price is Rs 3,200 in Haryana, but the Karnataka government is dilly dallying to fix even Rs 3,000 for a higher recovery rate of 9.5, they said.The protestors insisted that they will not withdraw the demonstration until the minister personally lends a ear to their grievances and issues some concrete assurances. Sangha president Kurubur Shantakumar, Attahalli Devaraj, Bhagyaraj, Shankar, Mahadevaswamy, Puttabasappa, and Narayan were present.Saraswathipuram Police provided tight security around the ministers residence."

Presently, sugar price per quintal is Rs 4,000, and factory authorities have failed to provide the fixed price for their produce, he accused.He said that the government has failed to take any initiative even after several protests in front of the district minister's residence, deputy commissioner's office, and several letters to the government to fix the price at Rs 3,000 per quintal of sugarcane.At the Belagavi session, the sugar minister had announced additional support price Rs 300 for remunerative price of Rs 2,300 for farmers of Bagalkot, Vijayapura and Belagavi districts, but the minister failed to announce the support price for Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and Mandya farmers, he accused.Association secretary Athahalli Devaraj said that in Uttar Pradesh farmers are getting Rs 3,150 while the Haryana government is providing Rs 3,200 as state advice price (SAP). ""The paddy grown in Kabini catchment area has withered due to drought. There is no water in canals in Kollegal, Chamarajanagar, Yalandur taluks.

58fd3a327be9e06c93717815,No hike in sugarcane procurement price,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2016/dec/28/no-hike-in-sugarcane-procurement-price-1553740.html,2016-12-28,"CHENNAI: The State Government on Tuesday announced that the procurement price of sugar cane for the current crushing season (2016-17) would remain unchanged at Rs2,850 a tonne. The State has taken this stand despite the repeated demand by farmers to fix a higher price for sugarcane.The procurement price would include the fixed remunerative price (FRP) of Rs2,300 announced recently by the Centre, and the State Advisory Price (SAP) of Rs550 which includes Rs100 for transportation charges.However, the Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said that a panel, comprising of senior officials of the State, representatives of farmers and sugar mills, would be formed to suggest to the Government a sugarcane price which would be remunerative to farmers and facilitate an appropriate share in the profit netted by the sugar mills.This decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by OPS on Monday. In a statement here, OPS said the Central government had not hiked its FRP for sugarcane for the current crushing season. Further in neighbouring Karnataka, a majority of sugar mills were giving only Rs2,600 per tonne while many mills in Maharashtra were paying less - Rs2,475 a tonne.He also recalled that whenever the Centre hiked the sugarcane price, the State government fixed a higher State Advisory Price for sugarcane, keeping in mind the farmers welfare.To maximise the sugarcane production in the State, the Government is implementing various technologies such as sustainable sugarcane initiative, drip fertigation etc, Panneerselvam said, adding that he had directed officials to implement these measures fully.Meanwhile, in a statement here, the PMK founder S Ramadoss said the refusal to hike the sugarcane procurement price had betrayed the farmers in Tamil Nadu. While Uttar Pradesh government had fixed an SAP at Rs3,050, Haryana and Punjab too have announced a higher price for sugarcane. He said the Tamil Nadu should increase the SAP to Rs4,000 a tonne and to take immediate steps for payment of Rs1,659 crore dues from the sugar mills to farmers.Expressing shock, D Ravindran, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said the meagre procurement price had come at a time when farmers were expecting at least Rs4,000 a tonne. The members of the association would protest in front of sugar mills from January 3, demanding Rs4,000 a tonne as well as immediate disbursal of dues from the sugar mills, he added."
